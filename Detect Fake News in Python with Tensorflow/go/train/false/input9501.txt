9519,WATCH: NAVY VET Declines Award At New Orleans Saints Game Because Of Disrespectful Players Who Continue To Kneel During Anthem,"One courageous Navy vet has had enough of the disrespectful NFL players who kneel during the national anthem. Although it would be a great honor for the vet to receive an award, he put standing up for and defending our flag before being recognized for his service. Good for him A disabled Navy veteran said he declined to accept an award at a New Orleans Saints game due to the controversy over players protesting during the national anthem.The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem. Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players  disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,  Wells said.  I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it. Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells  decision.

9521,McCain ‘Associate’ Who Handled Trump Dossier Is Accused Of Dodging Subpoena In BuzzFeed Lawsuit,"Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate,  has been seemingly avoiding service  of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press. And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show  reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published. BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous  pee dossier  into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed. Read more: McClatchyIt also reveals that McCain was one of a just few people with whom the dossier s author, ex-British spy Christopher Steele, shared a copy of his final findings. So how did they get from there to publication in Buzzfeed?",0
9522,APOLOGY ISSUED After LA TIMES and NY TIMES Columnists Go After #SarahSanders: Mock Her Weight And Southern Accent,"Wow! What a couple of hypocrites and haters! We ve included contact info for the two male liberal columnists below so you can let them know how tacky and disgraceful they are for mocking Sarah Sanders.UPDATE: HORSEY ISSUED AN APOLOGY AFTER BACKLASH BUT HIS CARTOON IS STILL IN THE ARTICLE! I want to apologize to Times readers   and to Sarah Huckabee Sanders   for a description that was insensitive and failed to meet the standards of our newspaper. It also failed to meet the expectations I have for myself. It surely won t be my last mistake, but this particular error will be scrupulously avoided in my future commentaries. I ve removed the offending description.   David HorseySHE MUST BE GETTING UNDER THEIR SKIN:Two male, liberal columnists this week launched personal attacks against White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.DAVID HORSEY OF LA TIMES:Los Angeles Times columnist David Horsey mocked Sanders  appearance (he later deleted this part), saying she  looks more like a slightly chunky soccer mom who organizes snacks for the kids  games. Rather than the fake eyelashes and formal dresses she puts on for news briefings, Sanders seems as if she d be more comfortable in sweats and running shoes,  Horsey wrote on Wednesday.  Yet, even if Trump privately wishes he had a supermodel for a press secretary, he is lucky to have Sanders. He s also a cartoonist. This horrible cartoon of Sanders is with the article:  BIG MOTHER ???Please contact Horsey on twitter to let him know what a total jerk he is to mock a woman like this: David Horsey TwitterNY TIMES BASHES SANDERS TOO:Another columnist, the New York Times  Frank Bruni, similarly went out of his way on Friday to bash Sanders for her personal characteristics, in this case her way of speaking.Bruni wrote that Sanders is serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. To listen to her pronounce  priorities  is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb,  Bruni added parenthetically, mocking Sanders for her Southern accent.Bruni calls Sanders a phony:  She s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of places. Please contact Bruni on twitter: Frank Bruni TwitterNice try, but Sanders is as real as they come. THAT S what bothers these two so-called journalists who just did a hit piece on a woman for her looks and her Southern accent NOT for the job she s doing as press secretary. Is this all they ve got? Nice try boys, we re even bigger fans now of this imperfect (who is perfect?) but incredible woman who stepped in and is hitting a home run for the Trump team Go Sarah! You got this!VIA: DAILY CALLER ",0
9523,LEFTY COMMUNIST Calls Trump-Supporting High School Students ‘White Supremacists’. Hilarity Ensues! [VIDEO],"If you haven t discovered Austen Fletcher yet, please check him out on twitter and YouTube He goes in and opens up lefty brains with shocking facts He s awesome!Communist calls Trump supporting high school students 'white supremacists'. Hilarity ensues! #FleccasTalkshttps://t.co/M7VCVpmEUV pic.twitter.com/JHpygavsZw  Austen Fletcher (@fleccas) November 2, 2017The entire video is below:Students at Cal State Fullerton attempted to shut down Milo Yiannopoulis  right to free speech. They end up looking like idiots!Townhall covered the idiocy:Halloween Night at Cal State Fullerton, I got to engage the crowd of students who would be protesting free speech absolutist and conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. I didn t want to hear him. I wanted to meet the students, see the force of outrage against his presence on the campus, and start changing some minds.In the beginning, I noticed that some protesters were wearing masks. Law enforcement surrounded and arrested one of them. Later that night, another Antifa thug got taken down after pepper-spraying others. Perhaps it s time for local law enforcement to deputize the law-abiding citizens to arrest those who wear masks and menace peace-loving protesters.Like many others in the student quad, I came in my own custom: Arthur, i.e. Arthur Reed the cartoon anteater (or Aardvark). It works, don t you think? Other costumes included Hugh Hefner, a pirate wrapped in rainbow feather boas, and a snowflake liberal. The last one was a young man wearing bubble wrap all over his body. Funny stuff!As soon as I arrived at the square, reporters and student journalists rushed towards me. One guy asked me which was worse, feminism or cancer. I said  both . Other students wanted to know why I was there, including the mainstream media reporters. I want free speech restored and respected on college campuses, and I want to debunk the lies and mythologies about President Trump.Within minutes, a crazed black woman later identified as Keyanna Celina roared at me:  White Supremacist! Get out of here!  My friend Genevieve Peters tried to calm the situation. Instead, Celina swiped at her, then beat her around the head multiple times before someone in the crowd fired pepper spray to stop Celina.Right on cue, the anti-Milo, anti-free speech fascists started chanting  Fascists go home! Fascists go home!  Instead of running away, I stood right in front of their protest, turned the cameras on them and shouted with them:  Fascists go home!  Trick or treat!Full disclosure: I am no Milo fan. But so what? He has every right to speak at a college, and no one should prevent him! Besides, I was more interested in listening to students, to find out why they were protesting, to get their views on key issues, and to stump for President Trump. Some students accused me of starting fights. I soon realized they were merely trying to silence me. After deftly casting accusations aside, I began to realize why abject liberalism had taken hold on many of these young people. Obviously, they don t hear other points of view, and thus anyone with a difference of opinion is wrong. As I feared, most students are told what to think, not how to think. Another problem was the sloppy misuse of terms. One man claimed that 75% of the businesses in socialist dystopia Venezuela are privately owned. Uh   Nope! Why would he believe this? Because he didn t see the clear synonym between nationalization and socialization.",0

The entire video is so full of reports on  scandal after scandal but the one towards the end is most disturbing.

Tell us what you found. JOHN SOLOMON HAD THIS SHOCKING REVELATION:SOLOMON:  Yeah, there wasn t just one decision, we look at Uranium One and say we let them buy the mine and 20% of the ore that was being mined at that time under there control. But there was a series of decisions made by the Obama administration time and time again, between 2010 and 2012 that are incredibly favorable to Russia s ROSATOM, the state owned nuclear energy industry, time and again these decisions are being made while the FBI knowns that there criminality going on by that company s executives HANNITY:  The bribery, exhortation, money laundering, the racketeering, and so on. SOLOMON:  Yeah, Kickbacks. And theres a second thing that I m just starting to report on now. There we concerns in the Obama administration that where very specific concerns that Russia was engaged in a Uranium scheme that it was going to get enough control of uranium, dump it on the market, drive all the prices down  HANNITY:  Wow!SOLOMON:  And put all the other people out of business.

9526,MARK LEVIN: AL QAEDA and ISIS “Actively” Using Schumer’s Diversity Visa Program To “Put Sleepers In Our Country” [VIDEO],"Two nights ago, Mark Levin dropped a bombshell on his show about the Muslim terrorist who killed 9 people in Manhattan and injured dozens. The Diversity VISA immigration program that allowed the Muslim terrorist, and 23 people who were tied to his lottery draw from Uzbekistan to live in the United States, was given the brainchild of none other than New York s own Democrat senator, Chuck Schumer.Mark Levin; NYC muslim terrorist came to US under  Diversity VISA Program    a bizarre lottery to shove more foreigners down our throats  Deplorable MD   (@MDDeplorable) October 31, 2017Numbers USA breaks down Senator Chuck Schumer s Diversity Visa immigration program: The Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) began working directly with Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his staff to draft a diversity program that differed significantly from those considered up to that point. The Schumer proposal would have set aside 75,000 visas each year for a new category of  diversity immigrants. 112 Under this proposal, the world would be separated into  high-admission regions  and  low-admission regions,  within which would be  high-admission states  and  low-admission states.  High-admission states would be those from which at least 25,000 immigrants had come to the United States within the most recent five-year period. While no state would be allocated more than seven percent of available visas, the bulk of visas would go to low-admission states in low-admission regions, with a much smaller number allotted to low-admission states in high-admission regions. Any visas not used by the state to which they were allocated would go to the remaining eligible states.Last night, nationally syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin slammed the Diversity Immigrant Visa (green card lottery) program in an interview with Sean Hannity on FOX News Tuesday night. He said a lottery is no way to run an immigration system. Levin said a caller, a counter-intelligence veteran, told him al Qaeda and ISIS are  actively  using the program to install sleeper cells in the U.S It took effect in 1995,  Levin said of the bill.  People go online and they apply. They apply online. It s a lottery system. That is no way to run immigration system. I had a caller on my radio program tonight and he said, he used to work counterintelligence. Al Qaeda and ISIS have actively been working to use this program to put sleepers in our country. Levin said we have forgotten what the purpose of immigration is. Immigration is supposed to benefit the United States, not to ensure diversity from the foreigners coming into this country. Immigration is supposed to improve the United States it has nothing to do with improving other countries and so forth,  he said. This mass killer has claimed an association with ISIS, hasn t he? This diversity visa program should be gutted. We don t need a diversity visa program with 50,000 people a year come into this country through a lottery system, because we want diversity from different countries,  Levin declared.Levin said after 9/11, you would have thought people would take the issue of immigration more seriously. Immigration is about national security,  the broadcaster said.  Once people get into the country it becomes far more complicated. So you want to stop them at the border. And when the President of the United States said, as he did when he first came into office, we can t vet these people. Some of these governments are effective war with us and some of them don t exist. Some of them are involved in civil war. You know, we can t call Yemen and say, hey, can you check this guy out on your computer system? There is no computer system. There is no effective government. What the President is saying is  you can t bring people in from these countries until we figure out what s going on.   Real Clear Politics",0
9527,HAHA! WATCH DNC CHAIR PEREZ Try To Dodge Questions About Hillary Stealing Dem Primary From Sanders [Video],"Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez is a nasty man. He s gone out trashing President Trump with disgusting language. He s also made claims more recently that Trump didn t win because the Electoral College really isn t in the Constitution. For this reason, we have zero sympathy for Perez. He s as dirty as they come He tried to dodge an opportunity to address Donna Bazile s Thursday piece in Politico that touted  Hillary Clinton s secret takeover of the DNC. Perez appeared on CNBC today where, after focusing primarily on the GOP tax reform proposal, host Carl Quintinella asked the DNC chairman about Brazile s allegations Ouch! THE IMPLOSION OF THESE GRIFTERS IS FUN TO WATCH Brazile claimed in the piece that the DNC was put on a  starvation diet  and became dependent on Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign for survival.HAHA!  HAVE YOU READ THE PIECE? I can t let you go, Tom, since you re with us, without asking if you ve read Donna Brazile s piece about the DNC that s in Politico today. Any comment at all?  Quintinella asked.DID YOU NOTICE THE DODGE?  WELL HEY, WE RE MOVING FORWARD Well hey, we re moving forward; we re building, you know. I ve been asked that question a number of times since I started,  Perez started.The DNC chairman continued by talking about the Democrats  plans to create a transparent nomination process for 2020. And, one of my goals here as DNC Chair is to make sure that the nominating process for 2020 is a process that s totally fair and transparent for everybody,  Perez said.He continued to avoid addressing the Brazile allegations directly, instead focusing on what the DNC will do moving forward. We re going to set the primary debate schedule well in advance of when we know who the candidates will be there,  he said.  We have to make sure that everything is fair and open, and everybody has a fair shake. That s what we re going to do. ",0

9529,LIZ WARREN Admits To Jake Tapper 2016 Primary Election Was Rigged [Video],"Liz Warren flips She just told Jake Tapper in an interview that the Dem Primary was rigged. We all knew this it s pretty huge for her to say it DONNA BRAZILE ALSO SPILLED THE BEANS WITH HER NEW BOOK: After months of lying about passing debate questions to Hillary before the presidential debate that was hosted by her employer, CNN, the former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, finally came clean. During an interview with Trevor Noah of the Daily Show, Brazile arrogantly excused her dishonest behavior by telling Noah: Well, first of all, I didn t have my hands in the cookie jar. I m an operative, I m a strategist, and part of what my role was, in addition to being a  political pundit,  was to help advance the cause of justice and equality Today s a new day, however, and Donna Brazile has decided to emerge from the shadows to promote her new bombshell, tell-all book that is sure to ruffle a few feathers in the Democrat Party Her book is about the chaos at the DNC during the 2016 campaign. On Thursday, she revealed a section of it at Politico. What emerges from the excerpt is a picture of Brazile as a heroine (of course), Hillary Clinton as the villainess, Debbie Wasserman Schultz as incompetent and lazy, and Barack Obama as the unnamed cancer that ate away at the center of the party.Ouch.In Brazile s book, she claims that Obama cleaned out the Party. Brazile writes that by the time she took over, the Democratic Party was  broke and $2 million in debt.  According to Brazile, Obama  left the party $24 million in debt    hey, sort of like the country!   and his campaign wouldn t pay off that debt until election year. Furthermore, Wasserman Schultz had grown staff and allowed the DNC to pick up the check for Obama consultants.Brazile also claims that Hillary ran the Party. Hillary used that debt to pick up power   they pledged to fill in the funding gap for the DNC so long as they got to run operations. Gary Gensler, CFO of the Hillary campaign, apparently  described the party as fully under the control of Hillary s campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie camp. The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse. Hillary Essentially Laundered Campaign Money Through The DNC. Hillary raised an enormous amount of money for the DNC, but virtually all that money went to Hillary s campaign. Less than half of 1 percent of all money Hillary raised from her fundraisers went to the states. Brazile explains:When the Politico story described this arrangement as  essentially   money laundering  for the Clinton campaign, Hillary s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary.The party ran as an adjunct to the Hillary campaign long before the primaries, meaning that Bernie was at a severe disadvantage. Brazile admits as much:The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.For entire story: Daily Wire",0
9530,VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTAL LUNATICS Cost Taxpayers MILLIONS To Protect Trump’s EPA Director After Receiving “Unprecedented” Number of Credible Death Threats,"Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has received an unprecedented amount of death threats, requiring a 24-hour security detail, according to an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal.The paper revealed the EPA has received more than 70  credible threats against EPA staffers, with a disproportionate number menacing Administrator Scott Pruitt and his family,  since President Donald Trump took office.Credible threats from liberal opponents have resulted in the EPA s inspector general s office recommending 24/7 security detail for Pruitt, which is costing taxpayers $2 million per year. Mr. Pruitt has received more than five times as many threats as his predecessor, Gina McCarthy,  the editorial explained.  These include explicit death threats. Some have referenced Mr. Pruitt s home address. Federal law enforcement has determined that some of those threatening Mr. Pruitt are likely capable of carrying out acts of violence. Democratic lawmakers have complained that the security detail is a waste of money, claiming  there is no apparent security threat against the administrator to justify such a security detail or expenditures. EPA security has already caught suspects prowling around the Administrator s neighborhood,  the Journal reported.Liberals have justified the death threats. Last week, a San Francisco columnist argued death threats against Pruitt were justified because he is a  banally evil, milquetoast, science-denying government administrator.  The death threats  make a warped sort of sense,  wrote liberal columnist Mark Morford. Mr. Pruitt didn t invent these threats, and Cabinet members shouldn t have to fear violence as a price of public service,  the WSJ editorial board said.For entire story: WFB",0
9531,NAMES REVEALED Of TOP DONOR And Popular ACTRESS Behind Disgusting Leftist Latino TV Ad Depicting White Man Running Down Minority Kids With Truck,"When a disgusting ad appeared on TV showing a white man in a pick-up truck with a confederate flag in the back, and an Ed Gillespie for Governor bumper sticker on the gate, that was chasing down a group of minority kids in their neighborhood, Americans from every political party were disgusted. Many were asking who in the world was behind the Latino Victory Fund that sponsored the disgusting ad? Well, Washington Free Beacon did some digging, and as it turns out, the same person who funds violent riots, Antifa anti-free speech uprisings, or violent anti-Trump protests is also behind the funding of this horrible and divisive group whose co-founder is a well-known leftist actress. Liberal billionaire George Soros is a major funder of a Latino activist group that produced an ad in Virginia depicting a supporter of Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie running down minority children in a truck, which was pulled following the New York City terror attack that left eight people dead.The group was part of Soros-backed efforts against Trump and Republicans during the 2016 election cycle, and its leadership includes individuals who previously worked directly with Soros at his foundation.The Latino Victory Fund, a group that carries a mission of  growing Latino political power by increasing Latino representation at every level of government,  released the advertisement showing a man driving a pickup truck with a Gillespie campaign bumper sticker chasing minority children down streets and alleyways.  Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by  the American dream?'  the voiceover says in the ad.Crist bal J. Alex, the president of the Latino Victory, said the ad was produced to show how Gillespie has  eagerly embraced racism and xenophobia  during the campaign. The group pulled the ad following the terror attack in New York City on Tuesday and issued a non-apology when announcing the move. We knew our ad would ruffle feathers,  Alex said in a statement late Tuesday night.  We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they don t like what they see. We have decided to pull our ad at this time. Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia. Here s the disgusting ad:Latino Victory was co-founded by actress Eva Longoria and San Antonio-based businessman Henry R. Mu oz III, who has chaired the DNC s finance committee since 2013. Longoria and Mu oz previously operated the Futuro Fund, which raised $32 million for Barack Obama s reelection efforts.Soros is the top individual donor to the Latino Victory Fund this year and has given $150,000 to the group, Federal Election Commission filings show. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, also gave $150,000 to the Latino Victory Fund.Soros produced funding for a campaign last year that involved the group.Numerous immigration activist groups, including Latino Victory, the Center for Community Change, and America s Voice, launched  Families Fight Back  during the 2016 election cycle.The Washington Free Beacon recently obtained unredacted tax documents revealing donors for the Center for Community Change, which does not disclose their contributors. Soros gave millions in funding to the group. It also received funding from the likes of the Ford Foundation, which was first created by members of the Ford Motor Company, but is no longer connected to the company.Three others who work at Latino Victory came from the failed presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.

She just offended them in a big way and took more veiled swipes at President Trump to the delight of the audience at the first Obama Foundation summit at the Marriott Marquis in Chicago.The Obamas headlined the first Obama Foundation international summit in Chicago where the turnout barely filled the venue halfway This is great news!Former First Lady Michelle Obama said men feel they are entitled and women protect them too much.She told the first Obama Foundation international summit men are raised to be babies while women are brought up to be strong. It s like the problem in the world today is we love our boys, and we raise our girls,  Obama said. We raise them to be strong, and sometimes we take care not to hurt men   and I think we pay for that a little bit.At the 28:50 point she takes a veiled swipe at President Trump She clearly relishes in bashing Trump in a very arrogant way.At the 44:40 point she complains about how horrible it was to live in the White House Gimme  a break!At the 47:20 point she discusses how she feels men are babied She s the definition of bitter Are we protecting our men too much so they feel a little entitled and self-righteous sometimes? But, that s kind of on us too as women and mothers, as we nurture men and push girls to be perfect. The former First Lady told men  y all should get you some friends  to develop a support network in the same way women do. Talk to each other, because that s the other thing [women] do   we straighten each other out on some things, our girlfriends,  she said. It s powerful to have strong men, but what does that strength mean? You know, does it mean respect? Does it mean responsibility? Does it mean compassion?

9533,FAMILY FEUD? Why President Trump Is Reportedly Blaming Jared Kushner For Mueller Indictments,"Is the last man standing in the West Wing about to be packing his bags? According to insiders, who refer to Trump s favored son-in-law Jared Kushner as  the worst political adviser in the White House in modern history,  President Trump is fed up with his daughter Ivanka s husband and  trusted  political advisor With the exception of Sebastian Gorka, who left the West Wing in August, here s a quick look at who s left the White House since Trump s inauguration. Somehow, Jared Kushner has managed to stay put:Breitbart   Donald Trump reportedly blames his son-in-law, White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner, for his role in the decision to appoint special counsel Robert Mueller, according to Vanity Fair s Gabriel Sherman.On a phone call Tuesday with Breitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon,  Trump blamed Jared Kushner for his role in decisions, specifically the firings of [former National Security Adviser] Mike Flynn and [former FBI Director] James Comey, that led to Mueller s appointment,  according to a source who was briefed on the call.On Monday, Mueller indicted Trump s former campaign chair Paul Manafort on 12 counts   ranging from making false statements to  conspiracy against the United States    as part of the ongoing, so-called  Russia Investigation.  Richard Gates, Manafort s deputy, was also charged.The New York Times reported that Kushner, along with his wife Ivanka Trump, also pushed Trump to hire Manafort, who was needed to fill the spot of Trump s initial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, after Ivanka reportedly gave her father an ultimatum to fire him.While Mueller s charges bear no immediate connection to Trump or his campaign, Sherman reports that everyone in the West Wing  is freaking out,  with advisers  on edge,   doing whatever they can not to be ensnared. One person close to Dina Powell and Gary Cohn said they re making sure to leave rooms if the subject of Russia comes up. Regarding Kushner, though, there is particular concern. Here s what Manafort s indictment tells me,  says former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg,  Mueller is going to go over every financial dealing of Jared Kushner and the Trump Organization.   Trump is at 33 percent in Gallup. You can t go any lower. He s f*cked,  he adds.Kushner s finances are already under scrutiny. Breitbart News  Adam Shaw reports:Kushner Companies has reportedly become a topic of interest for Mueller as he investigates alleged Russian interference, and the company was subpoenaed for its use of an immigration-for-investment scheme and for promoting the scheme to Chinese investors.Just this week, Maryland s attorney general announced an investigation into Kushner s family business  over allegations of abusive debt collection and disgusting living conditions at several properties,  reports Shaw.Kushner, who was tasked with a massive portfolio by Trump that includes solving America s opioid crisis, tackling criminal justice reform, and bringing peace to the Middle East   despite having no experience in any of these areas and achieving virtually no accomplishments in his time in the West Wing   is now reportedly shrinking his role, along with Ivanka, following their repeated terrible advice to the president and  periodic confusion and resentment  caused by their presence. Jared is the worst political adviser in the White House in modern history,  Nunberg tells Sherman.  I m only saying publicly what everyone says behind the scenes at Fox News, in conservative media, and the Senate and Congress. ",0

9535,HILLARY LIES THROUGH HER TEETH: Defends Paying for Fake Trump Dossier During Campaign [video],"Hillary Clinton told Trevor Noah on the Daily Show that  of course  there is a difference between paying for that information and colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 election WHAT A LOAD OF BS! She s trying to say that it s a forgone conclusion that Trump colluded with Russia. Clinton said the dossier was simply  opposition research  and pointed to the fact that it was not public knowledge during the election MORE BS! THE DOSSIER WAS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE DURING THE ELECTION: The NYT even states that,  The document, a dossier prepared by a former British intelligence officer hired by Mr. Trump s political opponents, had been circulating among high-ranking politicians and some journalists since last fall. Mother Jones, a left-leaning publication, published an article in late October about the existence of the information. Newsweek also  published some of the allegations.It s what she doesn t say that s more important Tonight at 11/10c, Trevor and Hillary Clinton discuss the Steele dossier and Trump's ties to Russia. pic.twitter.com/dxJoAPTj8D  The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) November 1, 2017What she didn t talk about is the fact that this dossier is totally fabricated and was never confirmed to be true but they shopped it around to the media anyway! She funneled millions into the payment for this dossier instead of using it for  legal services . She faces an investigation from the Federal elections commission for misusing funds.Clinton said:  It was research that started by a Republican donor during the primary, and then when Trump got the nomination for the Republican Party, the people doing it came to my campaign lawyer and said,  would you like us to continue it? He said yes. He s an experienced lawyer, he knows what the law is, he knows what opposition research is.DIRTY DOSSIER:The dossier circulated in Washington last year and was turned over to the FBI for its review. It contends that Russia was engaged in a long-standing effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about the Republican.Among its wild claims was that Russian officials have videos of the president cavorting with prostitutes, filmed during Trump s 2013 visit to a luxury Moscow hotel for the Miss Universe contest It also contains a highly unusual and unsubstantiated report that the call girls performed a  golden shower  routine that involved them urinating on a hotel bed as a sign of disgust for then-president Barack Obama.It is claimed that Barack Obama s campaign organization, Obama For America, paid Perkins Coie almost $1million to fund the research. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the disgraced former DNC chair, has also denied any knowledge of how the dossier was put together.Read more: Daily Mail",0
9536,"JUST IN: Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile Accuses Hillary of CHEATING To Win Election, Laundering Money Through DNC…Drops Major BOMBSHELL About “CANCER” Barack Obama","After months of lying about passing debate questions to Hillary before the presidential debate that was hosted by her employer, CNN, the former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, finally came clean. During an interview with Trevor Noah of the Daily Show, Brazile arrogantly excused her dishonest behavior by telling Noah: Well, first of all, I didn t have my hands in the cookie jar. I m an operative, I m a strategist, and part of what my role was, in addition to being a  political pundit,  was to help advance the cause of justice and equality Today s a new day, however, and Donna Brazile has decided to emerge from the shadows to promote her new bombshell, tell-all book that is sure to ruffle a few feathers in the Democrat Party Her book is about the chaos at the DNC during the 2016 campaign. On Thursday, she revealed a section of it at Politico. What emerges from the excerpt is a picture of Brazile as a heroine (of course), Hillary Clinton as the villainess, Debbie Wasserman Schultz as incompetent and lazy, and Barack Obama as the unnamed cancer that ate away at the center of the party.Ouch.In Brazile s book, she claims that Obama cleaned out the Party. Brazile writes that by the time she took over, the Democratic Party was  broke and $2 million in debt.  According to Brazile, Obama  left the party $24 million in debt    hey, sort of like the country!   and his campaign wouldn t pay off that debt until election year. Furthermore, Wasserman Schultz had grown staff and allowed the DNC to pick up the check for Obama consultants.Brazile also claims that Hillary ran the Party. Hillary used that debt to pick up power   they pledged to fill in the funding gap for the DNC so long as they got to run operations. Gary Gensler, CFO of the Hillary campaign, apparently  described the party as fully under the control of Hillary s campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie camp. The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse. Hillary Essentially Laundered Campaign Money Through The DNC. Hillary raised an enormous amount of money for the DNC, but virtually all that money went to Hillary s campaign. Less than half of 1 percent of all money Hillary raised from her fundraisers went to the states. Brazile explains:When the Politico story described this arrangement as  essentially   money laundering  for the Clinton campaign, Hillary s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary.The party ran as an adjunct to the Hillary campaign long before the primaries, meaning that Bernie was at a severe disadvantage. Brazile admits as much:The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.For entire story: Daily Wire ",0
9537,FORMER NPR CEO DITCHES AND SWITCHES: How A Liberal Learned to Love the ‘Right’ [Video],"The former NPR CEO Ken Stern ditches and switches after getting out of the Liberal Bubble He recently spoke with Tucker Carlson about his escape from the  liberal bubble . We give him huge credit for ditching the left to come over to the RIGHT side:STERN RECENTLY SPOKE WITH BREITBART S ALEX MARLOW:Stern described himself as a  lifelong Democrat  who  spent time in Democratic politics, ran NPR,  and  lived in a 93 percent Democratic ward in a 100 percent Democratic household.  Concern for the increasing political polarization of the country led him on a journey into red-state America to take a clear look at the other side of the political divide.He said his  a-ha!  moment was the latest version of a pledge recited annually by children at a block party in his D.C. neighborhood:  All are welcome here on Hobart Street, man or woman, gay or straight, white or black   everyone but Republicans. It was a joke, but it wasn t a joke,  he said.  It really signified, I think, how people are starting to feel about side. For me it said, you know what, something s got to change, at least for me. I live in a Democratic bubble. I need to get out there and meet the other half of America and see if they are  deplorables,  or if they are Americans like me. That s really what this year is about. Stern said NPR is  different from other media organizations  because its staff lives across the entire country, rather than being concentrated in a few media and political hubs. The New York Times, based in New York, 90 percent of their staff will be in New York. NPR is actually a membership organization with stations across the country. So it is actually unusual in the sense that it does have representation across the country,  he explained. I think the challenge, and I sort of challenged this week in the New York Post, is that even though they are geographically distributed, they   like most mainstream journalist organizations   draw from a pool of largely liberal people,  he continued.  When that happens you risk groupthink, you risk thinking about what stories are important that really don t represent the rest of the country as a whole. Stern contended that  bubbling  has become a bipartisan phenomenon,  because we are so politically vulcanized   Democrats hang out with Democrats, Republicans hang out with Republicans   it is easy to engage in the most vicious stick-figure cartoonish depiction of the other side. The Washington Post did a poll last year, I think, where they asked Democrats,  give me one word to describe Republicans,  and they did the same for Republicans. The words that came out from both sides were ridiculous. I mean, if you re a Republican you re a  bigot,  if you re a Democrat you re a  traitor.  I forget the exact words, but all of the words that came out were really cartoons of the other side,  he recalled. I think when Hillary Clinton said that she thought half the people that supported Trump were from the  basket of deplorables,  and then apologized for it, I think it does reflect how many people think about conservatives,  he said.  Truthfully, I think it goes both ways. That s a shame because we don t know the other side. Stern s journey to the flip side of politics took him  pig hunting in Texas  and  going to small Assembly of God churches  to meet people with different viewpoints. It meant hanging out in Pikeville, Kentucky, sort of a declining coal mining community. It meant going to Youngstown, Ohio. It meant tons of things,  he said.  The subtitle of the book is  How I Left the Liberal Bubble and Learned to Love the Right.  It didn t mean that I agreed with everyone I met, but it meant I met hundreds of people who I admired, and were doing great things in their community, and who in no way reflected the cartoon figure of what Middle America looks like. Stern said he took issues he was positive he was right about   including  climate change, poverty programs, and guns    and challenged himself by talking with people like gun-control skeptic John Lott. Jr. I went hunting. I went to gun shows. I talked to experts. I did my own research. And I really came away with a very different perspective, because I tried to look at it from other people s points of view. When you do that, you re going to change,  he said.He recalled pig hunting in George as an especially memorable experience for someone from an urban gun-control political environment, as he was tutored in gun safety by an eight-year-old, and found himself hunting with a diverse group that bore little resemblance to coastal caricatures of rural white men. I m an agnostic Jew from Washington, DC. I don t have a lot of experiences with evangelicals, so what I knew was from  Footloose  and from Jerry Falwell, who had been dead for ten years by the time I did this,  Stern said of his foray into church life, culminating in a visit to the Urbana Conference with some 15,000 evangelical youths. I thought they would be like you see in the movies. But these kids were there, they were talking about refugees   how to help them, not how to turn them away. They were talking about diversity on campus. They were talking about how to dedicate their lives to feeding the poor and housing the homeless. It was a really admirable group of people I saw. It taught me that, look, there are 50 million evangelicals, which means there are 50 million stories. You just can t bucket everyone in simple ways,  he said.Stern said that media people tend to  cluster in groups and reinforce their own stereotypes, their own confirmation bias, their own groupthink. That s a challenge that s really hard to acknowledge, but hard to deal with. And that s, I think, a fundamental challenge for the CNNs and others of the world,  he said.  But I think in the age of Trump they ve also found, if we can be direct about it, conflict is good for business. President Trump   it s actually sort of a self-reinforcing circle   challenges the  failing New York Times  and the New York Times responds, and it s great for business for both of them. And that s a problem. ",0
9538,Dem Lawmaker’s Epic Fake Panic Attack Over A Speeding Ticket Will Make Your Day [Video],"Thank goodness a police camera captured a Democratic county lawmaker bizarrely screaming, begging, invoking for special privileges, saying she s broke, claiming to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panting like she s about to keel over while she received a routine speeding ticket for driving 13 miles per hour over the posted speed limit. The legislator in the disturbing dash-cam video is Jennifer Schwartz Berky, a member of the Ulster County Legislature in Ulster County, New York.Becky obviously doesn t think the rules apply to her The incident occurred back in May. The video is coming out now   just in time for local elections   in response to a Freedom of Information Law request (and in spite of appeals by Berky s lawyer to suppress it).You owe it to yourself to watch this woman s epic freakout. There s groaning and whimpering. There are excuses galore.Mere words cannot do any sort of justice to the groaning, the whimpering, the excuse-making, the lamentation and the gnashing of teeth over a speeding ticket for going 43 miles per hour in a zone where the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour.The New York Post has published an even shorter version   sort of a CliffsNotes summary   of Berky s amazing encounter with local police.Berky   who claims in the video that she suffers from PTSD   has an undergraduate degree in art history and a graduate degree in urban planning from Columbia University, according to a lengthy biography at the website of Ulster County s local government.She was  born and raised in New York City  but  has lived for several years abroad during her career and studies, and is fluent in Spanish, French and Italian. She lists three party affiliations in her bio.

9539,PAM GELLER Rips Into Geraldo for Insults About Her Fight Against Terrorism [Video],"Pam Geller is not the person you d ever want to go up against in a debate but cocky Geraldo Rivera tried it You guessed right if you guessed she at his lunch! She s one tough cookie!Pamela Geller: He hates me more than the terrorists so I can t take much of what he says seriously.Fox is imploding right now. Pam Geller is attacking Geraldo Rivera for saying he needs to take a shower after she appears on the network.   pic.twitter.com/tYTvvSX5z8  Thomas Bishop (@bishopk0s) November 2, 2017Remember that Geraldo insulted Geller when she was almost killed by two jihadists in Texas Geller has long been a target of radical Islamists. Her life has been threatened but she keeps up the fight:Pam Geller has been spot on when speaking about the truth of jihadists. She spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how she feels Hollywood is  in the pocket  of jihadis. Very interesting read and lots to learn from this very brave lady:Pamela Geller has been on a rampage against radical Islam for years, beginning notably in 2010 by spearheading of the opposition to what she called the  Ground Zero Mega Mosque  near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. Her most recent controversy was the organization of a  Draw the Prophet Muhammad  contest in Texas.At the event, two self-described jihadists shot a security guard before police killed them. Then, on June 2, police killed a knife-wielding Muslim man in Boston whose goal was allegedly to behead Geller in retaliation for the contest. Even though the contest was a major news story, few media outlets published the winning cartoon. Geller s group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, put the image on billboards, 100 of which debuted in St. Louis on Monday with the tagline  Support Free Speech.  She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how the (largely hostile) media is portraying these events.Why are you being overly provocative, purposely insulting Muslims?I am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting Muslims. Islamic jihadists, not I, made Muhammad cartoons the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them. If we don t stand against them on that point, the only alternative is surrender and submission. I did not make the cartoons a flash point, the jihadis did.But if you just don t insult their prophet, they ll leave you alone, no?No. The death penalty for insulting Muhammad is just one aspect of Sharia. There is much, much more of infidel behavior that violates Sharia. If we refrain from drawing Muhammad, more demands to adhere to other aspects of Sharia will follow. Millions are suffering or have been slaughtered under Islamic Sharia law in Muslim countries. Islamic supremacists mean to impose it in the West.There is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment.  Hate speech  is a subjective judgment. If it were outlawed, the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate.  If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. Cartoons have been used as satire since the beginning of satire   especially in our country   and no one gets a pass. Not the Pope of Rome, president of the United States or Hollywood s biggest movie stars.  If you don t like it, don t look at it, boycott the network that airs it, don t buy the publication, make counter-images, make a million, fine, but you have to adjust to us, not we to you, and if that s too much, don t come here. Threaten violence? Commit violence? The consequences are yours to bear.It seems many media pundits who claim allegiance to the First Amendment aren t persuaded by your arguments.They are afraid of being killed by Islamic jihadists and camouflage their fear and cowardice as  respect  for Islam and Muslims.Are there any TV hosts who have been particularly hostile to you during interviews?Yes. Martha MacCallum, Erin Burnett, Alisyn Camerota, Chris Cuomo   although he let me speak and make my case.How about behind your back?Yes. Bill O Reilly and Laura Ingraham. They said I was insulting the entire religion, one held by our moderate allies such as Egypt and Qatar. They are wrong in assuming that we must submit to Sharia to placate moderates, rather than that moderates need to accept the freedom of speech. Roman Catholics don t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religions, but Roman Catholics don t kill when their religion is mocked   and so no one talks about  provoking  them or  respecting  them. In any pluralistic society, we have to put up with being offended and even with our core beliefs being mocked. Roman Catholics have learned that. Mormons and others have learned that   look at The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Why must we condescend to Muslims and think they cannot learn that? It s the low expectation of soft bigotry.So this isn t entirely a partisan issue where conservatives stand by you and liberals don t?No. Chris Hayes stuck up for me on MSNBC. This is not a left/right split, it is a free person/slave split.Did any TV host say something that struck you as particularly wrongheaded?They all say I have the right to draw Muhammad but shouldn t out of respect. They don t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadists as a victory and embolden them to make more demands. CNN s Erin Burnett said I relished being the target of a beheading. It s madness. Who self-promotes to get killed?So you re not purposely courting danger, as Burnett and others have insinuated?Of course not. I love life. But I will not live as a slave.Are there any TV hosts you d like to face off with but who won t have you on?Bill O Reilly. I expect he knows he would be shown up.We know about the man arrested who intended to behead you. Any other threats you can share?I have received many threats. The FBI and NYPD are aware of them and on the case.Anyone in Hollywood reach out to you to offer support?No.Should Hollywood care about threats against you?They may think they re exempt, but they aren t. Islamic supremacists will be demanding they adhere to Sharia as well. Of course, most producers already are careful not to show anything that might offend Muslims, including accurate representations of jihad plotting and activity, so Hollywood is mostly already in their pocket. But this is their issue, and the entertainment industry should be on the front lines in the information battle space. The jihadists aren t just coming for me, they are coming for all of us that believe in freedom.So why do you think Hollywood, which routinely claims to push the envelope in its art, hasn t supported you?They re afraid of being ostracized.Your  Draw Muhammad  event certainly got a lot of news coverage. Should mainstream media outlets have published the winning cartoon?Every media outlet should publish the Muhammad cartoons. They can t kill us all. By kowtowing to violent intimidation, they are inviting more of it. Instead, they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech. If the media had published the Danish cartoons back in 2005, this would never have become an issue. The submission by media, entertainment and academic elites empowered the savages.The Southern Poverty Law Center included you on their list of  hate groups.  Are they right?Of course not. They re the hate group, using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don t share their hard-left agenda. The SPLC smear machine does not profile jihad groups, but they target and libel patriots, veterans, Tea Party organizations and other groups that work in defense of freedom. They named [Republican presidential contender] Ben Carson as a hate group. That should tell you everything you need to know about them. Their [sympathizers] have violently attacked family groups, and one tried to assassinate Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. And a few months back an SPLC [sympathizer] killed three Muslims in a parking dispute in North Carolina.Email: Paul.Bond@THR.com",0

During his brief press conference, Trump confirmed that he is already working to eliminate the State Department s Diversity Visa program that brought the NYC terrorist to America and ironically, was the brainchild of Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY). He s also not shy about saying he d be willing to send the NYC terrorist to GITMO. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would consider sending Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbek national who plowed a rented truck through a bike lane full of cyclists and pedestrians on Tuesday, to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  I would certainly consider that, yes. I would certainly consider that. Send him to Gitmo,  Trump said.Separately, Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain, a Republican who has tangled with the president on taxes and Obamacare, said Saipov should be considered an  enemy combatant  and denied Miranda rights by police.The president also declared that he is already moving to terminate the State Department s diversity-oriented visa lottery program, which granted Saipov entry into the United States in 2010. I am today starting the process of terminating the diversity lottery program. I m going to ask Congress to immediately initiate or get rid of this program,  he said.Watch:Trump called Saipov  an animal  during remarks before a cabinet meeting at the White House. He came in through the diversity program as you know, and we re going to stop it,  the president vowed.On Capitol Hill, McCain said in a statement that Americans should recognize terror attacks as  acts of war. As such, the New York terror suspect should be held and interrogated   thoroughly, responsibly, and humanely  as an enemy combatant consistent with the Law of Armed Conflict,  McCain added. He should not be read Miranda Rights, as enemy combatants are not entitled to them. As soon as possible, the administration should notify Congress how it plans to proceed with the interrogation and trial of this suspect.   Daily Mail ",0

9544,MUSLIM ATHLETE Given “Hero’s Welcome” INDICTED For Sexual Abuse Of 12-Yr Old Girl After Senator Schumer Helped Him Get Around U.S. Visa Denial,"The media CHEERED when Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) helped a 24-yr old Muslim man enter the U.S. after he was denied entry The media was strangely SILENT, however, after he molested a 12-yr-old upstate NY girl while she was with her family at an event celebrating the Muslim athlete. Yesterday, it was discovered that the Islamic extremist who killed 9 people and injured dozens of others, when he rammed his truck into them on a busy bike path in New York City, entered our country on a  Diversity visa  that was the brainchild of none other than the Democrat Senator from NY, Chuck (I always put diversity before our nation s security) Schumer An Indian athlete who overcame a visa denial with the help of U.S. lawmakers and a local mayor to attend the World Snowshoe Championship in New York has been arrested on charges of the abuse of a minor.It was a long journey for Indian snowshoe champion Hussain and his coach to the World Snowshoe Championships in Saranac Lake, New York last weekend.The pair were initially denied visas to travel to the U.S. in the chaotic days following the Trump administration s travel ban, but with the help of Saranac s mayor and   according to Mir   the office of Democratic Sen. Chuck Schemer, the American Embassy in New Delhi reversed their decision Feb. 17 and allowed them to travel to the competition.Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, an outspoken opponent of President Trump s attempts to more carefully vet refugees and visa holder s coming into the United States, bragged about getting around Trump s temporary travel restrictions on his Facebook page:Hussain hails from the Indian side of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is predominantly Muslim. Although India is not one of the seven countries that were part of the initial travel ban, Hussain and Khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the United States was turned down in late January, the first business day after Trump s travel ban was put in place.Khan told the BBC that an employee at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi told them they were being rejected because of  current policy. U.S. officials said at the time that the denial was not connected to the travel ban. An embassy spokesman said they were preparing a statement for release later in the day.  National PostThe reckless and irresponsible acts of Democrat legislators like Senator Chuck Schumer, perfectly illustrates why Trump was right about demanding that we put additional vetting measures in place for immigrants. Hussain and team manager Abid Khan arrived Feb. 23 in the bucolic Adirondacks town, which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero s welcome. Locals offered congratulations and free lodgings at an inn that in the snow looked like a  fairy tale scene from a movie,  Khan said in a Facebook post.The  fairy tale  was shattered Wednesday, when Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment, police said.The parents of the 12-year-old girl allegedly involved said the incident happened Monday, after the end of the three-day snowshoe competition, and reported it to local authorities.Chief Charles A. Potthast Jr. of the Saranac Lake Village police force said the girl was playing pool Monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where Hussain was staying. There was a moment when the two were alone, and that s when the incident occurred,  Potthast said. The girl told police there was a  passionate kiss  and that Hussain touched her in an intimate area on top of her clothing.Hussain remains jailed on $10,000 bond. Khan said the athlete told him he had done nothing wrong.A spokesman for Schumer said the senator helped with the visa process at the request of Saranac Lake and described the charges against Hussain as  extremely troubling. A spokesman for Gillibrand said the senator thinks the charges are  extremely serious. During their time in Saranac Lake, Hussein and his coach were honored with a special reception by the mayor and gave a talk about Kashmir at Saranac Lake Middle School, where students had waged a letter-writing campaign on their behalf.  Pack your bags. Next year you are coming to Kashmir,  Hussain told them, according to one of Khan s Facebook posts. Washington PostThe athlete s coach said he is innocent. Mir had said that the visa would not have been issued without the  personal efforts  of Schumer and New York s other Democratic senator, Kirsten Gillibrand. On Saturday, Schumer celebrated Hussain s  rock star  welcome in a Facebook post, saying that the United States is  still a country that welcome athletes from across the globe to compete in our stadiums, our snow-covered fields and everywhere in between.

9545,WATCH: How The Crooked Clinton Foundation HID Over $145 Million In Donations From URANIUM ONE Shareholders,"While the mainstream media was salivating over the indictment of Paul Manafort by dirty cop Robert Mueller, for crimes he allegedly committed years before he worked on Trump s campaign, a bombshell was being dropped by the author of  Clinton Cash , Peter Schweitzer about Hillary Clinton and how her dirty dealings while acting as Obama s Secretary of State have compromised our national security.Watch:Hillary's Clinton Foundation took in 145 MILLION frm 9 different Share holders frm Russian Uranium Co. and did NOT report it. Podesta  pic.twitter.com/rsp09SPylt   STOCK MONSTER  (@StockMonsterUSA) October 19, 2017The National Review recently published a great article explaining how the Clinton crime family laundered money through their crooked foundation while putting our national security at risk: The FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States,  The Hill s John Solomon and Alison Spann report. They add that an eyewitness, with corroborating documents, indicates that, starting in 2009,  Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow. Even after this skullduggery was discovered, the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States   on which Hillary sat   decided that Rosatom, the Russian government s atomic-energy company, could capture 20 percent of America s uranium supply, by purchasing a mining company called Uranium One. Rosatom announced its acquisition plans on June 8, 2010. While Hillary weighed this deal, Bill scored $500,000 for his address that June 29 to Renaissance Capital, a Kremlin-tied bank that endorsed Rosatom s move. Before, during, and after CFIUS s deliberations, nine Uranium One investors gave the Clinton Foundation some $145 million. Ultimately, CFIUS approved the Kremlin s transaction, on October 23, 2010.Even worse, despite lacking an export license, Uranium One reportedly shipped uranium out of America. Destination: Unknown. Remember: Uranium is a main ingredient in atomic bombs. Why would the Obama-Clinton administration let Russia have even a firecracker s worth of American uranium? This is the $145 million question.  I was unaware of this criminal probe concerning bribery,  says Peter Schweizer, who first uncovered Uranium One in Clinton Cash, his best-seller on America s most powerful crime family.For entire story: National Review ",0
9546,LAWYER FOR FBI INFORMANT Knows of Russian Bribery and Info ‘That Involves the Clintons’ [Video],"DC lawyer Victoria Toensing is one smart cookie. She s representing a former FBI informant who has evidence on kickbacks and bribery involving the transportation of uranium in the US. She recently told Sean Hannity her client will brief Congress about Russian involvement in the U.S. uranium market. This includes widespread bribery and actions that involved the Clintons I m not going into detail,  attorney Victoria Toensing said on the Oct. 24 Hannity.  You know that, Sean. But the informant will give an overview and specific conversations that he had with Russians in what they were thinking about the money that they were spending. I mean, let me just be that general and it involves the Clintons. The director of the FBI at that time was Robert Mueller, and he is now the special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign. The undercover investigation involving Toensing s client occurred between 2009 and 2014, and the senior attorney on the case was Rod Rosenstein, who is now the deputy attorney general of the United States and the official who appointed Mueller as special counsel.Further, all this information indicates that many senior Obama administration officials knew about instances of bribery and money laundering involving at least one Russian official, at a time when Russia wanted to expand its uranium market in the United States, and when the administration through a special committee had to approve or deny the sale of a company, Vancouver-based Uranium One, to Rosatom. (Rosatom is the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.)Some of the people on that Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napalitano, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.The committee approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom in October 2010. That sale gave Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, control over 20% of U.S. uranium production. (At least nine investors in Uranium One   prior to, during, and after that sale   donated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.) So, Mueller, [Rod] Rosenstein, maybe even [James] Comey at the time, and the president of the United States   certainly Eric Holder was the head of the DOJ   they all knew that they had all this evidence that the Russians had infiltrated with the purpose of a criminal enterprise to corner the market on uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons?  asked Hannity.Toensing said,  That is correct.

9548,WOW! POPULAR IMAM WARNED NYC Mayor DeBlasio Of Terror Threats: “De Blasio spent all his energy and resources in trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists”,"Imam Tawhidi is an outspoken voice in the Muslim community, who is unafraid to openly condemn Islamic extremists. After the terror attack today on the streets of New York City by a radical Muslim who was allegedly here on a  diversity visa , Imam Tawidi took off the gloves on Twitter and told the world that he warned Mayor DeBlasio, but was  Ignored! Tawhidi regularly tweets about the evils of extreme Islam:Extremists cannot force us into their paradise. In fact, I don t want to be in paradise if they re going to be there as well.  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017The Australian Imam is young, well presented and articulate. He is charming, has successfully utilized social media and has a strong following amongst the Australian public. Perhaps most importantly to a government that yearns for unity amongst its electorate, Tawhidi is an immigrant who champions the integration of fellow expats into the Australian community. The complete package, as it were.He isn t shy about calling out Islamic extremists and the people who suffer under Islamic extremist rule. Yesterday, Imam Tawhidi tweeted about his friend who was beaten to death by the Basij Militia of Iran over his anti-terrorist views:My friend Ali Yazdanshenas has passed away yesterday after being beaten to death by the Basij militia of Iran for his anti-terrorist views. pic.twitter.com/E04FJFcPyX  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 30, 2017However, there is a barrier preventing Australian elites from supporting this maverick cleric, and that is that he does not follow the liberal narrative. Instead of simply condemning obscene teachings associated with his religion, Tawhidi demands modification. Rather than apologize for shortcomings within the immigrant community, the Imam has called for immediate action, encouraging a ban on Islamic schools and Islamist organizations like Hizb ut Tahrir. Through this, Tawhidi has even received the endorsement of none other than Ayaan Hirsi Ali   perhaps the most famous anti-Islamist (and Islamic) activist in the world   who has suggested that Tawhidi should be  elevated  to sit amongst and give counsel to politicians and leaders.Tawhidi is, therefore, one of those rare public figures: a reformer who not only denounces elements of Islam but actually seeks to restructure its teachings and interpretations. However, in the current global environment, the courage to promote such ideas inevitably leads to danger; the threat of violence is so present that Tawhidi has been forced to implement constant security measures in both his professional and private life.  The Spectator One might believe that a courageous person like Imam Tawhidi would be a valuable ally to America in their efforts to defeat radical Islam in the United States.  Based on the Imam s tweets, following the terror attack by a  diversity visa  holder in NYC, it appears that Mayor DeBlasio didn t find his warnings to be useful.Imam Tawhidi claims he personally sent letters to Mayor DeBlasio, and that he  did nothing. About #NYC terrorist attack, I personally sent letters to Mayor De Blasio online & in person about terrorist breeding in NYC.He did nothing.  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Tawidi then tweeted that after warning DeBlasio about  hot radical centers  in NYC, he was  Ignored! In 2016, I told Mayor De Blasio that I was in NYC and noticed some hot radical centres. I was willing to point out serious cases. Ignored!  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Imam Tawhidi explained that he s not some crackpot Imam trying to get attention, he actually holds a certificate in counter-terrorism.Not only am I a Muslim Imam who understands the threat of Islamic Extremism, I also hold a certificate in counter-terrorism. Now what!?  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Tawhidi really blasted DeBlasio and all of the wasted energy he expends on trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists.Fact: In the last two years, De Blasio spent all his energy and resources in trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Imam Tawhidi went on to slam the Mayor DeBlasio of NYC and Mayor Sadiq Kahn of London who offered NYC his condolences after the terror attack:London stands in grief and solidarity with the great city of New York tonight. pic.twitter.com/ojrxSDnZos  Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) October 31, 2017Here is Tawhidi s reply:De Blasio griefs about London and you grief about NYC. How about you both swap positions since you don t really care about your own people!? https://t.co/0yqTprAbdw  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Spectator   It was during this overseas study, in 2014, that Tawhidi saw it as his duty to speak out against the questionable elements enshrined in his religion. On a sunny day in the Iraqi city of Karbala, Tawhidi was standing outside a mosque when, within earshot, a bomb exploded. As crowds ran from the scene and emergency crews rushed to help the survivors, the speakers of the mosque announced to the street below that Islamic State forces had invaded Mosul. If ever there was a time to speak out against Islamist terrorism, it was then.However, Tawhidi s campaigning has attracted many critics within the Islamic community itself. Calling for the closure of Islamic schools is bound to court controversy, but it is his contention that Islamic teachings are the causal link to Islamist terrorist acts that seems to really rile community leaders. Following the Manchester bombing, Tawhidi appeared in a fiery TV exchange with Dr. Jamal Rifi, imploring his fellow guest to acknowledge that the Islamic holy scripture  teach(es) the beheading of people .Perhaps Tawhidi is just the kind of person America, and the know-it-all liberals in European nations, who are being overrun by Islamic extremists posing as immigrants, need to be listening to, and perhaps next time, they might want to consider taking his warnings seriously ",0
9549,JUST IN: NYC TERRORIST Allegedly Entered U.S. On NY Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer’s ‘DIVERSITY VISA” Program,"Mark Levin dropped a bombshell on his show tonight about the Muslim terrorist who killed 9 people in Manhattan and injured dozens.  The Diversity VISA program was given the green light by none other than New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer... Mark Levin; NYC muslim terrorist came to US under  Diversity VISA Program    a bizarre lottery to shove more foreigners down our throats  Deplorable MD   (@MDDeplorable) October 31, 2017According to ABC 7:Authorities say he came to the United States seven years ago from Uzbekistan under what is called the Diversity Visa Program, which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America.DIVERSITY LOTTERYOn May 1, 2017, the Washington Post wrote an article designed to criticize President Trump, as millions were concerned that this could be the last year of the  Diversity Lottery .According to the Washington Post, the lottery s premise is simple. Each year, the Diversity Visa Lottery, as it is officially known, provides up to 50,000 randomly selected foreigners   fewer than 1 percent of those who enter the drawing   with permanent residency in the United States.It s not connected to employment or family members in the United States. The only requirement is that entrants be adults with a high school diploma or two years of work experience. Winners can bring spouses and children. Citizens of countries that have sent 50,000 people to the United States in the past five years   such as Canada, China, India, Nigeria and Mexico   are ineligible to participate.The current lottery coincides with an intense debate over immigration and comes amid policy changes that have made the country less welcoming to new arrivals. President Trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and pressed forward with plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico. He has issued executive orders targeting foreign workers, refugees and travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries.But he hasn t said a word about the green-card lottery.Its days may be numbered, nonetheless. The lottery appears to conflict with the president s call for a  merit-based  immigration system. And at least two bills in the Republican-controlled Congress seek to eliminate the program. The Diversity Lottery is plagued with fraud, advances no economic or humanitarian interest, and does not even deliver the diversity of its namesake,  according to a news release from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a co-sponsor of one of the bills.The program   operated from a consular center in Williamsburg, Ky.   has been on the chopping block before. It came under attack in 2002 after an Egyptian terrorist who killed two people in Los Angeles was found to be in the United States through his wife s diversity visa. Mohamed Atta, another Egyptian and one of the 9/11 suicide pilots, had entered the lottery twice before entering the United States on a different visa to study aviation. If you re a terrorist organization and you can get a few hundred people to apply to this from several countries . . . odds are you d get one or two of them picked,  Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) told The Washington Post in 2011 after introducing an ill-fated bill to kill the program.State Department officials insist that lottery winners are vetted just as thoroughly as other potential immigrants to the United States.Here s how the  Diversity  Immigrant VISA program works:Twitter responded to the idiocy of the  diversity  visa program:Muslim terrorist slaughters 8 in NYC today. Wait for it, wait for it here on a diversity visa. Thank you, libtards  Wayne's World (@WayneSense) November 1, 2017",0

9551,JUST IN: Senior GOP Rep Announces His Retirement…A BIG LOSS,"Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) announced Tuesday he will not seek another term in Congress in 2018, telling supporters he has  already stayed far longer than I had originally planned. Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, was first elected to the House in 2002 and is described by the Dallas Morning News as a  staunch Constitutional conservative. PASSED OVER FOR TREASURY SECRETARY:Hensarling s future has been a source of speculation for months. He was passed over to be Trump s Treasury Secretary, a gig that ended up going to Steve Mnuchin. And Hensarling s term as House Financial Services chairman will expire at the end of next year.HENSARLING TRIES TO ROLL BACK OBAMA REGS:Hensarling in June saw the House OK his roll back of far-reaching banking regulations created under President Barack Obama   but the Senate has not moved on the bill. He s also been unable to get much traction on his plans to overhaul a beleaguered flood insurance program. I HAVE ALREADY STAYED FAR LONGER THAN I HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED Today I am announcing that I will not seek reelection to the US Congress in 2018. Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned,  Hensarling wrote to supporters on Tuesday.He added,  Since my term as Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee comes to an end next year, the time seems right for my departure. Although I will not be running for reelection, there are 14 months left in my congressional term to continue the fight for individual liberty, free enterprise, and limited constitutional government the causes for which I remain passionate. Hensarling s retirement announcement comes as Democrats look to 2018 as their best chance to take back the majority since losing the House in 2010.ONE OF THE NOTABLE THINGS HENSARLING TRIED TO DO:Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling told a conference of mortgage bankers Wednesday his 2013 bill that would have ended Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac still remains the best path forward for reform of the housing finance market.Appearing at a meeting of the Mortgage Bankers Association Wednesday morning in downtown Washington, the conservative chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said the legislation  still represents the best vehicle for reform. The bill cleared the committee with Republican votes in 2013, but failed to advance in the House thanks to finance industry skepticism.Notably, it would have dissolved the bailed-out mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In their stead, it would have created a privately-run utility to facilitate the creation of mortgage-backed securities and support a secondary market for home loans.The bill would have removed government backing for mortgage-backed utilities, though. At the time, many industry groups, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, argued eliminating the government backstop for mortgage-backed securities would make 30-year fixed-rate loans unavailable.READ MORE: DALLAS NEWS",0

Breaking Bad  actor Bryan Cranston, notably outspoken against then-candidate Donald Trump, recently changed his tone, calling out those who don t support the current president. President Trump is not the person who I wanted to be in that office, and I ve been very open about that,  Cranston said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Monday.  That being said, he is the president. If he fails, the country is in jeopardy. It would be egotistical for anyone to say,  I hope he fails,  Cranston said.  To that person I would say, f k you. Why would you want that? So you can be right? The actor, currently promoting Vietnam War-era movie  Last Flag Flying,  said he doesn t want Trump to fail.  I don t want him to fail,  Cranston argued.  I want him to succeed. I do. I honestly do.If Trump fails, then America fails too! Tax reform and pro-growth should be what all Americans want Right?The actor s comments mark an abrupt change from previous remarks he made about the president before he was elected. In October 2016, Cranston said he would move to Canada if Trump were elected to office:Fox News reported: Bryan Cranston says he ll leave the United States and move to Canada if Donald Trump is elected president.During an interview Sunday with The Bestseller Experiment podcast, Cranston was asked if he would leave the country and take and extended vacation to Vancouver if Trump defeats Hillary Clinton. Absolutely. I would definitely move. It s not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won t,  Cranston said. It wouldn t be a vacation. I d be an expatriate. However, in the interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cranston said regardless of political affiliations, he ll support anyone with  a good idea. If you ve got a good idea that helps the country, oh man, I m gonna support you,  Cranston said.  I don t care if you re a Republican and I m a Democrat or whatever, I don t care.

9553,HARVEY WEINSTEIN RAPE ACCUSER Has Warrant Issued For Her Arrest…Coincidence?,"Was the first actress who outed accused rapist and serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein targeted for ratting out the Hollywood kingpin producer or is this simply a case of another Hollywood liberal who believes she s above the law and can t believe she is actually going to be charged with felony drug possession? Aren t felony drug possessions supposed to be for the little people who pay to watch Hollywood actors perform? While her past history with Weinstein is horrific, the anti-Trump feminist is not above-the-law. This image of liberal activist and actress Rose McGowan was tweeted by the pro-abortion group Emily s List on Twitter:An arrest warrant for felony possession of a controlled substance has been issued for actress Rose McGowan, who is one of dozens of women who accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.The felony charge stems from a police investigation of personal belongings left behind on a United flight arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport on January 20.Police say the items tested positive for narcotics, but they did not reveal what type of drugs they were. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department obtained the warrant on February 1.Police say they ve attempted to contact McGowan so she can appear in a Loudoun County, Virginia, court.The warrant has been entered into a national law enforcement database.McGowan had not released a statement regarding the warrant as of Monday night.But she simply tweeted  FACT  early Tuesday morning in a retweet suggesting that if she had  taken the million dollars in hush money  from Weinstein, the warrant would not have been issued and not been a news story.McGowan retweeted Ashlee Marie Preston  who wrote:  If @rosemcgowan would have taken that million dollars in hush money I m quite sure this wouldn t even be a headline The 44-year-old actress also tweeted earlier on Monday claiming that there was a warrant for her arrest, but police would not confirm the details at the time. Are they trying to silence me? There is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia. What a load of HORSES**T.,  she tweeted.Read more: Daily Mail ",0
9554,WATCH: ACTOR Who Was DRAGGED OFF Jimmy Kimmel Show By Security For Groping Ivanka Trump Is FIRED From Movie For Sexual Harassment Claims,"When  comedian  Andy Dick repeatedly slid his hands up and down Ivanka Trump s legs during her interview with Jimmy Kimmel, his liberal audience laughed. To Kimmel s credit, (and believe me, we don t give Kimmel credit for much of anything) after seeing Ivanka becoming flustered by his inappropriate behavior, Kimmel got fed up with the actions of his guest host and actually asked to have him removed from the stage by security. It s hard to say if the whole security guard entrance was a set-up for comedic purposes, but in any event, Kimmel did make the point that he was standing up for Ivanka, and refused to sit back and watch Andy Dick make uncomfortable and unwanted advances on her.Watch:Kimmel was, of course, quick to defend Trump s daughter on his show. But that was during the pre-Obama era of 2007 when Jimmy Kimmel and all of Hollywood loved Donald Trump. Who could ve possibly imagined that only 9 years later, Trump would betray the liberal Democrat cesspool of Hollywood, and put his passion for defending the forgotten man, or the everyday American before the false idols of liberal Hollywood?As Hollywood continues its implosion  it looks like Andy Dick s chickens are finally coming home to roost.Hollywood Reporter   Though the 51-year-old actor denies he groped anyone, he does admit to other inappropriate behavior:  I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them. That s my thing.  Andy Dick has been dropped from the independent feature film Raising Buchanan following accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct on set.The Hollywood Reporter was not able to reach any of the alleged victims, however, two sources detailed Dick s inappropriate behavior, which included groping people s genitals, unwanted kissing/licking and sexual propositions of at least four members of the production. It s unclear if those involved were actors or crew.Late Monday, THR spoke to Dick, who confirmed he was let go from his small role in the film. Though he vehemently denied groping claims, he said it s possible that he licked people and he confirmed that he did make advances on others.To anyone who has followed Dick s legal troubles, his well-documented history of outlandish comedy and often intentionally offensive behavior, his dismissal may not come as a surprise. But the claims can be seen as more unsettling in today s cultural climate in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. (Or ousted figures like Bill O Reilly, Amazon Studios  Roy Price, political journalist Mark Halperin, The Loud House creator Chris Savino, and the list goes on.)Dick said he s aware of his reputation. At first, he made light of the situation, joking that  my middle name is  misconduct.  They know what they signed up for.  However, he followed up with a denial that he ever groped anyone on set. I don t grope people anymore. I don t expose myself anymore,  he said by telephone. (Also well-documented is his history of exposing his genitals in public and on stage.)  I do understand that the temperature in the world right now is delicate. Kimmel recently claimed that he would  go easy  on the accused rapist and serial sexual predator Hollywood kingpin Harvey Weinstein while hosting the Academy Awards show in 2018. FOX News   Jimmy Kimmel intends to deliver some sly wisecracks about disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein when he hosts next year s Oscars   but he ll tread warily given that victims of the accused sexual predator may be vying for the gold-plated awards. It s not really a laughing matter,  the  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  host says about the rape and sexual assault allegations pouring out against Weinstein in New York magazine out Monday.Hollywood.com caught up with Kimmel after Dick was dragged off the stage by security with Kimmel s assistance. Here s what Kimmel had to say:Talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel has spoken out about his decision to carry unruly guest Andy Dick off his show on Friday night, confessing the wacky funnyman always makes him  uncomfortable. Kimmel called security and helped them physically remove Dick from his show sofa after the comic started making unwanted advances toward fellow guest Ivanka Trump.The host says,  Andy did a segment, he was a little out of it. (When) she (Ivanka) came out, he wanted a big, wet kiss. It was time for Andy to go, so I escorted him out by his feet. But Kimmel has spoken to Dick since the Jimmy Kimmel Live incident, and he insists the comic is far from upset about his rude exit.Kimmel adds,  He s Andy. He s not upset. He s not apologetic. He s just nutty. ",0
9555,WHY PAUL MANAFORT Indictment Is Bad News For Dirty Cop Robert Mueller,"This summarization by Peter Flaherty, President of the National Legal and Policy Center, of why the indictment of Paul Manafort actually exposes the truth about the dirty dealings of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, is brilliant and is a must-read for anyone who cares to see what s really going on behind the curtain.Daily Caller   More than anything else, the indictments of Paul Manafort and his partner Rick Gates demonstrate the fraudulent nature of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation. The probe has little to do with Russian interference in last year s election. Instead, it is calculated to protect Mueller and a cabal within the FBI and Justice Department who covered up crimes by Hillary Clinton because they believed it was likely that she would be elected president.And once Mueller and then his friend and successor James Comey covered for Hillary, they had to keep covering. There was a reason that Mueller was so available when he was so swiftly appointed Special Counsel in May by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The Comey firing threatened to expose all that these same officials had swept under the rug. Yes, Rosenstein bit the bullet and drafted the memo that was the legal basis for firing Comey, but it would be followed by appointing Mueller.In July, Comey preemptively exonerated Hillary despite her maintenance of a private email server and mishandling of classified material. By accusing her of being  extremely careless,  he purposely distracted attention from the context of the emails. Hillary and Bill Clinton operated an aggressive shakedown operation of domestic and foreign interests, many of which are unsavory and criminal. Concealing the true nature of the operation was at least part of the Clintons  motivation for the private server.The outlines of the Uranium One deal were not a secret. Media outlets like the New York Times reported on the U.S. government approval of a partial sale of the Canadian mining company to Rosatom, a Russian firm, while those who benefitted donated to the Clinton Foundation and paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a single speech in Moscow.Then came more detailed reports about how the FBI cracked the case of a major Russian effort to penetrate the North American uranium industry through a host of illegal activities, but somehow the whole matter was slow-walked and kept from U.S. government officials who had to approve the Uranium One deal. Mueller and Comey ultimately supervised the probe.Meanwhile, the FBI s email investigation was supervised by now-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who has significant connections to the Clintons through his wife Jill McCabe. Hillary headlined a fundraiser for a group supporting Jill McCabe s campaign for the Virginia state senate, as first reported in the Wall Street Journal. The National Legal and Policy Center subsequently exposed more Clintonista support, including from then-Clinton Foundation operative Doug Band who wrote a personal check for $50,000.The plot thickened last week when the bombshell hit that it was Hillary s campaign and the Democratic National Committee that paid for the Fusion GPS dossier. Reporters were chagrined to realize that they had been lied to repeatedly for months and months. Hillary now claims that the first she heard of it was when the dossier memo was printed by BuzzFeed in January, a likely lie. As long as this  what did Hillary know and when did Hillary know it  question is of no interest to Mueller, his investigation has no credibility whatsoever. But therein lies the dilemma for Mueller. A real probe of Hillary would mean a review of his own actions and those of his colleagues. He s cornered.Mueller s strategy is clear. He has to rescue himself, Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein and others from their complicity in Hillary s dealings with the Russians. Mueller is creating a diversion by going after Manafort, the lowest of low-hanging fruit. Just about any inquiry into Manafort s dealings over the years was sure to yield results.The left and the leftist media are apoplectic over the possibility that they finally have Trump in their crosshairs. The problem is after the media smoke has cleared, the truth is revealed about the Manafort indictment, and the facts point to President Trump having nothing to do with it. Democrats would love nothing more than to see President Trump fire special prosecutor Robert Mueller, as it would prove that he was guilty of the Trump-Russian narrative the Democrats and their allies in the media have been pushing since the night he soundly defeated Hillary Clinton in the election upset of the century. Watch Jay Sekulow explain to rabid CNN host Wolf Blitzer that Trump has nothing to do with either the announcement of the  indictments of Paul Manafort or campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos: ",0

During the interview he claimed he held no grudges against his former colleagues yet he called a few of them  a holes . Was he drunk? He also got into it on twitter with Sean Hannity and Hannity shot back questioning whether Boehner had been drinking Perhaps Hannity is on to something.John were you sober when you said this? That conversation never happened. I m sorry you are bitter and u failed! https://t.co/SLquw7rXZv  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 30, 2017Boehner gave a lengthy interview and even went after other conservative talk radio hosts: I always liked Rush.

He went really crazy right and got a big audience, and he dragged Hannity to the dark side. He dragged Rush to the dark side. And these guys   I used to talk to them all the time. And suddenly they re beating the living s  out of me. TRUE COLORS?Why is John Boehner suddenly attacking his fellow Republicans? Jordan is a valued member of Congress and isn t a RINO so maybe Boehner has it out for him.Former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a new profile from Politico on Sunday that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz(R-Utah) are  a holes. The former speaker made the comment while discussing Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) likely becoming the chair of the House Oversight Committee, a position Gowdy eventually earned.Chaffetz, the previous chair, had recently announced his resignation from Congress at the time of the interview. Jordan, who was also on the committee, was reportedly considering going out for the chairmanship. Gowdy   that s my guy, even though he doesn t know how to dress,  John Boehner told Politico.  F  Jordan. F  Chaffetz. They re both a holes. Boehner also called Chaffetz a  total phony  who was obsessed with promoting himself while in Congress. With Chaffetz it s always about Chaffetz,  Boehner told Politico.Chaffetz resigned from Congress in June and joined Fox News as a contributor.Boehner also criticized Jordan, who helped found the House s Freedom Caucus, which was part of the movement to push Boehner out as speaker: Jordan was a terrorist as a legislator going back to his days in the Ohio House and Senate,  Boehner told Politico.  A terrorist. A legislative terrorist. Last July, Boehner also spoke out against Jordan:Former House Speaker John Boehner assailed GOP House arch conservatives led by Rep. Jim Jordan as the  knucklehead caucus,  calling them  anarchists  who are  for nothing. In a speech from a private gathering in Las Vegas casino/resort, the West Chester Republican took aim at the conservatives who pushed him from office at the end of 2015. Among those was Jordan, R-Urbana, who revolted against Boehner, even though he was the first speaker from Ohio since Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1931.Boehner was asked to explain why House Republicans did not support House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to succeed Boehner as speaker. The knucklehead caucus decided they weren t going to vote for him,  Boehner said.  Now these are the guys in the Republican Party you could call right of right. They are anarachists.

You compare those two, those are apples and oranges.What the Clinton campaign did, what the DNC did, was actually exchange money. They took a meeting. Those are far different.

CEO of Allied Artists excusing sexual assault of a minor  Lydia Snider (@LydiaSnider) October 30, 2017 In 2008, financier Jeffrey Epstein, whose friends included some of the most powerful people on the planet, was convicted of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution.Spacey was on board Epstein s private jet with Bill Clinton when it flew from JFK Airport into the Azores before the former President and the actor enjoyed a tour of Africa.According to Fox News, Epstein,  Allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on  Orgy Island,  an estate on Epstein s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Bill Clinton took at least 26 trips on the Lolita Express, a luxury jet fitted out with beds where prominent elitists allegedly had sex with young girls, ditching his Secret Service detail for 5 of those trips.Clinton chose to continue his association with Epstein even after, according to the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking,  everyone within his inner circles knew was a pedophile. Epstein also reportedly had 21 different phone numbers for Bill Clinton.While there is no evidence to suggest Spacey engaged in criminal activity while on board Epstein s jet, his admission that he sexually assaulted a 14-year-old boy is sure to provoke further questions.ABC Action News   Spacey, who has been famously private about his personal life, said that he now lives as a gay man   which marked the first time the actor has made a public statement about his sexual orientation. This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life,  Spacey said in his tweet. He continued that he has had  relationships with both men and women,  and added,  I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man. Is Spacey suggesting that s it s  normal  behavior for all gay men to molest young boys?  Or is the Trump-hating actor attempting to convince people that it s okay for a 26-year-old man to molest a 14-year-old boy if he was drunk, or that if he  already forgotten about it, we should too?So many questions remain, like for instance, will Prince Charles  Un-Knight  the alleged pedophile actor?https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/743590498456088576Spacey took the opportunity to bash Trump while in France at an awards ceremony: Watch Spacey and unhinged Late Show s  Stephen Colbert, who been allowing Donald Trump to live rent-free in his head for well over a year, bash Donald Trump: ",0
9565,TOLD TO SURRENDER: Former Trump Campaign Manager Charged in Mueller Witch Hunt,"The main stream media is all aflutter this morning with the news that someone connected to President Trump has been indicted. What they aren t telling you is what s more important. A CNN anchor gave a report this morning and not until the end of the report did she say that she  should  mention that this really has nothing to do with President Trump.Paul Manafort and longtime associate Rick Gates have been told to surrender to federal authorities What the media isn t telling you is that the charges are from before Manafort worked for Trump. Let s hope Trump fires Mueller ASAP this is a witch hunt that needs to end The 12 counts are for  money laundering and not registering as a foreign agent when Manafort worked for pro-Russian forces in the Ukraine BEFORE they worked for the Trump campaign.Manafort was seen leaving his home this morning and then entering the FBI building with his lawyer:Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort told to turn himself in today: Report https://t.co/Upf5gTqiQp pic.twitter.com/4cx3TFTgVV  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 30, 2017Manafort entering the FBI offices with his lawyer:Ex-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort walks into FBI office; surrendering to feds in connection to Russia probe https://t.co/B2d9RX5PsV pic.twitter.com/piMhgnKNOY  ABC News (@ABC) October 30, 2017FOX NEWS IS REPORTING: Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were reportedly told to surrender to federal authorities as part of the special counsel s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials during the 2016 presidential election.JEFFREY TOOBIN: Trump campaign not mentioned in Manafort indictmentAccording to the New York Times, Manafort and Gates will face the first charges in the special counsel s investigation, though the charges are not immediately clear.Gates is a longtime associate of Manafort. According to the Times, his name appeared on documents linked to companies that Manafort s firm created in Cyprus to receive payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe.Mr. Manafort had been under investigation for violations of federal tax law, money laundering and whether he appropriately disclosed his foreign lobbying. Mr. Manafort has expected charges since this summer, when F.B.I. agents raided his home and prosecutors warned him that they planned to indict him. That warning raised speculation that Mr. Manafort might try to cut a deal to avoid prosecution.Mr. Trump s lawyer, Ty Cobb, said there were no concerns that Mr. Manafort would offer damaging information about the president in exchange for a deal.Some close to Mr. Manafort, including his former business partner Roger J. Stone Jr., have said he had nothing to offer that would help prosecutors build a case against Mr. Trump. He s not going to lie,  Mr. Stone said in September.Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican strategist, joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 to help keep delegates from breaking with Mr. Trump in favor of establishment Republican candidates. Mr. Trump soon promoted him to chairman and chief strategist, a job that gave him control over day-to-day operations of the campaign.But Mr. Trump fired Mr. Manafort just months later, after reports that he received more than $12 million in undisclosed payments from Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president and a pro-Russia politician. Mr. Manafort spent years as a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych. ",0

ANTI-TRUMP ACTORS George Clooney and Matt Damon’s “Suburbicon” Movie TANKS: “One of Paramount Pictures’ worst performing wide-releases ever”,"In fly-over country, and pretty much anywhere in between the east and west coasts of America, people are sick and tired supporting the arrogant, condescending, anti-American, Trump hating,  liberal actors  and Hollywood is finally starting to feel the pain in their pocketbooks. George Clooney s  Suburbicon  notched one of the most dismal wide-release debuts in recent years on a sluggish pre-Halloween weekend where the horror sequel  Jigsaw  topped all releases despite an underperforming debut.Despite debuting on more than 2,000 screens,  Suburbicon  managed just $2.8 million, making it one of Paramount Pictures  worst performing wide-releases ever and marking a new box-office low for Clooney as a director and star Matt Damon. Obviously we are disappointed in these results which we don t feel are indicative of the quality and message of his original movie,  said Kyle Davies, president of distribution for Paramount. liberal activist actors Matt Damon, George Clooney and Julianne MooreAre liberal activist actors Matt Damon, George Clooney and Julianne Moore so blinded by their hate for middle America, that they can t see the audience they re trying to appeal to, has lost their desire to support them and their sub-par movies?Before the election last year, Matt Damon expressed his anxiety over a possible Trump win:  It makes me nervous,  Damon said of the possibility that Trump would win the presidency (which he did via the Electoral College).  It s a binary choice . There s no way we can let this guy be the [president]. To let that dude have the nuclear football, are you kidding me? That s dangerous. He s impulsive and rash, and doesn t seem to think deeply about too many things. Who can forget George Clooney s interview, where he laughed at the idea that Trump would win the election, saying  There s not gonna be a President Donald Trump. That s not gonna happen. Co-star Julianne Moore is no stranger to the Hollywood anti-Trump movement.  The outspoken gun-control advocate shared her thoughts with the Huffington Post on Trump s  nationalistic  rhetoric more specifically. It s a very interesting time,  she said.

She and John Podesta testified last month that they knew nothing of the payment for a dossier on Trump Oops! Now, Republicans want answers:Congressional Republicans on Sunday called for Democrats John Podesta and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to provide further answers about their party paying for a dossier on President Trump s alleged ties to Russia, after telling Senate investigators last month that they had no knowledge of such payments.Wasserman Schultz is the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Podesta was the chairman of Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign. Both groups purportedly paid millions for research that led to the dossier, The Washington Post reported last week.Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, suggested on  Fox News Sunday  that the DNC paying a law firm for so-called opposition research connected to the dossier was tantamount to money laundering. I m not an election law expert, but the good news is you don t have to be, to understand the absurdity of believing that you can launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm,  said Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor.  So I m interested in that. He also seemed to question Podesta and Wasserman Schultz telling the Senate Intelligence Committee last month that they didn t know who paid for the dossier. I am also interested in sharing some memory tricks with folks at the DNC because no one can remember who paid $10 million to a law firm to do oppo research,  Gowdy said.  I find that stunning. $10 million and no one can remember who authorized it, who approved it, who said,  This is a really good idea.

9570,JUST IN: DALLAS COWBOYS OWNER Jerry Jones Is Leading Effort To Oust NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell,"Make no mistake about it, the NFL needs to show their fans that their players are serious about playing football, or the owners are going to continue to face catastrophic financial losses. The owners didn t hire Goodell to be their social justice director Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones led a conference call with 17 NFL owners on Thursday to discuss the possibility of halting commissioner Roger Goodell s pending contract extension.The owners on Thursday s conference call are unhappy with Goodell and the NFL s front office for a variety of reasons, including the player protests staged during the national anthem, issues regarding the relocation of teams to Los Angeles and the league s handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, sources told ESPN. You don t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,  one owner said during the call.Sources have previously said that Jones has tried to stand in the way of any extension for Goodell.Last month, ESPN reported that Jones was impeding the progress of contract negotiations aimed at an extension for Goodell.  If not for Jerry,  one owner said last month in regard to the contract negotiations,  this deal would be done. The tension between Jones and Goodell is in part credited to the commissioner giving Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott a six-game suspension, which is currently being disputed in court.Another factor in the frustration with Goodell is the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem.Goodell won t mandate the players stand while Jones is threatening Cowboys onto their feet.Earlier this month, Jones said that any of his players who  disrespect  the flag won t be allowed to play. I know this, we cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,  Jones, also the team s general manager, said after a 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers on October 8.The previous week, Jones knelt along with head coach Jason Garrett and all their players in the middle of the field on September 26 in a show of unity before they all stood for the anthem before their 28-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!  President Trump tweeted.On the other side of the debate, Goodell strongly backed the players and criticized Trump for  an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL. For entire story- Daily Mail ",0

You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history   led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017Boy, was Trump ever correct!GP   Robert Mueller continued with his now widely reported corrupt and criminal activities last night by leaking information sealed by the courts to CNN. This is just another corrupt and criminal act in Mueller s corrupt and criminal career.Last night we found out from information leaked to CNN that the Mueller investigation has filed charges in the ongoing superfluous investigation into President Trump and the far out possibility that he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. CNN reported that:A federal grand jury in Washington, DC, on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to sources briefed on the matter. The charges are still sealed under orders from a federal judge.In typical bad cop form, former FBI Head and current Special Counsel Mueller proved again that he is as dirty as it gets.Trump came out today after the crooked deep-state with these series of tweets:Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), .

Is this coincidental? NOT! All of this ""Russia"" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017Mueller s career is littered with numerous investigations of major scandals and likely crimes that he did not meaningfully investigate as FBI Director resulting in no arrests and no consequences. All of these resulted in the Clintons and/or Obama Administration getting away with criminal activities:IRS Targeting (2010-2013): the IRS intentionally selected and then delayed or denied tax-exempt 501(c)(3) applications from conservative groups to prevent them from participating in the 2012 election, followed by IRS agent Lois Lerner invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (No charges have been filed of any wrong doing by any government officials in this case.)Fast and Furious (2010): this ATF program, which seems to have served no rational purpose, allowed over 2,000 guns to be purchased illegally inside the United States and then  walked  into Mexico for use by criminals, one of which was later used in the 2010 murder of Border Agent Brian Terry by the member of a Mexican cartelAssociated Press Spying (2012): the Department of Justice illegally seized the communications of AP reporters made during April and May 2012, allowing the DOJ to unmask journalists  confidential sourcesClinton Foundation Pay-for-Play (2009-2013): during the period in which Hillary Clinton held the office of Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton received millions of dollars in paid speaking fees and a million dollar  gift from countries involved in matters with the State Department, many of which had ties to terrorism and human rights abuses; some of these funds were apparently diverted from charitable causes to personal expenses, such as Chelsea Clinton s 2010 wedding.Russian Uranium Deal (2009-2013): Hillary Clinton s State Department approved a deal allowing a Russian company to control 20% of the uranium mining production capacity inside the United States, which was followed by millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from people associated with the transaction. This past week information was reported that prior to the Obama administration approving the very controversial deal in 2010 giving Russia 20% of America s Uranium through the approved sale of Uranium One, the FBI had evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were involved in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering in order to benefit Vladimir Putin, says a report by The Hill. Mueller was the head of the FBI at this time! He was even hand picked by Hillary Clinton to hand over uranium to Russia on an airport tarmac at this time.Clinton Private Email Server (2009-2013): during her entire tenure as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton dodged Freedom of Information Act requirements by using a private email server to conduct official government business, as well as sent and received classified information that was Top Secret over an unsecured system an  extremely reckless  (and obviously illegal) act. Mueller s acceptance of the lead role in the investigation into Russia is another obvious example of his corrupt and criminal tendencies. Based on numerous accounts he has obvious conflicts of interest and even liberal publications like the USA Today have called for Mueller to step down as special prosecutor because of his conflicts of interest with the investigation he is carrying on. Now we know he took over the investigation in spite of his criminal activities in covering up the FBI investigation into Uranium One. A person of integrity would easily have seen his conflicts of interest and would recuse himself.Independent UK   Donald Trump s former campaign Paul Manafort has said he has not been informed of any possible criminal charges against him, after it was reported the first indictments had been filed by the team investigating Russia s alleged meddling in the 2016 election.Reports said a grand jury working with Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, had approved the first charges to result from the ongoing probe that is looking at possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The reports, which have not specified what the charges are or who they were filed against, said a suspect could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.CNN, which broke the news, said the charges were filed on Friday and placed under a seal by a federal judge. Yet, that has not stopped a flurry of speculation as to who may be the focus of Mr Mueller s charges and the nature of them. ",0

9574,TREY GOWDY SLAMS Mueller Teams Over Leaks About Charges in Trump-Russia Investigation [Video],"Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the leader of the House s top investigative committee, slammed special counsel Robert Mueller on Sunday for allowing the news media to learn that he and his legal team now have charges in their Russia investigation. In the only conversation I ve had with Robert Mueller, I stressed to him the importance of cutting out the leaks,  Gowdy, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told  Fox News Sunday.   It s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law. Mueller and his team have for roughly the past five months been leading a Justice Department investigation into whether anybody associated with the President Trump s 2016 White House campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election outcome. On Friday night, CNN reported that Mueller s team has filed the first charges in the case with a federal grand jury.IN THE MEAN TIME, TRUMP S LAWYER SAYS THERE S NO WORRY: Donald Trump s lawyer says President Trump is not worried about what his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort or former national security adviser Mike Flynn told special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Ty Cobb told the New York Times Trump is confident neither Manafort nor Flynn has incriminating information about the president. The president has no concerns in terms of any impact, as to what happens to them, on his campaign or on the White House,  Cobb said.Prosecutors on Mueller s team reportedly warned Manafort to expect an indictment when they raided his Virginia home in July.CNN reported late Friday the first charges have been filed in the Russia investigation and anyone charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday. It is not known who is being charged in the case. Trump likes and respects Mr. Manafort and appreciates the work he did for him during the three months he was with the campaign. He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel,  Cobb said.  I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments. But to the extent that that happens, that s beyond his control. ",0
9575,"JUST IN: Obama Campaign Secretly Paid $972,000 To Fund Creation Of Fake Trump Dossier","Well, well, well As a famous  reverend  once said, Obama s  chickens have come home too roost OR AS MIKE HUCKABEE SAID:.@GovMikeHuckabee: I think it's easier to find Bigfoot and Amelia Earhart than it is to find collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/RA68QqD9kG  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 29, 2017Obama for America (OFA), the former president s political organization, has directed nearly a million dollars to the very same law firm that funneled money to Fusion GPS, the firm behind the infamous Steele dossier.Since April of 2016, Obama For America (OFA) has paid over $972,000 to Perkins Coie, records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show.The Washington Post reported last week that Perkins Coie, an international law firm, was directed by both the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s campaign to retain Fusion GPS in April of 2016 to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump. Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, to compile a dossier of allegations that Trump and his campaign actively colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. Though many of the claims in the dossier have been directly refuted, none of the dossier s allegations of collusion have been independently verified. Lawyers for Steele admitted in court filings last April that his work was not verified and was never meant to be made public.FEC records as well as federal court records show that Marc Elias, the Perkins Coie lawyer whom the Washington Post reported was responsible for the payments to Fusion GPS on behalf of Clinton s campaign and the DNC, also previously served as a counsel for OFA. In Shamblin v. Obama for America, a 2013 case in federal court in Florida, federal court records list Elias as simultaneously serving as lead attorney for both OFA and the DNC.OFA, which managed Obama s successful re-election campaign in 2012, retooled after that campaign to focus on enacting the president s agenda during his final term in office. The group reorganized again after the 2016 election and planned to use its staff and resources to oppose President Donald Trump. During the entire 2016 campaign cycle, the group spent only $4.5 million, according to FEC records.Federal records show that Hillary Clinton s official campaign organization, Hillary For America, paid just under $5.1 million to Perkins Coie in 2016. The DNC paid nearly $5.4 million to the law firm in 2016.The timing and nature of the payments to Perkins Coie by Obama s official campaign arm raise significant questions about whether OFA was funding Fusion GPS, how much Obama and his team knew about the contents and provenance of the dossier long before its contents were made public, and whether the president or his government lieutenants knowingly used a partisan political document to justify official government actions targeting the president s political opponents named in the dossier. According to the Washington Post, Fusion GPS was first retained by Perkins Coie on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in April of 2016.At the same time that Hillary s campaign, Obama s campaign organization, and the DNC were simultaneously paying Perkins Coie, the spouse of one of Fusion GPS s key employees was working directly for Obama in the West Wing. Shailagh Murray, a former Washington Post reporter-turned-political operative, was serving as a top communications adviser to Obama while the Obama administration was reportedly using information from the dossier to justify secret surveillance of Trump campaign staff. Murray is married to Neil King, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was hired by Fusion GPS in December of 2016. While at the Wall Street Journal, King worked alongside Fusion GPS s core team, even sharing bylines with Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS executive who personally hired Steele to probe Trump s alleged Russia connections.As you might suspect,  Neil King was a thick as thieves with CNN, the WSJ and the Washington Post. The lines between investigating the truth and fake news were blurred in a big way when King and Catan jumped from the WSJ to Fusion GPS. As the Daily Caller reported:CNN s reporting on the Trump-Russia dossier has left out at least one crucial fact: the close ties between the network and the opposition research firm at the center of the dossier controversy.CNN s reporting on the dossier, led by justice correspondent Evan Perez, has been favorable to the firm, Fusion GPS, and hyped the dossier s credibility. Left out of Perez s reporting, which has relied largely on unnamed sources, is his personal closeness to Fusion GPS  operatives. Fusion has repeatedly been described in Senate testimonies as a smear-for-hire operation that manufactures misleading or false media narratives for its clients. Another Fusion founder, Tom Catan, worked as a reporter for the Journal at the same time as Perez and Simpson. The third Fusion co-founder, Peter Fritsch, worked above Perez and Simpson as the senior national security editor.KING (FUSION GPS) ON THE RIGHT -Photo posted on Facebook by Perez (CNN)Simpson and Fritsch left the WSJ in 2011 to launch Fusion. Perez jumped from the paper to CNN in 2013. Another longtime Journal reporter, Neil King, left the paper to join Fusion in December 2016.PEREZ ( LEFT) AND ALL OF FUSION The importance of the fake dossier and how it was shopped around to the press comes into focus when you realize that Obama, Clinton and the DNC had Fusion GPS create this smear campaign on Trump. This also opened the door for the phony Russia collusion investigation whereby the Trump campaign and family members were spied on because of something fake.Read more: The Federalist ",0
9576,BREAKING: ONLY MLB Player To Kneel During National Anthem ARRESTED For Pulling Gun On Delivery Woman,"When Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Maxwell took a knee during the national anthem before their game against the Texas Rangers, the Oakland Athletics immediately tweeeted out their support for him. To date, Maxwell is the only MLB player who has chosen to disrespect our flag as a way to help BLM push an anti-cop movement.Here is the Oakland A s response to Bruce Maxwell kneeling during our nation s national anthem:pic.twitter.com/EHXwg8Zpax  A's, But Spooky   (@Athletics) September 24, 2017Last week, Maxwell was caught lying about being denied service at a local restaurant after kneeling for the anthem.FOX News   Oakland A s catcher Bruce Maxwell, 26, claimed this week that a waiter in his Alabama hometown of Huntsville refused him service after identifying him as the MLB player who took the knee during  The Star Spangled Banner  last month   only the waiter has a very different version of events and he told Fox News that was far from what went down. He is outright lying. This is really upsetting as he was given full service, I didn t even know who Bruce Maxwell was,  Matt Henry, a 42-year-old waiter at Keegan s Public House, told Fox News.  This all started because I carded his friend who wanted to order a beer. According to Henry, an Alabama native, Maxwell was dining with local Democratic councilman Devyn Keith and another friend who produced an expired ID, and the server refused to serve him a drink   which upset the friend, who followed him into the kitchen. He asked me,  Don t you know who Bruce Maxwell is? , and told me I was making everyone feel uncomfortable. Nobody was even paying attention to them,  Henry claimed. I didn t know anything about him or the kneeling. All I know is a friend of mine 15 years ago lost his job for serving someone a drink who happened to be underage, so if anyone looks under 30, I m going to card them. The waiter said that the councilman then complained to the restaurant s manager about Maxwell being uncomfortable, and the manager simply swapped me to another table, and that it was  no big deal. The restaurant manager on duty that day, Anne Whalen   who requested the restaurant name not be used without permission from the owner   also told Fox News that Maxwell s story being portrayed in the media could not be further from the truth. Matt came to me and told me that a guy wanted a beer but his ID was not valid and I told him he absolutely could not give it to him, we can go to jail for that in the state of Alabama,  the manager said. It was his friend causing all the fuss, none of us even knew who this baseball player was. I told him I had no idea who he was going on about,  she said.  Eventually Matt just asked if we could put another server on the table so I did.   I can t believe the story. Today, it was announced that Maxwell was arrested in Arizona after a food delivery person told authorities that he pointed a gun at her.TMZ  Scottsdale PD tells us Maxwell, 26, was arrested Saturday at 6:08 PM at his Scottsdale, AZ home. Cops say the alleged victim was a female food delivery driver who told them Maxwell pointed a gun at her.It s unclear what led up to the incident.SPD says Maxwell was booked on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct.Cops say he is in custody and awaiting his initial appearance in front of a judge.

9577,MICHIGAN MAN Charged with Threatening to Assassinate President Trump,"Can you imagine being POTUS and having this threat every day while you re in the WhiteHouse? The threats are there but this type of threat is frightening because this man is apparently mentally ill. We were unable to find any pictures of this man. He made vile and graphic threats to President Trump and was charged:A truck driver has been charged in federal court with threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump in several phone calls to Secret Service field offices.Special Agent Matthew Lariviere wrote in a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday that James Anthony Jackson repeatedly called the Secret Service field office in Chicago on Oct. 12-13 and made more phone calls to the field office in Detroit on Oct. 18 threatening to  blow Trump s brains out.

The company, which does not appear in state business records, is linked to an outreach center in Grand Rapids.Phone records also showed Jackson frequently called a woman in the 517 area code. The woman told investigators she had met a man online named  Jamie  who had harassed and threatened her from the same Grand Rapids-area phone number used by Jackson.Jamie threatened to  cut off her head and parade it in front of the White House for Trump,  according to the court filing.On Friday, investigators interviewed Jackson s uncle.Jackson had cursed and threatened relatives, the uncle said.Agents played a recording of one of the Trump threats for Jackson s sister and she confirmed the voice belonged to Jackson, according to the complaint.The News reports Jackson was born in 1984 but a hometown wasn t available and the U.S. Attorney s Office refused to discuss the case.Via Detroit NewsVia: WNEM",0

CNN political commentator Van Jones was also a guest on the Bill Maher show. Jones recently wrote a book about how if Democrats ever want to win another race, they need to find ways to reach common ground with Trump supporters.Bill Maher started out his interview with Joy Behar by complimenting her because she s one of the only Democrats to agree with him that Democrats are  too nice .  When he asked Behar how she felt about Michelle Obama s famous (and ridiculous) quotes at the DNC convention where she claimed that,  When they (Republicans) go low, we (Democrats) go high.  Behar then said,  No! When they go low we should go lower.  She then looked out at Van Jones and called him out,  Van, listen, you re the first perpetrator of this. He wants the kumbaya. F**k the kumbaya!   These people on this side are crazy. Dont  you understand? They re crazy! And then, quite hilariously, Behar told Jones  You don t deal with white supremacists!

Her tweet showed a document that appears to prove that former Democrat President Lyndon B. Johnson was a member of the Klan in Texas during the early days of his political career. The JFK Files reveal that Democrat President LBJ was a member of the Klan. pic.twitter.com/NoOJLWAlDp  Patricia Dickson (@Patrici15767099) October 27, 2017Dinesh D Souza was quick to respond to Dickson s tweet, saying:  If this is true, LBJ becomes the third Democratic President to be either a member or avid supporter of the Ku Klux Klan. If this is true, LBJ becomes the third Democratic President to be either a member or avid supporter of the Ku Klux Klan https://t.co/2gX4i6fDc0  Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) October 28, 2017In Dinesh D Souza s movie,  Hillary s America , the ugly truth was revealed about the Democrat Party, and how throughout the history of the United States Democrats have been responsible for slavery and for much of the racism blacks have experienced in America.In his movie, D Souza interviewed Vanderbilt professor Carol Swain. Swain made her own video about the  Inconvenient Truth about The Democratic Party  that s been viewed 1.8 million times. When you think about racial equality and civil rights, which political party comes to mind, the Republican s or the Democrat s? Most people would probably say the Democrats. But that answer isn t correct.Since its founding in 1829, the Democratic Party has fought against every major civil rights initiative, and has a long history of discrimination. The Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed reconstruction, founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynching and fought against the Civil Rights Acts of the 1950 s and 1960 s. In contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territory with the aim of abolishing it entirely. Dickson reminded Twitter users that the Republican Party was formed for the sole purpose of ending slavery.No Republican owned slaves because the Republican Party was formed for the sole purpose of ending slavery. https://t.co/vv3jaQ62QJ  Patricia Dickson (@Patrici15767099) October 28, 2017",0
9580,NEW STUDY Shows Why Atheists and People Who Agree With Immigrants That Bash Their Country Use LESS BRAIN POWER,"It s not at all surprising that at least 28% of Democrats consider themselves to be atheists. Fascinating This has to be embarrassing . . . if you re an atheist. A new study performed at the University of York used targeted magnetism to shut down part of the brain. The result: belief in God disappeared among more than 30 percent of participants.That in itself may not seem so embarrassing, but consider that the specific part of the brain they frazzled was the posterior medial frontal cortex the part associated with detecting and solving problems, i.e., reasoning and logic.In other words, when you shut down the part of the brain most associated with logic and reasoning, greater levels of atheism result.You ve heard the phrase,  I don t have enough faith to be an atheist ? Apparently, we can now also say,  I have too many brains to be an atheist.   The American VisionDaily Mail  The study was carried out by Dr Keise Izuma from the University of York and Colin Holbrook from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).They recruited 38 participants with an average age of 21, to take part in the study.Each of these participants said they held significant religious beliefs, and the majority held moderate to extremely conservative political beliefs.Political views were important because it suggested they were more likely to have stronger viewpoints on immigration.Half of these participants formed part of a control group and received a low-level  sham  procedure that did not affect their brains.The other half received enough energy through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to lower activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC).This part of the brain, located near the surface and roughly a few inches up from the forehead, is associated with detecting problems and triggering responses that address them.Following the treatment, all the participants were first asked to think about death before being asked questions about their religious beliefs and their feelings about immigrants.The death task including writing brief responses on the subject of their own death.To address their levels of prejudice, participants were asked to read two essays   one critical and one positive   written by an immigrant from Latin America about the US.After reading each essay, participants rated how much they liked the person who wrote the essay and how much they agreed with their views.Religious belief was measured using a version of the Supernatural Belief Scale.Items were presented in random order and rated according to the same scale used in the immigrant ratings.Questions included:  There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God ,  There exist good personal spiritual beings, whom we might call angels  and  There exists an evil personal spiritual being, whom we might call the Devil. Circa   So how do Democrats and Republicans stack up when it comes to having faith vs. athesists?According to the Pew Research Center,  nones    people who don t identify with any religion   make up 23 percent of American adults.In the Democratic Party, that number is even bigger. 28 percent of Democrats are non-religious, Pew s research shows.Conversely, people who identify as non-religious are much more likely to vote Democratic. 70 percent of self-identifying atheists, for example, voted for President Obama in 2012, according to Pew.One of those atheists is James White, a Texas delegate for Hillary Clinton at this year s DNC. At the convention on Monday, White was wearing a shirt that read,  I m actually an atheist. White said he still feels it s necessary to publicly broadcast his beliefs to promote acceptance of atheism within the party. When we make it safe for people to realize that a nearly 60-year-old Texas middle-aged white guy is an atheist and a Democrat, those things make it easier for others to come forward too,  he said. There has been some progress, White said. Earlier this year, the Texas Democratic Party adopted three secular resolutions into its official policy platform.The investigators additionally found that the magnetic stimulation had the greatest effect on reactions to the critical author in the essay test. We think that hearing criticisms of your group s values, perhaps especially from a person you perceive as an outsider, is processed as an ideological sort of threat,  said Dr Izuma. One way to respond to such threats is to  double down  on your group values, increasing your investment in them, and reacting more negatively to the critic,  he continued. When we disrupted the brain region that usually helps detect and respond to threats, we saw a less negative, less ideologically motivated reaction to the critical author and his opinions.

9581,HILARIOUS! Paul Joseph Watson DESTROYS Media For Bullsh*t Russian Collusion Propaganda [VIDEO],"Paul Joseph Watson nails it again. In the video below, Watson does a brilliant job of exposing the hypocrisy of the media and why they are not to be believed or trusted when it comes to offering actual news without a nauseating leftist bias.From Ned Ryan of Fox News  You may have heard of the scandal brewing in Washington. Presidential advisers cutting sweetheart deals with a foreign power, signing million dollar lobbying contracts with that foreign power, bribes being proffered, and the foreign government gained unprecedented access to government agencies and crucial U.S. natural resources? And what if I told you that foreign power was Russia?Collusion you say? Perhaps. Collusion with Trump? Nope.I m talking about a news story that fittingly is coming back from the dead just before Halloween to scare a lot of Democrats, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Obama administration officials. If you want to take a deeper dive on this issue, read the book  Clinton Cash,  by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. But here are the basics.A decade ago, a long-time Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his uranium company to another firm, Uranium One. With that deal, Uranium One now owned uranium mines in the western U.S., including Wyoming, with about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the U.S.In 2009, Rosatom, Russia s nuclear agency, took a 17-percent position in Uranium One. A year later, in the summer of 2010, Rosatom bought majority control of the Uranium One, effectively giving the Russian government-controlled entity proprietary access to one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply.And then there s that whole phony Trump-Russian dossier story Watch, as Paul Joseph Watson DESTROYS the liberal media for force-feeding their viewers with  24/7 phony Trump-Russian coverage, without having so much as ONE actual identifiable or legitimate source to back up their assertions. But when ACTUAL evidence is put forth about REAL collusion with the Russians by Hillary Clinton and the DNC for the purposes of affecting the outcome of the election,  the media goes silent.Enjoy:",0

Trump (@AKADonaldTrump) October 28, 2017FOX News   Special Counsel Robert Mueller is facing a fresh round of calls from conservative critics for his resignation from the Russia collusion probe, amid revelations that have called into question the FBI s own actions and potentially Mueller s independence.This week s bombshell that a controversial anti-Trump dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign has Republicans asking to what extent the FBI   which received some of the findings and briefly agreed to pay the same researcher to gather intelligence on Trump and Russia   used the politically connected material.Hill investigators also are looking into a Russian firm s uranium deal that was approved by the Obama administration in 2010 despite reports that the FBI   then led by Mueller   had evidence of bribery involving a subsidiary of that firm. Critics question whether Mueller s own ties to the bureau as well as fired FBI director James Comey now render him compromised as he investigates allegations of Russian meddling and collusion with Trump officials in the 2016 race. The federal code could not be clearer   Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey,  Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who first called for Mueller to step down over the summer, said in a statement to Fox News on Friday.  The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code.   All of the revelations in recent weeks make the case stronger. Outgoing New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor and Trump ally, also suggested Friday that Mueller consider stepping aside. If the facts that you just laid out are true, then somebody with Bob Mueller s integrity will step aside and should   if in fact those facts, as you laid them out, are true,  Christie said on  Fox & Friends,  in response to various conflict-of-interest allegations.",0

Why is everyone in Washington DC and in the media ignoring her bizarre and incoherent interviews that leave viewers wondering how in the world she is fit to serve. American Mirror   During her recent weekly press conference, the House Minority Leader was seen stumbling over words, uttering gibberish, staring blankly at reporters, and on at least two occasions, suffering from face spasms.

9584,HOUSTON TEXAN PLAYERS THREATEN Owner For Telling NFL Team Owners “We can’t have the inmates running the prison” During Private Meeting,"The NYP reported that the players whom Bob McNair employs were not happy about his comments at a recent NFL owners meeting.McNair sparked the outrage by saying,  We can t have the inmates running the prison,  during an NFL owners meeting one day after he and 10 other NFL representatives met with current and former players to discuss the issues behind the national anthem protests. McNair has apologized for the racially insensitive analogy, but count outspoken Seahawks star Richard Sherman   who will play against the Texans this weekend   among those who don t believe the apology was sincere.The Texans nearly staged a team-wide walkout Friday, a few hours after McNair apologized for comparing NFL players to  inmates  in a prison, ESPN reported.Texans players wanted to walkout today in response to owner Bob McNair s comments, per @sarahbarshop. Had to be persuaded to stay.  Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 27, 2017Houston s best offensive player, wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, skipped practice for  personal reasons,  but ESPN later confirmed it was in response to McNair s comments. Head coach Bill O Brien said he is  100 percent  with his players.Texans offensive lineman Duane Brown said McNair s comments  sickened  him and were  horrible,  according to the Houston Chronicle. Brown also said he wasn t surprised by the comments, and that Houston players are not done dealing with the issue.Brown s wife also spoke out on the issue. My husband has put his BODY & MIND on the line for your team for 10 YRS & to you he is an  inmate,  Devi Brown wrote.  You owe these players RESPECT & support. ESPN reported the Texans will  do something  before the game Sunday but have not decided what yet.Texans rookie Treston Decoud tweeted,  I don t believe he is the only owner that feel that way   smh. NFL players may not be happy with the Houston Texan team owner s choice of words when he told other team owners in a private meeting that,  We can t have the inmates running the prison , but how far off base was Texan s owner Bob McNair when he used the commonly used phrase?While the Houston Texans may only have 13 players who ve been arrested for crimes, they re not exactly a group of choir boys either. Here are just a few examples of  NFL teams and the number of players who ve been arrested on those teams since 2000. Keep in mind that each NFL team has 53 players.Minnesota Vikings Number of arrests: 49 Perhaps the most notable of the Vikings  arrests was the  Love Boat  scandal, during which Fred Smoot, Daunte Culpepper, Bryant McKinnie and Moe Williams were all arrested. Adrian Peterson s child abuse case along with 18 DUI cases were also among the Vikings  arrests over the years.Denver Broncos Number of arrests: 47 Brandon Marshall accounted for four of these arrests while he was with the team, including two instances of domestic violence and one domestic dispute. The Broncos have had 12 instances of domestic violence since 2000, as well as 12 DUIsCincinnati Bengals Number of arrests: 44 The Bengals currently employ Adam Jones, who has the most arrests of any NFL player since 2000 (10) and was even arrested earlier this year for poking a security guard in the eye. They also employed the player with the third most arrests since 2000, Chris Henry (6), who passed away in 2009. Overall, the Bengals have had nine assaults, nine DUIs and six domestic violence cases over the past 17 years.Tennessee Titans Number of arrests: 36 Kenny Britt, who has the second-most individual arrests since 2000 (seven times), was arrested six times within a span of two years with Tennessee. In total, the Titans have had 10 DUIs, four assaults and four domestic violence cases over that span.Tampa Bay Buccaneers Number of arrests: 36 The Buccaneers have had 11 DUIs since 2000, as well as four drug charges and four instances of domestic violence. Former Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib was arrested on gun and assault charges while with Tampa Bay.Jacksonville Jaguars Number of arrests: 35 The Jaguars have had four gun charges and five drug charges to go with their seven DUIs. Among those drug charges was wide receiver Matt Jones, who was spotted cutting up cocaine in his car by police in 2008.Cleveland Browns Number of arrests: 33 Johnny Manziel recently made the list after he was accused of domestic violence in early 2016. Meanwhile, Dont  Stallworth was charged with a DUI manslaughter in 2009, while Ausar Walcott was charged with attempted murder in 2013. The Browns also have six drug charges and five gun charges.Chicago Bears Number of arrests: 32 The Bears have had seven assaults and 10 DUIs since 2000. Among those arrests was Lance Briggs, who crashed his Lamborghini into a pole and left the scene of the accident   a crime that he pled guilty to.Kansas City Chiefs Number of arrests: 32 The Chiefs employed Jovan Belcher, who fatally shot his girlfriend 10 times before going to the team s facility and shooting himself in the head with a gun. They also employed Larry Johnson, who was arrested four times   including twice for domestic disputes. Kansas City has 10 DUI cases and four cases of theft/burglary since 2000.Miami Dolphins Number of arrests: 31 The Dolphins have seven domestic violence cases and seven assault and battery cases to go with their eight DUI arrests. They also had Ricky Williams, who was charged with reckless driving after going 126 mph on the highway once.Baltimore Ravens Number of arrests: 27 The Ravens have several high-profile arrests since 2000, including Ray Rice s domestic violence case and Ray Lewis  murder charge. They also had Terrence Cody, who was indicted on charges of animal cruelty after one of his dogs died. Cody also illegally owned an alligator. Seattle Seahawks Number of arrests: 27 Lofa Tatupu, who was arrested for a DUI during which he had a .155 blood alcohol content, was one of 11 Seahawks players to be charged with a DUI. Seattle has also had six domestic violence instances over that span.Carolina Panthers Number of arrests: 22 Panthers players have had six DUIs, four assaults, three gun charges, three domestic violence cases and three drug cases since 2000. One of the more prominent cases involved defensive end Greg Hardy, who threw his victim onto a couch covered in guns among other instances of domestic violence.Black Lives Matter posterchild for disrespecting our flag, former 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick s team is in the middle of the pack for team members with most criminal arrests and convictions:San Francisco 49ers Number of arrests: 25 The 49ers have 13 DUI charges since 2000 along with three domestic violence cases. One of those cases involved former fullback Bruce Miller, who later was charged with assault after allegedly assaulting his 70-year-old father in a hotel in San FranciscoWhile the Houston Texans team doesn t land in the top of the list for players with most criminal convictions on their team, they certainly have their fair share. Sadly, only having 13 arrests on their team makes them look good compared to the other teams with more arrests for criminal activity. Houston Texans Number of arrests: 13 The Texans were founded in 2002, and have overall been pretty good about staying out of trouble compared to the rest of the league. Houston has four DUI charges, including one to Jacoby Jones that he pleaded guilty to.Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman sounded off on McNair s comments, as he attempted to throw gasoline on the fire:I can appreciate ppl being candid. Don t apologize! You meant what you said. Showing true colors allows ppl to see you for who you are.  Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) October 27, 2017Sherman isn t shy about his hate for cops. His big mouth and unnecessary disrespect for a law-enforcement officer didn t end up well for him, as he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct towards a police officer in 2014.Empire Sports   Sherman is known for his cockiness on the field and a vocabulary that can only be described as  trash-talk.  His passion on the field often carries over to the after-game interviews, and he is the type of player Seahawks fans either love or love to hate.Despite his reputation for attitude within the NFL, witnesses to Sherman s altercation with a Seattle police officer were shocked by his behavior. It was like he just picked off Peyton in the Super Bowl, and ran it back for a touchdown or something. His cockiness was at an all-time high!  Said Curt Johnson, a bystander to the incident.Sherman s problems arose when a police officer witnessed him jaywalking, and gave him a warning not to do it again. The officer later admitted that he wasn t so much worried about the jaywalking law in Seattle, but the fact that it was a busy street and Sherman could have been hurt, as several pedestrians have been hit by cars in the same area over the last few months. He asked me if I knew who he was, and I said, of course, I m a huge fan.  Said Patrolman Mike Stephens.  [Sherman] then continued to say,  Then you know that I own [expletive] Seattle, and any [expletive] street I want to cross I can, no matter where I decide to [expletive] cross it. Stephens apparently tried to apologize, and explain to Sherman that he was just doing his job and that Sherman s celebrity status in the city did not give him the right to curse anyone. He told me that I was a terrible police officer, and said I should just go eat some [expletive] donuts.  Said Officer Stephens.  He went off on me about how he was doing better in life than I was, and said that I shouldn t even watch a Seattle game again because I didn t deserve to witness the  greatness  that was him on a football field. Sherman was arrested and charged with jaywalking and disorderly conduct towards a police officer in the course of his duty.",0

Brad Sherman appeared as a guest on Thursday s  Tucker Carlson Tonight,  and apparently didn t feel like leaving after his segment was over.Sherman and Carlson went back and forth in a heated arguments over new revelations regarding Russian influence via the Podesta Group and the new tax bill. Sherman also brought up impeaching Donald Trump, something he tried to trigger this summer with his own articles of impeachment.After the segment ended, Carlson began a new segment with Byron York of the Washington Examiner, but Rep. Sherman stuck around, interjecting into the conversation.At the end of Carlson speaking with York, Sherman is still sitting at the other end of the desk, so Tucker invites him to read the teleprompter tease for the next part of the show after the commercial break.Sherman reads it poorly and the show goes to commercials.What a putz!NOT EMBARRASSED?!SHERMAN S PARTY WAS JUST CAUGHT GIVING MILLIONS FOR OPPOSITION RESEARCH!

9587,INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED: SECOND TRESPASSER May Have Been Near President Trump In U.S. Capitol [Video],"The news that a second man was able to sneak into the press gaggle inside the Capitol building earlier this week is a huge red flag. With all of the hate and leftist extremists out there, the security should be very tight. It s not Check out the news below that a second man bragged about being able to sneak into the press area:Congressional security officials Thursday were investigating a report of a second man who may have passed through security to join a press gaggle inside the U.S. Capitol building earlier this week awaiting President Trump, sources said.News of a possible second intruder came after another protester managed to infiltrate a group of reporters waiting for Trump, who had been meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the source told Fox News.The second person was described as a middle-aged man who stood about 6 feet, 3 inches tall and was dressed in a gray suit and bow tie. When asked by reporters who he worked for, the man replied,  I m a tourist,  and bragged about being able to sneak inside the Ohio Clock Corridor in the Capitol building. Via: FOX 5INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED INTO TRESPASSER WHO WAS ALREADY ON WATCH LIST:The liberal protester who earlier this week infiltrated a group of reporters in a secure area of the Capitol, tossed mini-Russian flags and shouted  treason  at President Trump had been on a watch list before Tuesday s incident, Fox News has learned.The protester was identified as Ryan Clayton, an activist from an anti-Trump group who was later arrested and charged with unlawful conduct.The U.S. Capitol Police Board is conducting an internal investigation into how someone without a press credential   and on a watch list   was able to slip into the secure area and get so close to the president. This was a monumental f up,  a senior congressional security source told Fox News.Clayton has been on a  watch list  kept by the Capitol Police, a source said, and was denied entry to the complex earlier that day when an officer recognized him at the Russell Senate Office Building.But later on, officers in a tunnel leading to the Capitol did not check his ID to see if he had a pass or badge, the source said. He used an outdated visitor s pass to enter the Capitol through a tunnel connecting the Rayburn House Office building. After clearing the security checkpoint, he made his way outside the Senate chamber, where he blended in with credentialed congressional reporters and stood just feet away from Trump.A source also said Clayton was in possession of a four-day old pass for the location of the House Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility, which is home to the House Intelligence Committee. Fox News is told there is no evidence so far that Clayton attempted to access that facility.PROTESTER ON WATCH LIST MAKES HIS WAY INTO PRESS GROUP TO THROW RUSSIAN FLAGS AT POTUS:As we previously reported: A protester on Tuesday shouted  Treason!  at President Trump and threw mini Russian flags at him as he arrived for a meeting with Senate Republicans: The unhinged left is at it again They only make themselves look like lunatics when they pull stunts like this:A protester threw Russian flags at President Trump on Tuesday as he entered the GOP policy lunch.The protester could be heard shouting  Trump is treason  as the president walked by.Random guy threw Russian flags at Trump and shouted  Trump is treason  pic.twitter.com/stVfDOtMAB  a da ch vez (@aidachavez_) October 24, 2017 Why are you talking about tax cuts when you should be talking about treason?  the man could be heard shouting in videos.He was later identified as Americans Take Action s Ryan Clayton.Clayton is known for expressing his anti-Trump views by tossing Russia flags.

Still unclear is how Clayton may have gotten into the press area, as security was extremely tight.Trump is huddling with Senate Republicans Tuesday on Capitol Hill in hopes of finding party unity.Republicans are in broad agreement about the need to pass tax reform, but are struggling to get on the same page as they begin a debate over legislation.THE IRONY IS THAT IT S THE CLINTONS AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE DEEP INTO RUSSIA:Devin Nunes just announced a probe into the Uranium One Deal that smells to high heaven of corruption and money laundering by the Clintons and the Obama administration:BREAKING: Devin Nunes announces probe into the #UraniumOneDeal. pic.twitter.com/c7p9mVdTYa  Based Monitored   (@BasedMonitored) October 24, 2017FBN S LOU DOBBS SPOKE WITH THE AUTHOR OF  CLINTON CASH :  Biggest scandal in the history of American politics While speaking with Peter Schweizer, the author of  Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,  and Breitbart News senior editor-at-large on Friday, Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs argued that the Uranium One deal could end up being the biggest scandal in the history of American politics.Dobbs said,  There is no clear statement as to why we would give up, for any reason, any price, 20% of our uranium in this country. And that is a question that is left open still unanswered. and secondly, have you ever heard of anyone putting $145 million, at one moment, into the hands of the Clinton foundation?

9588,SICK OF HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS and PERVERTS? Here’s Your Chance To Support Hollywood CONSERVATIVES In NEW Movie “Let There Be Light” That President Trump Just Tweeted About [VIDEO],"Actor Kevin Sorbo and his wife, actress Sam Sorbo, are an anomaly in Hollywood. Both of them are committed conservatives who are dedicated to raising their children with values and morals, and most importantly, they put their faith first in all aspects of their lives. Kevin and Sam Sorbo are the real deal. If you re sick and tired of reading about the rampant sexual abuse that appears to be the norm in Hollywood, and watching leftist actors and comedians using severed heads of President Trump to get a laugh, perhaps their new movie  Let Their Be Light , that opens in theaters tomorrow, is the movie you ve been waiting for. At a time when Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood elites face growing accusations of sexual impropriety, Sean Hannity has emerged as a film producer eager to see more family-friendly films that don t shy from upholding Judeo-Christian values. In fact, for Mr. Hannity, the timing couldn t be better. I think the old paradigm of Hollywood is crumbling right in front of our eyes,  Mr. Hannity said during a phone interview with The Washington Times.  We re on the cutting edge of getting ahead of this because the demand has been there, and [producers] have had no desire to fulfill it. That is, except for most independent filmmakers like Mr. Hannity, who agreed to become an executive producer and fund most of the $3 million budget for  Let There Be Light,  a faith-based drama opening in theaters Thursday that stars Kevin Sorbo, known for  Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. He s the best executive producer anybody could ever ask for,  Mr. Sorbo said of Mr. Hannity.  He said,  Here s the money. Go make the movie and show me when you re done.In the film, which Mr. Sorbo also directed, he plays Dr. Sol Harkens, a famous book-writing atheist who, while living for the crowd s roars of approval while skewering Christians in packed debates, also struggles with loneliness, the death of his young son and the leery attitudes of his two remaining sons, who are being raised by his Christian ex-wife, Katy, who is portrayed by Mr. Sorbo s own wife, Sam Sorbo.The executive producer of the  Let Their Be Light  movie, Sean Hannity tweeted about the Sorbo s movie: Let There Be Light  opens THIS FRIDAY! Locations listed at https://t.co/9hkyEX1UVi https://t.co/NxlxjswYJG  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 26, 2017President Trump retweeted Sean Hannity s tweet about the  Let Their Be Light  movie, and said that Hannity s movie will be  another Sean success! Will be another Sean success! https://t.co/SlNTENvJLA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2017The couple s two sons also feature in  Let There Be Light. Sean Hannity interviewed the very talented Sorbo family recently, and asked them what it was like for their family to work together to make the movie:After Miss Sorbo first came up with the idea for the film, she approached veteran screenwriter Dan Gordon ( The Hurricane,   Wyatt Earp ), who agreed to co-write the script with her. A random contact from Mr. Hannity led to his immediately bankrolling the film. Sean Hannity, kind of out of the blue, called my husband and said,  I want to do a faith-based movie, and I want to work with you,  Miss Sorbo recalled.Not long after, Mr. Hannity, who juggles two full-time jobs in radio and TV, found himself in a pitch meeting in New York with the Sorbos and Mr. Gordon. Twenty minutes later, he cut them a check.Here s a sneak peek at the movie  Let There Be Light : It s better than I ever dreamed it could be in terms of the quality, the acting and the cinematic value,  Mr. Hannity said.  I think with all that s happening out in Hollywood, there might be an opportunity here to make more of these independent films that people will go see, and that s why I wanted to lend my name to it.   For entire story: Washington Times Sam Sorbo is an awesome actress, a loving wife, an amazing mom who homeschools her children and we re proud to call her our friend. If you d like to know more about homeschooling your kids, Sam has written one of the best books on the market on the subject of how to be a successful homeschooling mom or dad.

9592,DISNEY HAS A DISTURBING SURPRISE For Kids Who Watch Their Top-Rated Show Targeted At Kids 6-14 Yrs Old,"The Walt Disney Company   the same group that s so woke, they once apologized for drawing a fat cartoon that made race-baiters mad   has taken it upon themselves to teach your kids about LGBT rights by featuring their first on-screen gay character.According to this, Disney plans to have one of the main characters on their popular tween show Andi Mack come out as  gay  in this week s episode. Oh   and it s a 13-year-old boy who s got feelings for the main character s crush.Of course, the character s coming out as gay doesn t to do with moving the plotline forward so much as it pushes the pro-LBGT agenda the media are determined to cram down your throat   or, if that fails, your kid s. Andi Mack is a story about  tweens  figuring out who they are,  said Disney Channel in a statement.  (Creator) Terri Minsky, the cast and everyone involved in the show takes great care in ensuring that it s appropriate for all audiences and sends a powerful message about inclusion and respect for humanity. Producers say the  coming out  scene will have the barely-a-teenager telling a friend about his feelings for a boy at school. His friend will tell him it s A-O.K. and perfectly natural for guys to like guys, because Disney s all about creating a brainwashing  supportive  atmosphere. The company added they consulted with several outside advocacy groups to make sure the scene was  age-appropriate  and sufficiently inclusive, including gay activist groups GLAAD and PFLAG, along with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and Common Sense Media.Groups that would ve likely had a different opinion about teaching pre-pubescent elementary school kids the importance of being gay didn t make the list.According to ratings data, the median age of Andi Mack s viewers is 10. In fact, the show is the Disney channel s No. 1-rated program among kids six-14. Because nothing says  inclusivity  like teaching six-year-olds about being gay, whether their parents like it or not.

9594,DNC CHAIR PEREZ Says Trump ‘Didn’t Win’…Decides To Rewrite Constitution Without Electoral College…,"DNC chairman Tom Perez decided to create his own reality during a speech on Tuesday. This is such a Democrat thing they love to make up a false narrative and push it over and over to the sheeple who follow them. It s really pitiful that after so many months that all the Democrats have is this lie The electoral college is a brilliant creation because it gives balance to voters Would you want California and New York deciding our elections? That s what would happen without the electoral college. We bet that Perez already knows this but is counting on the uneducated voters to buy into it .Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez incorrectly stated  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution  during a Tuesday night speech.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));DNC Chair Tom Perez incorrectly claims  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution Posted by Fox & Friends on Friday, October 27, 2017 The Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution,  Perez said during a lecture at Indiana University Law School.  It doesn t have to be there. The Electoral College, a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states, is clearly laid out in Article II of the Constitution:  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress. Perez has previously stated that President Donald Trump  didn t win  last November s election because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote:Following his comment, Perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a  national popular vote compact,  in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. There s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says, we will allocate our vote, our electoral votes, to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 170 electoral votes do the same,  Perez said.  I m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was Maryland. The main supporters of the plan put forward by Perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the Constitution, not an argument that the system doesn t exist.The comment from Perez came during a lecture honoring former Indiana Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh, who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said Bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine. VIA: WFBOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH THE CLUELESS LEFT!   If the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.   The Electoral College remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the Constitution empowered it to select presidents. Though occasionally maligned, this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the American people.The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College after much debate and compromise, but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents. Though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency, that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections: 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000.Some see the Electoral College as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few, select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the United States. Others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large ones.Every four years, around election time, there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct, national popular vote.The Founders  CollegeAs one of The Heritage Foundations legal experts, Hans von Spakovsky, noted in a paper on the Electoral College:  In creating the basic architecture of the American government, the Founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule. Some elements of the Electoral College, such as the indirect vote through intermediaries, were hotly debated at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. It was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal, traitor, or similar kind of heinous person. The Founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the American system, but they feared a kind of pure, unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the past.The product of the Founders  compromise has been well balanced and enduring, and we would be wise to leave it intact.Alexander Hamilton defended the Electoral College in Federalist 68. He argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president, but it was also  desirable  that  the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. Hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability, and that an     intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. As students of ancient history, the Founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy, and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch, they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people. The Electoral College was a compromise, neither fully democratic nor aristocratic.The Constitution states:Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress.In addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule, the Founding Fathers attempted to create a  federalist  system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities. America s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states, not just the American people as an undifferentiated mass.The total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the District of Columbia included after the passage of the 23rd Amendment adds up to 538. The winner must receive a majority, or 270, of these votes to become president.The system empowers states, especially smaller ones, because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers. Farmers in Iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in New York. A more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into account.The states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors. In the early days of the republic, most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors, rather than the people. But, over time, the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead. Every state has opted for popular election at least since the Civil War.Calls to AbolishModern opponents of the Electoral College argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution, criticizing both the intermediary electors and the state-by-state system of voting.Calls to fundamentally change the Electoral College reached a peak after Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore in the tightly contested 2000 election. Gore narrowly won the national popular vote, and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the Supreme Court stepping in was unfair.One organization, National Popular Vote, has worked toward eliminating the Electoral College through an amendment to the Constitution or a state compact. National Popular Vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in  swing states  rather than campaigning for votes across the entire country.This plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support, but Heritage s von Spakovsky has called it bad policy, based on mistaken assumptions. Swing states, he wrote,  can change from election to election, and many states that are today considered to be reliably  blue  or  red  in the presidential race were recently unpredictable. Many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote. Those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national vote.But this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers. Swing states change over time, and the 2016 election could be a prime example of swing-state unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political map.Additionally, if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.FINALLY ARE THE DEMOCRATS PROUD OF THIS DISGUSTING MAN WHO CURSES AND LIES?Read more: Daily Signal",0

Sadly, the children of these parents who are so consumed by hate, that they behave like schoolyard bullies, are going to be the ones who pay the price in the end Kids tossing bean bags at a mock tombstone for President Trump at a public school was a  despicable  display of dirty politics the adults forced on the unwitting children, a Gloucester Republican official said, as the furor continued to grow.School officials have apologized for a parent-teacher organization fundraiser last week at West Parish Elementary School   but one GOP official fears the damage is already done.

9597,BREAKING: BROTHER Of Las Vegas Massacre Suspect Has Been ARRESTED In California,"By now, most of America has seen the crazy video of the Las Vegas mass shooter s brother Eric Paddock. Stephen Paddock s brother Eric, defended his brother, by arguing that he was wealthy and that somehow because he was generous to him and his mother, (which he bragged about ad nauseam) that people should consider looking at his brother in a different light.Watch this compilation of Stephen Paddock s brother Eric Paddock s strangest moments during the interview:The family of the alleged mass murderer Stephen Paddock is very interesting, to say the least. Stephen s father was listed on the FBI s  Most Wanted  list, and now, it appears, there s another alleged criminal in the Paddock family.A brother of Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock was arrested in Los Angeles on Wednesday on suspicion of possessing hundreds of images of child pornography, according to authorities.Bruce Douglas Paddock, 58, was taken into custody at a nursing facility in the 5300 block of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, in the Valley Village neighborhood, and booked at 8 a.m. Television news footage showed Paddock in a wheelchair being loaded into the back of a van by Los Angeles Police Department officers.Documents filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court outlined 20 criminal charges against Paddock, all related to possession of child pornography or the sexual exploitation of children. The felony complaint for the arrest warrant accused Paddock of having more than 600 pornographic images of children or youths, including 10 or more images showing a child younger than 12.The investigation of Paddock began after evidence was found in a Sun Valley business where he had been squatting, the LAPD said in a statement. The evidence was found after Paddock was evicted, police said.Paddock was homeless at the time and couldn t be found, the LAPD said, adding that investigations  recently  tracked him to the North Hollywood facility where he was arrested Wednesday.The LAPD released a photo of Paddock  in case there may be victims of unreported incidents,  who might see it and contact authorities, the department said.Josh Rubenstein, an LAPD spokesman, said Paddock s arrest was the result of an independent investigation by the LAPD and not related to the deadly shooting rampage in Las Vegas. The LAPD s case began before the shooting, he added. There s no connection,  he said.On the night of Oct. 1, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock fired on the crowd at a country music festival from his hotel room in Las Vegas. Paddock killed 58 people in the meticulously planned attack and wounded hundreds more before he shot and killed himself. His motivation remains a mystery, authorities say.On Wednesday, Sandra Breault, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Las Vegas, declined to comment on Bruce Paddock s arrest.Bruce Paddock was apprehended at a nursing home that offers patients long- and short-term medical care. A spokeswoman for the facility confirmed the police activity occurred there, but declined to comment on Paddock, citing patient privacy laws.The suspect is one of four brothers. Their father, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was a convicted bank robber who was once placed on the FBI s Most Wanted list.Bruce Paddock has had numerous run-ins with local law enforcement over the last 25 years, according to Los Angeles County criminal records.

9598,MAD MAXINE Doubles Down On Threats Against Trump: His Supporters Are The KKK [Video],"U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters attacked President Trump about 27 seconds into her speech to  homeless LGBTQ youth  at the Ali Forney Center in New York City earlier this month.She began her speech with:  Wow, what a moving evening this is. I m sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight,  she said, pumping her fist as the crowd roared with approval.On Monday, Waters offered no apologies for her promise to  take out  Trump during an interview with CNN s  New Day,  and instead doubled down on her commitment to impeach the president. Those words have been interpreted as an attempt on the president s life,  CNN s Chris Cuomo told Waters.  How did you intend them? That s absolutely ridiculous, nobody believes that,  Waters said.  A 79-year-old grandmother who is a congresswoman and who has been in Congress and politics for all these years talking about doing any harm. The only harm I may be doing to the president is I want him impeached,  Waters said.She alleged the folks who oppose her efforts to unseat the president, and the people who want her out of office, are racists. And those people who are so opposed to my leadership on impeachment are organizing the right wing, the white nationals, the KKK, they have organized an effort to try and, of course, defeat me in my election coming up and to discredit me,  Waters said. Everybody knows that I m on the front lines not talking about any physical harm to anybody, but I am talking about impeachment and I m not going to stop. She then went on to name all the reasons she hates Trump, though none of them include a legal justification for removing the president. I believe this president is not worthy,  she said.  I believe this president should not be representing our country. He has alienated our allies. He continues to lie, day in and day out. He creates controversy. He can t get along with the members of Congress. He needs to be impeached. I want him impeached. And I m going to continue my efforts to call for his impeachment. Cuomo pointed out that Waters  comments represent  ugly talk,  and questioned whether those who oppose Trump should  be the change that you want to see and have   a high level of decency in how you discuss those whom you want to criticize, especially when it s the president of the United States. Waters alleged she s been  extremely responsible in laying out the case for why this president should be impeached. The problem is racists, she said. I know that the right wing, the white nationalists, all of those who have organized around this president, do not like this. And people are not accustomed to a woman, in particular an African American woman, taking this kind of leadership,  she said.  How dare me challenge the president of the United States, but we have never witnessed a president who has been as irresponsible and as dangerous as this president. And I think that we need to step up to the plate and tell the truth and speak truth to power and that s what I m doing and that s what I m going to continue to do. Waters has used every platform available to her to continue her crusade against President Trump It s only making her look totally unhinged.",0
9599,ABC NEWS REPORTS: Las Vegas Massacre Suspect’s Hard Drive Is MISSING From His Laptop,"The investigation into the Las Vegas massacre Stephen Paddock just keeps getting more and more strange. Since the shooting massacre that took the lives of 59, and injured hundreds of others in Las Vegas at the Rt. 91 country music festival, we ve seen several timeline changes, a lockdown of the Las Vegas coroner s office, a very strange protection around the  security guard  at the Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort, including an armed guard and a scripted appearance on the Ellen Show. And now like some of the most well-known mass shooters before him, Stephen Paddock s hard drive is missing ?ABC News  A laptop computer recovered from the Las Vegas hotel room where Stephen Paddock launched the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was missing its hard drive, depriving investigators of a potential key source of information on why he killed and maimed so many people, ABC News has learned.Paddock is believed to have removed the hard drive before fatally shooting himself, and the missing device has not yet been recovered, sources told ABC News.Investigators digging into Paddock s background also learned he purchased software designed to erase files from a hard drive, but without the hard drive to examine it is impossible to know if he ever used the software, one source said.The absence of substantial digital clues has left investigators struggling to piece together what triggered Paddock to kill 58 innocent concertgoers and injure more than 500 others on Oct. 1.Did Paddock remove the hard drive or is there something more to this story? Is there some connection to evidence being removed from laptops or cell phones from suspects of 3 of the most well-known mass shooting cases in America?According to ABC News (who dismisses this curious evidence as a casual coincidence):In 2007, Virginia Tech shooter Cho Seung Huiremoved the hard drive of his computer and disposed of his cell phone shortly before the massacre. Authorities even searched a pond for the missing digital media, but the devices were never recovered.The 2008 Northern Illinois shooter, Steven Kazmierczak, removed the SIM card from his phone and the hard drive from his laptop, and neither was recovered.In 2012, Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza had removed the hard drive from his computer and smashed it with a hammer or screwdriver.

9600,"GUESS WHO’S TRYING To Tie Amnesty For Nearly 800,000 ILLEGALS To End-of-Year Spending Deal? TWO HINTS: It’s Not A Democrat and He Has A Huge Wall Around His Home","Hey, Paul do you hear that huge sucking sound? That s the sound of arrogant elected officials sprinting from Washington DC, like US Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Bob Corker (R-TN), as they watch polling numbers confirm their worst fears that they have no chance of being re-elected.  Americans are no longer willing to wait around for you to do the right thing.  We re holding every member of Congress accountable. If you re not working in the best interests of America and the American worker, you ll be drained from the swamp Breitbart   House Speaker Paul Ryan s closed-door announcement of slipping amnesty for nearly 800,000 illegal aliens covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program into an end-of-the-year spending deal comes less than a month after a DACA recipient has been accused of murder.Ryan, according to members of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), is planning to put together a spending deal that includes giving amnesty to the DACA illegal aliens, as Breitbart News reported. He did talk about the fact that that would be good if we could get ahead of that as opposed to being reactionary,  RSC Chairman Mark Walker (R-NC) told the HuffPost following the meeting with Ryan.Two House Republicans confirmed to the HuffPost that Ryan mentioned at the gathering slipping DACA amnesty into the spending deal.Ryan s leaking of a secret plan to attach amnesty to a spending bill comes less than a month after Breitbart News confirmed that a DACA recipient allegedly murdered a high school student in South Carolina.Voters need to ask Ryan why he s so determined to allow nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who are protected by DACA, many of whom were not children when they illegally crossed our borders, and are in fact, members of  violent gangs like MS-13, or who have a criminal history in the U.S. but are protected by sanctuary cities or counties. Paul Ryan has a huge wall around his personal residence in Wisconsin however, to keep the  bad hombres  out.As Breitbart News s photographic documentation reveals, Ryan s home is surrounded by a tall border fence reinforced by equally high bushes  ensuring both privacy and security. Moreover, the fence is manned by an on-duty agent who guards his property s perimeter. Upon even the slightest appearance of any unusual activity  such as a 5 2  female taking a photograph of the fence  Ryan s border agent will deploy into action to ensure the perimeter s sovereignty.Daniel De Jesus Rangel Sherrer, 19, was one of the nearly 800,000 illegal aliens shielded from deportation and given a work permit under DACA, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) confirmed to Breitbart Texas.Sherrer was charged in connection with the murder of 18-year-old Diana Martinez-Gonzalez, who was found shot to death in a wooded area in the town of Easley, South Carolina.Sherrer is now facing first-degree murder charges, and if he is released from prison at any time, he will be deported.Last week it was also reported that a 5-time deported, illegal alien, Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, was arrested on suspicion of intentionally starting the wildfires that ravaged through Sonoma County.

9602,TV EXECUTIVES In Discussion About CANCELLING Thursday Night NFL Games,"Capitalism at work. It s funny how the loss of real money has a way of helping to remind NFL owners and the networks who support them, who are writing the checks. One hint it s not the guys disrespecting our flag.Network executives are scrambling to solve the growing problem of crashing ratings for the National Football League, by cutting games to end the perceived  over-saturation  of football on TV.To put an end to the sliding ratings, the executives are proposing that fewer games may be the ticket to stop that  over-saturation,  with one idea being to cut Thursday Night Football by a whopping ten games.The idea to trim Thursday Night Football from 18 games a season to only eight was first reported by Sports Business Journal and was part of a plan to reverse the ratings crash that also includes pulling games played in the U.K. back to 1 PM eastern time (6PM London time).Indeed the amount of football on TV has exploded in the last decade.Ratings are still down despite the small rise seen in Week 7. NBC Sports is off 21 percent from 2015, CBS Sports is down 14 percent compared to 2015, and ESPN s Monday Night Football has sunk 17 percent over 2015. -BreitbartRasmussen reports that nearly one-third (32 percent) of adults say they re less likely to watch NFL game telecasts because of the Kaepernick-led player protests against racial injustice. The telephone/online survey of 1,000 American adults was conducted Oct. 2-3.This letter from a die-hard Pittsburg Steelers fan hits the nail on the head, as it relates to how NFL fans feel about the players who continue to disrespect our flag: I want to thank you for freeing up my Sundays. Some of the earliest memories of my life are watching Steelers games with my dad. I was once a season-ticket holder. I have occasionally missed a few games on TV through the years due to scheduling conflicts, but I can honestly say in my 44 years of living, I have never intentionally turned off a Steelers game. That changed today. As I sat down to watch the Steelers-Bears game today, I learned from the sideline reporter that the Steelers chose not to participate in the national anthem. I realize that there is a lot of injustice in our country. I realize that there are a lot of people upset at the current administration. I realize that we live in a free country where people have the freedom to not participate in the national anthem. I also have the freedom to not spend another minute or dollar on your product. I am of the opinion that this is quite possibly the worst way to go about  protesting.  If you want to hold a rally at Heinz Field to allow your players to voice their opinions, that would be fine. If you want all the Steelers and NFL players to march on Washington D.C., fine. But to not participate in the national anthem is an insult to every serviceman who has served or has passed away defending this country. If you are truly that unhappy with the country, feel free to play for the CFL. So thank you, Steelers and NFL, for freeing up my Sundays. I will no longer waste my time or money watching your product. The weather today the in Pittsburgh area is beautiful and I can not think of a better day to spend it outside, away from the TV.

Russia collusion was with Dems in 2016 election. #MAGA #DTS pic.twitter.com/4OnuUx01lB  Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) October 25, 2017A Republican had contracted first with Fusion GPS, and Clinton and the DNC continued to fund Fusion GPS s work, the report says.According to the Post:Mark Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community  Before that agreement, Fusion GPS s research into Trump was funded by a still unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.So, who is that  still unknown Republican ? Could it be Senator John McCain, the petty and spiteful sworn emeny of Donald Trump? What about his admission in January 2017, that he was the one who passed along the dossier of claims of a Russian blackmail plot against the president-elect? McCain called it doing  what any citizen should do .McCain   a longstanding anti-Trump Republican who had disassociated himself from the candidate s campaign weeks before the election   cast himself as an innocent and concerned member of the public as he justified his move.He claimed he had no idea whether it was accurate or not   but that he believed the FBI should have it because it was  sensitive . I did what any citizen should do. I received sensitive information and handed it to the FBI,  he told CNN   the network which broke the story that the document existed. It was then published in full by Buzzfeed. The Arizona senator issued a public statement amid mounting questions of his exact role in the affair   and how a document riddled with errors and unverifiable claims came to be published. Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,  he said. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue. But the 2008 Republican loser, who disowned his party s candidate weeks before the election, may have been far more intimately involved than that.  Daily MailThe Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.The  Russian dossier,  whose contents Trump has denied and which has been widely discredited, is believed to have led the FBI to investigate the Trump campaign and several Trump associates.Until now, Fusion GPS has continued to refuse to cooperate with congressional panels investigating Russian attempts to intervene in the election, and how the Obama administration probed those efforts. Democrats have also protected the company.The revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were involved in procuring the salacious accusations against Trump that fed their own later accusations of Russian interference in the election lends credence to those who, like Trump himself, have regarded the Russia accusations as conspiracy theories.

9608,BREAKING: Russia Backfires! Clinton Campaign and DNC Busted In Huge Discovery On Fake Salacious Trump Dossier,"Wow! The left-leaning Washington Post just broke this big story:Clinton Corruption- WaPo reports DNC & Clinton paid for debunked Trump Dossier. Russia collusion was with Dems in 2016 election. #MAGA #DTS pic.twitter.com/4OnuUx01lB  Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) October 25, 2017The Washington Post just revealed:The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump s connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin, people familiar with the matter said.Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. UNKNOWN REPUBLICAN CLIENT Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS s research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary. The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.Fusion GPS gave Steele s reports and other research documents to Elias, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele. One person close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS s role.The dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump campaign s possible connections to Russia. Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier.THANKS TO TRUMP S PRESSURE, THE TRUTH CAME OUT:Trump tweeted as recently as Saturday that the Justice Department and FBI should  immediately release who paid for it. Elias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement. Spokesmen for the Clinton campaign and the DNC had no immediate comment.Some of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, telling the research firm that it was released from a  client-confidentiality obligation. The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPS s bank records.People involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the cost.Read more: WaPo",0
9609,CNN’S DRAMA QUEEN HOST Tears Up After Reading Letter To Trump On-Air [Video],"CNN s Don Lemon gave an OSCAR-worthy performance on air when he teared up after reading his  open letter  to President Trump in response to Trump s tweet attempting to respond to charges from the widow of a fallen soldier who was killed in Niger earlier this month. Lemon is further politicizing the phone call from President Trump to the widow. Shame on him.Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, said on  Good Morning America  that Trump s condolence call made her  cry even worse.  She added that Trump  couldn t remember my husband s name. President Trump responded to Myeshia Johnson s account on Twitter, writing,  I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation! Johnson s interview and Trump s subsequent tweet led Lemon to write Trump an open letter, which read in part:Your tweet this morning essentially called her a liar.Mr. Trump, please stop it. Please stop!Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way.I know you have children and two daughters.Can you imagine Ivanka or Tiffany in Myeshia s shoes?Having a fight with the commander in chief while they are pregnant and grieving?If Myeshia Johnson is mad at you, take it.Just as President Bush and others did.Take it.It s part of what YOU signed up for when you decided to descend that escalator and throw your hat in the ring for president.You re commander in chief, the president of the United States of America, the greatest country on Earth.Act like it.Act like you know that you re big enough not to have to win every fight or respond to every criticism.Act like you know where the high road is.Confident and secure people ask for help, and for forgiveness.Insecure people think they know everything and need no help.Lemon went on to call La David Johnson a  hero  and said that he is a  role model  to him as an  awesome soldier, a great man, and a great American. After Lemon read his open letter, he introduced a CNN panel but had to stop for a few seconds to compose himself after he appeared to be crying. Sorry, I m sorry,  Lemon said.",0
9610,ZING! SARAH SANDERS Calls Out Sen. Bob Corker For ‘Grandstanding’ [Video],"Sarah Sanders hit back at Senator Corker today:  Imagine progress that could be made if Corker cooperated instead of grandstanded This isn t the first time Sanders has admonished Senator Corker. In August of this year, Sanders responded to comments against President Trump by Corker: White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ripped Republican Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker s questioning of Trump s  stability  and  competence  on Thursday, calling Corker s claim  ridiculous and outrageous. Corker, who has been one of the more supportive voices of Trump in the Senate, raised questions about Trump s competence last week in the wake of the president s comments on the violence in Charlottesville. He recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of our nation   what has made it great and what it is today. He s got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that. Without those things happening, our nation is going to go through great peril,  Corker said of Trump. The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful   and our nation and our world needs for him to be successful, whether you are Republican or Democrat,  Corker added.Asked about Corker s claim at the White House press briefing, Sanders kept her answer brief. I think that s a ridiculous and outrageous claim and doesn t dignify a response from this podium,  Sanders said.Via: Daily Caller",0
9611,RINO SENATOR FLAKE Trashes Trump and Republican Party On Way Out [Video],"The swamp is draining One more RINO is not running for reelection. Senator Jeff Flake announced he will not run again today in a vindictive speech against President Trump and Republicans. Hey, the guy was even thinking of running as an Independent what does that tell you? He s NOT a conservative! He mentioned in his speech that he couldn t support Trump s policies on trade and immigration. Well, those two policies are what got Trump elected!FLAKE WAS 26 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS:The bombshell, which Flake, R-Ariz., detailed Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor, will further roil Republican hopes of keeping the party s 52-seat Senate majority in the midterm elections of Trump s first term, when the president s party historically loses seats in Congress.It also likely will upend the race for Flake s seat.Flake, one of the Senate s more prominent critics of President Donald Trump, has been struggling in the polls.A GRANDSTANDING AND VINDICTIVE SPEECH:He told The Arizona Republic ahead of his announcement that he has become convinced  there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party. Flake said he has not  soured on the Senate  and loves the institution, but that as a traditional, libertarian-leaning conservative Republican he is out of step with today s Trump-dominated GOP. This spell will pass, but not by next year,  Flake said.Among Republican primary voters, there s overwhelming support for Trump s positions and  behavior,  Flake said, and one of their top concerns is whether a candidate is with the president or against him. While Flake said he is with Trump on some issues, on other issues he is not. And Trump definitely views him as a foe, having denounced Flake publicly and called him  toxic  on Twitter. Here s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I m not willing to take, and that I can t in good conscience take,  Flake told The Republic in a telephone interview.  It would require me to believe in positions I don t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone. LAURA INGRAHAM COULDN T HAVE SAID IT BETTER:Flake was for the disastrous Trans Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, open immig, blanket amnesty and had Hillary won, he'd be happy today.  Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 24, 2017As of Sept. 30, Flake s campaign had $3.4 million on hand. He has continued to raise money   as recently as Thursday, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice headlined a fundraiser for him in Arizona.Flake said he has ruled out running as an independent rather than a Republican, saying he didn t think that was a viable strategy. He also said he has  no intention  of making a presidential run.SENATE RACE HEATS UP:Kelli Ward, the former state senator from Lake Havasu City who lost her primary challenge last year against Sen. John McCain, has emerged this year as the top GOP alternative to Flake, but other names have been mentioned as possibilities: Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham and Arizona Board of Regents member Jay Heiler. Lesser-known Republicans Craig Brittain and Nicholas Tutora also have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are running.But Flake s exit is sure to prompt bigger Arizona Republican names to take a fresh look at the GOP Senate race.Steve Bannon, Trump s controversial former White House strategist, has embraced Ward as part of his national  open revolt  against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the GOP establishment. But other Republicans have warned that Ward is a weak candidate whose nomination would jeopardize GOP chances of holding Arizona s Senate seat.The winner of the Aug. 28 Republican primary could face Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., considered the front-runner in her the Democratic Senate primary.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised Flake as  one of the finest human beings I ve met in politicsFlake publicly announced his intentions in a Senate floor speech that began around noon Arizona time.In a copy of prepared remarks released to The Republic before his speech, Flake gave a blistering critique of the  coarseness of our national dialogue  that has defined the Trump era, saying it should never become accommodated as a  the new normal.

And that is a question that is left open still unanswered. and secondly, have you ever heard of anyone putting $145 million, at one moment, into the hands of the Clinton foundation? And the answer is, of course not. These questions, most basic and fundamental, were armed by the very committee made up of the very agencies, departments, and individuals responsible for national security. this, this is the biggest Obama scandal. I think it may well turn out to be the biggest scandal in American political history. ",0
9613,BOOM! PRESIDENT TRUMP’S National Park Service CANCELS Taxpayer Funding For Project Honoring Violent Black Panther’s Group That Killed Park Ranger,"Beyonce made an attempt to glorify the violent Black Panther s group during her NFL Superbowl halftime show in 2015. Former President Barack Obama once marched with the New Black Panthers while campaigning for president in Selma, AL in March, 2007. The photographs, captured from a Flickr photo-sharing account before it was scrubbed, are the latest evidence of the mainstream media s failure to examine Obama s extremist ties and radical roots.The National Park Service told the Washington Free Beacon it is no longer providing funding for a controversial project  honoring the legacy  of the Black Panther Party after outrage that the agency would spend taxpayer dollars to memorialize a group that murdered a park ranger in the 1970s.The Free Beacon revealed last month that the Park Service gave roughly $100,000 to the University of California, Berkeley for a research project on the Marxist extremist group to  memorialize a history that brought meaning to lives far beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. A captain in the Black Panther Party murdered National Park Service ranger Kenneth Patrick while he was on patrol near San Francisco in 1973. Patrick was shot three times by Veronza Leon Curtis Bowers Jr., who is currently serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. Patrick left behind a widow and three children.The Fraternal Order of Police, the largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers with over 330,000 members, sent a letter to President Donald Trump last week expressing  outrage and shock  that the National Park Service would fund a project honoring the legacy of the Black Panther Party. Mr. President, as far as we are concerned the only meaning they brought to any lives was grief to the families of their victims,  wrote Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police.  According to our research, members of this militant anti-American group murdered 16 law enforcement officers over the course of their history. Among their victims was U.S. Park Ranger Kenneth C. Patrick. He was murdered in cold blood by three members of the Black Panther Party on 5 August 1973. His killer, who remains behind bars, still considers himself a Black Panther and a  political prisoner.' It is appalling that the National Park Service, Ranger Patrick s own agency, now proposes to partner with [Berkeley] and two active members of this violent and repugnant organization,  Canterbury said.The FBI labels the Black Panther Party as advocates for  the use of violence and guerilla tactics to overthrow the U.S. government. At a time when many in our nation feel strongly that memorials to aspects of the darker times in our history be removed from public lands, why would the NPS seek to commemorate the activities of an extremist separatist group that advocated the use of violence against our country a country they perceived as their enemy?  Canterbury asked.  This is a despicable irony and we hope you can bring it to an end by halting [the grant] immediately. ",0
9614,ELIZABETH “Fauxchahontas” WARREN CAUGHT LYING Again…This Time About Sexual Harassment,"Serial liar and 2020 Democrat presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren just can t help herself. In an effort to try to make herself relevant and in what seems like a desperate attempt to address her irrelevancy, Warren appears to have made up a sick story of sexual harassment at the hands of a law professor at Harvard University.After her account about what happened with the now deceased Harvard law professor on Meet the Press, the Boston Herald called out the senator, who has a history of lying. In 1997, Elizabeth Warren was listed as the Harvard Law s  first woman of color  in a law review piece on diversity and affirmative action.Elizabeth Warren pushed back hard on questions about a Harvard Crimson piece in 1996 that described her as Native American, saying she had no idea the school where she taught law was billing her that way and saying it never came up during her hiring a year earlier, which others have backed up.But a 1997 Fordham Law Review piece described her as Harvard Law School s  first woman of color,  based, according to the notes at the bottom of the story, on a  telephone interview with Michael Chmura, News Director, Harvard Law (Aug. 6, 1996). GPThe Boston Herald set the record straight about Warren s  new  account of  events with the now deceased law professor:U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren reportedly switched up her account of sexual harassment that she relayed this weekend in a televised #MeToo testimonial from an earlier  light-hearted  version .But the Boston Globe reported last night that Warren recounted the same incident in a  more light-hearted manner  at a memorial service after the professor s death in 1997   an account the Globe noted was  inconsistent  with her story on Sunday. During the service after his death in 1997, Warren spoke fondly of law professor Eugene Smith and told the gathered mourners she was laughing as Smith chased her around his desk, according to a colleague s memoir,  the Globe reported.The author of the memoir, John Mixon, told the paper,  I may have been wrong saying she was laughing,  adding that he was writing about the service 15 years after the fact.The paper also noted that Warren failed to mention on  Meet The Press  that Smith had polio.The Globe said Warren told the broadsheet yesterday she shared the story at the memorial service as a statement about Smith s authority. It was 20 years later, and he didn t have power over me any more,  Warren told the newspaper, which noted she was by then a Harvard law professor.",0
9615,LAWYER FOR FBI INFORMANT: My Client Knows What Russians Were Saying During Bribery of Clintons [VIDEO],"The lawyer for the FBI informant under a gag order that prevents him from going before Congress spoke out about what s to come with the Clinton/Russia Uranium story:Fox Business reported: An informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is under a gag order that prevents him from testifying before the United States Congress that Russian nuclear officials were involved in fraudulent dealings in 2009 before the Uranium One deal was approved.Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch blocked the informant from testifying last year and threatened criminal action against him if he were to do so.In an interview with FOX Business  Lou Dobbs, Victoria Toensing, the attorney representing the FBI informant, said she has never heard of a criminal penalty for breaching a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). If it does and it is unconstitutional and it s invalid, if it prohibits my client from giving information to the legislature, the executive cannot say to people,  Hey, you can t give information to another body of the government,  Toensing said.KEY POINTS: The Republican leadership was blocking the investigation into both Benghazi and the Russia uranium scandal involving Clinton.Senator Grassley called on Sessions to release the info on the gag order by November 1st This should be interesting.The NDA (gag order) is unconstitutional and Toensing says this type of gag order has a criminal penalty. She says she s never heard of this type of gag order.Victoria Toensing is one of the best lawyers in DC and will get to the bottom of this one way or another. The plot thickens on this one ",0
9616,FBI INFORMANT Has Video Evidence of Russian Efforts to Win Favor of Clintons in Uranium One Deal,"It s astonishing that after all of the fake Russia collusion on Trump, we have Hillary, Obama and others who are the real thugs dealing with Russia:SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE RUSSIA URANIUM DEAL:  Despite an ongoing criminal investigation into officials working for subsidiaries of Rosatom, the Russian government entity seeking to acquire ownership of U.S. uranium, the Obama Administration approved the deal. The Justice Department has reportedly threatened to prosecute the informant if he discloses details of his involvement in the investigation. The Executive Branch does not have the authority to use non-disclosure agreements to avoid Congressional scrutiny. If the FBI is allowed to contract itself out of Congressional oversight, it would seriously undermine our Constitutional system of checks and balances. The Justice Department needs to work with the Committee to ensure that witnesses are free to speak without fear, intimidation or retaliation from law enforcement. Witnesses who want to talk to Congress should not be gagged and threatened with prosecution for talking. If that has happened, senior DOJ leadership needs to fix it and release the witness from the gag order,  Grassley said.",0
9617,OFF HER ROCKER! MAXINE WATERS: Trump Has ‘Tendency to Talk Down to People of Color’ [Video],"Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) Monday accused President Donald Trump of having a tendency to target women and people of color for his ire.Waters spoke uninterrupted for almost four minutes on MSNBC s  The Beat  about the Trump Administration s handling of the aftermath of Army Sgt. La David Johnson s death in Niger. She called on Trump and his Chief of Staff John Kelly to apologize to widow Myeshia Johnson and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D., Fla.), going on to criticize Trump s disrespect for women and minorities in general. He seems to have this tendency to talk down to people of color, to treat them with disrespect, and I think this adds to it,  Waters said.  First of all, he called [Wilson] wacky. Secondly, that he didn t back down, that he simply talked about her in a way that was not respectful I think that yes, I think this adds to the suspicion of him and the way that he thinks about minorities and black people in particular. She said Kelly was also wrong in her criticism of Wilson s 2015 speech, and she said she had the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus in saying the Trump Administration needs to do more to respect black women. All of the women of the Congressional Black Caucus have come together and we re demanding an apology,  she said.  We re sick and tired of women being undermined, dismissed, and black women, in particular, being called names. Waters also criticized Trump s overall leadership. He has the most distorted leadership of any president I ve ever known or heard about,  Waters said.  Here he had the opportunity to make the condolence call, to do it properly, to recognize this family and their grieving, and also to know the name of the soldier who had been killed. It is so unconscionable in the way that he manages his leadership,  she added.Waters also said Kelly s credibility has been damaged. General Kelly has had a good career, and to have his career basically undermined by the president of the United States because he s trying to protect the president and stand up for the president when the president did not deserve to be stood up for, now he s damaged himself,  Waters said.  He needs to call the congresswoman and apologize. ",0

9619,BILL O’REILLY EMBARRASSES Megyn Kelly…Publishes Letters She Wrote Thanking Him For Being A “Dear Friend” and For “Years” of Support After She Bashed Him On Her Flailing NBC Morning Show [VIDEO],"Megyn Kelly is quite possibly the least popular host on television. She s also quite possibly one of the highest paid hosts on one of the lowest rated morning shows on television. In her desperate attempt to do just about anything for ratings, the very unlikeable host went after Fox News and the former top-rated host Bill O Reilly. Was Kelly s on-air letter an attempt to jump on Hollywood s anti-sexual harassment bandwagon? Was she hoping to endear herself to a more left-leaning audience, since she clearly has no hope of ever regaining the conservative fans she lost when she attacked then-candidate Trump during a FOX News hosted GOP primary presidential debate? The NBC News host made the reveal before welcoming former Fox News host and O Reilly accuser Juliet Huddy onto her Monday talk show.Former Fox News host Juliet Huddy spoke out for the first time about her accusations against Bill O Reilly and what women face when going up against a corporation on Monday s Megyn Kelly Today.During an opening segment about this weekend s report of new sexual harassment revelations against O Reilly, former Fox News host Kelly revealed that she, too, had complained about O Reilly s behavior. She said she understands the roadblocks women see when speaking out about sexual harassment, something an emotional Huddy explained as  You are just this one person about to go up against a machine. It s daunting and frightening and it holds you back from taking action sometimes. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that Huddy said O Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011 and that when she rebuffed his advances he tried to derail her career. Allegations included O Reilly calling Huddy repeatedly, sometimes sounding as if he were masturbating, and after asking her to return a key to his hotel room, he appeared at the door in his boxer shorts. In exchange for her agreement not to sue, she was paid a sum in the high six figures, though 21st Century Fox and O Reilly said her allegations were false.To open the show, Kelly made public for the first time a letter (below) she wrote to the co-presidents of Fox News about O Reilly, displaying the note she sent to Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy during the top of her show while discussing this weekend s Times report about a new sexual harassment settlement made by O Reilly. Fox News was not exactly a friendly environment for harassment victims who wanted to report, in my experience,  Kelly said.  However, O Reilly s suggestion that no one ever complained about his behavior is false. I know because I complained. Not so fast Megyn Bill O Reilly immediately revealed 2 handwritten letters from Megyn Kelly where she gushed all over him and how much she appreciated him on his website:My former FNC colleagues Megyn Kelly & Gretchen Carlson wrote me notes when we worked together. You can read them on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C  Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017Here are Kelly s letters to O Reilly: O Reilly even took it a step further and released a letter from sexual harassment accuser and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson:Here is Carlson s letter to O Reilly:Bill  Thank you for being the calm in the sea.Thank you so much for supporting me.Thank you for being my friend.It means the world to meGC[Gretchen Carlson]Megyn immediately got hammered on Twitter after O Reilly released her letters to him.

9620,"WORLD’S MOST POPULAR Search Engine Places FICTIONAL Story At Top Of News Feed:”Melania Trump is Lonely, Racist and Obsessed With Michelle Obama”","Google is the search engine the majority of people in the world go if they need to look up something. In fact, it is estimated that over 30 BILLION searches are performed on Google every month. Google now has a special feature for mobile users. When you go to search for a topic on Google, a news feed appears under the search bar, with what users expect to be the most popular current stories. But are they the most popular stories, or are they simply Google s contribution to the leftist propaganda machine? With all of the news breaking about Hillary s Uranium One deal with Russia, surely readers wouldn t expect to find some fictional story about Melania being a  racist ,  as the top story on Google s mobile newsfeed or would they?    Here s the story that appeared at the top of Google s news feed today:Newsweek: Melania Trump is lonely and obsessed with Michelle Obama. At least in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie s version of events anyway.The Nigerian author has penned a short story for the The New York Times  style magazine, T, which paints the first lady referred to throughout only as  Mrs T as the reluctant wife of the president who displays an unease with her political fame. And she s a little bit racist, too.Adichie s  micronovel,  Janelle Asked to the Bedroom, envisions a conversation between a forlorn Trump and her pilates instructor Janelle. The story was published on the Times website and on the T magazine Instagram page.In the short story, Janelle is unusually called to join Mrs T in her bedroom, rather than her home gym, and is surprised to find the first lady looking  disheveled, her manner distracted. Adichie s fictional account also portrays Trump as envious of her predecessor s natural ease in the role of first lady. Mrs T shows Janelle a video she s been watching on YouTube of Michelle Obama visiting a classroom. She also reveals a folder full of pictures of Obama on her laptop.  Look at this. I always look at them for the inspiration,  she says.In this fictional world, Mrs T s only source of joy comes from her 11-year-old son, Barron. The first lady perks up speaking to her son, who is described as  sweetly shy and polite, dependent on his mother for his sense of self. But Adichie s imagined Trump also exhibits a casual racism that her husband, President Donald Trump, is often accused of sharing.Mrs T makes a prejudicial remark when Janelle informs her that her son has been accepted to Harvard University.  He got scholarship to go?  she asks.  How automatic, this assumption of a scholarship, and Janelle knew she meant a scholarship not of smarts but of skin,  writes Adichie.Janelle Asked to the Bedroom follows an earlier, pre-election short story by Adichie, The Arrangements, also written for the Times.In that story, published in June 2016, Trump quietly doubts her husband s chances of winning the presidency. It also depicts a strained relationship between her and Donald Trump s children from previous marriages, particularly Ivanka Trump, whose close relationship with her husband she envies.Why would Google choose to put that ridiculous story of pure fiction about Melania, that claims she s a  racist  at the top of their newsfeed? Who, at Google is in charge of deciding which  news  stories will appear at the top of the feed? Let s take a look at the next two stories, following the fictional Melania smear story:The next most popular story on Google s  news  feed was about Hillary. The story wasn t about what is likely the biggest political scandal in American history, as a massive coverup that involves former Sec of State Hillary Clinton, Rober Mueller, Jim Comey, Barack Obama, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe and Bill Clinton, it was instead, about how the spies that Hillary helped to send back to Russia after the FBI caught them, were coming ever closer to her, while they were here in the U.S. spying. The next most popular story on Google s newsfeed was about the media s obsession with Rex Tillerson abandoning his post as Trump s Sec of State. Even though Tillerson has denied those claims, Google s third story in their line up was about who Tillerson s replacement will be:So, where s a reader to go when they re just looking for a list of top stories without the propaganda?

9621,ILLEGAL ALIENS Jump Over Border Fence as MSNBC Reports On Border Wall Construction [Video],"Oh the irony! Left-leaning MSNBC aired a segment about President Trump s proposed border wall, which ultimately proved the U.S.-Mexico border needs a bigger wall.HOW HIGH SHOULD WE GO? The Trump administration has approved the construction of eight prototypes of the border wall. These prototypes are nearing completion as the administration s deadline approaches. The prototypes have several guidelines they must satisfy. For instance, concrete walls have to be 30 ft. tall while walls made from alternate materials have to be 18 to 30 ft. tall.JUMPING THE FENCE MSNBC reporter Jacob Soboroff went to preview the prototypes that are being built between two existing border fences along the U.S.-Mexico border. During the segment, Soboroff was interviewing border patrol agent Roy Villareal when several migrants were caught on camera jumping the existing fence into the United States.EVERYDAY BORDER ENFORCEMENT = OPEN BORDERS  A small group of three people just jumped over in the middle of the day,  Soboroff noted.  So can you explain to me what s going on? This is the reality of everyday border enforcement. The United States is the draw for people with dire situations where they are at,  Villareal said.  We are going to continue to witness this. It plays out on a regular basis for us. Soboroff went to the Mexican side of the border and showed how easy it was to cross the border under current conditions.THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! Can you imagine how easy it s been for terrorists to cross?We just reported on a terrorist who made his way to Canada via Mexico and the U.S.: The Democrats are fighting against closing our border with Mexico at every step of the way. They want open borders It s that simple. If you vote for Democrats then you re voting for open borders. They have zero interest in stopping the flow of illegals to America. One of the key things to remember about open borders is it s not just the people from Mexico looking for a job or better life. The truth is that our open border has become a GLOBAL MAGNET for people from all over the world to come for many different reasons. One of the reasons is terrorism The case below highlights the desperate need for border control if we want to stop the flow of terrorists to America and Canada:The Somali terrorist who stabbed a Canadian police officer and ran over four pedestrians a few weeks ago entered the United States through the Mexican border and was released by Obama s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), allowing him to continue his journey north. The ISIS operative, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, was ordered deported, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman told various media outlets recently, but was released on an  order of supervision  and the feds never saw him again.Sharif entered the U.S. in 2011 through the San Ysidro port of entry in California without documentation and was briefly held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, a local newspaper reported. A year later he crossed the border into Canada and settled in Edmonton after being granted refugee status. On September 30 he slammed into an Edmonton police officer with his car then got out of the vehicle and repeatedly stabbed the cop with a knife. After fleeing the scene, Sharif stole a truck and deliberately mowed down four pedestrians. Canadian authorities found an ISIS flag in his car and have charged him with multiple counts of attempted murder, criminal flight causing bodily harm and possession of a weapon. Two years ago, Canadian authorities investigated the 30-year-old terrorist for espousing extremist views. It s disturbing that Sharif s northbound trek took him through the U.S.-Mexico border.As part of an ongoing investigation into cartels, corruption and terrorism, Judicial Watch has for years reported that Islamic extremists are entering the country through Mexico and that ISIS is operating in border towns just miles from American cities. Judicial Watch launched the project in 2014 by exposing a sophisticated narco-terror ring with strong ties to ISIS and connections running from El Paso to Chicago to New York City. Two of the FBI s most wanted were embroiled in the operation that also had deep ties to Mexico. Less than a year later, Judicial Watch reported that ISIS is operating in a Mexican border town just eight miles from El Paso, the result of Islamic terrorists joining forces with drug cartels and human smugglers knowns as  coyotes. When Judicial Watch reported that Mexican cartels were smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into a small Texas rural town, federal authorities publicly denied the story was true. Never the less, high-level sources on both sides of the border confirmed to Judicial Watch that foreigners, classified as Special Interest Aliens (SIA), were being transported to stash areas in Acala, a rural crossroads located around 54 miles from El Paso on a state road   Highway 20. Once in the U.S., the SIAs waited for pick-up in the area s sand hills just across Highway 20. At the time a Texas Department of Public Safety report leaked by the media had already confirmed that for years members of known Islamist terrorist organizations had been apprehended crossing the southern border.Last year a high-ranking DHS official told Judicial Watch that Mexican drug traffickers help Islamic terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the United States to explore targets for future attacks. Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir, an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso. Khabir trained hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and has lived in Mexico for more than a year, according to information provided by Judicial Watch s government source. Now Khabir trains thousands of men mostly Syrians and Yemenis to fight in an ISIS base situated in the Mexico-U.S. border region near Ciudad Ju rez, the intelligence gathered by Judicial Watch s source reveals. Staking out U.S. targets is not difficult and Khabir actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article that the border region is so open that he  could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.  In the same article Mexico s top diplomat, Foreign Affairs Secretary Claudia Ruiz, said  this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States. While much of the American mainstream media ignores that Sharif made it to Canada via the U.S.-Mexico border, it s hardly surprising considering Islamic extremists have been infiltrating the country through the famously unprotected region for years. Referring to the recent Canadian attack, a think-tank dedicated to investigating the operations, funding, activities and front groups of Islamic extremists worldwide writes:  Fears about a terrorist using the U.S.-Mexican border as a gateway for an attack have been realized.

9622,WATCH: SANCTIMONIOUS ANTI-TRUMP Hollywood IMPLODES…Best Friends Turn On Each Other To Save Their Careers and Their New Movie SUBURBICON,"Anti-Trump besties Matt Damon and George Clooney sat down with Good Morning America s Michael Strahan to discuss their good friend, Democrat mega-donor and accused rapist and serial sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein. Not only did both actors, who owe much of their successful careers to Harvey Weinstein, wait until their reputations were on the line to speak out about the sexual predator, but they waited until only days before their new movie,  SUBURBICON  is about to debut, to say that they actually knew more about the abuse women received at the hands of the bully movie mogul than they had previously admitted to.Notably absent in the interview is the third actor Ben Affleck, who completes the trio of bestie actors. After Affleck spoke out on the Harvey Weinstein controversy, he was also accused of covering up Weinstein s behavior, as well as videos that show Affleck used his power to prey on innocent women. Notice how quickly Damon throws Affleck under the bus, saying he knew, but only told Damon (who of course, never told anyone else).Americans who are sick and tired of sanctimonious, holier-than-thou liberals who have no values or morals, yet try to shame Americans for supporting political candidates who don t hold the same liberal views as theirs, are left with only one option #BoycottSuburbicon and #BoycottHollywood In the interview that aired on Monday morning, George Clooney and Matt Damon said that they knew Weinstein was a  bully  and  womanizer  who bragged of bedding actresses but had no idea about the level of criminal behavior that was occurring behind closed doors in hotels.Damon also confessed that he was aware Weinstein had sexually harassed  the first lady of Miramax  Gwyneth Paltrow just before the actress shot the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen s  Emma  for the studio. I knew the story about Gwyneth from Ben [Affleck] because he was with her after Brad [Pitt] and so I knew that story,  said Damon. But I was working with Gwyneth and with Harvey on [the 1999 film  The Talented Mr.] Ripley. He then added:   I never talked to Gwyneth about it but Ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there was an understanding   and he treated her incredibly respectfully. Always. Affleck and Pitt have not spoken about the incident, and Damon s revelation that he learned about Weinstein s behavior from his friend may cause even more problems for the embattled actor as it seems to contradict his initial statement. I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades,  said Affleck almost one week after news of the scandal broke in a carefully-worded response that seemed to suggest he had never before heard any of the allegations.Damon s decision to characterize the relationship between Paltrow and Weinstein as  always  respectful is a bit odd as well, considering her admission that she had been sexually harassed by the mogul is part of the reason the men were sitting down for the interview.Clooney meanwhile said that like many of Weinstein s victims, he had been told a number of times by the mogul that he was bedding a number of stars. Harvey would talk to me about women that he had had affairs with,  said Clooney. I didn t necessarily believe him quite honestly because to believe him would be to believe the worst of some actresses who were friends of mine, and I didn t really think that they had affairs with Harvey   and clearly, they didn t.He then added:  But the idea that this predator, this assaulter was out there silencing women like that, it s beyond infuriating. And the fact that the story is coming out now and the more it comes out, I want to know all of it. Daily MailWatch, as these two actors desperately attempt to save their upcoming movie,  Suburbicon , as well as their Hollywood careers:""He didn't do it out in the open.""   Matt Damon on Harvey Weinstein: https://t.co/fBSMwurc1A pic.twitter.com/oj1xEPTapz  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 23, 2017 It s indefensible. That s the only word you can start with. Harvey s admitted to it, and it s indefensible. I ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We ve had dinners, we ve been on location together, we ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I ve never seen any of this behavior ever.I ve heard rumors, and the rumors, in general, started back in the  90s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with Harvey to get a role. It seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn t get the jobs based on their talent, so I took those rumors with a grain of salt. But the other part of this, the part we re hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn t hear anything about that and I don t know anyone that did. That s a whole other level and there s no way you can reconcile that. There s nothing to say except that it s indefensible.A lot of people are doing the  you had to know  thing right now, and yes, if you re asking if I knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young, beautiful women, sure. But I had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence, and that these women were threatened and victimized. I ve been talking with a lot of people about this, and I don t know many people who knew of that.There s an argument that everyone is complicit in it. I suppose the argument would be, that it s not just about Hollywood, but about all of us, that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don t speak up, you re complicit. And there s no question about that. ",0
9623,ESPN’S JEMELE HILL Makes Shocking Admission About Her Suspension for Calling Trump A ‘White Supremacist’,"ESPN anchor Jemele Hill says she deserved to be suspended for getting too political on Twitter (please see our previous report below).

9624,YOU CAN’T MAKE THIS UP: Special Counsel Leading Trump-Russia Collusion Investigation Is Person Who Gave Russians Uranium Under Direction Of Crooked Hillary,"You seriously can t make this stuff up Wouldn t it be great if we had a real and honest media, and this was the top story of the day today?Zero Hedge   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton facilitated the transfer a highly enriched uranium (HEU) previously confiscated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) during a 2006  nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices,  a newly leaked classified cable shows.So-called  background  information was provided in the cable which gave vague details on a 2006 nuclear smuggling sting operation in which the U.S. government took possession of some HEU previously owned by the Russians. Over two years ago Russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices. The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody and is being held at a secure DOE facility. The secret  action request,  dated Aug. 17, 2009, was sent out by Secretary of State Clinton and was addressed to the United States Ambassador to Georgia Embassy Tbilisi, the Russian Embassy, and Ambassador John Beyrle.It proposed that FBI Director Robert Mueller be the one that personally conducts the transfer a 10-gram sample of HEU to Russian law enforcement sources during a secret  plane-side  meeting on a  tarmac  in the early fall of 2009. We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director s aircraft. Gateway Pundit    The cable also states that  Given Russia s reluctance to act so far, FBI Mueller s delivery of this sample will underscore to Russia our commitment to follow through on this case.  It continues in stating,  Embassy Moscow is requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21. The cable summarizes that,  We regret that the April visit by Director Mueller could not take place due to a scheduling conflict.  and makes a final request that,  We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director s aircraft. Now knowing that the Obama Administration and Hillary Clinton hid the FBI investigation into the Uranium One deal, this cable brings on new meaning and leads to numerous questions.Why did Obama and Clinton agree to provide this uranium delivered by Mueller to Russia in the first place?An article by the Atlantic from April 2008 tells the fascinating story of the smuggler in the country of Georgia who was arrested trying to sell uranium to potential buyers. The smuggler, Oleg Vladimirovich Khintsagov, on January 31, 2006, was apprehended by authorities carrying 100 grams of highly enriched uranium tucked into a plastic bag in his tattered leather coat.A sample of the uranium captured during this sting operation was provided to the Russians who analyzed it and determined that it was indeed highly enriched uranium (HEU). In the Atlantic article, it states that the Russians at first didn t respond to requests from Georgia on the uranium and at no time asked for the uranium back. As a matter of fact, the Russians worked hard to deny that the uranium came from Russia in the first place. So why did the Obama Administration hand deliver 10 grams of HEU to Russia in 2009 and when did Russia begin asking for another sample of the uranium and why did the memo not mention that the Russians had already obtained a sample of this uranium and determined that it was HEU?Another question is why did Clinton s Secretary of State request that FBI Director Mueller deliver the sample of HEU to Russia and why was the transfer in April canceled and postponed to September?Of all people, why would the Head of the FBI be selected to transfer uranium to Russia? It would seem that the US has a number of individuals who could perform this transfer and it would seem that FBI Director Mueller would have enough on his plate in the US. When Mueller couldn t make the transfer in April the transfer was postponed to September so Mueller could be there.The fact that Mueller needed to perform the transfer should raise numerous red flags. It s been widely reported about Mueller s conflicts of interest with his recent appointment as special counsel in the Russia investigation.According to The Hill, before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. For entire story: The HillThe investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017, The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are.  Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election. ",0

The Chicago Bears play in the second largest market in the NFL and in the league s smallest stadium. The law of supply and demand dictates that when a relatively small number of seats is available for the most popular sport and team in town, then ticket prices will increase. Thanks to the NFL players decision to kneel during our national anthem, the Bears may not be able to afford to raise the ticket prices, since fans have decided to something more productive with their time than watching a bunch of snowflake football players disrespecting our flag, as a way to support an anti-cop movement that was started by Black Lives Matter.Here s a look at the usually sold out Chicago Bears stadium today:(2/X) RT @lauriekor: Look at all the empty seats   #Bears #nfl #emptyseats #chi #CARvsCHI #unreal pic.twitter.com/C5CwhfDx9X  Empty Seats Galore (@EmptySeatsPics) October 22, 2017The Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Indiana Colts (the team that Vice President Pence famously walked away from, after the players disrespected our flag during the anthem) game was far from capacity:#NFL #JAXvsIND RT @kimklika: Tons of empty seats at kickoff not surprising pic.twitter.com/65AYCSo3NK  Empty Seats Galore (@EmptySeatsPics) October 22, 2017There was a sea of blue (empty blue seats) at the New York Jets Vs.

9626,CLASS ACT SARAH SANDERS Reveals What She Does Before Every WH Briefing[Video],"White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders revealed she says  a little prayer of God help me  each day before walking into the briefing room during an interview on  Fox News Sunday. Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary herself, mentioned she would say a prayer of  thanks and gratitude  as she would arrive at the building each morning. Sanders, speaking about her job taking questions as the Trump administration s chief spokesperson, expressed both love for the job and said there was hostility from the press she has never seen. I ve always said if I ever walk into the building and I m not in awe of being here and being part of it, then I ve been here too long and it s time to go,  Sanders said.  Thankfully, I still feel a sense of reverence every time I step into the building, certainly every time I step into the briefing room. And I hope I never lose that. I also say a little prayer of  God help me  every day right before walking into that room,  she added.OUR MOST RECENT REPORT ON SANDERS:  ALL HAT, NO CATTLE Sarah Sanders hit back at criticism that General Kelly was fabricating his account of Rep. Frederica Wilson  grandstanding  during an event to dedicate a new FBI office in Texas. The press was all over Sanders who clarified that Rep. Wilson made comments during the event about how she got the funding for the FBI office by picking up the phone and calling Barack. She was  grandstanding  and making the event about her, according to Kelly. The fake news is saying Sanders said the press couldn t speak to Kelly but when you listen to what she said it s clear she said to go ahead if they want to challenge Kelly. She NEVER said the press couldn t talk to him.Great job Class act!",0
9627,NANCY PELOSI’S Face Falls After Joy Reid Questions Her About Stepping Down [Video],"First of all, the picture of President Trump that s behind Pelosi is as funny as it gets. Could that be what got Pelosi all sad during her interview with Joy Reid?House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was clearly disturbed by the comments and questions from liberal hack Joy Reid this morning. She made a face when asked about those in the Democratic Party that want to see her step down from her leadership position.MSNBC S Reid discussed with Pelosi the goals of the Democrats in 2018. She mentioned winning back a majority in the House of Representatives. Pelosi smiled at the remark but then things went downhill from there Reid then took a veiled swipe at Pelosi and you could see Pelosi s face fall:  There is still a contingent on the left side of the Democratic Party  that would like to see you ousted as leader. Pelosi is clearly hanging on to her leadership by a thread and continues to deny the rift in the party. Delusional?Oh Boy! Then Reid asked: If the Democrats were to retake the House, do you foresee a challenge to your leadership? Pelosi disagreed and defended her continued leadership:  With all due respect, I disagree with your characterization. I have overwhelming support of my caucus. There are some people there who disagree with me, and that s OK, but I would not say that it s a challenge from the left, because I am on the left. It gets better she takes a swipe at any challengers to her leadership by saying it s about others   ambition Yikes! She s not going down without a fight!Several Democrats have called for Pelosi to step down and MSNBC called the situation an  ugly divide  in the party.We think her time has come and gone but we re with President Trump KEEP HER! SHE S GREAT FOR THE GOP!HERE S ANOTHER RECENT MENTION TO PELOSI ABOUT STEPPING DOWN: WOW! Nancy Pelosi can t keep a train of thought going for more than a few seconds. She stumbles over her own words and can t remember what she just said. She gets really irritated with Meghan McCain who pointed out there s a divide in the Democrat Party. She claims that,  This is our turn! SHE S BANANAS!MEGHAN MCCAIN, CO-HOST  THE VIEW : There s a fracture in your party, like mine. There were people like Tim Ryan that were calling you to step down and asking for new blood. I don t think it s gender, look at the Bernie supporters versus Hillary supporters.PELOSI: Let me, with all due respect, disagree with you. There is not a fracture in our party similar to what s happening to the Republican party. It s always been a dynamic party. That s the vitality of it. You name people that want me to step down, and I can name you people in my caucus that want me to stay. If Hillary had won and dealt with things like Medicaid, MediCare and Affordable Care Act I had an important role in passing that I had a responsibly to protect that.

She s so bitter that it s embarrassing. She s the poster child for what a liberal elitist pig looks like. Check out this video of Clinton describing how she tried to get out of going to the inauguration:Can you believe this hateful woman? She claims that after other former presidents announced they were going that he and Bill looked at each other and said,  Well, we gotta go .Clinton continued to insinuate that the elder Bush might not have been sick but just didn t want to go to the inauguration. Then she said the rudest thing of all:  It was reported George W. Bush said,  That was some weird shit, The crowd roared with laughter What a shame that former First Lady Hillary Clinton would stoop so low. But we have come to expect low budget moves from the Clinton grifters who will do just about anything for a buck. It has also been reported that Hillary has a nasty mouth and treated others poorly during her time in the White House and as Secretary of State under Obama.Remember how Elizabeth Warren called liberal women  Nasty women  during the 2016 campaign? Well, we think we found the queen of nasty women in Hillary Clinton.OUR LATEST ON THE CLINTON OVERSEAS BOOK TOUR THAT S BEEN A TOTAL FLOP: Hillary Clinton got a dose of boos and heckles while hawking her book overseas.

People looked at your name and your legacy more than they looked at your gender. Clinton answered in her usual delusional way by laying out the amount of support she THINKS she received and then blaming former FBI director James Comey and the Russians for her defeat: That doesn t explain why I led all the way through, why I won the primary by 4 million votes, why I was winning, we had a great convention,  she said.  I was thought to have won all three debates. That doesn t explain it, Matt, so that s why I had to really dig deep. And, yes, I take responsibility. Obviously, there were things I must have been able to do differently in order to have won,  Clinton continued.  But at the end, there was this really perfect storm, and so you had the Comey letter and you had the enormous impact of the Russian theft of emails, the release of them by WikiLeaks, basically now a part of the Russian intelligence apparatus, and the weaponization of that. These were all new phenomena. So you re still blaming others more than yourself?  Frei asked I DON T BLAME OTHERS ??? No, I take ultimate responsibility, I don t blame others, but I think it s important that people understand what happened,  Clinton said.  It easy to say,  You know she wasn t a good candidate.  Then why did lead all the way to the end, why did I get nominated overwhelmingly? Did people lie at the polls?  Frei interjected. No, I think there were intervening events that caused people to worry, to have second thoughts,  she said.Read more: WFB",0
9629,WAKE UP CALL! SOMALI WHO EXECUTED Terror Attack In Canada Entered U.S. Via Mexico,"The Democrats are fighting against closing our border with Mexico at every step of the way. They want open borders It s that simple. If you vote for Democrats then you re voting for open borders. They have zero interest in stopping the flow of illegals to America. One of the key things to remember about open borders is it s not just the people from Mexico looking for a job or better life. The truth is that our open border has become a GLOBAL MAGNET for people from all over the world to come for many different reasons. One of the reasons is terrorism The case below highlights the desperate need for border control if we want to stop the flow of terrorists to America and Canada:The Somali terrorist who stabbed a Canadian police officer and ran over four pedestrians a few weeks ago entered the United States through the Mexican border and was released by Obama s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), allowing him to continue his journey north. The ISIS operative, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, was ordered deported, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman told various media outlets recently, but was released on an  order of supervision  and the feds never saw him again.Sharif entered the U.S. in 2011 through the San Ysidro port of entry in California without documentation and was briefly held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, a local newspaper reported. A year later he crossed the border into Canada and settled in Edmonton after being granted refugee status. On September 30 he slammed into an Edmonton police officer with his car then got out of the vehicle and repeatedly stabbed the cop with a knife. After fleeing the scene, Sharif stole a truck and deliberately mowed down four pedestrians. Canadian authorities found an ISIS flag in his car and have charged him with multiple counts of attempted murder, criminal flight causing bodily harm and possession of a weapon. Two years ago, Canadian authorities investigated the 30-year-old terrorist for espousing extremist views. It s disturbing that Sharif s northbound trek took him through the U.S.-Mexico border.As part of an ongoing investigation into cartels, corruption and terrorism, Judicial Watch has for years reported that Islamic extremists are entering the country through Mexico and that ISIS is operating in border towns just miles from American cities. Judicial Watch launched the project in 2014 by exposing a sophisticated narco-terror ring with strong ties to ISIS and connections running from El Paso to Chicago to New York City. Two of the FBI s most wanted were embroiled in the operation that also had deep ties to Mexico. Less than a year later, Judicial Watch reported that ISIS is operating in a Mexican border town just eight miles from El Paso, the result of Islamic terrorists joining forces with drug cartels and human smugglers knowns as  coyotes. When Judicial Watch reported that Mexican cartels were smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into a small Texas rural town, federal authorities publicly denied the story was true. Never the less, high-level sources on both sides of the border confirmed to Judicial Watch that foreigners, classified as Special Interest Aliens (SIA), were being transported to stash areas in Acala, a rural crossroads located around 54 miles from El Paso on a state road   Highway 20. Once in the U.S., the SIAs waited for pick-up in the area s sand hills just across Highway 20. At the time a Texas Department of Public Safety report leaked by the media had already confirmed that for years members of known Islamist terrorist organizations had been apprehended crossing the southern border.Last year a high-ranking DHS official told Judicial Watch that Mexican drug traffickers help Islamic terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the United States to explore targets for future attacks. Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir, an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso. Khabir trained hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and has lived in Mexico for more than a year, according to information provided by Judicial Watch s government source. Now Khabir trains thousands of men mostly Syrians and Yemenis to fight in an ISIS base situated in the Mexico-U.S. border region near Ciudad Ju rez, the intelligence gathered by Judicial Watch s source reveals. Staking out U.S. targets is not difficult and Khabir actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article that the border region is so open that he  could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.  In the same article Mexico s top diplomat, Foreign Affairs Secretary Claudia Ruiz, said  this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States. While much of the American mainstream media ignores that Sharif made it to Canada via the U.S.-Mexico border, it s hardly surprising considering Islamic extremists have been infiltrating the country through the famously unprotected region for years. Referring to the recent Canadian attack, a think-tank dedicated to investigating the operations, funding, activities and front groups of Islamic extremists worldwide writes:  Fears about a terrorist using the U.S.-Mexican border as a gateway for an attack have been realized.

9630,BEST SUMMARY Yet Of The Shocking Clinton Uranium One Scandal From The Beginning,"There s so much to know in order to understand just how bad the Uranium One scandal is to what s happening now with the Fake Russia probe by Comey. Once you understand the connections and the details of it, you realize it s HUGE!It s not just the Clinton grifters but Obama, the FBI and the DOJ!And at the heart of it is not just the greedy, grasping Clintons, but the Obama Administration, the FBI and the DOJ.Andrew McCarthy does a masterful job of breaking down the entire scandal from beginning until now.McCarthy breaks it all down for you.You ll be shocked to know that the same people investigating the phony Trump/Russia  collusion  were aware of the Uranium One scam AND even helped to cover it up! Here s just a little of what Andy McCarthy explains to us in his summary:Here s the kicker: The Uranium One scandal is not only, or even principally, a Clinton scandal. It is an Obama-administration scandal.The Clintons were just doing what the Clintons do: cashing in on their  public service.  The Obama administration, with Secretary Clinton at the forefront but hardly alone, was knowingly compromising American national-security interests. The administration green-lighted the transfer of control over one-fifth of American uranium-mining capacity to Russia, a hostile regime   and specifically to Russia s state-controlled nuclear-energy conglomerate, Rosatom. Worse, at the time the administration approved the transfer, it knew that Rosatom s American subsidiary was engaged in a lucrative racketeering enterprise that had already committed felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses.This next part is even worse:The Obama administration also knew that congressional Republicans were trying to stop the transfer. Consequently, the Justice Department concealed what it knew. DOJ allowed the racketeering enterprise to continue compromising the American uranium industry rather than commencing a prosecution that would have scotched the transfer. Prosecutors waited four years before quietly pleading the case out for a song, in violation of Justice Department charging guidelines. Meanwhile, the administration stonewalled Congress, reportedly threatening an informant who wanted to go public.Read more here: Andy McCarthyOnce you read the entire summary you ll know just how bad this entire scandal is and how the Obama administration covered it all up.

9631,DEM CHAIRMAN GOES HARDCORE HATE: Curses and Says Trump is ‘Most Dangerous POTUS Ever’ [Video]," Potty Mouth Perez  is at it again with his hate and vulgarity. He s repeatedly gone low when it comes to President Trump. His manner of speaking is so crude and hateful that it s pretty shocking to hear his speeches. We ve reported on them before and have spoken about how Perez is a former La Raza guy who is a radical from a way back. He fights dirty and is one of Obama s minions. If this is the direction the Democrats are going in It s pretty ugly. OUSTING ACTIVISTS Trying to quell accusations that he is ousting activists from the party s left flank, Democratic Chairman Tom Perez told fellow Democrats on Saturday that unity is crucial in the fight against President Donald Trump, whom he lambasted as an  existential threat  to the nation. MOST DANGEROUS We have the most dangerous president in American history and one of the most reactionary Congresses in American history, BERNIE SUPPORTERS OUSTED FROM PARTY LEADERSHIPPerez said as he addressed the first Democratic National Committee gathering since his February election. The former Obama Cabinet official blistered  a culture of corruption  that he said extends to Trump s Cabinet, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but he warned that internal ruckuses over party priorities and leadership would distract from the goal of winning more elections to upend Republicans  domination in Washington.Those who have been pushed out include:Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic chairman and longtime DNC official who ran against Perez for chair before backing Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn. Buckley lost his spots on the Executive Committee and DNC Rules Committee.James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute and prominent Sanders backer, is no longer co-chair of the Resolutions Committee and is off the Executive Committee, a spot he has held since 2001.Alice Germond, the party s longtime former secretary and a vocal Ellison backer, who was removed from her at-large appointment to the DNC.Barbra Casbar Siperstein, who supported Ellison and Buckley, was tossed from the Executive Committee.POTTY MOUTH PEREZ If someone ever asks you which wing of the party you belong to, tell  em you belong to the accomplishment wing of the Democratic Party,  he said,  because you re trying to get s  done. That s what we re trying to do here, folks. We re trying to move the ball forward. ERIC HOLDER ON THE SCENEEric Holder has been making comments and appearances recently raising questions about what he s up to. He has bashed President Trump on Twitter and is now involved with the Democrat Party and voting rights. The left claims that Republicans used gerrymandering to win states   He goes way back with victimhood he s always a victim.

We looked everywhere but the video was gone from every source. After much digging, we found a clip of it on Facebook so here you go:Waters starts off with,  Wow, what a moving evening this is. Then this:  I m sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him.

Feeling inspired, Mad Maxine promised the group that she would 'go and take Trump out tonight!'. Like >> Share >> Follow >> The New Revolution IIPosted by The New Revolution II on Saturday, October 21, 2017Just two days later, Waters continued to rant about Trump, this time at a Los Angeles AIDS walk.Waters turned the event into a platform to push her personal political agenda: We face unprecedented challenges today in our struggle against HIV and AIDS and I want you to know those people in Congress on the opposite side of the aisle from me control every branch of our federal government,  Waters said.  And we have, unfortunately, an unstable, erratic person in the White House. We don t know what this president will do, or say, or tweet from one day to the next. Don t forget, this is not a political event, but I m heading toward impeachment,  Waters said with a snicker. Another challenge we face today is Republicans  determination to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare,  Waters continued. Without Obamacare, insurance companies will once again be able to deny care to the people living with HIV and other pre-existing conditions. Furthermore, without Obamacare states like California that expanded Medicaid will not be able to cover low-income adults living with HIV. And so, the House Republicans  Obamacare repeal bill which passed the House in May will cut $100 billion from Medicaid and cause 23 million Americans to lose their health insurance,  the 79-year-old career politician said.  So far, the Senate has been great. It has refused to pass the bill. Via: American Mirror",0
9633,WATCH: IRRELEVANT DEM POLITICAL ANALYST James Carville Says Trump’s Mental State Needs To Be Looked At Because of His Sentence Structure,"On Friday s broadcast of HBO s  Real Time,  former Clinton Campaign Manager James Carville stated that President Trump lacks empathy and sentence structure, and someone has to examine his mental state like people did at the end of the Reagan presidency.Carville said,  I think what happened was, is General Kelly told the president when he called this war widow that   look when, people   fighting men and women understand that when they take on this mission they could die for the country or for each other, and it s something that binds them together, and you have to make that point. Of course, Trump has no empathy and his sentence structure is completely gone. He can t say two sentences.   So, he gets on the phone, and he says,  Well, that s what he signed up for.  And General Kelly heard what I wanted. I mean, the truth of the matter is, somebody has to look. You know, when President Reagan was president, towards the end of his term, Howard Baker had a memo, and they seriously were looking to see if he had any kind of cognitive issues and they decided that he did not. I don t think Trump is capable of making those two thoughts.   BreitbartAt about the 2-minute mark, Democrat Party political analyst James Carville starts his rant about why President Trump needs to look at Trump s mental state:In October of 2016, James Carville piled on with another guy who just can t seem to get anything right, crybaby Mark Cuban. Carville and Cuban were guests on Maher s show when Carville told Bill Maher and friends that then-candidate Trump was going to quit the race.BILL MAHER: Donald Trump was supposed to have a rally tomorrow with Paul Ryan and now he has been disinvited   this just happened before we went   and it s going to be Mike Pence and Paul Ryan. Wow. When the top of the ticket is disinvited to his own rally?MARK CUBAN: He s finally toxic. Donald Trump is finally toxic.JAMES CARVILLE: Mark and I got in a discussion before the show. I think he s going to quit. Really, right now, I m saying right here.[APPLAUSE]MAHER: You know why he s not going to win? Because his basket of deplorable and if the basket fits Carville hasn t been right about too much of anything in his career, but since he helped to get the impeached rapist into the White House, the media will always use him as their go-to-guy when it comes to getting advice on how to stop the Republicans winning elections.",0
9634,HILLARY WORKED FEVERISHLY To Return 10 Russian Spies Operating In U.S. In Midst Of Selling 20% Of U.S. Uranium To Russia,"Why is this not front page news on every major media outlet?Russian intelligence targeted Hillary Clinton before she became secretary of state in 2009, FBI documents show.New FBI information about corruption in a Clinton-approved uranium deal with Russia raises questions about Clinton s actions after the FBI broke up a deep-cover Russian spy ring in 2010.For a decade, the FBI ran an operation called Ghost Stories to monitor and rip apart a deep-cover Russian agent network. Ghost Stories tracked a ring Russian spies who lived between Boston and Washington, D.C., under false identities. It was one of the FBI s most elaborate and successful counterintelligence operations in history.After the FBI arrested 10 of the spies in June, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton worked feverishly to return the Russian agents to Moscow in a hastily arranged, lopsided deal with Putin.It all happened as the uranium deal was in play: An arrangement to provide Moscow s state Rosatom nuclear agency with 20 percent of American uranium capacity, with $145,000,000 to pour into the Clinton Family Foundation and its projects.For the Clintons, the FBI s biggest counterintelligence bust in history couldn t have come at a worse time.The day the FBI arrested the Russian agents, on June 28, 2010, the day before the secretary of state s husband, Bill Clinton, was to give a speech in Moscow. A Kremlin-connected investment bank, Renaissance Capital, paid the former president $500,000 for the hour-long appearance.An unnamed Hillary Clinton spokesman told ABC News that there was  no reason to think the Secretary was a target of this spy ring. That was a lie.Under the code name Operation Ghost Stories, the FBI had been working the ring for a decade. Its targets had burrowed in along the Acela Corridor between Boston, New York, and Washington DC. They lived normal daily lives as Americans to attend universities, run businesses, marry, and conceive and raise children to infiltrate society and subvert government institutions. One of the SVR agents had stolen the identity of a six-week-old Canadian baby who had died in 1963. That prompted the Ghost Stories code name. The ring inspired the FX network s television series,  The Americans. As with any secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would be a primary target under any circumstance. But she was much more. She was a known quantity: predictable, vain and ruthless, and with an insatiable desire for cash to enrich her family, friends, and political machine. Blindly ambitious to become president of the world s only superpower and swearing to come back after losing in 2008 to Barack Obama, she was the 21st century KGB s perfect mark.Read more: Daily Caller",0
9635,WHAT THE HECK Is Going On In Las Vegas? VIDEO PROOF That Las Vegas Coroner’s Office Is On LOCKDOWN,"When people say  What happens in Las Vegas, stays in Las Vegas.  they apparently aren t  kidding around Suspicion about what is going on in the Las Vegas massacre investigation is at an all-time high. Americans want to know, and frankly, we have a right to know what happened in Las Vegas the night of the Rt. 91 Music Festival, where 59 people were killed and 527 were injured.  It s almost eery how quickly the Las Vegas investigation has fallen off the radar of the mainstream media, who don t seem to be interested in finding out what really happened, and even appear to be giving up on using the massacre to promote their gun-control agenda.A worker at the Mandalay Bay hotel said Wednesday that he warned staff at the complex to report an active shooter before gunman Stephen Paddock launched his massacre on crowds at a music festival below the venue.The revelation has added to doubts about the initial timeline given by authorities about what happened Oct. 1. They had said the assault began with Paddock opening fire on concertgoers at the Route 91 Festival.But the new account alleges that an unarmed guard Jesus Campos who was initially believed to have approached and been shot by Paddock during his massacre was shot before the assault, with that gunshot heard by a maintenance worker.JESUS IS BEING PROTECTED BY AN ARMED SECURITY GUARD WHO REFUSES TO SAY WHO S PAYING HIMIndependent investigative journalist Laura Loomer paid a visit to the home of the  hero  Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort  security guard  who was allegedly shot by the Las Vegas shooter Steven Paddock. Loomer can be seen having a conversation with a paid security guard who refused to say who was paying him to stand in front of Campos  home.

HIS APPEARANCE ON THE SHOW IS SHOCKINGLY DIFFERENT THAN THE IMAGE THAT  S BEEN CIRCULATING OF HIM IN THE MEDIAAn announcement was made last week that Jesus Campus would appear on the Ellen Show. Jesus did appear on the show, but given the original photo of Campos that was being used in the media and a quick snapshot from his appearance on the Ellen Show, two things really jump out. The first thing that jumps out is the incredible 1-week weight gain that Campos had experienced, and the second is the missing moles that were very prominent in the photo below, that was allegedly taken only one week before his  performance  on the Ellen Show.#Jesuscampos in 5 days, gained 50 LB, had moles removed from his face, has no injury to forehead but had bandage on it 5 days before? pic.twitter.com/TlT6Mt0eyZ  Fed Up Lilly   (@FedUpLilly) October 21, 2017MGM ADMITS TO ALLOWING CAMPOS TO ONLY APPEAR ON THE ELLEN SHOW IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE HE KEPT HIS STORY STRAIGHTFearing Jesus Campos would  spill the beans  about the timeline of the shooting if he was grilled by proper journalists, MGM, which owns the hotel where deranged gunman Stephen Paddock shot 600 people, insisted that security officer appear ONLY on only appear on Ellen, DailyMail.com has learned exclusively.MGM is worried that families of the 58 people murdered as well as many of the 546 injured in the Mandalay Bay massacre will launch lawsuits potentially worth billions of dollars against the company, sources tell DailyMail.com.And they thought Campos might not keep his story straight under the pressure of the TV lights and tough questioning.That is why Campos, 25, appeared on a daytime chat show hosted by a fast-talking, dancing comedienne, rather than take questions from TV hardhitters such as Fox News  Sean Hannity, CNN s Wolf Blitzer or MSNBC s Rachel Maddow. MGM was behind the decision to call off all the interviews and did a deal with Ellen, knowing she would not play hardball on the timeline as long as she had the exclusive,  a TV insider told DailyMail.com.Here s a closer look at the images:And now, citizen journalist Mike Tokes has uncovered what is indeed a very suspicious development. Tokes traveled to the Las Vegas coroners office to see if he could get some answers from the Clark County Coroner and Medical Examiner John Fudenberg. What Tokes got when he attempted to enter the Las Vegas Coroner s office was a woman by the name of  Laurie  who informed him that the coroner s office was on lockdown and would remain on lockdown  at least until the end of the week . When Tokes asked if it was unusual for the office to be on lockdown, she replied,  We ve never had a situation like this.

She can be heard telling the dispatch operator for her cab service that she hears what  sounds like automatic gunfire.  Cori Langdon hears more gunfire, and tells her dispatch operator that the gunshots sound like they re coming from a completely different area:  Now it sounds like its coming from farther away. After listening to Langdon s video recording of the event as it unfolded, one can t help but wonder if it s possible there was more than one shooter.Automatic gunshots are still being heard from the cab. Langdon tells her dispatch person:  Somethings going on. I m not sure why people aren t  running, but. There s a security guard, what s he doing? Ya know, for there being gunfire, it sure doesn t seem like people are runnin .  Oh, shit! Seriously? I don t know what s goin  on? Where are the cops at? I m right here by the porch of Mandalay Bay, and everything seems to be normal here.  More and more rapid-fire gunshots are heard. The radio dispatcher replies,  Remember, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. And everything seems normal when it s not.

Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.  Power is derived from 2 main sources   money and people.  Have-Nots  must build power from flesh and blood. 2.  Never go outside the expertise of your people.  It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. 3.  Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.  Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. 4.  Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.  If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. 5.  Ridicule is man s most potent weapon.  There is no defense. It s irrational. It s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. 6.  A good tactic is one your people enjoy.  They ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. 7.  A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.  Don t become old news. 8.  Keep the pressure on. Never let up.  Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. 9.  The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.  Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. 10.  If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.  Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. 11.  The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.  Never let the enemy score points because you re caught without a solution to the problem. 12.  Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.TUCKER AND MARK STEYN DISCUSS THIS TACTIC: Why is it the left always accuses its  opponents of the exact same thing they re guilty of?  @TuckerCarlson  RT #MAGA #TRUMP #Weinstein pic.twitter.com/g5oI4TqVHR  DONNA WARREN   (@DonnaWR8) October 12, 2017",0

This portion of her speech seems to emphasize her role in getting the naming done. That was his point, she needs the spotlight hence her using the death of a soldier and the families grief as a political football trying to score political points.In case you missed the wonderful message from Chief of Staff Kelly:White House Chief of Staff John Kelly says he was stunned to learn that Congresswoman Frederica Wilson listened in on the president s call to a fallen soldier s wife. He came into the White House press briefing and let the press have it too. He goes through the steps of what happens when someone in the military is killed.

9638,AUDIT REVEALS: 150 AFGHAN TROOPS Have Gone AWOL In U.S. During Training…Some Still Missing,"The new report on the number of missing Afghan trainees draws attention to the current policy that obviously needs to be changed. The terror risk is bad enough and the cost to train these soldier is HUGE. Remember when Obama was famously called out for the outrageous cost per trainee? Reuters reported in October of 2016 that  Washington has allocated more than $60 billion since 2002 to train and equip Afghan troops. This is a waste of taxpayer dollars. Immigration agents say they re  worried  about the terror risk with these AWOL trainees.While other foreign troops on U.S. military training visits have sometimes run away, a U.S. defense official said that the frequency of Afghan troops going missing was concerning and  out of the ordinary. More than 150 Afghan troops brought to the U.S. for military training have gone AWOL since 2005, with 13 of them still unaccounted for and perhaps living as here illegal immigrants now, an inspector general said in a new report Friday.Part of the problem is that the U.S. never puts the trainees through an in-person interview and exempts them from registering as aliens when they arrive   both steps that other visitors would normally have to go through.In-person interviews and requiring the troops to register beforehand would help the government gauge whether someone is likely to go absent without leave, and would give immigration officers information about relatives in the U.S. as starting points when someone does go AWOL, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said.But the State Department rejected those suggestions.The audit said that while no acts of terrorism have yet been traced to the trainees, immigration agents say they re worried because a number who go AWOL end up trying to claim asylum in the U.S., stymieing any national security investigation into their behavior.Beyond the potential danger, American taxpayers also miss out on the investment in the troops, the inspector general said. It is clear that Afghan trainees go AWOL while in the United States at a far higher rate than do trainees from any other country, and we believe that the State Department (as well as other government agencies) should use all the tools at their disposal to reduce these occurrences and ensure that Afghan trainees return to Afghanistan and make use of the substantial U.S. taxpayer investment in training,  the audit concluded.The number of troops going AWOL surged in 2015 and 2016 as security back home deteriorated.Some Afghan troops currently being trained in the U.S. said the Taliban threatened their families back home once it became known they had a relative training here. Many of them said the training made them bigger targets when they returned.Investigators identified 152 Afghan trainees who have gone absent without leave under the training program. Seventy of them fled the U.S., 39 managed to obtain legal status here, three returned to duty, 27 were arrested and put in deportation proceedings, and 13 remain unaccounted for.The largest number disappeared from training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, but four went AWOL from training in D.C., three disappeared from Quantico, Virginia, and one from Arlington.The State Department and Homeland Security said they don t think there s a reason to be concerned.Read more: WTA PREVIOUS REPORT ON TWO AFGHAN TRAINEES THAT WENT MISSING:THE TWO TRAINEES ARE STILL MISSING! The public has received no picture or description of the two Afghan men who were last seen on Friday of last week. They will not say why they re not giving a description to the public. It would help if they let people know what these two men look like. MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, Ga.   Authorities are searching south Georgia for two male Afghan air force students who did not report for duty Monday, officials said.The students have been at Moody Air Force Base since February of this year and were screened prior to coming to the U.S. more than a year ago, according to officials with the base.The base says that both men have trained alongside U.S. troops for the entirety of this year and do not pose any apparent threat. The students and their class were set to graduate on Dec. 18.Federal authorities are involved because these are international military students, said Captain Korey Fratini, Chief of Public Affairs for the air force base.The two students were last accounted for Friday but did not show up for duty on Monday.They are part of Afghan Air Force and are maintenance aircraft students here training to learn how to maintain the a29 Super Tucano. Foley said they are not pilots.There are 9 Afghan pilots at Moody and 14 Afghan aircraft maintainers, according to Foley.There is a coordinated effort among federal agencies to locate these men as quickly as possible and return them to the proper authorities, a statement from the base said.They were both assigned to the 81st Fighter Squadron. The base is near Valdosta, Ga. off of Interstate 75.According to Forey, the students are considered absconded for now.They are not releasing missing males names, ages or pics right now but did not say why.When they are located he says they will be brought back to Moody AFB and Foley does not know what will happen next.Foley said the main focus is trying to get info out to local communities that the information they have is there is no indication they pose any threat.Read more: FCN",0

It s a must-see part of the museum. The beautiful ball gown that Melania Trump wore to the Inaugural Ball will be a great addition to this collection.First Lady Melania Trump donated her inaugural ball gown to the First Ladies  Collection at the Smithsonian Institution today. The Fist Lady handed over the vanilla silk, off-the-shoulder gown during a ceremony Friday in Washington: The president, Barron and I love living here and we are so honored to represent this country,  the first lady told a crowd gathered in Flag Hall at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, the museum where her inaugural ball gown will now live.In her speech, which lasted under four minutes, the first lady admitted procuring a ball gown had slipped her mind, so she made  poor Herv ,  designer Herv  Pierre, work on a tight two-week deadline to craft the  gorgeous couture piece.

9640,BLM PROTESTER Leaves Angry After Watching FERGUSON- The Play in NYC…Realizes She Was LIED To By Media: “Why did I demonstrate ‘Hands in the air…Don’t shoot’?” [VIDEO] ,"Filmmaker and author Phelim McAleer knew he was going to ruffle some feathers when he decided to open his FERGUSON-the play in the leftist hotbed of New York City. McAleer has never been one to shy away from controversy, especially when he knows the truth is on his side. So last night, with very little mainstream media coverage, Phelim opened his controversial play in NYC, that challenges the false narrative being fed to the general public about what really happened in Ferguson, MO. The Ferguson play will, no doubt, force viewers to question how much of what the media feeds them is real, and how much is propaganda that feeds their leftist agenda.  What is FERGUSON?FERGUSON is a staged reenactment of the controversial killing of Michael Brown using ONLY Grand Jury testimony. No spin. No media filter. Just the truth. Nine cast members of the staged reading in Los Angeles walked out before opening night because of their desire to rewrite the script. But you can t rewrite the truth; you can t rewrite history. See for yourself!LA Weekly called the staged reading of FERGUSON  a riveting spectacle  and  an incendiary evening of theatre.  This is the World Premiere of a full production.FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play   it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot, Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists.As guests at the opening of the thought-provoking Ferguson-the play began to exit the theater, Phelim approached a random woman to get her reaction to the performance. The woman he questioned seemed confused and angry by what she just witnessed. She admits she was a Black Lives Matter supporter, and even protested with Black Lives Matter to help them to push the  hands up, don t shoot  narrative. After realizing that she had been lied to by the media, she asks Phelim,  Why did I demonstrate  Hands in the air Don t shoot ? The controversial play opened last night in New York City and is set to run through November 5th.Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production.

9642,MELANIA SAVES TAXPAYERS A Fortune By Making Shocking Cuts In Number of Aides At White House Compared To Lavish Michelle Obama,"Melania Trump is embracing a more active and public schedule as first lady   but she still runs one of the leanest East Wing operations in recent history.According to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports, Melania Trump has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady s office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.During then-President Barack Obama s first year in office, 16 people were listed working for Michelle Obama, earning a combined $1.24 million a year.This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June. Their salaries totaled $486,700.The details are contained in an annual report the White House sends to Congress showing the names, positions and salaries of all its personnel. Both the Obama and Trump administrations acknowledged several additional staffers beyond those listed in the report with the term  first lady  in their titles. But even counting all those employees   24 for Michelle Obama and nine for the current first lady   Melania Trump s office is relatively small.It s an approach her spokeswoman says is intentional. As with all things that she does, she is being very deliberate in her hiring, focusing on quality over quantity,  communications director Stephanie Grisham said in an email.  It is important to her that the team is a good fit for what she wants to accomplish as first lady, and that everyone works well together. She also wants to be mindful and responsible when it comes to taxpayer money. While the 2009 annual report listed 16 staffers for Michelle Obama, her press secretary said at the time the staff actually included 24 people. A 2009 FactCheck.org story said Obama s 24 aides might have broken records.  FOX News",0

Uh-I-uh-mean that-uh-that folks looking fifty years back. It s the 21st century. Obama really was the most divisive POTUS in history. It s pretty unbelievable that he s now claiming Trump is divisive.

9644,WOW! CONFIRMED BY ICE: 5-Time Deported ILLEGAL ALIEN Protected By Sanctuary County Is Suspected ARSONIST Behind Worst Fires CA History,"Remember when candidate Donald Trump was condemned by the left for telling Americans that we have criminals coming across our borders? Well, it turns out that he was not only correct, it appears as though the worst fire in California s history that caused the death of 42 so far and over $1 billion in damage to almost 3,000 homes was very likely started by an ILLEGAL ALIEN arsonist. From Donald Trump s campaign speech at a rally in Arizona: The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else s problems. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best. They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us.  They re bringing drugs, they re bringing crime, they re rapists and some, I assume are good people. Watch:Well, now that ICE has confirmed that the arsonist arrested in connection with setting the fires that devastated California is a 5-time deported ILLEGAL ALIEN, who in the media is going to tell Trump they re  sorry  for criticizing him? Will it be one of the local government officials in Sonoma County who decided to make their county a  sanctuary county  to protect people like Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday?Breitbart   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Tom Homan confirmed on Thursday that a man arrested in connection with setting a fire in Sonoma County Wine Country is an illegal alien from Mexico who has been twice returned to his  home country. Homan also confirmed that ICE has issued detainer requests for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez five times now in the past year alone, including the one issued on October 16 in relation to his most recent arrest on suspicion of arson. All of the arrests were made  by Sonoma County on various felony and misdemeanor charges,  according to Homan.Sonoma County is considered a sanctuary jurisdiction and does not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials. That includes not honoring ICE detainer requests.  ICE was never notified of Mr. Gonzalez  various releases,  Homan wrote in the statement regarding Gonzalez.There were several fires in the region, and it is not clear what role the fires Gonzales allegedly set played in the overall disaster.The LA Times reported on the incident from eyewitnesses after Gonzalez was seen leaving the scene of the fire: He was screaming really bad things at the police when he was arrested,  recalled David Moreno, 29, who witnessed the arrest.  He was yelling things like,  I m going to teach you a lesson you ll never forget. Three Sonoma County probation officers patrolling Maxwell Farms Regional Park just before 3 p.m. noticed a plume of smoke rising from an area near the Sonoma Creek, Sheriff s Department spokeswoman Misti Harris said.Gonzalez walked away from the fire as the officers approached, Harris said. Nobody else was in the area,  Harris said.Sonoma County Sheriff s Department deputies followed Gonzalez to a nearby McDonald s. Gonzalez had  previous contacts  with law enforcement, she said.Gonzalez told police he started the fire because he was cold, Harris said. Officers found a lighter in his pocket.*The recorded temperature at the time that the fires started was a balmy 78 degrees.Some homeless people who knew Gonzalez said that he had a habit of setting fire to brush along the creek bed.Tensions were already high in this smoke-filled region, about 25 miles east of Santa Rosa.Local mechanic Shawn Stephensen, 40, said,  A few days ago I was walking down the street with a gas can and someone driving by stopped to say,  I wouldn t be carrying a thing like that around at a time like this. At first I didn t get it,  Stephensen, who knew Gonzalez, said.  Then it dawned on me    Oh yeah, instant felony case. What will Governor Jerry Brown, who recently signed off on legislation that makes the entire state of California a  sanctuary state  have to say about this recent development? ",0

It s known for its jokes and roasting of political figures. The Catholic fundraiser for New York s neediest children included a who s who of New York politicians, among them Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Emmy Award-winning Patricia Heaton served as the event s first-ever woman emcee.Ryan hit at President Trump several times during his speech: I m learning being Speaker of the House is a stepping stone to becoming ex-Speaker of the House. But just because I m speaker, you did not have to invite me,  Ryan quipped.This is probably NOT the best time to focus on bashing President Trump but it s no secret that globalist Ryan isn t a huge fan. He famously said during the 2016 campaign that he would fight against Trump s agenda:The October conference call apparently was intended only for House Republican members. It s unclear which or how many House Republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. The remarks on the portion provided to Breitbart News certainly sound like they were coming from Speaker Ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. He says not only will he not defend the Access Hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with Trump at all between this call on Oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on Nov. 8 and that Ryan would not defend Trump on anything generally. For entire story- Matthew Boyle, Breitbart NewsLISTEN:Globalist RINOs like Paul Ryan hate Trump s agenda because it focuses on the American people 100%. Ryan has famously supported cheap foreign labor that kills American jobs and has expressed his dislike for Trump s wall that would prevent the flood of illegals we have now. The bottom line is that Ryan is part of the swamp that Trump wants to drain. Let s hope Ryan is out soon!",0
9648,WHAT? MATT LAUER ASKS OBAMA’S Former CIA Director If Trump’s Inner Circle Is Prepared To “Tackle” or “Lock Him In A Room” To Keep Trump From Using Nuclear Weapons [VIDEO],"NBC host Matt Lauer on Thursday asked former CIA Director John Brennan whether military officials surrounding President Donald Trump would  tackle him  before he engaged in a nuclear confrontation.Brennan replied that Trump has unilateral authority to authorize military action.Lauer asked Brennan hesitantly about reports surrounding America s procedure to deploy nuclear weapons under Trump, emphasizing the stories of  key players around the president  maybe locking Trump in a room or even tackling him to prevent the use of such weapons. I feel weird asking you this, but you ve read the same stories I ve read,  Lauer said to Brennan.  You know the key players around the president in [Jim] Mattis, [H.R.] McMaster, and John Kelly. Stories are going around out there that if the president inches closer to some kind of a nuclear confrontation with North Korea, that those guys are going to do something. They re going to lock him in a room. They re going to tackle him. Watch the incredible exchange here: You re smiling,  Lauer added.  But these are the stories that are out there. And they will prevent him from carrying out any action that would cause that. Is that all nonsense? No, I think the military leaders, current and former, Mattis, Kelly, also Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, they know the risks of escalation,  said Brennan, who served as CIA director during the Obama administration.  They know just how dangerous the situation is. I think they are governors on the president s instincts to continue to try to intimidate and bully. You re technically not answering the question. Would they take some action to prevent the president from carrying out an order?  Lauer asked. The president has unilateral authority to be able to authorize military action,  Brennan said.  That order goes through Secretary Mattis. Secretary Mattis can try to talk him out of it, disagree with it, carry it out, or not. After Brennan walked Lauer through the usual White House process of authorizing military actions, Lauer pushed his original question about tackling Trump, using a quote from Brennan. In July you said it is the obligation of some executive officials to refuse to carry out some of those orders that are inconsistent with what this country is all about,  Lauer quoted Brennan.Brennan clarified that he made that comment  in the context  of the firing of former FBI Director Jim Comey and the efforts to  delay and to put obstacles in some of the investigations that are underway. We are a country of laws,  Brennan added.  WFB ",0
9649,WATCH: THINGS GOT REALLY AWKWARD When NBC Sent Hoda Over To Help Spike Megyn Kelly’s Miserable Ratings,"Buzzfeed reports, that, from the start, Megyn Kelly Today s Nielsen ratings have been down compared to the third hour of Today, which was cohosted by Al Roker and Tamron Hall last fall. The ultimate aim of Megyn Kelly Today was to challenge Live With Kelly and Ryan, which is syndicated by ABC, but the contest is not even close. In Megyn Kelly Today s first week, Live beat it by 14% among viewers and 17% in the 25-to-54 demographic. In the second week, the gap widened, with Live besting Megyn Kelly Today by 34% among viewers and 60% in the demo.We re not sure what they were thinking when they sent the wine-soaked Hoda from the Kathie Lee and Hoda show over to help make Megyn look more  normal  and approachable to her audience, but by bringing a likeable and relatable host from another (formerly) popular show on NBC, they only managed to shine a huge spotlight on Megyn Kelly s inability to connect with anyone who isn t holding a camera. By bringing Hoda Kotb over for a very awkward segment on Kelly s show, NBC managed to reinforce why nobody wants to watch the cringe-inducing host of Megyn Kelly Today.Watch:Hoda was on #MegynKellyToday this morning for no reason other than to fill time and I've never been so embarrassed. pic.twitter.com/wXUatEcPhY  Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) October 19, 2017",0

9652,BLACK HOMICIDE VICTIMS Killed Mostly By Black Criminals Jumps 900 Per Yr. Since Start Of Black Lives Matter…Number Of Cops Killed By Blacks Is STUNNING,"Lost in the uproar over the NFL sideline protests against police brutality are newly released statistics showing that the threat to black men is skyrocketing   not from trigger-happy or racist cops, but from crime.More than any other demographic group, black men are paying the price with their lives with a surging violent crime rate over the past two years, including a 20 percent jump in the overall homicide rate, even as the number of blacks killed by police declines.Using homicide figures from the 2016 FBI Uniform Crime Report released Sept. 25, Manhattan Institute fellow Heather Mac Donald found that the number of black homicide victims has jumped by nearly 900 per year since the Black Lives Matter movement took root in 2014. The majority of victims of that homicide surge have been black,  Ms. Mac Donald said in an email.  They were killed overwhelmingly by black criminals, not by the police and not by whites. Meanwhile, the number of blacks killed by police dipped from 259 in 2015 to 233 in 2016, with 2017 so far coming in below both years with 175 deaths as of Oct. 12, according to The Washington Post s Fatal Force database.Ms. Mac Donald and others have blamed the increasingly hands-off approach of police officers who are worried about running afoul of the Black Lives Matter movement after the 2014 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. She dubbed it  the Ferguson effect. Peter Moskos, associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, tracked the same phenomenon in Baltimore after the April 2015 rioting over the death of a black man in police custody. He calls it  the Freddie Gray effect.  He found a spike in homicides and shootings after the riots, which were followed by Baltimore State s Attorney Marilyn Mosby s decision to charge six officers in Gray s death. Three of the officers were acquitted in non-jury trials, and charges against the other three were dismissed. Police were instructed   both by city leaders and then in the odd DOJ report city leaders asked for   to be less proactive since such policing will disproportionately affect minorities,  Mr. Moskos said in a Sept. 4 post.  Few seem to care that minorities are disproportionately affected by the rise in murder. Officers also have been hit: Ms. Mac Donald said there was a 53 percent increase in 2016 in the shooting deaths of cops, while The Washington Post database found that only 16 of the 233 black men killed by police in 2016 were unarmed. A police officer is 18 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer,  Ms. Mac Donald said.  Black males have made up 42 percent of all cop killers over the past decade, though they are only 6 percent of the population. Those involved with Black Lives Matter have said in the past that prosecuting such killings is easier than cases involving police force against civilians.While the NFL kneeling began as a protest against police brutality, those involved have increasingly expanded the point to encompass what San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid described as  systemic oppression that has been rampant in this country for decades and decades. Rashad Robinson, senior campaign director at Color of Change, said President Trump s recent suggestion that owners should fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem represents a view within sports that  black people serve at the pleasure of white people. Almost every NFL owner is white. Nearly 70% of players are Black,  Mr. Robinson said in a written statement.  Yet for Donald Trump, this power imbalance is not enough   he wants to be sure that players who exercise their right to protest social injustice can be fired with impunity. This is what it means to advance a white supremacist worldview.   Washington Times",0

She thinks women shouldn t appear  inviting THIS WOMAN IS SO IN THE DARK ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT: I grew up in a time when it was as much the woman s responsibility as a man s how you were dressed, what your behavior was,  Texas Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson told Dallas  local NBC5. I m from the old school that you can have behaviors that appear to be inviting. It can be interpreted as such,  Johnson continued.  That s the responsibility, I think, of the female. Interviewer Diana Zoga asked if it was time to stop asking about what women were wearing and to start talking about the power that men abused.

9655,MUST WATCH: SEN TED CRUZ Tells SEN BERNIE SANDERS To “Curb Your Enthusiasm” In Hilarious Moment During CNN Debate,"Two US Senators who couldn t be more ideologically opposed, Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Independent (Socialist Party) Senator Bernie Sanders came together for what ended up being a very entertaining debate on the subject of the GOP tax plan during a debate hosted by CNN.The polarizing topic has been at the center of Capitol Hill, as lawmakers have attempted to reform the tax code. Republicans, in an effort to pass the tax code, have explored trying to pass tax reform without Democratic support; while Democrats have complained that they have been left out of a crucial, bipartisan process in governing.Included in the GOP tax plan is a 20% corporate tax rate, the elimination of the estate tax, and the implementation of three tax brackets.Cruz defended the plan, saying on CNN,  Republicans want to lower the taxes for each and every person watching this debate,  and said that lowering the corporate tax rate would allow businesses to create more jobs.Sanders, however, said the GOP s tax plan is about giving  tax breaks to people who don t need it.  The senator said he supports  a tax cut for the middle class and working families. Throughout the evening, the two senators threw several verbal jabs at each other s expense.At one point, Cruz claimed that his 2016 presidential campaign tried to strengthen social security and said politicians in Washington were  recklessly letting it careen towards insolvency. There are no changes at all,  Cruz said.  Every dollar, every penny of benefit is protected, but for young people, people my age  You re not so young anymore,  Sanders replied. You d be surprised,  Cruz said.Cruz also joked about the impersonation that comedian Larry David, star of HBO s  Curb Your Enthusiasm  did of Sanders on an episode of  Saturday Night Live. I m not interrupting you,  Sanders said, waving his hand as a sign for Cruz to hurry.  Come on, come on. You know, as some might say, curb your enthusiasm,  Cruz quipped.  By the way, the impression that Larry David does of you is spectacular and uncanny.

9656,ONE BRAVE MAN Is About To Reveal The Truth About What REALLY Happened In Ferguson…Black Lives Matter and The Media Are NOT Going To Be Happy [VIDEO],"Thanks to one very brave journalist and filmmaker, FERGUSON, a very important and extremely controversial play, is set to begin in New York City on October 19 and will run through October 30th.The New York version of FERGUSON is directed by Jerry Dixon.Much like the contentious real-life drama that played out on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, when Michael Brown was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, filmmaker Phelim McAleer s controversial retelling of what really happened that fateful day in the Ferguson the play, using only the Grand Jury testimony from the Officer Wilson trial, is sure to ruffle some feathers.Black Lives Matter has been perpetuating a lie about Michael Brown and how he was a victim of murder at the hands of a white police officer, who had no grounds whatsoever to shoot him.FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play   it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists.This is why it is so important to bring the truth to New York. Obviously the New York theatrical establishment won t support this play. They seem to really detest anything that challenges their cozy consensus world view.Ferguson the play, was the brainchild of journalist and filmmaker Phelim McAleer, who many know for his hard-hitting documentary Fracknation, that pulled the curtain back on a false narrative being pushed by liberal activists and politicians, and exposed the truth behind the lies Americans were being told about the dangers of fracking.Two years ago, when rehearsal began in Los Angeles for FERGUSON, McAleer found himself having to deal with 9 actors who walked out when rehearsals began, after reading the script (that is based on the verbatim Grand Jury testimony of the witnesses during the officer Wilson trial).What makes FERGUSON so compelling, is that not one word of the Grand Jury testimony is altered or changed. McAleer, who was determined to keep the show alive, explains how difficult it has been to get his play to the New York stage:McAleer tells viewers in the promotional video below, that the truth about what really happened in Ferguson is not what the mainstream media s been telling you.:  The truth was so shocking to so many people, that 9 of the cast walked out during rehearsals in Los Angeles. I was determined that the show would go on, even though the cast walked out. And the cast walked out because what they wanted to believe, didn t match the truth that was in the  Grand Jury documents. They were so convinced by the media, of one version of events, and the truth didn t matter to them, and they couldn t handle it. So that s why it s so important to bring this to New York. Phelim goes on to remind viewers of how Mike Pence was attacked by the cast and audience when he went to see Hamilton in New York.Despite the 9 members of the cast who walked out on the play in Los Angeles and the anger the play incited in many supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, FERGUSON was very well-received by critics after its debut in Los Angeles.Watch:Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production. Please consider making a contribution to this very worthy cause by clicking HERE to donate.FERGUSON  made for a riveting spectacle and comes as a reminder both of the adversarial dramatic power that is inherent in any courtroom testimony and how even the dry language of a legal transcript can come alive when placed in the hands of skilled actors. Add a standing-room-only audience and the high stakes of this country s ongoing debate about race, police profiling and its use of lethal force, and you ve got the ingredients for an incendiary evening of theater.  -LA WEEKLYHopefully, FERGUSON the play will cause Americans to understand what really happened in Ferguson through the eyes of the people who testified to what they actually saw that day and not through the lies of the mainstream media and the false narrative of Black Lives Matter leaders and activists.",0
9657,THEY KNEW! CLOSE CLINTON FRIEND Warned Against Agreeing To Allow Sexual Predator Harvey Weinstein To Host Fundraisers…They Did It Anyway,"In June of 2016, the disgraced sexual predator, and Hollywood producer, Harvey Weinstein, hosted a fundraiser for Hillary s presidential campaign in Manhattan. Some of the top celebrities in the business accepted Harvey s invitation to the event. Celebrity donors who were in attendance at the event included Leo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, and Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick. Weinstein raised $1.8 million for Hillary at his star-studded fundraiser. When Hillary was asked if she was planning to give any of the money back or would give it to charity, the Clinton Foundation claimed they would not give back a cent, and that the money had already been spent on other  charitable purposes .  We re wondering what, exactly the Clinton Foundation means by  charitable purposes ?  Like Chelsea s wedding that was partially funded by the Clinton Foundation?A TV writer and close Clinton family friend says she warned at least three  top-level Democratic operatives  against allowing Harvey Weinstein to host fundraisers. A warning that evidently (and to the glee of Fox News) fell on deaf ears,  writes  Designing Women  creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason in a new Hollywood Reporter op-ed.Weinstein gave thousands and bundled $1.42 million in donations to Hillary Clinton s presidential run, but the former secretary of state has said she had no idea about the producer s predatory ways.Bloodworth-Thomason, who has created political promotional films for both Clintons, said she helped President Bill Clinton pen an apology amid his own sex scandal and that his actions have  taxed my feminist conscience    but she still loves him  dearly. She says she has long been aware of Weinstein s lecherous ways and is skeptical of those now claiming ignorance. Some said this despite knowing him for decades, starring in his films and being friends with accusers who starred in his films,  she writes.But although Weinstein was  at the top of the sexual predator food chain  she says the industry is rife with men like him. These kinds of atrocities against women routinely go unreported and unpunished in the entertainment industry. The No. 1 casting criterion in Hollywood is that, above all else, an actress must be  hot and f kable,  she writes.  Page Six ",0
9658,SARAH SANDERS Slams Cowgirl Congresswoman’s Criticism of Trump: ‘Appalling’ [Video],"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday blasted Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson s criticism of the president s call to a fallen soldier s widow as  appalling and disgusting,  even as the congresswoman stood by her account. I think it s appalling what the congresswoman has done and the way she s politicized this issue and the way that she s trying to make this about something that it isn t,  Sanders said during the White House press briefing.The dispute has steadily escalated   puncuated by claims and counter-claims via Twitter, briefings and interviews   ever since Wilson, D-Fla., claimed Tuesday that President Trump told the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson during a phone call that  he knew what he signed up for. Johnson was among four service members killed earlier this month during an ambush in Niger. Wilson called Trump s remarks in the phone call insensitive.Johnson s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, later backed up the congresswoman s account, telling The Associated Press that Trump showed  disrespect. But Sanders defended the president s tone. This was a president who loves our country very much, who has the greatest level of respect for men and women in the uniform and wanted to call and offer condolences to the family. And I think to try to create something from that that the congresswoman is doing is frankly appalling and disgusting,  she told reporters.Read more: Fox News",0
9659,HANNITY TEARS IT UP IN HIS BEST EVER RANT: ‘Hillary Clinton and Her Husband Sold Out America to the Russians!’ [Video],"Sean Hannity was on fire with his opening comments on the Clinton-Uranium One deal bombshell last night. He ripped the Clintons and called on Trump s intelligence and law officials to investigate the scandal. It s a classic Hannity rant:  After President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration   they were telling anyone who would listen,  Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy  Hannity mocked.  Well if that s the case, why when they have mountains of evidence that we will reveal tonight of Russian bribery going back to 2009, why then would the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20% of America s uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians? Tonight, with this new evidence, what we have discovered is that the evidence against the Clintons is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible,  Hannity continued.  Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton created a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child   giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium. IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE CLINTON-URANIUM ONE BOMBSHELL:Yesterday, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange sent a cryptic tweet that contained a series of number and letters.

Sean told his audience that Circa News Sara Carter and The Hill s John Solomon have HUGE BREAKING NEWS. Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.

Sean told his audience that Circa News Sara Carter and The Hill s John Solomon have HUGE BREAKING NEWS. Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017",0
9661,SESSIONS CALLS OUT Lying Senator In Heated Exchange During Hill Testimony: ‘Give me a break’ [Video],"Senator Al Franken tried his best to grandstand and corner Jeff Sessions in testimony on the Hill today. Sessions came back reading exact quotes of what he said in past testimony destroying Franken s attempts to mischaracterize his testimony. Sessions did a masterful job of shutting down Franken who twisted Sessions  words like all lying Democrats have done. Sessions called him out on it by insisting on having a chance to refute Franken s comments: Mr. Chairman, I do not have to sit in here and listen to his charges without having a chance to respond. Give me a break, Fox News reported:Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly and repeatedly clashed with Democratic Sen. Al Franken on Wednesday after being pressed over the accuracy of past testimony regarding his communications with the Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.In one of several testy exchanges Sessions had with Democratic senators during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Franken, D-Minn., grilled the attorney general and suggested his explanations have changed. The goal post has been moved. First it was  I did not have communications with Russians    which was not true. Then it was  I never met with Russians to discuss any political campaign    which may or may not be true. Now it is  I did not discuss interference in the campaign  which further narrows your initial blanket denial about meeting with the Russians,  Franken said.A visibly frustrated Sessions responded that,  Without hesitation, I conducted no improper discussions with Russians at any time regarding a campaign or any other item facing this country. Franken attempted to begin a second round of questioning before Sessions could respond in full to the first, but Sessions fired back. Mr. Chairman, I do not have to sit in here and listen to his charges without having a chance to respond. Give me a break,  Sessions said, noting that Franken s  lead in  to his questioning was  very, very troubling,  and that he needed more time to respond.",0
9662,CA FIRE UPDATE: Jesus Fabian Gonzalez Arrested For Suspicion of ARSON In Sanctuary County After He’s Caught Walking Away From Fire With Lighter In Pocket,"Yesterday, a man who is likely an illegal alien was arrested on suspicion of arson in the sanctuary county of Sonoma, where wildfires have devasted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Californians and destroyed structures worth billions of dollars. The only news, however, that most of America will read about today, is news of an unproven allegation by a Democrat Representative from Texas about a conversation President Trump allegedly had with a grieving military widow. This story, of course, is a much bigger story, with actual evidence that points to the very real possibility that the Sonoma County Sheriff s office has, in their custody, the arsonist who s responsible for the largest fire in California s history. It s also quite possible, that without the aid of the local and state government officials, who have gone out of their way to protect illegal aliens living in their communities, we wouldn t even be reading about these horrific wildfires.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated   about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.Breitbart   The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking  out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,  according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.LA Times    He was screaming really bad things at the police when he was arrested,  recalled David Moreno, 29, who witnessed the arrest.  He was yelling things like,  I m going to teach you a lesson you ll never forget. Three Sonoma County probation officers patrolling Maxwell Farms Regional Park just before 3 p.m. noticed a plume of smoke rising from an area near the Sonoma Creek, Sheriff s Department spokeswoman Misti Harris said.Gonzalez walked away from the fire as the officers approached, Harris said. Nobody else was in the area,  Harris said.Sonoma County Sheriff s Department deputies followed Gonzalez to a nearby McDonald s. Gonzalez had  previous contacts  with law enforcement, she said.Gonzalez told police he started the fire because he was cold, Harris said. Officers found a lighter in his pocket.*The recorded temperature at the time that the fires started was a balmy 78 degrees.Some homeless people who knew Gonzalez said that he had a habit of setting fire to brush along the creek bed.Tensions were already high in this smoke-filled region, about 25 miles east of Santa Rosa.Local mechanic Shawn Stephensen, 40, said,  A few days ago I was walking down the street with a gas can and someone driving by stopped to say,  I wouldn t be carrying a thing like that around at a time like this. At first I didn t get it,  Stephensen, who knew Gonzalez, said.  Then it dawned on me    Oh yeah, instant felony case. Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a  sanctuary county  in May 2014. The county only cooperates with  ICE holds  if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of  unreasonable searches and seizures  under the U.S. Constitution s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department s  1.0 Policy Statement  reads:  No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.  The policy adds that  the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff s Office personnel execute their duties. Gonzalez is being held on bail of $110,000, according to Sonoma County booking records   $10,000 for the felony arson charge, and $100,000 for a bench warrant issued in Ventura County.Gonzalez was scheduled to be arraigned Monday in a county jail facility because the courts were closed due to the disaster. The arraignment was closed to the public and media.Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano on Tuesday afternoon tried to tamp down speculation that Gonzalez was responsible for fires that have killed more than 40 people in Northern California and destroyed thousands of homes.Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano on Tuesday afternoon tried to tamp down speculation that Gonzalez was responsible for fires that have killed more than 40 people in Northern California and destroyed thousands of homes. There is no indication that he is responsible for these fires,  Giordano said. ",0

9665,WATCH: CNN Reporter Gets SKEWERED For MOCKING Polio Survivor Mitch McConnell After Trump Helps Him Up Stairs,"The CNN  journalist  who posted the video of President Trump helping polio survivor Mitch McConnell up the stairs, following their remarks to the press, will likely backfire, as most Americans will notice the gentle way that President Trump discreetly held Mitch McConnell s arm, as he helped him to navigate the stairs. For most Americans, this video will solidify what they already believe about him, that he is a generous and kind man and not the monster the media would like their followers to believe that he is. CNN political reporter Daniella Diaz sent a tweet on Monday pointing out that President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell locked hands while walking up stairs at the White House following their Rose Garden press conference. Diaz seemed to be mocking the Republican duo   but while followers quickly pointed out that the Kentucky senator is a polio survivor, the tweet remains on her feed nearly 24 hours later. That hand-lock between Trump and McConnell, though,  Diaz wrote with video of the incident.That hand-lock between Trump and McConnell, though. https://t.co/xFClDYCmdQ  Daniella Diaz (@DaniellaMicaela) October 16, 2017A CNN colleague called out Diaz, quoting her tweet and explaining the situation.

9666,MESSAGE TO HOLLYWOOD GOES VIRAL,"This is the best yet! A message to Hollywood that went viral. It covers most of the things we think of when we think of the hypocrisy that runs rampant there:Hollywood:You lecture us about our carbon footprints while flying on private jets.You preach feminism while brutalizing women.You castigate violence while making millions off it in your movies.You condemn guns, with armed bodyguards at your side.You are the problem, not us.WELL SAID!LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD HAD THE WORST SUMMER IN 25 YEARS:With the list of Hollywood actors and entertainers that Americans have decided to boycott over their sickening public hate for our President, is it really any wonder we re seeing the worst box office numbers in 25 years? Meryl Streep used her allotted time for accepting her lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes to trash President Trump. At the start of her dramatic speech, Streep bemoaned to her fellow liberals that Hollywood  belong to one of the most vilified segments in America right now .  It appears that she hit may have actually the nail on the head. The problem with arrogant actresses like Meryl Streep who falsely believe that because they ve been gifted with exceptional acting abilities, that Americans should fall in line with their radical political beliefs or we are ignorant.""As my friend Princess Leia said to me once: take your broken heart, make it into art."" #MerylStreep pic.twitter.com/GzOHo7O729 #GoldenGlobes  Richard Hine (@richardhine) January 9, 2017And then there s Robert DiNero, who called candidate Trump  a punk,   a pig  and  an idiot.  Only days before the election, DiNero angrily admitted that he would like to assault our soon to be President, claiming,  I d like to punch him in the face .The list of Hollywood losers who have made vile, unfounded and even threatening remarks against a man who has put his very successful life on hold in an effort to save our nation is vast. The list of Hollywood losers who have said they would like to harm our President is also rather significant, starting with Madonna who got a visit from the secret service after she told a large, adoring group of women at the Women s March in DC, that she d like to blow up the White House.And then there s  comedian  Kathy Griffin, who saw her career literally blow up after making an ISIS style video holding up a decapitated and bloodied head of President Trump. Is Hollywood s rapidly declining appeal really so surprising to most Americans who are 100% FED UP with their hate for middle-America?As Hollywood wraps up the all-important summer box-office season this Labor Day weekend, a sobering reality has gripped the industry.The number of tickets sold in the United States and Canada this summer is projected to fall to the lowest level in a quarter-century.The results have put the squeeze on the nation s top theater chains, whose stocks have taken a drubbing. AMC Theatres Chief Executive Adam Aron this month called his company s most recent quarter  simply a bust. Such blunt language reflects some worrisome trends. Domestic box-office revenue is expected to total $3.78 billion for the first weekend of May through Labor Day   a key period that generates about 40% of domestic ticket sales   down nearly 16% from the same period last year, according to comScore. That s an even worse decline than the 10% drop some studio executives predicted before the summer began.  LA TimesBreitbart   Even before this catastrophic Labor Day weekend is factored in (more on this below), the domestic 2017 box office is in hideous shape. This year is  6.3% behind 2016 and continues to fall behind 2015, 2013, and 2012.If you figure in inflation, those numbers are even worse. For example, in 2012 the average ticket cost $7.96. Today it is almost a full dollar more at $8.89. Yeah, things are that bad and will look even worse on Tuesday.With no apparent faith in their own product, this is the first Labor Day in 25 years where a new title has not been released on more than 1,000 screens. Over this weekend last year, the box office hauled in nearly $130 million. This year will do about a third of that.Summer attendance is at a 25-year low.The summer box office is down a whopping  16% compared to 2016.Can a handful of titles   It, Kingsman 2, Bladerunner 2, Thor 3, Justice League, Star Wars 8   save an entire year? Doubtful. Pull out of a dive? Maybe. Still, we are talking about only six big titles over four months, which is about on par with last year s Passengers, Rogue One, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Inferno, Sully, and Magnificent Seven.",0

You think that I would somehow behave in a way that I would block everything just because of some personal disagreement? That s a dumb question. Doocy s question really isn t too far off. We could begin with McCain s shocking vote for keeping Obamacare. Since then, the war of words between President Trump and McCain has only gotten more heated.OUR LATEST ON THE FEUD BETWEEN THE SENATOR AND THE PRESIDENT:President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump s policies. RINO McCain famously demolished the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in a dramatic show during the vote. McCain came onto the floor at the end of the Senate vote and voted no with a dramatic thumbs down motion.McCain has been at odds with Trump since Trump questioned McCains status as a war hero. It seems McCain has had it out for Trump ever since.Another bombshell on the McCain/Trump feud hypothesizes that the Trump Dossier could have come from McCain.The latest slam to Trump happened just last night  during a speech McCain gave. McCain called out Trump s nationalism but it didn t take long for Trump to respond:President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a warning shot after Republican Sen. John McCain questioned  half-baked, spurious nationalism  in America s foreign policy.Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington that  people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.  The president added  I m being very, very nice but at some point I fight back and it won t be pretty. MANY QUESTIONS RAISED ON MCCAIN S STORY OF CAPTIVITYTrump could be referring to new questions about McCain s captivity in Vietnam. McCain has always been touted as a war hero for decades but many of the men who served when he did have raised questions about McCain.McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent 5  years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp and is battling brain cancer, offered a simple response to Trump:  I have faced tougher adversaries. In Philadelphia on Monday night, the six-term Republican senator from Arizona received an award for a lifetime of service and sacrifice to the country. In addition to recalling his more than two decades of military service and his imprisonment during the war, McCain took a moment to go a step further than the night s other speakers, who lamented what many described as a fractured political climate.MCCAIN S GLOBALIST WORD SALAD: To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems,  he said,  is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history. He continued:  We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. Former Vice President Joe Biden presented McCain with the Liberty Medal. Though members of opposing parties, the two men worked together during their time in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama, who defeated McCain in his bid for the presidency in 2008, congratulated the senator on the award in a tweet Monday night. I m grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for his lifetime of service to our country. Congratulations, John, on receiving this year s Liberty Medal,  Obama wrote.Trump said in the radio interview that McCain voted against Republican efforts to dismantle Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act.He says the vote was a  shocker.

9668,YIKES! ACADEMY AWARD WINNING Actor Starring In Harvey Weinstein’s New Batman Movie: “Children UNDER 16 Are Immensely Attractive”,"Batman fans who have been looking forward to the upcoming Batman sequel,  Justice League , a Harvey Weinstein produced movie, that is set to be released before Christmas of 2017, have taken to social media, demanding that the studio replace the Batman actor Ben Affleck. A close friend of the now disgraced Hollywood kingpin producer and sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein, Ben Affleck, has received quite a bit of criticism after women in the industry came forward to accuse him of being complicit in Weinstein s behavior, and have even accused him of disgusting and inappropriate sexual behavior toward women in the industry.The lone female superhero, Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman in the upcoming movie, recently came out with a statement of support for fellow actresses who have been victims of sexual abuse and condemnation for their sexual harassers: Ben Affleck, who stars as Batman in the Harvey Weinstein Batman Vs. Superman movie is not the only actor who should be shunned by moviegoers. It s time for the spotlight to be shined on a few of the other actors in the Weinstein movie, including  Justice League  actor Jeremy Irons.Actor Jeremy Irons, who won a  Best Actor  Academy Award for his role in  Reversal of Fortune , is set to play the role of Batman s butler, Alfred J. Pennyworthy in Weinstein s Batman sequel  Justice League . Hollywood has clearly been ignoring sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, and Ben Affleck for decades, so it s not too surprising that Jeremy Irons has somehow managed to escape scrutiny by the media, and by his fellow Hollywood actors, after the disgusting remarks he made following his lead role as a pedophile in the controversial  Lolita  movie.In 1998, Jeremy Irons starred as a pedophile in the movie Lolita, that was based on a 1955 novel written by Russian American novelist Vladimir Nabokov. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator a middle-aged literature professor called Humbert Humbert is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather.  Lolita  is his private nickname for Dolores.Telegraph   The actor Jeremy Irons, who starred in the film Lolita, says the  hysteria  sweeping the country over pedophilia is damaging relations between adults and children.Irons, who has two sons with his wife Sinead Cusack, says it is important to uphold a rigid social morality but also vital that adults are allowed to show affection to children.Pedophilia should be treated as a disease, he says in a BBC interview to be screened next week. But it must also be recognized that children are attractive and that parental love has a  sexual  element. It is very difficult because children under 16 are immensely attractive,  he says.  Any father will tell you. I think our children have to be protected. But I don t think we need to have hysteria. In the interview, Irons says his character was not a pedophile in the strict sense, as he  knew that what he was doing was wrong . Referring to his family, he describes the difficulties of judging the line between natural affection and pedophilia. I remember when my son was 12 and he was like a god. He just went through that sort of golden time for about 18 months. I don t have a daughter but they do the same. Parental love is sexual. Children practice on their parents. Girls will flirt outrageously with their fathers because they are practicing. But we should know that that is practice. Boys will flirt outrageously with their mothers in a different way. His comments were seized on by child protection charities. The NSPCC said:  Such comments are ambiguous and could be interpreted by sex offenders as a justification for their behavior. Esther Rantzen, the chairman of ChildLine, said:  The words  immensely attractive  are not the best thing to say about children under 16.  Appealing or charming  are more appropriate. Irons, 56, made the remarks when asked about his portrayal of Humbert Humbert, the lecturer who falls for a young girl in the film of Vladimir Nabokov s novel Lolita. When the film came out in 1998, he suggested that child abuse did not always ruin the life of the victim.In the video below, Jeremy Irons arrogantly discusses his own brilliance as he portrays a pedophile in  Lolita . Go to the 7:50 mark to hear Irons tell the interviewers how  devastatingly attractive  many 15-year-old girls are. The greatness of the performance that Dominique Swain gives, is that she is all of our daughters. Funny, wacky, silly, attractive, because many girls of 15 are devastatingly attractive. WATCH:Irons also once posed the question about whether or not a son should be able to marry his father:NYDN -Academy Award-winning actor Jeremy Irons said Wednesday that while he doesn t have much of a strong opinion either way on same-sex marriage, he believes it poses interesting questions, including whether allowing same-sex marriage would open the door for interfamilial relationships. Could a father not marry his son?  Irons asked HuffPost Live host Josh Zepps. Irons argued that  it s not incest between men  because  incest is there to protect us from inbreeding, but men don t breed,  and wondered whether same-sex marriage might allow fathers to pass on their estates to their sons without being taxed.Jason Momoa who plays  Aquaman  in in Weinstein s  Justice League  movie was recently attacked on social media after a video was being circulated of him making a disgusting  joke  during a public forum, where he bragged about the benefit of being able to play  Khal Drogo  on the  Game of Thrones  series, and how he is able to  rape beautiful women and get away with it .

9670,PRESIDENT TRUMP Issues Warning To John McCain After Senator’s ‘Tough’ Speech,"President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump s policies. RINO McCain famously demolished the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in a dramatic show during the vote. McCain came onto the floor at the end of the Senate vote and voted no with a dramatic thumbs down motion.McCain has been at odds with Trump since Trump questioned McCains status as a war hero. It seems McCain has had it out for Trump ever since.Another bombshell on the McCain/Trump feud hypothesizes that the Trump Dossier could have come from McCain.The latest slam to Trump happened just last night  during a speech McCain gave. McCain called out Trump s nationalism but it didn t take long for Trump to respond:President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a warning shot after Republican Sen.

9671,"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Hillary, Obama, Holder, Comey, Mueller and 2 Key Officials Leading Trump-Russia Collusion Investigation Are All Linked To HUGE Secret Russian NUCLEAR Deal","Yesterday, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange sent a cryptic tweet that contained a series of number and letters. Someone out there knows what that code means, and they are very likely shaking in their boots today.4767 5774 6a7a 4d6c 6330 666b 314a 3453 0000 0907 84b4 f787 7616 86f7 a737 5707 5736  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 15, 2017On another front, two writers from separate publications were set to publish what Sean Hannity was calling a  huge bombshell  story that was due to break today.Last night on Fox News  Hannity show, Sean Hannity warned that a huge bombshell would be breaking today. Sean told his audience that Circa News Sara Carter and The Hill s John Solomon have HUGE BREAKING NEWS. Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017 ",0

9673,ONE BRUTAL IMAGE Perfectly Captures The Truth About Hillary’s Plans To “Donate” Weinstein’s Campaign Contributions,"A spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation claims the group will not return Weinstein s donations, which totaled between $100,000 and $250,000.Because oops! The Clinton Foundation has already spent the money. But don t worry, Harvey s dirty money went to very good causes supporting women and children. And we all know how much Bill loves to take care of women This image by cartoonist Antonio F. Branco, perfectly illustrates just how generous the Clinton s are with their charitable donations.The spokesman said the foundation already spent the money on its programs, such as lowering the cost of HIV medication and supporting women and girls in developing countries.The foundation said it supports commitments to combat human trafficking, and runs the No Ceilings Project  which aims to advance the full participation of girls and women around the world  through  data-driven analysis on gender inequality, an in-depth conversation series, innovative partnerships, and CGI commitments. The explanation comes after foundation board member Chelsea Clinton ducked questions about Weinstein s money from a DailyMail.com reporter while attending a Clinton Global Initiative University event at Northeastern University in Boston on Saturday.The former first daughter hustled out a side door after the event, evading a reporter as she rushed to her car surrounded by aides and security.The Clinton Foundation and a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton had previously declined to comment on the Weinstein matter.Organizations have been divided on whether to return money to Weinstein, who gave to numerous political and philanthropic causes over the years.

Trump responded that her way of agreeing with the players disrespecting our flag is the reason she lost the election, saying,  Well, that s why she l the election. I mean honestly, it s that thinking is why she lost the election. Trump said that he believes that Hillary s statement  in itself, is very disrespectful to our country.

Behar suggested that Eminem was being brave because literally no one in Hollywood or the music industry has taken such a stand,  That s why you need to give him [Eminem] credit because very few people in the industry will go out and say,  I don t care if you don t support me. This is more important than, than my popularity.  I have never seen it, frankly.  Really Joy?

She went on to condemn Trump for using Twitter and other means of communication to express his conservative views and then told the excessively liberal panel that,  I just thought it was very brave. That s when Meghan McCain, who appeared to be silently seething, as she listened to these morons speak to viewers as though they re speaking to an audience who s been living on an alternate planet, or don t have any access to real news finally spoke up, saying,  Actually, It s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood. That s when Whoopi lost it Whoopi made a complete fool of herself when she embarrassingly attempted to prove that Meghan McCain doesn t understand history and that communism in Hollywood was really a right-wing movement. Huh? Whoopi then doubled down and suggested in her condescending tone that a simple trip to Amazon to purchase a few books should help Meghan to understand the history of Hollywood, that of course, only Whoopi truly understands. Whoopi then embarrassed herself again when she tried to prove how many conservatives are working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show,  Last Man Standing  was just clearly canceled by ABC for political reasons. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck who hasn t acted in a major movie or television show for decades. Selleck s career peaked in the 1990 s. Outside of his occasional appearances on  Friends  as Monica s boyfriend, Selleck s career has been almost non-existent.Meghan tried to explain to the panel that liberals are treated horribly in Hollywood and that it s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood than a conservative.  She said that she lived in Los Angeles and that she was never more harassed than when she was living there. Meghan told that cast that it s more popular to be an Obama and Hillary, and even Bernie supporter.Whoopi then embarrassed herself again, when she tried to convince the panel that Meghan s assertion that conservatives are blacklisted in Hollywood is ridiculous. Whoopi laughed and corrected McCain saying,  Except that all of the conservatives in Hollywood are working. They re the ones that are working.   She tried to recall some examples of conservatives working in Hollywood.  The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show,  Last Man Standing  was recently canceled by ABC for his political views. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck. Wow, 2 conservatives in Hollywood! Way to NOT prove your point Whoopi Watch: ",0

9678,WHY FORD’S DARK SECRET May Come Back To Haunt Them Over Owner’s Support of NFL Protests,"Founder of the Ford Motor Company, Henry Ford, made no secret of the fact that he disliked Jewish people. More precisely, he disliked  the Jew    an abstract impression of what Ford imagined to be a sinister people bent on controlling the world.Not only did he make no secret of his contempt, but he launched a weekly newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, in 1919 to promote his paranoid views. He pressed Ford retailers to sell subscriptions.In the end, historians say, Ford assisted some of the greatest evil and genocide in history by fueling the anti-Semitism of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in the 1920s. According to press reports, Hitler had a portrait of Henry Ford on his office wall and a copy of The International Jew, published by Ford, on his desk.   Crains Business Detroit Should anyone be shocked by a Sheriff s decision to not want to support a car brand, after their decision to openly support a movement started to create hate and distrust for our law enforcement? The Bossier Parish (La.) Sheriff s Office is boycotting its local Ford dealership because of Ford Motor Company s support for protests of the National Anthem by National Football League (NFL) players at games, Sheriff Julian Whittington announced Wednesday.Sheriff Whittington sent a letter to Hixson Ford of Alexandria notifying the dealership that his office would no longer purchase Ford vehicles for  as long as Ford sides with those who have no regard for the men and women who protect and serve this great nation : Yes, the NFL players have a right to protest as they deem necessary, but we, the Bossier Sheriff s Office and the taxpayers of Bossier Parish have a right to spend our money elsewhere,  Whittington says in his letter posted on the office s Facebook page. It is my hope that this letter will cause you to encourage Ford Motor Co. to change their advertising choice and cease to support the NFL with advertising dollars until the NFL leadership demands its players show proper respect for our nation s colors.  After the letter to Hixson Automotive was received by Dallas L. Hixson, the Sheriff discussed the issue with Mr. Hixson, the Sheriff s office told CNSNews.com. Mr. Hixson informed Sheriff Whittington that he was not aware of Ford Motor Company s support for NFL players who wish to protest during the National Anthem or during the game.Hixson told Sheriff Whittington that such a stance concerns him as well, and he will be taking the Sheriff s letter with him to Detroit to present to Ford Motor Co. leadership in the near future.Sheriff Whittington says he is sending copies of the letter to each of the state s 63 other sheriffs, as well as both the national and Louisiana sheriffs  associations.National Sheriffs  Association (NSA) Executive Director Jonathan Thompson tells CNSNews.com that NSA has received the letter and that sheriffs have both the authority and obligation to authorize, or decline, purchases based on the best interests of law enforcement and their communities: Sheriffs have the obligation to decide which products they authorize for bids, procurements and purchases. They choose, based upon a variety of requirements and capabilities, but also whom they believe is best able to support the broad needs of law enforcement and the communities they protect  Since 2016, the Bossier Sheriff s Office has spent $747,132 and purchased 29 vehicles patronizing Hixon Autoplex. The Sheriff s Office provided the following breakdown to CNSNews.com:In 2016, BSO purchased 14 vehicles from Hixson Autoplex, costing $346,519.50. They included:One 2015 Ford F-150 Two 2015 Ford F-250 Six 2017 Ford Police Interceptor One 2017 Ford Explorer Three 2016 Ford Taurus One 2017 Ford Taurus In 2017, BSO purchased 15 vehicles from Hixson Autoplex, costing $400,612.50. They included:Fifteen 2017 Ford Police Interceptor Ford Motor Company issued a statement in late September supporting the right of the players to protest the National Anthem at NFL games, Bloomberg reports: Ford, for example, said the automaker would  respect individuals  rights to express their views, even if they are not ones we share.

9679,REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER WATCH Arrogant JIMMY KIMMEL Again After What He Just Said About Them ,"Apparently, Kimmel s okay with throwing half of his audience away over his uncontrollable hate for Donald Trump and his supporters. The big question is, will parent company ABC be okay with Kimmel insulting, and driving 50% of his audience away?Late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel said he would perform the same emotionally-charged monologues about healthcare and gun violence  again in a heartbeat,  despite a drastic reduction in Republican viewership of his show. Three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats,  Kimmel told CBS   Sunday Morning  of  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  which has aired on ABC since 2003.  And then Republican numbers went way down, like 30 percent, or whatever. And you know, as a talk show host, that s not ideal but I would do it again in a heartbeat. Kimmel earned high praise and sharp rebukes for his foray into the healthcare debate in September, an issue that became particularly important to the comic after his six-month-old son Billy was born with a rare congenital heart defect.He also garnered similar reactions when he choked up during a monologue imploring Congress to act on gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre earlier in October.Critics like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro have slammed Kimmel for parading as a  moral arbiter. I m not. I mean, I agree with him. I m nobody s moral arbiter,  Kimmel told CBS.  You don t have to watch the show. You don t have to listen to what I say. A defiant Kimmel added that he doesn t say  I don t mind  because he preferred  everyone with a television to watch the show. But if they re so turned off by my opinion on healthcare and gun violence then, I don t know, I probably wouldn t want to have a conversation with them anyway,  he continued.  Not good riddance, but riddance.   Washington ExaminerKimmel has been known to mock Trump over comments he made to Billy Bush several years ago about a woman in the privacy of the bus they were traveling on together. Jimmy Kimmel never counted, however, on this video resurfacing where he asks random women to  feel  what s in his pants and then tell the TV audience what it is. Pretty funny, huh?

THE MONEY HAD ALREADY BEEN SPENT???The foundation s decision comes as politicians and philanthropic groups grapple with whether to return donations they have received from Weinstein, after numerous women stepped forward this month to accuse the movie mogul of sexual assault, harassment and rape.HILLARY LIES AGAIN:The Clinton Foundation faced questions about Weinstein s funding after Hillary Clinton said last week she would re-gift his campaign donations to charity.

The explanation comes after foundation board member Chelsea Clinton ducked questions about Weinstein s money from a DailyMail.com reporter while attending a Clinton Global Initiative University event at Northeastern University in Boston on Saturday.The former first daughter hustled out a side door after the event, evading a reporter as she rushed to her car surrounded by aides and security.The Clinton Foundation and a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton had previously declined to comment on the Weinstein matter.Organizations have been divided on whether to return money to Weinstein, who gave to numerous political and philanthropic causes over the years.Read more: Daily Mail",0
9681,BOOM! CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SOARS To Level Americans Haven’t Seen Since Another Republican Was President…MEDIA SILENT,"Prior to the 2016 election (Oct  16) consumer confidence measured by the University of Michigan was indexed at 87.2 Today that same confidence rating is 101.1 A stunning 15.9% increase. Similarly, consumer expectations were indexing 76.8 in October 2016 and now stand at 91.3, an increase of 18.9%.   Conservative TreehouseBusiness Insider   US consumers haven t been this optimistic about the economy since the start of 2004, according to a survey conducted by the University of Michigan.The consumer-sentiment index registered a preliminary October reading of 101.1, a monthly report showed Friday.The data suggest that consumer spending will likely continue to support the economy through at least mid-2018, at which time this economic expansion would become the second-longest since the 19th century. US economic growth in the second quarter rose to a two-year high on stronger consumer and business spending, a late-September report showed.The surge in optimism  reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected,  said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the survey. This  as good as it gets  outlook is supported by a moderation in the expected pace of growth in both personal finances and the overall economy, accompanied by a growing sense that, even with this moderation, it would still mean the continuation of good economic times.

9682,WATCH: FORMER CHILD ACTOR Tried To Call Out Powerful Hollywood Pedophiles on The View…Barbara Walters and Female Co-Host Shamed Him: “You’re damaging an entire industry!”,"Child actor Corey Feldman appeared on The View in 2013 to talk about his book that exposed some of the richest and most powerful people in the business [Hollywood], who are pedophiles that prey on young actors. Corey s brave admission of his experiences in Hollywood should have been treated as a public service announcement for parents who had child actors working in Hollywood, as he was giving them a  heads up  to take the extra steps to protect them. Instead, he was shamed Feldman appeared in a 2103 episode of The View where Barbara Walters and Star Jones went out of their way to discredit and shut him up. I m saying there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey [Haim] that are still working. They re still out there, and that are some of the richest most powerful people in this business. Walters tried to interupt, but Feldman continued,  And they do not want me saying what I am saying right now. Walters asked Feldman,  Are you saying they are pedophiles  and that they are still in this business?  Feldman replied,  Yes. Feldman went on to say,  They don t want me here right now. They want me dead! Star Jones quickly jumped in to try to shut Feldman up so he doesn t scare parents who want their kids in the industry.Feldman clarified, that he s just warning parents to  be careful what you wish for. Don t go into it with naivety.  Instead of considering Feldman s warning, that may be of interest to parents who have children in the industry, Walters interrupted him to admonish him,  You re damaging an entire industry! Feldman apologized,  I m sorry. After several years of being shamed by his peers and high-profile women in the industry like Barbara Walters, child actor Corey Feldman may finally find someone who will finally take him seriously, now that Harvey Weinstein has been exposed.Cernovich   The recent exposure of serial sexual predator and Hollywood Democrat kingpin Harvey Weinstein raises, even more, questions than it answers.In a now famous photo, Weinstein can be seen grabbing young actress Emma Watson in a compromising position.While the public controversy currently centers around Weinstein s sexual abuse of power over young women, the question remains   how young were Weinstein s victims?Former child actor Corey Feldman has publicly stated that  I was molested and passed around,  while discussing how in Hollywood adult males in the industry would pass young stars  back and forth to each other.  Feldman revealed that his co-star Corey Haim was raped at 11-years-old.Actor Elijah Wood confirmed Feldman s claims in May 2016, describing Hollywood as a den of  vipers  in an interview, and saying  If you can imagine it, it s probably happened. Wood said he was protected from abuse by his mother, who didn t let him go to Hollywood parties, but he said other young child actors were regularly  preyed upon  by those in power.Wood also compared Hollywood s sexual predators with known pedophile and English TV personality Jimmy Savile. You all grew up with Savile,  Wood said.  Jesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized. X-Men director Bryan Singer is among those publicly accused of sexual abuse of young boys in Hollywood.",0

9686,COLLEGE QB Kneed Out Of Anger Over Trump’s Remarks About NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag…Immediately Gets Bad News From Coach,"He was given the option to kneel in protest before the game, but it was more important for him to take a stand against our President for bravely taking a public stance in defense of our flag and for our veterans A liberal arts college in eastern Pennsylvania cut its backup quarterback after he knelt during the national anthem.Albright College in Reading cut Gyree Durante from its team after he took a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.According to the paper, the school promised consequences if players took actions different than those made in a special agreement.The team s  leadership council  decided that the squad would take a knee during the pregame coin toss, but stand for the national anthem. I knew the consequences. I knew that if I took a knee, that there would be a good chance that I would be kicked off. I didn t like the whole taking a knee during the coin toss, I just thought it defeated the whole purpose of kneeing for the anthem. I get the whole team unity thing, but at the end of the day, I also thought that we should be allowed to be individuals, and express ourselves. The week before, I was watching NFL football, and I happened to see some of the remarks by President Trump about, uh, regarding NFL players taking a knee during the anthem, and he said that they should be fired, they should be kicked off and things like that. I already knew that it was an issue with, all of the racial and social injustice and you know, police brutality among African Americans and things like that.  But when I heard the President say something about it, and, it was very negative, it just kinda struck a nerve with me and it made me think, if this is how the President feels,  then Idefinitelyy need to take a need and protest this.  (Go here for video)After Durante knelt, the Division III Lions went on to lose to Delaware Valley University, from nearby Doylestown, by 41-6.Durante s name was wiped from the team roster and a college spokesperson said in a statement obtained by ESPN that the Norristown, Pa. native was dismissed for his actions.

9687,PUMPKIN SPICE LATTES ARE RACIST? Feminists Are Going After Starbucks [Video],"The left is really great at eating its own. Feminists think Starbucks has a special drink that s racist and they re going after the coffee house because of it. No, we didn t make this up. Just listen to Tucker Carlson s dismay at how ridiculous this is:WEIRDEST CLAIM EVER: PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE = WHITE SUPREMACY: Pumpkin spice just doesn t taste as good when you add a shot of racism,  a feminist leader explained as the fall flavor began to pop up in coffee shops around the country. This is a shockingly weird claim, but it shouldn t be surprising.In an editorial published last month, we wrote about the Left s effort to broaden the boundaries of concepts such as white supremacy and racism in a way that impugns the conduct of well-meaning people. Now, a feminist nonprofit is running a campaign to convince festive imbibers of Pumpkin Spice Lattes they re unknowingly boosting the cause of white supremacy.The co-founder of UltraViolet issued the  shot of racism  statement Sept. 6. I knew Starbucks had a secret menu, but the baristas must really be keeping these racism shots on the down low.A social media post from the group informed readers:  That favorite fall drink of yours is funding rent payments to white supremacy. Given the severity of the campaign s language, one may assume profits from sales of Starbucks  beloved PSLs are being surreptitiously redirected to the Klan or neo-Nazi groups. In fact, UltraViolet s actual complaint is that a couple of Starbucks  24,000 locations happen to be in properties owned by the Trump Organization.According to UltraViolet s logic, by patronizing any of Starbucks  thousands of stores, average consumers of the signature fall beverage are directly boosting the cause of white supremacy.

This team has sweeping authority and an open-ended mission, yet they are allowed to operate largely in secret, selected by and ultimately accountable to only one person: Mr. Mueller himself,  the letter sent to House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley states.Texas Republican Rep. Brian Babin started asking his colleagues to sign the letter in August. The congressmen who signed on include: Iowa Rep. Steve King, Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, California Rep. Duncan Hunter, and Virginia Rep. Dave Brat.The Mueller team has overwhelmingly supported Democrats and even worked for Democrats. Donations were also mostly to Democrat candidates:It s hard to dispute that this team of lawyers are biased against a Republican like Trump who came into D.C. ready to upset the status quo.Read more: DC",0
9689,"ACTRESS ACCUSES Weinstein Buddy, Actor GEORGE CLOONEY Of Helping To “Blacklist” Her After She Reported Sexual Harassment","The Hill   During a recent interview, Clooney describes conservative criticism of Democrats associated with film producer Harvey Weinstein as  a little pot and kettle,  noting the prior sexual harassment allegations levied against conservative figures like Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly. Yeah, that s a little pot and kettle there, unfortunately. But I think that everything gets politicized these days. The reality is that this is a problem deeply ingrained in our society,  Clooney told The Daily Beast when asked about criticisms coming from conservatives in the days since a New York Times report that detailed accusations of sexual harassment against Weinstein. It was something that was talked about a lot on the left with Roger Ailes, Bill O Reilly, and Donald Trump, and it s something that s going to be talked about a lot on the right with Harvey Weinstein,  Clooney added. I think that rather than politicize it, there should be talk on both sides about the really bad behavior by powerful men and the horrible acts they commit. It s pretty crazy to me.

9690,REPORTER TO CLINTON: ‘So you still blame others more than yourself for loss?’ [VIDEO],"British TV journalist Matt Frei asked Hillary Clinton if she s still blaming other more than herself in an interview Friday: Your dynastic appeal or perhaps it was the opposite: The fact that you were called Clinton the fact that you were first lady basically trumped any novelty if you forgive the term of being the first female president of the United States,  he said.  People looked at your name and your legacy more than they looked at your gender. Clinton answered in her usual delusional way by laying out the amount of support she THINKS she received and then blaming former FBI director James Comey and the Russians for her defeat: That doesn t explain why I led all the way through, why I won the primary by 4 million votes, why I was winning, we had a great convention,  she said.  I was thought to have won all three debates. That doesn t explain it, Matt, so that s why I had to really dig deep. And, yes, I take responsibility. Obviously, there were things I must have been able to do differently in order to have won,  Clinton continued.  But at the end, there was this really perfect storm, and so you had the Comey letter and you had the enormous impact of the Russian theft of emails, the release of them by WikiLeaks, basically now a part of the Russian intelligence apparatus, and the weaponization of that. These were all new phenomena. So you re still blaming others more than yourself?  Frei asked I DON T BLAME OTHERS ??? No, I take ultimate responsibility, I don t blame others, but I think it s important that people understand what happened,  Clinton said.  It easy to say,  You know she wasn t a good candidate.  Then why did lead all the way to the end, why did I get nominated overwhelmingly? Did people lie at the polls?  Frei interjected. No, I think there were intervening events that caused people to worry, to have second thoughts,  she said.Read more: WFB",0
9691,BUSTED! FBI Hid Clinton-Lynch Tarmac Meeting Documents…Delay Turning Over," The FBI is out of control. It is stunning that the FBI  found  these Clinton-Lynch tarmac records only after we caught the agency hiding them in another lawsuit.    Judicial Watch Tom Fitton.FBI hid 30 documents related to Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting. https://t.co/8JJTDR4G47  Real Jack (@RealJack) October 14, 2017BUSTED! THANK GOODNESS FOR JUDICIAL WATCH!Judicial Watch was informed yesterday by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that the FBI has located 30 pages of documents related to the June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, and proposes non-exempt material be produced no later than November 30, 2017 (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:16-cv-02046)).The new documents are being sent to Judicial Watch in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the Justice Department failed to comply with a July 7, 2016, FOIA request seeking the following:All FD-302 forms prepared pursuant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s use of a private e-mail server during her tenure. All records of communications between any agent, employee, or representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding, concerning, or related to the aforementioned investigation. This request includes, but is not limited to, any related communications with any official, employee, or representative of the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President, the Democratic National Committee, and/or the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.All records related to the meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016. The FBI originally informed Judicial Watch they did not locate any records related to the tarmac meeting. However, in a related case, the Justice Department located emails in which Justice Department officials communicated with the FBI and wrote that they had communicated with the FBI. As a result, by letter dated August 10, 2017, from the FBI stated,  Upon further review, we subsequently determined potentially responsive documents may exist. As a result, your [FOIA] request has been reopened (Surprisingly, the Trump Justice Department refuses to disclose the talking points developed by the Obama Justice Department to help it respond to press inquiries about the controversial June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.)On June 27, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked private plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton s email server, and mere hours before the Benghazi report was released publicly involving both Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting. The FBI is out of control. It is stunning that the FBI  found  these Clinton-Lynch tarmac records only after we caught the agency hiding them in another lawsuit,  stated Judicial Watch Tom Fitton.  Judicial Watch will continue to press for answers about the FBI s document games in court. In the meantime, the FBI should stop the stonewall and release these new records immediately. This case has also forced the FBI to release to the public the FBI s Clinton investigative file, although more than half of the records remain withheld. The FBI has also told Judicial Watch that it anticipates completing the processing of these materials by July 2018.There is significant controversy about whether the FBI and Obama Justice Department investigation gave Clinton and other witnesses and potential targets preferential treatment.The Obama administration extended numerous immunity agreements, including: Clinton s former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills; John Bentel, former director of the State Department s Office of Information Resources Management; Heather Samuelson, Clinton s executive assistant; Brian Pagliano, an IT employee at the State Department who serviced the Clinton non-government server; and an employee at Platt River Networks, the company that maintained it. It is not clear whether Hillary Clinton received some type of immunity.In 2015, a political action committee run by McAuliffe, a close friend and political supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, donated nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe, wife of McCabe, who was then running for the Virginia State Senate. Also, the Virginia Democratic Party, over which McAuliffe had significant influence, donated an additional $207,788 to the Jill McCabe campaign. In July 2015, Andrew McCabe was in charge of the FBI s Washington, DC, field office, which provided personnel resources to the Clinton email probe. Judicial Watch has several lawsuits about this McCabe/FBI/Clinton scandal.Via: Judicial Watch ",0
9692,"LOL! HILLARY Commends Weinstein Accusers For Coming Forward, Says Sex Claims Against Bill Are “Clearly In The Past”…Claims Trump Has “Admitted To Being A Sexual Assaulter In The Oval Office”","Hillary Clinton today falsely called Donald Trump an  admitted sex assaulter  and compared him to disgraced alleged sex abuser Harvey Weinstein.The failed Democratic presidential candidate, who received thousands in campaign funding from Weinstein, told the BBC s Andrew Marr  we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office. She was referring to the Access Hollywood tape leaked during the campaign where Donald Trump was heard boasting about  grabbing women by the p****y  in 2005.Mrs. Clinton is in the UK to promote her hand-wringing book about losing the presidential election.She told Marr:  I was really shocked and appalled because I ve known him through politics as many Democrats have.Team player Hillary Clinton tries to deflect attention from the millions of dollars Harvey Weinstein raised for her recent failed presidential campaign by reminding reporters that he also donated to Obama and,  for people (she forgot to mention that he ONLY funded DEMOCRAT people) who have run for office in the United States. He s been a supporter   he s been a funder for all of us, for Obama, for me, for people who have run for office in the United States.  So it was just disgusting and the stories that have come out are heartbreaking. But I think that it s important that we not just focus on him and whatever consequences flow from these stories about his behavior but that we recognize this kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it s in entertainment, politics. After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office. There has to be a recognition that we must stand against this kind of action that is so sexist and misogynistic.  And asked about allegations of sexual misconduct leveled at her husband and former president, Bill Clinton, she said:  That has all been litigated. That was the subject of a huge investigation in the late 90s and there were conclusions drawn. That was clearly in the past. It is something that has to be taken seriously, for anyone not just in entertainment. The really sad part of the campaign was how this horrific tape, what he said about women in the past what he said about women during the campaign, was discounted by a lot of voters.   DMLOL! Hillary. You re the only one left standing who believes a single word that comes out of your lying mouth. ",0
9693,CONGRESS WARNED Threat of Nuclear EMP Attack Has Never Been Higher: “N. Korean EMP Attack Would Kill ‘90% of All Americans’,"While fecklessness towards the emerging North Korean threat characterized the Clinton and Bush  43 administrations, we find ourselves needlessly exposed to its present magnitude in no small measure because Obama s so-called strategic patience was characterized by inaction on two, vital fronts: advancing the U.S. missile defense capabilities and protecting the grid against electromagnetic pulse and other perils.Barack Obama and his subordinates brought to office a visceral enmity towards missile defense, born of an ideological attachment to the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union, which prevented the United States from having any effective anti-missile systems. While George W. Bush formally withdrew us from the ABM Treaty in 2002, the capabilities of such defenses as have been put into place have been deliberately limited   so much so that they were reportedly not up to the task of shooting down the ballistic missile Pyongyang fired over Japan last week.Team Obama was convinced that it would rid the world of nuclear weapons and so declined to take seriously, let alone do anything appreciable about, the danger that one or more detonated outside the atmosphere over the United States could destroy our most critical of critical infrastructures: the electric grid. Late in his presidency, Mr. Obama did evince concern about a similar, nation-ending effect being caused by intense solar storms, but did little to make the grid resilient against that source of destructive electromagnetic pulses, either.   Frank J. Gaffney, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Reagan administration, and President of the Center for Security PolicyWashington Examiner   Congress was warned Thursday that North Korea is capable of attacking the U.S. today with a nuclear EMP bomb that could indefinitely shut down the electric power grid and kill 90 percent of  all Americans  within a year.At a House hearing, experts said that North Korea could easily employ the  doomsday scenario  to turn parts of the U.S. to ashes.In calling on the Pentagon and President Trump to move quickly to protect the grid, the experts testified that an explosion of a high-altitude nuclear bomb delivered by a missile or satellite  could be to shut down the U.S. electric power grid for an indefinite period, leading to the death within a year of up to 90 percent of all Americans. Two members of the former congressional EMP commission said the threat to the U.S. has never been higher, in part because of the current high level of saber-rattling by both sides and North Korea s surprising display over the past six months of its ability to deliver on its threats. With the development of small nuclear arsenals and long-range missiles by new, radical U.S. adversaries, beginning with North Korea, the threat of a nuclear EMP attack against the U.S. becomes one of the few ways that such a country could inflict devastating damage to the United States. It is critical, therefore, that the U.S. national leadership address the EMP threat as a critical and existential issue, and give a high priority to assuring the leadership is engaged and the necessary steps are taken to protect the country from EMP,  the experts told a House Homeland Security subcommittee.Watch the discussion about the threat of an EMP attack on the United States with congressional members here: ",0

9695,MYSTERIOUS TWITTER ACCOUNT: NFL’s Goodell Gets Help From Shocking Source,"Well, this is embarrassing! The NFL commissioner was getting help from a helicopter wife who set up a fake twitter account to counter any negative press on her husband. It s pretty shocking because his wife is former Fox analyst Jane Skinner Goodell who should know better because she s in the news business. Did she really think people wouldn t find out who was constantly tweeting support for Goodell?Roger Goodell s wife set up a secret Twitter account to clap back at the NFL commissioner s detractors, according to the Wall Street Journal.The Twitter account, under the name  Jones smith,  has no followers, no profile picture and has been virtually dormant for long periods since its creation in 2014.@forargument is no longer active as of Thursday afternoon but according to the report, it was owned and operated by Goodell s wife, Jane Skinner Goodell, and often clashed with sports media outlets that produced content critical of the commissioner.Under the fake name  Jones Smith,  the account defended Goodell on several issues including the NFL s recent handling of national anthem protests.An example of the mysterious account standing up for Goodell took place earlier this month in response to an ESPN story chronicling the chaos that swept across the league when President Donald Trump went to war with anthem protesters. Reads like a press release from players  union. You can do better reporting. (D Smith sounds like D Trump with the inaccurate firebombs),  @forargument tweeteed to ESPN writer Seth Wickersham. D Smith  was likely a reference to NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith.Goodell s wife, who is a former broadcast journalist with Fox News, has also taken aim at WSJ columnist Jason Gay and other sportswriters, according to the Journal.The Journal said it traced a series of clues back to Mrs. Goodell, including how the account in question followed four accounts associated with their twin daughters  high school.Goodell s wife coming to his digital defense is nothing new in sports and media, though it is embarrassing. Thin-skinned Kevin Durant was recently accused of running a fake Twitter account to take on negative news and opinion about him on social media.Wives and girlfriends of pro athletes have never been shy about standing up for their famous husbands online. From Kate Upton sticking up for Justin Verlander not winning a Cy Young last year to Miko Grimes cheerleading for her husband, cornerback Brent Grimes, on social media, plenty of athletes have gotten a digital assist from their significant others. However, those women did not hide behind a fake Twitter account to make their feelings known.Goodell has earned plenty of negative press in his more than 10 years running the NFL, including the league s handling of domestic violence and concussion issues, Deflategate, and most recently, the anthem protests.Just be nice about what you say about him on Twitter, because his wife might clap back at you.Read more: NYDN",0
9696,GAME ON! California State Senator to Enter U.S. Senate Race Against Dianne Feinstein,"Senator Dianne Feinstein recently announced she would be running again She s 84-years old! Her career in politics has been a very lucrative undertaking. How could she possibly give that up? The power and the money are just too hard to pass up for retirement. The on;y problem is that sudden;y Feinstein has challengers How dare they try and dethrone the powerhouse Senator who was once the Mayor of San Francisco Game on!A potential primary challenger to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) is signaling his intent to enter the race for the Senate seat she has held since 1992.California Democratic state senate president Kevin de Le n will throw his hat into the ring to challenge Feinstein in the 2018 race, according to three sources who spoke to CNN. The 84-year-old senator announced Monday she would run for reelection, causing consternation on the progressive left even as she tried to get out ahead of de Le n.In the state senate, de Le n represents Los Angeles and has helped pass measures directed at President Donald Trump, positioning himself as one of the president s fiercest critics. The California state legislature has opposed Trump s agenda by becoming a so-called sanctuary state, as well as trying to force him to release his tax returns and even passing a resolution calling for him to apologize for  racist and bigoted behavior. Feinstein, however, took criticism from the left in August for expressing the hope that Trump would change to be more cooperative with Democrats. I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president,  she said, receiving boos from the San Francisco audience. She later said she is  under no illusion that it s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies. De Le n will likely be one of multiple contenders for Feinstein s seat. A source said Democratic mega-donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer is  very much looking at the Senate race,  and in a letter Wednesday he also called on Democrats to impeach Trump.California has an open primary in which the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, face off in the general election. The primary will be held on June 5, 2018.FEINSTEIN RECENTLY OPENED HER MOUTH AND PROVED SHE S OUT OF TOUCH WITH MOST AMERICANS: Senator Dianne Feinstein opened her mouth and proved she s out of touch with most of us. This dinosaur who needs to retire already is demanding more gun control she claims  increasing numbers  of Americans want more gun control citing zero proof. Go home Dianne, you re drunk on power SHE COULDN T NAME ONE LAW THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED VEGAS!!! Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) couldn t name any laws in an interview airing Sunday that might have prevented last week s massacre in Las Vegas.NBC host Chuck Todd asked Feinstein what laws could have prevented the massacre if she had her way with writing all laws. Let me ask you this: give me the slate of laws that if you could wave your wand and have enacted that could have prevented Vegas?  Todd said. Well, I don t know. I would have to take a good look at that and really study it,  Feinstein said.  I m not sure there is any set of laws that could have prevented it. ",0
9697,WATCH: “HANOI JANE” FONDA Had Chance To Expose Sexual Predator Harvey Weinstein One Year Ago…The Reason DIDN’T Is LAUGHABLE,"Speaking to Bill Maher about her participation in the Women s March in DC,  Hanoi Jane  Fonda remarked about her ability to use her celebrity to express her hate for Donald Trump to the masses. Fonda told Maher that one of the benefits of being a celebrity is that you can bring attention to things that need to be addressed, she then went on to refer to President Trump as the  Predator in Chief . Of course, Hanoi Jane had no evidence whatsoever to back up such a hideous claim, yet, she made the claim anyhow. As it turns out, Hanoi Jane actually knew about a certain sexual predator who actually assaulted a much younger actress only one year ago. That younger actress was Rosana Arquette, who shared her horrible experience with the  celebrity  Jane Fonda. Fonda, who bragged about having so much power to bring attention to important issues, did absolutely nothing about it.Hypocrite Hanoi Jane would rather stay mum about an actual sexual predator who was harming so many young women in her industry, than risk being ostracized in Hollywood. It was better to just stick to the  hate Trump  script and get along with the other sickening hypocrites in Hollywood than to expose a serial sexual predator who should ve been stopped years ago if there weren t so many self-serving and shallow human beings running around Hollywood. Watch:Hanoi Jane s very comfortable trashing President Trump who she believes can t hurt her career, but when it comes to the mega-Democrat donor, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein, all bets are off..

It came as a shock and a great disappointment,  Fonda said. I only met Harvey when I was old and Harvey goes for young because that s more vulnerable. She added that she was proud of the victims for speaking out but it wasn t a unique or isolated case and specifically mentioned Bill Cosby s history. This is not unique, this goes on at the most horrendous high levels,  she said. I m glad it s coming out, I m so proud of those fellow actors that are speaking up. I know that it has taken a long time. It is a very, very, very hard thing to do. You don t get anything out of it as the person who has been victimized but it is important that it come out.

What is it that attracted both of these misogynist men who clearly use their positions to treat women like subjects? Is it Hillary s undying support for her husband Bill, who is also a serial sexual predator and accused rapist that attracted them to her?Misogynist pig Ben Affleck was so close to Hillary, that he actually was one of the people who was found to be emailing her on her secret private server.But of course, the mainstream media will never call out these Hollywood hypocrites who attempted to label President Trump a  misogynist  with absolutely no evidence.",0
9703,"BREAKING NEWS: N. AMERICAN FAMILY Held Hostage During Obama Presidency RESCUED In Pakistan: “This is a country that did not respect us, this is a country that respects us now” [VIDEO]","In 2017, Kelli O Brien, the aunt of Joshua Boyle spoke publicly about the kidnapping of her nephew and his wife Caitlan Boyle who expresses her disappointment over the lack of response from Prime Minister Trudeau. Interestingly enough, Trudeau was visiting President Trump when Trump announced that he would soon be announcing some very good news would be forthcoming regarding the captured family s status.TODAY, Boyle and Coleman s families got some very good news! More winning An American woman, her Canadian husband, and their three children have been freed from captivity by Pakistani security forces, nearly five years after being taken hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan.The initial word came from a Pakistani Army statement and was confirmed by US officials.The couple, American Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her American husband, Joshua Boyle, 33, were kidnapped by the Taliban in 2012 while they were traveling as tourists in Afghanistan and were held in captivity since.Coleman was pregnant when she was kidnapped. The couple had two more children born in captivity.Here is a video showing Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlin Coleman speaking to the camera while in captivity in January 2017: In a statement, the Pakistani Army said US intelligence agencies had been tracking the hostages and shared intelligence with Pakistan when the family was moved to the country. US officials confirmed there was intelligence about their location in recent days that was shared with the Pakistanis. The operation by Pakistani forces, based on actionable intelligence from US authorities was successful; all hostages were recovered safe and sound and are being repatriated to the country of their origin,  the statement said.  The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan s continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy. It is possible that the successful recovery of the family was what was being referenced Wednesday when President Donald Trump told a crowd in Pennsylvania that  something happened today where a country that totally disrespected us called with some very, very important news. Trump did not disclose what country or any details involved but said  one of my generals came in and they said, you know, I have to tell you, a year ago they would have never done that. This is a country that did not respect us, this is a country that respects us now. The world is starting to respect us again, believe me,  Trump said appearing to reference Pakistan and that country s role in bringing about the recovery of the four hostages. CNN",0

9705,VAN JONES Tells ‘Mad’ Liberals To Go Hug Trump Voters in Appalachia To Win Elections [Video],"CNN political commentator Van Jones on Wednesday visited ABC s  The View,  where he criticized fellow liberals for being  mad at every single person  who voted for President Donald Trump. Jones tells the women that the Democrats need to make their tent bigger to include  folks in Appalachia Really? He goes on to say that they ve been embracing Muslims and other minorities but need to include the  miner with black lung Huh??? Basically, he s saying the Democrats are willing to toss their remaining policies to wh*re themselves out for votes any votes they can get from any warm body they can drag to the polls. Is anyone else out there as offended by this as we are?Jones first argued that, while the tent of the Democratic Party is diverse, it is not as inclusive as it could be. Right now I don t see Democrats looking at the situation and saying, you know what, maybe we drew our circle too small,  Jones said.  I love that we re hugging LGBT and Muslims and all the people who usually don t get a hug. We re hugging them, but maybe we need a bigger hug, and include some of those folks in Appalachia. That s exactly what the DNC chair said,  co-host Sunny Hostin insisted.  We had Tom Perez on the show, and that s exactly what he said. They are trying to do that,  co-host Joy Behar affirmed. Listen, there may be some leaders who are. Unfortunately, and I have to be honest I get in trouble because I m honest,  Jones said. I know you do,  Hostin interjected. When I listen to liberals, when they re not on TV trying to make it sound good, we re still in grief; we re still mad,  Jones said.  And we re not just mad at Trump, who we should be mad at. We re mad at every single person who voted for Trump, even people who have no jobs, even coal miners who have black lung disease and who are dying and Democrats don t have anything to say about it for years. Behar and co-host Whoopi Goldberg interrupted Jones to take issue with the idea that liberals are mad at Trump voters, asking Jones specifically who he was talking about. Jones explained his point of view comes from conversations with liberals. In my conversations with liberals, it s like  they,   those  Trump voters,  them.   I don t understand how those people could ever do that.  In America, we don t have to agree. We have to try to understand,  he said.Via: WFB",0
9706,LAURA INGRAHAM: GOP Senators In Private Meeting “Laughed out loud at the idea that Trump’s border wall would ever be built”,"During a private meeting of the most senior Republican senators, GOP leaders  laughed out loud at the idea that Trump s border wall would ever be built. The explosive revelation comes from Laura Ingraham s new book, Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump.Ingraham reports that her source  was there in the room  when it happened and that the sordid episode is  a reminder that the populist movement that delivered Trump into office must remain vigilant and keep the heat on the GOP Establishment. The bestselling author and new Fox News primetime host argues that Republicans will pay an enormous political price if the GOP Establishment succeeds in torpedoing President Trump s border wall. Mark these words: If a wall a physical wall is not erected along our southern border, the president and his party will pay a severe political price,  writes Ingraham. She added:  Like George Bush s promise to  Read [his] lips: no new taxes,  the promise of a border wall was a searing pledge to the American people. Billionaire at the Barricades also dismantles arguments against the cost of erecting the border wall.The notion that Congress can t find $25 billion the higher end estimated cost of building the wall in our nearly $4 trillion annual budget is absurd. Democrats have never met a spending or building project they didn t like. But now all of a sudden they re fiscal hawks? Get real. And the Establishment Republicans who cowered in the corner for eight years while Obama nearly doubled the national debt to $19 trillion dollars now expect us to believe they re courageous penny-pinchers?

9707,WOW! DNC WILL KEEP Dirty Harvey’s Money To Fund Future Democrat Campaigns,"The Democratic National Committee announced Friday that it is still holding onto most of the money it received from Hollywood mogul and alleged sexual harasser Harvey Weinstein.The DNC will donate just ten percent of the almost $300,000 received from Weinstein, money that will go to organizations close to the Democratic Party: EMILY s List, Emerge America, and Higher Heights, all of which predominately help Democratic candidates running for office. The DNC s response to the Harvey Weinstein matter is shockingly bad   even by Washington standards,  Alexandra Smith of the conservative opposition research firm America Rising said.  Donating  a mere 10 percent of the entire Weinstein contribution to another left-leaning political action committee is a complete embarrassment. The mission statement of EMILY s List is:  We elect pro-choice Democratic women to office.  Emerge America adds ethnic diversity to that same basic mission, proclaiming its intent  to increase the number of Democratic women leaders.  Higher Heights goal is to help black women get elected; the Center for Responsive Politics notes that it gives exclusively to Democrats.Some Democratic politicians are donating money received from Weinstein to nonprofits helping victims of sexual violence, while others have remained silent on the matter. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) announced he would donate his Weinstein money to  several charities supporting women  following a Washington Free Beacon report about Democrats  inaction.

In the first part of this series, Nicholas Dudich, Audience Strategy Editor for the Times  extensive video library speaks candidly about how his left political bias influences his editorial judgement and reveals an unusual connection to former FBI Director James Comey, and a strange association with domestic terror group Antifa.Since this video came out, the New York Times released a statement saying they ve launched an investigation:This should have been done when hiring this former antifa thug who also worked for Clinton.RT reported:In the video, Dudich calls himself the  gatekeeper  for all the New York Times videos posted online, saying that his  imprint is on every video we do. Any video that goes on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram   I have a hand in that,  Dudich said.When talking journalistic ethics, Dudich is captured sarcastically making air quotes while he said that he will  be objective  working for the Times before quickly admitting:  no I m not. That s why I m there. According to the New York Times ethical handbook, employees  must do nothing that might raise questions about their professional neutrality or that of The Times. As a journalist, I m not able to give any money to any political organization. I m not able to volunteer for any political organization. I m not able to work for any nonprofit or charity. Like, there s a lot of guidelines and ethics,  Dudich said.However, before joining the Times, Dudich worked social media on the 2012 presidential campaign of former President Barack Obama and the 2016 presidential campaign of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.When asked how he was able to be politically active and still work as a journalist, Dudich said that he had to leave his job at ABC to take a job where he  wasn t deemed a journalist anymore  in order to work for the Clinton campaign.Dudich said he made the sacrifice in order to work against Trump, who he said was a  threat. I saw the threat and I was like, I want to do something,  Dudich said.  Trump was a threat and still is a threat, right? Trump is a threat,  the interviewer interjects.  He s a threat. Oh, he s a threat to everything,  Dudich added.Read more President/co-founder of The Dream Corps and CNN contributor Van Jones   Rich Polk CNN s Van Jones calls Russia  nothing burger  video  edited, right-wing propaganda  At one point, Dudich explains his idea to make Trump resign or leave office by going after his businesses and his  dumb f**k of a son, Donald Jr., and Eric. Target that. Get people to boycott going to his hotels,  Dudich said.  If you can ruin the Trump brand and you put pressure on his business and you start investigating his business and you start shutting it down, or they re hacking or other things. He cares about his business more than he cares about being President. He would resign. Or he d lash out and do something incredibly illegal, which he would have to. ",0

WATCH Former Teen Hollywood Actor: “I Can Tell You The #1 Problem In Hollywood Was and IS and ALWAYS Will Be Pedophilia”,"Are we finally watching the end times for Hollywood celebrities, who have been worshipped like golden idols by Americans who believe them to be flawless and infallible human beings? Is the morally superior facade of Hollywood actors like Meryl Streep and Gwenyth Paltrow, who admonish and berate Americans that would dare to support President Trump, while sucking up to serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein? What about actress Ashley Judd who America watched while she wore her p*ssy hat, go off on an insane rant at the Women s March in DC, over Donald Trump s remarks about a woman, to another man, during a private conversation, while she hid the ACTUAL sexual assault that was allegedly committed against her by mega-Democrat donor Harvey Weinstein. Judd claims she was asked to meet Weinstein for a breakfast meeting at the Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel some 20 years ago. She said the meeting turned into him inviting her up to his hotel room and claimed he asked to give her a massage and watch him shower. A disgusting audio of Weinstein begging an Italian model to watch him shower in his hotel room was just released today. You can find the story and the audio HERE.Gwenyth Paltrow claims that she was also sexually abused by Harvey Weinstein when she was 22 years old. So that was 23 years ago, why the silence until now? How many countless women could have been saved by Paltrow or Judd if they came out and pressed charges against Weinstein decades ago? Neither one of them has any trouble publicly bashing Trump. But, oh yeah, bashing Trump is a resume enhancer in Hollywood, while ignoring a Hollywood producer who s a sick pervert, is perfectly acceptable, as long as he s the one who signs your enormous paychecks.Gwyneth Paltrow claims that she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was just 22: https://t.co/ZtZlJFXZ6z pic.twitter.com/oqRm7WSO9q  E!

Wait until you watch the video below and read about the horrific experiences these former child actors had with full-grown men in Hollywood.Cernovich  The recent exposure of serial sexual predator and Hollywood Democrat kingpin Harvey Weinstein raises, even more, questions than it answers.In a now famous photo, Weinstein can be seen grabbing young actress Emma Watson in a compromising position.While the public controversy currently centers around Weinstein s sexual abuse of power over young women, the question remains   how young were Weinstein s victims?Former child actor Corey Feldman has publicly stated that  I was molested and passed around,  while discussing how in Hollywood adult males in the industry would pass young stars  back and forth to each other.  Feldman revealed that his co-star Corey Haim was raped at 11-years-old.Actor Elijah Wood confirmed Feldman s claims in May 2016, describing Hollywood as a den of  vipers  in an interview, and saying  If you can imagine it, it s probably happened. Wood said he was protected from abuse by his mother, who didn t let him go to Hollywood parties, but he said other young child actors were regularly  preyed upon  by those in power.Wood also compared Hollywood s sexual predators with known pedophile and English TV personality Jimmy Savile. You all grew up with Savile,  Wood said.  Jesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized. X-Men director Bryan Singer is among those publicly accused of sexual abuse of young boys in Hollywood.Was Weinstein one of the men Elijah Wood says is sexually  preying upon  young children in Hollywood? Is Weinstein one of the men Feldman says would pass young stars around?The questions must be asked when an apparent industry of pedophilia and sexual abuse has been in the open and yet kept secret for decades.Watch this disgusting interview with former child actor Corey Feldman regarding pedophilia in Hollywood: I can tell you the #1 problem in #Hollywood WAS and IS and ALWAYS will be pedophelia. @RedNationRising  #MAGA pic.twitter.com/ARb0W7QYnC  DONNA WARREN   (@DonnaWR8) October 9, 2017",0

Do you think the players will give up kneeling or do you think the protests will get worse?He began his letter with:  We live in a country that can feel very divided. Sports, and especially the NFL, brings people together and lets them set aside those divisions, at least for a few hours. The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country.

9717,"MIKE DITKA SLAMS NFL Players: “No Oppression In Last 100 Years”…”If You Don’t Respect Our Country, Then You Shouldn’t Be In This Country Playing Football”","Wow! Former Bears coach Mike Ditka is coming under fire from the liberal media and Black Lives Matter activists for saying there has been  no oppression in the last 100 years .Former Chicago Bears star and coach Mike Ditka, an adamant critic of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination, said Monday in a national radio interview that this country has been free of oppression for at least a century. All of a sudden, it s become a big deal now, about oppression,  Ditka told Jim Gray on Westwood One s pregame show ahead of the Bears   Monday Night Football  loss to the Vikings.  There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. Now maybe I m not watching it as carefully as other people. As a side note, the now unemployed and clearly  oppressed  49 ers QB, Colin Kaepernick who started kneeling to show his unity with the anti-cop, Black Lives Matter movement, listed his humble abode in San Jose, CA, 10 months ago, for a mere $2.9 million.According to Realtor.com, the gated four-bedroom, 5.5-bath estate features 4,500 square feet of living space on a 20,000-square-foot secluded lot with a long private driveway and expansive views of the valley.Ditka continued: Is that the stage for this? If you want to protest, or whatever you want to protest, you ve got a right to do that, but I think you re a professional athlete, you have an obligation to the game,  Ditka said.  I think you have to respect the game. That s what I think is the most important thing. I don t see a lot of respect for the game. I just see respect for their own individual opinions. Opinions are like noses, we all have one. Some are good. Some are bad. Ditka insisted he wasn t  condemning anybody or criticizing anybody  but urged players to  protest when the game s over, protest whatever other way you want to  and said he would bench players who insisted on demonstrating during the anthem because it s disrespectful. If you don t respect our country, then you shouldn t be in this country playing football,  he said.  Go to another country and play football. If you had to go somewhere else to try to play the sport, you wouldn t have a job. So that would be my take. If you can t respect the flag and the country, then you don t respect what this is all about. So I would say, adios. Gray cited athletes such as Muhammad Ali and Jesse Owens who have taken on social injustices, but Ditka was unmoved. I don t know what social injustices have been,  Ditka said.  Muhammad Ali rose to the top. Jesse Owens is one of the classiest individuals that ever lived. I mean, you can say,  Are you (saying) everything is based on color?  I don t see it that way. I think that you have to be color blind in this country. You ve got to look at a person for what he is and what he stands for and how he produces, not by the color of his skin. That has never had anything to do with anything. Ditka said there are opportunities for everyone in the United States, regardless of race, religion, creed, color, nationality  if you want to work, if you want to try, if you want to put effort into yourself. I think you can accomplish anything, and we have watched that throughout our history of our country. People rise to the top and they became very influential people in our country by doing the right things.   Trib LiveMost of America gets what Ditka is trying to say when he says there has been  no oppression for 100 years . He s clearly referring to the era of slavery. The idea, however, that Ditka would point out that slavery ended 100 years ago, and that we are, and have been, for decades, a nation of equal opportunity for all, was more than the left and the liberal media could bear. Here are just a few of their responses to Ditka s remarks:Mike Ditka said that, Black folks have not suffered, ""any oppression over last 100 years.  and Mike Ditka was alive during the Jim Crow era  LEFT  (@LeftSentThis) October 10, 2017Just heard Mike Ditka say on a radio interview that there hasn t been oppression in the US in 100 years.

9718,FINALLY! DOCUMENTS FOUND Support Donald Jr.’s Account of Meeting With Russian Lawyer,"This is unbelievable! The Russia collusion scam has been going on for months now with fingers pointing everywhere there is a Trump team member. Specifically, Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr. who have been defending their meeting with a Russian lawyer and others for so long! Now we know it was nothing and even CNN now proves it Yes, CNN! Can you believe it?Via Newsmax:The controversial June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Russians, Donald Trump Jr. and others was indeed about the Magnitsky Act, not dishing dirt on Hillary Clinton, CNN reported.Documents provided to CNN back Trump Jr. s account   and that of Jared Kushner   that the meeting was insignificant and a waste of their time.An attorney for the Russian billionaire who requested the meeting provided the documents to CNN, and suggested the mixup originated with the publicist who brokered the meet and greet with Trump Jr., Kushner and other members of President Donald Trump s campaign.The attorney, Scott Balber, told CNN that the publicist, Rob Goldstone,  probably exaggerated and maybe willfully contorted the facts for the purpose of making the meeting interesting to the Trump people. And the seeds of a Russia collusion story were born, CNN reported. The documents   are consistent with my client s understanding of the purpose of the meeting which was from the beginning and at all times thereafter about her efforts to launch a legislative review of the Magnitsky Act,  Balber told CNN.Goldstone knew the Trumps from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow where he had a client who performed at the pageant.",0

The rude comments go on and on First Lady Melania Trump wasted no time in responding. We give her credit she called it exactly what it was:  attention-seeking and self-serving noise Ivana Trump said she should be considered the  first lady  because she was President Trump s first wife, prompting a stinging rebuke from third wife and current first lady Melania Trump that the remark was  attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana, the mother of Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric, said she has a line to the White House but tries not to call Trump too often because it makes Melania Trump jealous Ouch!Ivana Trump to @arobach: I don't like to call POTUS at the White House: ""I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy"" https://t.co/SiTlUUDX2S pic.twitter.com/nyvSj3Wk9O  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 9, 2017THE FACT THAT IVANA THINKS SHE WOULD CAUSE ANY JEALOUSY IS LAUGHABLE! I have the direct number to White House, but I no really want to call him there because Melania is there,  Ivana told ABC s  Good Morning America  during an interview on Monday.  I don t want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I m basically first Trump wife. MELANIA WASTED NO TIME RESPONDING: Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, DC, and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books,  spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to CNN.  There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex, this is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana Trump, 68, who married Donald Trump in 1977 and divorced him in 1992, has been making the rounds of talk shows to promote her memoir,  Raising Trump,  which was published on Tuesday.WHAT A B*TCH! IVANA THINKS IT MUST BE  TERRIBLE  FOR MELANIA TO BE IN WASHINGTONDespite her comment that she should could carry the mantle of  first lady,  Ivana Trump said she really wouldn t be happy in the White House and wouldn t be willing to change places with Melania. I think for her to be in Washington must be terrible,  Ivana Trump said.  It s better her than me. I would hate Washington. IVANA TAKES A SHOT AT MELANIA!But then she took a veiled shot at the first lady s White House role. Would I straighten up the White House in 14 days? Absolutely. Can I give the speech for 45 minutes without [a] teleprompter? Absolutely. Can I read a contract? Can I negotiate? Can I entertain? Absolutely. But I would not really like to be there. I like my freedom,  she said.Ivana also takes  full credit  for raising their three children because he was  on the telephone making the deals. He was a loving father, don t get me wrong, and he was a good provider, but he was not the father which would take a stroll and go to the Central Park or go play to baseball with them or something,  she said,  It was only until they were about 18 years old [that] he could communicate with them, because he could start to talk business with them.

9721,BRILLIANT! President Trump Offers Congress Hard-Line Deal On Immigration…Shines Spotlight On Democrats’ Agenda To Put Votes Before American Citizens,"AP  President Donald Trump has told congressional leaders that his hard-line immigration priorities must be enacted in exchange for extending protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, many of whom were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.Trump s list of demands included overhauling the country s green-card system, a crackdown on unaccompanied minors entering the country, and building his promised wall along the southern border.Many were policies Democrats have said explicitly are off the table and threaten to derail ongoing negotiations over legislation protecting young immigrants known as  Dreamers.  They had been given a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally in the country under President Barack Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which Trump ended last month.In a letter to House and Senate leaders released by the White House Sunday, Trump said the priorities were the product of a  a bottom-up review of all immigration policies  that he had ordered  to determine what legislative reforms are essential for America s economic and national security. These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients,  he wrote, adding that:  Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end. Trump announced last month that he was ending the DACA program, but he gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before recipients began to lose their status. Trump suggested at the time that he was eager for a deal, telling reporters,  I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly. He d also tweeted that if Congress was unwilling to find a fix, he would  revisit this issue!  in six months.  Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017 ",0

She has sneake rs, in the meantime, so she can change into other clothing when we re walking through where a hurricane is just leaving. And she took tremendous abuse.

How many of those same women were simultaneously begging Harvey Weinstein, who was apparently a well known sexual predator, for a job? Well, today Harvey got some very bad news Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced co-founder and CEO of The Weinstein Company, has been fired effective immediately, his board of directors said on Sunday.The statement said: In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company   Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar   have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately. The company has been under intense pressure since The New York Times broke an investigative story on Thursday detailing three decades of sexual misconduct, including propositioning actresses and harassing female employees. More ugly stories continued to dribble out over the weekend, including a vulgar report by a news anchor that Weinstein masturbated in front of her and other stories of inappropriate propositions.Internally Weinstein continued to fight for his survival, insiders have told TheWrap. His advisors   including his brother Bob   told him that he needed to take the allegations seriously and not merely pay lip service. They wanted him to leave for six months and get treatment for sex addiction or whatever his behavior may be called.Weinstein told TheWrap in an interview on Thursday that he was sincere in his apology and intention to make amends. But reports continued to leak out of the company internally that the CEO was determined to dictate the terms of his leave of absence and treatment.Harvey and Bob Weinstein co-founded the indie film company Miramax in 1979 and grew it into a powerhouse brand that made art-house films mainstream   and reshaped the Academy Awards race with aggressive marketing and buzz.The company was bought by Disney in 1993, where the brothers continued to run the company   and dominate the Oscar race   until they left in 2005 to launch the new privately held The Weinstein Company.

9726,‘BIZARRE’ HILLARY CLINTON After Election Tells of Screaming Into Her Pillow [Video],"In a bizarre interview with Irish TV,  wacky grandma  Hillary Clinton talked about her election loss. She took it upon herself to say she was  totally worried  about Trump becoming our president. Maybe it was visions of that orange prison jumpsuit and a jail cell that kept going through her head.She also admitted that she had no concession speech prepared. Really? That s just stupid! You paid those pollsters to lie. You must have known the truth or did you figure that no one could overcome as much election fraud as you and the Democrat Party had committed?Either way, Hillary, Donald Trump is President, you are not, and We the People are the grateful winners.The interview takes on a narcissistic tone when she describes how she had to go  lie down  and would  scream  in her pillow to get over the pain of losing the election to Trump. I would have to go lie down because it was so excruciating , she joked to interviewer Ryan Tubridy in a candid conversation, filmed near her home in Chappaqua, New York. I was in a state of shock. I had not prepared a concession speech,  the former presidential candidate revealed, explaining that whilst expecting a close result, her campaign remained confident of victory up until early election night returns began to suggest otherwise. EVERYONE WAS SO CONFIDENT Following a final rally in Philadelphia, appearing with then president, Barack Obama, husband Bill Clinton and celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, Clinton recalled that on the eve of polling day  everyone was so confident. Whilst discussing the inauguration of President Trump, asked if she wanted to scream, Clinton told RT ,  Oh, I did. But that was a common occurrence in those days. You know, scream into the pillow when I saw what was happening. I would have been disappointed and really unhappy if I had lost to a normal Republican. But to lose to someone who I believed profoundly was not ready for the job, was temperamentally unqualified for the job   was such a burden. I just thought,  I ve let everybody down, I ve let my country down, I ve let the world down. How did this happen?  Clinton recalled.TOSSING THE BLAME TO EVERYONE BUT HERSELF Acknowledging the role of the email scandal and various shortcomings in her campaign, Clinton also blamed Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the propagation of  fake news  as factors in the election of President Trump. I knew there were these other forces at work that needed to be unpacked and analyzed. It s not only about what happened, it s about preventing it from happening again,  she added.

Corker has threatened to obstruct and be a thorn in the side of Trump because he has nothing to lose now that he s not running for reelection. What that tells us is this man was NEVER a true Republican! He s a RINO! DRAIN THE SWAMP!PROOF BELOW THAT WHAT TRUMP SAID IS TRUE:CORKER THREATENS TO HALT PROGRESS ON TAX REFORM Corker announced in September that he will retire after his term expires in 2018. Sen. Corker announced his departure from the Senate one day after Breitbart News reported on his $3 million  swamp  deal and just hours after conservative Judge Roy Moore beat establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) in a Senate runoff election.Now, Sen. Corker threatens to halt any progress that Republicans have made with tax reform, similarly to how Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) tanked Obamacare repeal twice this year. Patty McMurray Corker said at the hearing,  This is some of the most meaningless work that we do here.  The Tennesseean argued that the 2018 budget amounts to nothing more than a vehicle for Republicans to pass a tax reform package.Republicans hope to use budgetary reconciliation to attach a tax reform proposal to the 2018 budget that will allow the Senate to pass the tax reform legislation using a simple majority. GOP lawmakers tried to repeal and replace Obamacare using the same strategy.The current tax plan proposal introduced by Republicans would include $4 trillion in tax cuts. Republicans hope to cut roughly $2.5 trillion in missing revenue by closing loopholes and eliminating deductions to hit the maximum $1.5 trillion deficit allowed for Congress s budget rules.President Donald Trump said that the tax reform plan  will be rocket fuel for our economy.  Read more: BreitbartHere is the article that verifies what Trump said is true about the cabinet post:Sen. Bob Corker emerged from an interview Tuesday with Donald Trump and said he believed the president-elect had narrowed the list of candidates for secretary of state to  a very small group.  The selection process for who will run the State Department in the Trump administration has been grueling, including grumbling among Mr. Trump s allies about his considering bitter foe Mitt Romney for the nomination. Mr. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described this moment as  the greatest opportunity in modern times to really strengthen our nation s security interests around the world and help us economically.  He said that he was honored to be considered for the job.  It s been an honor to have the kind of meeting that I had today. We had a very wide-ranging meeting, actually a couple meetings and his instincts on foreign policy are obviously very, very good,  Mr. Corker told reporters at Trump Tower, where Mr. Trump lives and the transition team offices are located.  I know he has a number of outstanding individuals that he s talking with. I was glad to be here and glad to see more fully some of what his views about the world are,  he said. Pressed about when he expected Mr. Trump to announce the nomination, Mr. Corker said they didn t talk about that in the meeting.  I think he ll make the decision when he s comfortable. My sense is he s narrowed it down to a very small group of people,  he said. The president-elect is scheduled to meet later Tuesday with Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee who harshly criticized Mr. Trump s during the campaign and worked to prevent him from winning the nomination and the White House. Other candidates for secretary of state include retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.

Public opinion about the NFL and its players has taken a huge hit since President Trump tweeted about his disgust for the lack of respect the players have shown for our flag. NFL ratings continue to be in the basement.Sporting News   The alarming fall in NFL TV ratings this season is partly because of fan anger over on-field protests by Colin Kaepernick and other players of the American flag/national anthem, according to pollster Rasmussen Reports.Nearly one-third (32 percent) of adults say they re less likely to watch NFL game telecasts because of the Kaepernick-led player protests against racial injustice, according to Rasmussen s telephone/online survey of 1,000 American adults conducted Oct. 2-3.Only 13 percent said they were more likely to watch an NFL game because of continuing protests by Kaepernick and supporters such as Antonio Cromartie of the Colts (who was cut only two days after raising a fist during the playing of  The Star-Spangled Banner  in London on Sunday).

9730,MAYORAL CANDIDATE In DIE-HARD DEMOCRAT City May Prove That 2016 Trump Win Was Just The Beginning of The End For Democrats,"If John Persinger wins the mayoral race in Erie, Pa., next month, it just might be the greatest local political upset in America this century. A Republican candidate has not been elected mayor here since 1961, when JFK was president.Tall, witty, energetic and razor-sharp, Persinger is not the guy you d expect to settle in a town like Erie. He is the kind of person who leaves, moves on to blazing success elsewhere and never returns.Persinger s grandfather, John DeMarco, was the son of Italian immigrants who was supposed to take over the family grocery store but instead went to medical school and ended up delivering more than 12,000 Erie babies.Before he was born, Persinger s parents moved to the suburbs outside New York City, but young John spent his summers with his grandparents in this port city in northwestern Pennsylvania. He got his undergrad degree at Harvard, where he was captain of the swim team; he also competed in the 2000 US Olympic team trials.From there he served as an aide in the George W. Bush White House and then chief of staff at the US Embassy in Australia, where he met his wife, a journalist fluent in Arabic. He left government for Notre Dame Law School, but when the couple started to have children, they decided Erie held the most promise for their young family.In many ways, they are correct. The city is affordable, the housing is charming. It is both a college town (there are three: Mercyhurst, Gannon and Penn State Behrend) and a tourist town (miles and miles of beaches along the lake). It boasts some of the top medical facilities in the country, and it is also a company town (Erie Insurance is one of the top employers).But it is also a struggling city, where schools are hurting financially, the opioid epidemic is rampant and the manufacturing base is collapsing   all factors that led Erie County residents to vote for a Republican president in 2016, the first since Ronald Reagan.The city of Erie, however, is a different story   Hillary Clinton won all 69 of its voting districts over Donald Trump.So can 35-year-old Persinger convince his townspeople to turn red? It s not impossible. And while he is nothing like the president in terms of temperament and style, the two politicians do share a key quality   tapping into voters  willingness for change. The fourth-largest city in the state, Erie has a population just under 100,000 and a 5.6 percent unemployment rate.As Persinger walked the shop floor of Fralo Industries, a sheet-metal fabricating plant, he talked to each worker, asking what they were making. One young man said he was building a new invention for college dorms that puts laundry in a shoot and allows students to track its progress until it s ready for pickup in a pod. Another worker was steering a high-tech laser.Persinger gives each worker his full attention, nodding and taking notes. He seems unbothered by the fact he s a Republican in a city with a nearly 3-1 Democratic registration advantage. Here, people are born blue.It doesn t seem to ruffle him that his rival, Democrat Joe Schember, is one of the nicest guys in the world and has been active in the community for over 40 years. Plus, they re neighbors (they even live on the same street). Everyone asks me about my odds. I am confident if I run a good, honest campaign, I can win,  Persinger said.  I didn t take time away from my family and waste the time of voters . . . not to win. Persinger is forward-thinking and energetic; he drives around in a mobile campaign office (a 22-year-old converted RV) with his name and photo shrink-wrapped around the entire vehicle. He visits neighborhoods, churches, community centers, mosques, synagogues and knocks on doors where no Democratic or Republican mayoral candidate has been for decades, especially in the African-American and Hispanic communities.And he listens. It is a trait that has not gone unnoticed in the black communities who for years have had their votes taken for granted by the Democrats and ignored by the Republicans.Just ask Steve McLallen, who got a visit from Persinger earlier this year.  Hey, I just want to let you know I appreciate your willingness to come and listen to our concerns,  McLallen told Persinger as he shook hands with the GOP candidate.  You have made an impression and impact on me, not just by traveling to our neighborhoods or where we work, but actually asking us what we need. A longtime Democrat, McLallen said he is voting for Persinger.Jim Baer, meanwhile, is looking for new blood in the mayor s office. A welder at Fralo, he s a Democrat who did not vote for Clinton or Trump but is tired of the same old politics.  Look, we tried the old ways; we have had nothing but Democrats running this city and managing the decline. It is time to place someone young with different ideas and the willingness to listen in charge,  he said.While neither candidate has invested in polling, both keep detailed data on their campaigns  voter outreach and they know this race is close.

9732,"#WINNING UPDATE: Arizona’s Other Anti-Trump, RINO Senator Just Got Some Very Bad News","Watch President Trump hammer Senator McCain and the  weak  Senator Flake at an Arizona rally, where he also threw his support behind Dr. Kelli Ward:AP  Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake s re-election race is becoming a case study in the GOP s convulsions among the establishment, a furious base, and angry donors.After bucking Donald Trump in a state the president won, Flake is bottoming out in polls. Yet Republicans look like they may be stuck with a hard-core conservative challenger who some fear could win the primary but lose in the general election.A White House search for a candidate to replace former state Sen. Kelli Ward in the primary appears to have hit a wall. And now conservatives want to turn Arizona into the latest example of a Trump Train outsider taking down a member of the GOP establishment. People are fooling themselves if they think Jeff Flake is anything but a walking dead member of the United State Senate,  said Andy Surabian, whose Great America Alliance is backing Ward. I don t see how he survives a primary. I don t see how he survives a general. The numbers just don t add up,  added Surabian, who worked at the White House as an adviser to Steve Bannon, then the president s top strategist.Despite discontent among some Republicans over Ward, Bannon met with her last week at a conservative conference in Colorado Springs to encourage her campaign, according to a Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the previously unreported private meeting.Ward unsuccessfully challenged Arizona s senior senator, John McCain, in last year s election, losing in the primary by a wide margin. But in Flake, she would face a more vulnerable candidate at a moment when the GOP establishment is on the defensive, facing a simmering anti-incumbent mood heightened by Republicans  failure to make good on seven years of promises to scrap Barack Obama s health care law.Flake is in danger of becoming the latest victim of this voter wrath. Yet rather than making an effort to soothe pro-Trump GOP voters, he s all but dared them to take him down by kicking off his campaign with an anti-Trump manifesto,  Conscience of a Conservative,  a book in which he bemoaned his party s failure to stand up to Trump in last year s presidential race. We pretended that the emperor wasn t naked,  Flake wrote.Trump, in turn, has lashed out at Flake on Twitter, calling him  toxic,  while praising Ward. White House officials say there s little chance Trump will have a change of heart over supporting Flake. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations, said Trump is irritated not only by Flake s public criticism but by what Trump sees as the senator s attempts to use his critiques of the president to gain attention.Nevertheless, Flake, 54, insists he won t be getting out of the race. The primary is Aug. 29. ",0

9739,LOL! “BLACK STUDENTS UNITED” Demands “Racist” Cornell University Stops Recruiting Blacks That Aren’t Like Them,"EAG    Black Students United    which represents people of the  African diaspora    penned a letter to university administration recently in response to allegations that a white student from the Psi Upsilon fraternity severely beat a black student from the Kappa Sigma fraternity in mid-August.Cornell closed down the Psi Upsilon fraternity as it works to  develop and implement steps to be a more equitable, inclusive and welcoming university,  according to The Washington Post.John Greenwood, the 19-year-old student accused of the beating, faces a third-degree assault charge and possible hate crimes. Greenwood apologized for using  abhorrent language  during the dispute, but his attorney has maintained that Greenwood was  in no way involved in any physical altercation of any kind,  according to The Cornell Daily Sun.Black Students United want more to be done, and they re using the unfortunate incident to pressure school officials into a list of 12 demands   at least some of which target other black students.The demands are prefaced with a diatribe on Cornell s inherently white supremacist system that allegedly perpetuates a daily assault of racism against black students on campus. We attend a university that s obsessed with the optics of our black and brown faces but is indifferent to the justice we week. This is not an indictment of white people; this is an indictment of a system that perpetuates white supremacy and shelters our peers under the warm blanket of white privilege   all the while, we are left to freeze in our frigid reality of racist epithets, essentialist curriculum, and apathetic governance,  the letter read. In post-racial America, our classmates call us niggers from their pickup trucks in broad daylight. In post-racial America, we are berated by airborne bottles on our own campus. In post-racial America, we are told we have a chip on our shoulder. We are called everything but our name. Above all else, in post-racial America we are bombarded by the deafening silence that allows the centuries-old hum of white supremacy to grow louder,  it continued.  Silence is violence. Because Cornell is racist, and its Interfraternity Council is an alleged arm of the white supremacist system, Black Students United drew up a list of 12 demands that will help set things right.They include a system of mandatory coursework for all students that s focused on race, gender, discrimination, white privilege and other social justice causes from the perspective of  oppressed people,  as well as mandatory training for staff on the same issues.Black Students United want Psi Upsilon shut down and to use the building as  an adequate and appropriate space for the people of the Africa diaspora to utilize for programs of any kind, in perpetuity. The group also demands mandatory diversity and inclusion training for all greek members on campus, a special  minority liaison  position on the University Assembly, Cornell Health to hire at least two black psychologists and one black doctor in coming years, a new student-led dispute resolution process, and a limit on different types of black students admitted to the Ivy League school. We demand that Cornell Admissions to come up with a plan to actively increase the presence of underrepresented Black students on this campus. We define underrepresented Black students as Black Americans who have several generations (more than two) in this country,  the letter read.The problem is there are too many black students from other places outside of the U.S., Black Students United argued. The Black student population at Cornell disproportionately represents international or first-generation African or Caribbean students,  BSU wrote.  While these students have a right to flourish at Cornell, there is a lack of investment in Black students whose families were affected directly by the African Holocaust in America. Cornell must work to actively support students whose families have been impacted for generations by white supremacy and American fascism. The demands also include a call for an  Anti-Racism Institute  to  educate the campus and community about the horrors of white supremacy and political education,  among other things.",0

9741,SAN JUAN MAYOR On Video Disrespecting Our Constitution…But She Takes Our Money [Video],"With Puerto Rico teetering on financial oblivion and asking for financial help from the U.S., it s pretty shocking to see the anti-American attitude of the San Juan Mayor in the video below. In case you haven t heard, Puerto Rico is $74 billion in debt after decades of poor management and government corruption. They re angling for a bailout from us but check out the disrespect given during the swearing in of the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico: Is it time to cut Puerto Rico off?San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz has scored political points among the sort of liberals who bring us the news by indulging in hysterical hyperbole after Hurricane Maria, and more importantly, by sparring with Trump. This ought to make her even more of a rock star among liberals:When taking the oath of office, Cruz delayed repeating the words that she would  uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States,  turning her back to the woman administering the oath for a long moment.  After turning her back and pausing, Cruz does swear to defend the Constitution, and then enthusiastically repeats to uphold the Puerto Rican Constitution.Her approval rating was as low as 24% earlier this year. She manages to prop it up by pandering to anti-American sentiment, much like the regimes in Cuba and Venezuela. Read more: moonbattery:",0
9742,4 EASY TO UNDERSTAND REASONS My Ancestors Are NOT The Same as Illegals Who Come To America Today,"How many times have liberals used the argument that  everyone s relatives came here illegally!  ? The answer is about a million or more times. Liberals can t seem to differentiate between people who came to our nation to either escape persecution or to find a better life that came through Ellis Island or immediately applied for citizenship in America, and those who float across the Rio Grande on an inner-tube after paying a coyote a fee to help them illegally cross our borders.This meme brilliantly explains the difference in 4 short bullet points.:Here s a little visual for anyone who tells you #4 isn t true:It is estimated that 12.5 million illegal aliens are currently living in the United States.Below, are a series of visuals from the Federation for American Immigration Reform or FAIR to help Americans to understand the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Americans. This data from September 27, 2017, paints a pretty bleak economic picture for America if we continue to ignore the serious problem of illegal immigration:   FAIR   At the federal, state, and local levels, taxpayers shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens. That amounts to a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664. The total cost of illegal immigration to U.S. taxpayers is both staggering and crippling. In 2013, FAIR estimated the total cost to be approximately $113 billion. So, in under four years, the cost has risen nearly $3 billion. This is a disturbing and unsustainable trend. ",0
9743,WATCH: “NASTY” SAN JUAN MAYOR Continues To Bite The Hand That Feeds The People Who Elected Her,"San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz tore a book from the nasty Democrat women s playbook on Wednesday and wore a black t-shirt emblazoned with the word  nasty  during an interview with Univision s Jorge Ramos. In case anyone forgot, Hillary Clinton actually was called a  nasty woman  by then-candidate Trump during one of the presidential debates. Hillary and her liberal Hollywood friends turned Trump s remark about her into a fundraiser to support abortion. The t-shirt was in response to President Trump s tweet criticizing the politician where he referred to her actions as  nasty  and NOT the mayor. It hasn t taken the American public long to figure out that the mayor of San Juan is not only  nasty , but ungrateful and apparently, someone who just can t get enough attention. Does she really believe that constantly criticizing the President of the United States is going to help the people who are relying on her to speed up or improve the aid they re getting? Cruz told Ramos she wore the shirt because  it was one of the expressions that the president used to describe me. I was a  nasty mayor,  People reported. When it bothers somebody that you re asking for drinking water, medicine for the sick and food for the hungry, that person has much deeper problems than what we can discuss in an interview,  Cruz said.""What is truly 'nasty' is to turn your back on the Puerto Rican people"": mayor of San Juan pic.twitter.com/2GVgJNqmve  Al Punto Univision (@AlPunto) October 5, 2017 What really is nasty is showing your back to the Puerto Rican people,  Cruz added.The island was recently hit by powerful Hurricane Maria and has been working to restore power and clean water to the territory.Cruz criticized the Trump administration s hurricane response to the island. Last Friday, the mayor appeared on television in a black shirt with white letters that read,  HELP US, WE ARE DYING.  Cruz argued that federal aid had been slow to reach Puerto Rico following Maria, which knocked out power to the entire island.In response, Trump tweeted on Saturday,  Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.

9744,CHICAGO DELI OWNER Says He Was Relieved To Hear Las Vegas Massacre Happened At Country Music Festival: “White people shooting white people isn’t terror … it’s community outreach”,"Chicago Tribune   Just weeks after stoking controversy by using Nazi imagery on his Jewish deli s Facebook page, the co-owner of Max s Deli in Highland Park again has ignited outrage   this time with a tweet he fired off in response to the Las Vegas shootings. Soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief. White people shooting white people isn t terror   it s community outreach. #LasVegas,  the tweet read.Morelli attempted to apologize for his remark:Morelli, who described himself as politically  lost  with no allegiances, said his tweet about the deaths was thoughtless. It was a dumb joke and it didn t work. I own it. It was stupid,  Morelli said. It was seven in the morning and I was stressed out and freaked out by the shooting,  he added.  I was trying to participate, and all I did was put my foot in my mouth. But is he really sorry, or is he only doing damage control?  Only one month ago, Morelli posted this vile image on Max s Deli s Facebook page. Although Morelli admitted that after his post, his family, who were affected by his outrageous post, are  done  with him. Chicago Tribune   Highland Park deli is facing backlash over a Facebook post that includes a cartoon drawing of a man wearing a Nazi armband, giving a stiff-armed salute and donning a T-shirt reading,  I m with Alt-Right. Greg Morelli, who owns Max s Deli with his brother, posted the image last week. Morelli frequently posts the deli s menu along with cartoon drawings he creates to the restaurant s Facebook page. He said the recent events in Charlottesville inspired him to use the page to make a strong political statement. I have a Jewish deli, I am a Jewish man,  Morelli said.  I am the first person that s going to get a brick through the window if this plague is not stopped immediately. Morelli, 49, said the image was of an alt-right member who has hair evocative of President Donald Trump, but was not meant to be a depiction of the president himself.The full post and its related image are still on the deli s Facebook page.He said the deli was inundated with calls on Thursday as the post began to spread on Facebook and through news stories. Callers have been criticizing the post s imagery and its political message, he said.The effect of the post on his family has been difficult and Morelli says they are  done with him. When you create a storm, everyone that loves you just wants you to take the easy path,  he said.In a Facebook post on the restaurant s page Thursday evening, Morelli did not back down from the discussion the initial image provoked. I do not regret getting involved. I do not regret speaking out,  he wrote.  I do not regret assigning symbolism to hatred. I do not regret being trashed on Facebook. That said, it hurt. When asked about the specific use of Nazi imagery in the post and the reaction to not just his intended message, but the image itself, Morelli said the symbolism was a necessary point to make. We have to use the imagery and assign it to the groups so we know how to react,  Morelli said.  I happen to find satire very powerful. ",0
9745,NANCY SINATRA Says 5 MILLION “Murderous Members” of the NRA “Should Face A Firing Squad”,"Nancy Sinatra sent out an absolutely vile tweet today, that suggested 5 million NRA members should be killed by a firing squad. The tweet didn t mention the Las Vegas massacre, but the timing of her tweet seems to be in line with the 100 s of celebrities who are using this horrific massacre as an opportunity to push gun-control in America. Here is a screenshot of the tweet she sent out on Twitter today. Sinatra has since removed her disgusting tweet, but the screenshot of her horrific suggestion is here to stay.Another day, another liberal entertainer wishing harm, or in the case of Nancy Sinatra, death on millions of Americans. When do American citizens, who are sick and tired of being abused, berated, and slapped around by celebrities who have no respect our God-given rights, stop supporting their industry? When will we cut the cord, and turn off the NFL, and turn off shows like  Will and Grace  who admittedly are making a return to TV so they can promote an anti-Trump message to their viewers? When will Americans find something better to do with their time than watching a TV show or movie featuring an actor or actress who boldly stands against our First and Second Amendment Rights, and regularly spews hate against our President because he bravely defends those inalienable rights?If you want to see a man who faces a  firing squad  each and every day, while celebrities sit comfortably in their Malibu mansions, acting as keyboard warriors for the left, attacking him and anyone who supports him,  you don t have to look too far:Celebrity Sheryl Crow joined the hate fest against gun owners and called out politicians who support our Second Amendment Right by saying:  Any politician who takes money from the NRA has blood on their hands.

Former president Barack Obama s administration provided cover to Dreamers from possible deportation to their countries of origin with the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) executive order in 2012.The Trump administration rescinded the order last month and called on Congress to replace it within six months. Reyna expressed concern about Democrats coming to a deal with President Donald Trump about illegal immigration and Dreamers.Pelosi promised Reyna that a clean  Dream Act  would be passed before December.Pelosi continued to heap praise on Dreamers and their families and laid out Democrats  plan to block the Trump administration and Republicans from taking any kind of potential action against illegal immigration.Read more: WFB ",0

Trump tweeted criticism of her over the weekend, saying she exhibited  poor leadership  and that others in Puerto Rico were not doing enough to  get their workers to help. Upon meeting each other face-to-face on Tuesday, Cruz told Trump it was saving lives and  not about politics.

I m very sorry, Mika, but I m not going to get into local politics,  Fortu o said.Brzezinski did a double take upon hearing his answer. If she s running for governor, there are different parties I don t care,  Fortu o said.  I care about results. Is that what you think it is?  Brzezinski asked.  You think it was politics that had him attacking her? I have no idea,  he said.  All I can tell you is we need results. We have people that desperately need help.

San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has refused to participate in any FEMA meetings regarding aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has continually accused the Trump administration of not helping out in Puerto Rico s time of need, going so far as to claim the federal government is  killing  Puerto Ricans.Fox News  Geraldo Rivera went down to Puerto Rico and actually confronted Cruz about her statement that people are  dying  because of the Trump administration s  inefficiency and bureaucracy. But are people dying? I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying,  Rivera challenging Cruz said.  I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Dying is a continuum,  Cruz said in response.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people like we took out of a nursing home, severely dehydrated, you are dying. Of course dying is a continuum. Everyone eventually dies. It s an unfortunate part of life. But, when it comes to Puerto Ricans dying from neglect and a lack of supplies, Rivera wasn t buying it. The death count was 16 a week ago. It remains 16 today,  Rivera said.  People are not dying. Here s the video of Rivera s interview with Cruz:Backing up Rivera s claims, an article released on Sunday by the Daily Mail said that a Puerto Rican woman claiming to be a police officer alleged that Cruz and Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello have been holding back supplies  in order to make for better photo opportunities. The woman even went so far as to say that U.S. armed forces need to  come in and distribute the aid. Via: MRCTV",0

Each time, it was a gut-wrenching decision.But this year it s an easy choice. I m going to put my country ahead of my party by voting for Hillary Clinton   and by making my first-ever public endorsement of a presidential candidate. Breaking from investigative reporter Laura Loomer*: EXCLUSIVE: In this internal memo I have obtained, Jim Murren, the CEO of MGM resorts which owns Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (where Stephen Paddock committed his massacre) asked employees to donate to CAIR, a documented terrorist organization, two months ago.Murren declared that he d match all donations from his employees to CAIR, and radical left-wing anti -Trump groups like Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL   Anti-Defamation League. His wife, Heather Murren also worked for the Obama administration on Obama s  Commission for Enhancing National Cybersecurity  in 2016.When this memo first came out from the MGM CEO to his employees, Wayne Allen Root wrote in the Townhall publication about his disgust for a CEO of a major company asking his employees to donate to these radical groups, many of which, are in direct conflict with conservative and Christian values.Why is the MGM CEO asking his employees to contribute to radical, left-wing organizations? Why did the killer choose to stay in the Mandalay Casino? Why is no one reporting about the fact that the wife of the MGM CEO worked for Obama on his Commission for Enhancing National Cybersecurity  only one year ago?What about the fact that receipts that allegedly came from the Mandalay Casino Resort show that there were 2 GUESTS in the room with the shooter and that he actually checked in one day before the date of check-in that s being reported.Again, more from investigative journalist Laura Loomer*:BREAKING: Copies of receipts from the Las Vegas shooter s room service were posted by Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino room service employee Tony Hernandez Armenta.

The woman who was never proud of her country until her husband was elected President, lived a very comfortable life as the First Lady in the nation s White House. She took regular 5-star vacations, that included her tax-supported live-in mother, friends, relatives, and of course, her daughters, who attended the best schools in Washington DC. After 8 long years of acting as the First Lady of the United States of America, it s actually quite sad to see Michelle travel around from venue to venue, explaining to her audiences how she s still a victim of racism or sexism Tuesday at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, former first lady Michelle Obama said when she attended the State of the Union address she would notice the Republican side was  all men, all white,  and that was why she argued many people of color  don t trust politics. Speaking about diversity, Obama said,  We should be working actively to mix it up, so we re getting a real broad range of perspectives on every issue. Shoot, I would see that in Congress. She explained,  At the State of the Union address   when you are in the room what you can see is this real dichotomy. It s a feeling of color almost. On one side of the room is literally gray and white. Literally, that is the color palette on one side of the room. On the other side of the room, there are yellows and blues and whites and greens. Physically, there s a difference in color, in the tone, because on one side all men, all white, on the other side some woman, some people of color.

She said efforts to locate him were unsuccessful.Sharif faces 11 charges, including five of attempted murder in the Saturday night attack in Edmonton, Alberta.

He appeared on closed-circuit television and followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter. The suspect spoke briefly with a lawyer who stepped forward to help.Edmonton police say they believe Sharif acted alone during the series of attacks, which began around 8:15 p.m. Saturday as police Constable Mike Chernyk was handling crowd control outside a Canadian Football League game at a stadium just northeast of downtown.

9757,LEFTIST MEDIA OPENLY DISPLAYING DISLIKE FOR TRUMP: Mike Barnicle ‘I’m sick of seeing him’… Andrea Mitchell ‘Annoyed’ With Trump [Video],"Andrea Mitchell is  annoyed  with President Trump and Mike Barnicle is  sick of seeing him . How do we know? They openly displayed a disgust for our president ON THE AIR TODAY! Mitchell s beef is with the supposed poor treatment of the San Juan mayor at a meeting today on recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. We think the leftist media is officially losing it over a president who calls out liars like Mayor Cruz who tried to politicize disaster response by the feds. Can you blame Trump for skipping over her even though he officially greeted her? She lied through her teeth to make Trump and the feds look bad. A couple other things also peeved the left. They hated the comment from Trump claiming Puerto Rico has  thrown our budget a little out of whack . Chuck Schumer and other Dem leaders came out admonishing Trump. Can you blame Trump for commenting on the expense when Puerto Rico is $72 billion dollars in debt? The second thing Trump did was to toss out paper towels to people in the crowd during the day. The left was horrified. Yes, they are using every single thing to criticize him. Here s Andrea Mitchell below and Mike Barnicle expressing their dislike for Trump. HOW CAN THEY REMAIN EMPLOYED IF THEY ARE SO BIASED AND OPEN ABOUT THEIR BIAS??? Mike Barnicle looks like he s going to pass out when he dramatically criticizes President Trump. Why is he still employed after his total lack of decorum?  I m sick of seeing him Really? That s what toddlers who have no filter say  Andrea Mitchell  annoyed  with Trump:Here s why she s annoyed Trump called out the Mayor and thanked the governor:Mitchell said it was  notable  that Cruz was the only elected official who never got the opportunity to speak at the meeting to her knowledge. It was very pointed that she said,  It s not about politics  when she was shaking his hand there and then when they went to sit down, he opened his remarks by thanking the governor for not playing politics from the start, but did not give her any kind of  thank you  for what she s doing for her people or give her an opportunity to speak,  she said. That s a pretty deliberate slight, politically,  Mitchell added.Here s video of the meeting: Trump was on target! ",0
9758,WATCH: FEMALE CAB DRIVER Entering Mandalay Bay Casino Property Records Video That Appears To Capture Gun Fire From More Than One Location,"Cori Langdon, a Las Vegas cab driver recorded her harrowing experience as she entered the Mandalay Bay Casino at about the same time gunshots were first being fired into the crowd at the Rt 91 country music festival in Las Vegas.Langdon was using her phone to videotape, as she was pulling into the Mandalay Bay Casino, when she heard gunshots. She can be heard telling the dispatch operator for her cab service that she hears what  sounds like automatic gunfire.  Cori Langdon hears more gun fire, and tells her dispatch operator that the gun shots sound like they re coming from a completely different area:  Now it sounds like its coming from farther away. After listening to Langdon s video recording of the event as it unfolded, one can t help but wonder if it s possible there was more than one shooter. Automatic gunshots are still being heard from the cab. Langdon tells her dispatch person:  Somethings going on. I m not sure why people aren t  running, but. There s a security guard, what s he doing? Ya know, for there being gunfire, it sure doesn t seem like people are runnin .  Oh, shit! Seriously? I don t know what s goin  on? Where are the cops at? I m right here by the porch of Mandalay Bay, and everything seems to be normal here.  More and more rapid-fire gunshots are heard. The radio dispatcher replies,  Remember, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. And everything seems normal when it s not. Langdon and the other drivers are then warned by another driver that claims he just got details from the metro police at the airport,  Do not go to Mandalay Bay!  Langdon then says she s leaving,  I m leaving. I don t know why people aren t leaving. This is insane. Everyone s just standing around, it doesn t seem like anybody s uh  moving.   She then gets a message on her radio telling her,  Shots fired.  They don t even know the details yet. I just talked to the Metro here at the airport and they re still getting the details, but there s multiple injuries and uh (inaudible) That s all they re saying though.  They re saying stay away from there, uh, they re shutting the whole place down. Langdon continues to have a conversation with her dispatch people on the radio in her car. She is remarkably calm amongst the chaos going on around her.  Langdon tells dispatch,  Alright, I m oughta here , as she speculates that she believes the shots are coming from the 10th floor of the hotel.  As she s attempting to leave the premises, some panicked concertgoers, who appear to be injured, enter her cab at the Mandalay Bay Casino. The passengers get into the car screaming,  Broken leg, broken leg! Drive, broken leg! Let s go, let s go Langdon asks the passenger where they want to go, to which they reply,  Anywhere! Langdon asks the passengers,  Is there somebody out there?  to which the passengers reply,   Yes, yes, and active shooter. The passengers reply,  Heck yeah! Go, go, go! Langdon:  Oh, oh, and active shooter? Alright. Passengers:  Go, go, go! Langdon:  Go, okay. Alright, alright. Oh g*d, alright, there is an active shooter then. The female passenger replies:  Yes, so many people are dead! Langdon asks:  Are you kidding me? The passengers appear to be in pain and are screaming in the back seat.Langdon yells at them: Okay, close the door, close the door! The passengers yell:  Okay, lock the doors! Go, go, please drive! Langdon:  Oh my g*d, okay. Alright, alright, I m going, I m going, okay. Oh shit! Where are we going? The male passenger is freaking out and asks:  Are you going as fast as you can? Are you f*cking videotaping this?Langdon replied:  Yeah, I am. I didn t know it was so bad! Okay. The female passenger implored Langdon to get out of the area:  Thousands of people are dead! Everybody s dead, c mon! and  go!  and get out of the area.Next, the passengers begin to panic, as Langdon isn t leaving the scene fast enough, not understanding how many people are running in front of her cab to get away from the scene.Langdon calmly drives people out of the scene as she relays the situation to her dispatch unit, and the passengers relay the horrific scene of dead people everywhere! to their parents on their cell phones.Watch:",0
9759,JIMMY KIMMEL: Republicans ‘Should Be Praying for God to Forgive Them’ For Las Vegas Massacre,"Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel opened his program Monday with a ten-minute political rant about Sunday s mass murder in Las Vegas, saying  now is the time for political debate  about gun control.Dismissing as inadequate calls for prayers for the victims by President Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Jimmy Kimmel Live host said:  they should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Kimmel railed against lawmakers who  won t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip,  insisting that their  thoughts and your prayers are insufficient. The comic responded to those saying there was nothing that could have been done to stop Sunday s attack.  I disagree with that intensely,  Kimmel said,  because of course there s something we can do about it.   BreitbartMeanwhile, reports are coming out that Kimmel has increased his security detail  which consists of highly-trained, off-duty police officers.According to a report from The Blast on Monday, late night host Jimmy Kimmel has been bulking up on his security for his Jimmy Kimmel Live! show tapings, including the addition of  highly-trained, off-duty police officers  at both the front and back entrances. Per the report:Sources close to the show tell The Blast that ever since Kimmel re-ignited his campaign against the Republicans  health care proposals, the comedian has had some issues with protestors at the show.We re told the show has responded by adding security to the tapings   increasing personnel at both the front and back entrances.

9760,PRESIDENT TRUMP WEIGHS Executive Order On WELFARE REFORM: If You’re an Able Bodied American Who Wants A Paycheck…Find A Job,"Trump administration officials are mulling an executive order that would instruct federal agencies to review low-income assistance programs, part of a coming effort to make sweeping changes to the country s welfare system.The White House began circulating a draft order to federal agencies for comment last week, according to two administration officials, who were granted anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.One of the officials said the draft order calls on agencies to review existing regulations and propose new rules that conform to a set of broad welfare principles, including tighter work requirements that encourage recipients to shift back into the labor force.The order also calls for streamlining or eliminating duplicative services and establishing metrics for holding agencies accountable for program performance. It also encourages greater cooperation with state and local governments.  PoliticoIf Americans are serious about helping to raise up the lower and middle class in America, it must start with jobs. President Trump has made a serious commitment to keeping American companies and manufacturing in America. If the US government continues to pay people to stay home, those jobs won t be worth fighting to keep here.A study by the NBES shows a correlation between parents who are welfare dependent and their children who are more likely to also become government dependents: If parents become welfare dependents, the likelihood of their children eventually becoming welfare recipients also increases. Specifically, when parents are awarded DI, the likelihood that one of their adult children will participate in DI rises by 5 percentage points over the next five years, and 11 percentage points over the next decade. These findings suggest that a more stringent screening policy for DI benefits would not only reduce payouts to current applicants, but would also have long-run effects on participation rates and program costs. The results underscore how important accounting for intergenerational effects can be when making projections of how participation rates and program costs may be affected by program reforms.One of our favorite videos was made in the city of Detroit that shamelessly glorifies the benefits of an EBT card, a government assistance program that was initially created to provide food for low-income families. Like most other government handout programs, the card is now used like a credit card for gas and other products unrelated to food. President Trump is likely going to spur anger and hate like we haven t seen before if he pulls the plug on welfare assistance for Americans who have been trapped in a government dependancy program in exchange for votes by Democrats for generations.When generation after generation of Americans stop having the desire to earn a living, this is the result: ",0

9762,CNN REPORTER: Victims at Las Vegas Concert Were Likely Trump Supporters [VIDEO],"CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny said on Monday that country music fans who attended the Las Vegas concert  Sunday night were  likely Trump supporters . Zeleny does what the left has been saying not to do he politicizes this horrific massacre by using identity politics. What would the left do without identity politics? It s their go-to strategy in all situations but is particularly sickening in this tragic one.NOTE: THERE IS SOME MIC TROUBLE DURING THE VIDEO At least 50 people were killed and more than 500 were injured when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on country music festival attendees Sunday night from his 32nd floor room at Mandalay Bay Hotel, according to local authorities.Zeleny said Trump, in his remarks about the shooting, took on the role of being a unifier for the country. The president, he left it to his role of being a unifier. He did not talk about the investigation, he did not talk about the suspect,  Zeleny said.Trump called on  the bonds that unite us  during remarks Monday morning. In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one, and it always has,  he said.  We call upon the bonds that unite us, our faith, our family, and our shared values. We call upon the bonds of citizenship, the ties of community, and the comfort of our common humanity. Zeleny further commented on the personal connections that Trump has to the city of Las Vegas. By saying that he will go to Las Vegas on Wednesday, by visiting this, it is something that puts him in line with what so many presidents before him have done and paid their respects. Of course Las Vegas is a town that he is connected to, and knows well,  Zeleny said.  His name is emblazoned on the top of a hotel there as well. He campaigned there a lot. Zeleny said, however, that the conversation after the tragedy will soon be focused on politics. The moment here, is what comes after this. This invariably, after today and tomorrow, will become a discussion of politics, of guns. It s not appropriate for that moment today,  he said.In the video, it appears CNN had audio problems, which caused the host to interrupt Zeleny several times. ",0

What s even more unbelievable is she wasted no time politicizing this horrific event while asking everyone else not to: We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. She tweeted out several times just digging herself a deeper hole with her ignorance and lack of compassion for the victims: Her first tweet let us know she s clueless about the particular weapon used in this crime:The second tweet was another dig at the NRA and Clinton has the nerve to say we need to  put politics aside  when she isn t:Fox News host Christ Stirewalt said what everyone is thinking GO AWAY!:",0

Social Media FREAKS OUT Over What’s Behind MARIAH CAREY During #LasVegas Shooting Interview With Piers Morgan [VIDEO],"Good Morning Britain viewers have been left baffled by pop diva Mariah Carey s appearance on Monday s installment following the breaking news of a shooting in Las Vegas.The 47-year-old hitmaker was due to chat to host Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid about her upcoming Christmas shows in London and Paris before news broke about the shocking incident at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival   which so far has claimed the lives of 50 people and left more than 400 injured.Appearing in a live feed from her Beverly Hills home, Mariah was seen stretched out across a chaise longue in a red gown as the British TV presenters asked her about the attack near the Mandalay Bay Resort and Hotel.The Grammy award-winning singer is no stranger to the world-renowned Vegas strip, having held residency at Caesars Palace s the Colosseum in recent years.Despite admitting she didn t know enough about the attack, Mariah shared her condolences to all who were affected.Following the interview, GMB s Piers took to social media to explain that Mariah s reps knew that they would ask her about the horrific attack.Writing to his 6.12million followers, he retweeted a comment that criticized the interview and added:  We told Mariah s people before the interview. Her reaction seemed very relevant given she s a performer who often resides in Vegas.  Daily MailAlthough fans have come to expect that whenever Mariah is being interviewed, that she will make her viewers uncomfortable, this latest interview with Piers Morgan has created a bit of a social media meltdown. Social media users couldn t get over how Mariah was draped across the sofa like she was posing for a glamorous magazine shoot during the morning talk show.  It was the CHRISTMAS tree in the background, however, that had everyone really questioning her sanity.   Piers Morgan cleared up the confusion about the Christmas tree when he told viewers that,  Mariah was booked to do an interview about her UK Christmas tour.  So without addressing the elephant or Christmas tree if you will, in the room, Morgan was able to explain (kind of) why Mariah Carey was propped up on her couch with a lighted Christmas tree behind her during the first official week of fall ",0

Volunteers at the event used NFL jerseys and other sports gear to wash down veterans  vehicles for three hours as a response to NFL players protesting the national anthem before games. We met some great people, heard some wonderful stories from the veterans and their spouses,  Blake Wolney, owner of the rock station Bladerunner Radio, told KOCO in an email.Wolney said that radio station employees came up with the idea after thinking about how to create an event that would help people in need and start a trend on social media. We started off with the idea of doing an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, and we thought we ll take a bunch of NFL gear and destroy it and start it on fire and burn and donate money to veterans, like they do with ALS,  Wolney said Friday.  And then we thought, you know, there s so much negativity and animosity the way it is. Instead of burning the merchandise, they came up with the idea of using NFL jerseys and other accessories to wash cars. Breitbart",0

Roughly half the San Francisco 49ers took a knee prior to their game against the Arizona Cardinals.IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK? Is it too much to ask for these players to just stand with hand over heart for our national anthem? Do they even have a clue about how this idiotic protest began? Kaepernick knelt in support of domestic terror group Black Lives Matter and against our law enforcement. It has now morphed into a salute to eternal victimhood and a protest against President Trump. Of course, the Democrats have jumped on the bandwagon to interpret Trump calling ALL the players  sons of bitches  into a racist word. It s sickening to see that an out of work mediocre football quarterback has caused such a stink for the sinking NFL.

9772,COLLEGE CONSERVATIVES Stalked by Antifa on Campus: You ‘will not stop us’ [Video],"It s shocking that stalking conservatives to intimidate or harm them is actually happening in 2017. Several instances of stalking and threatening behavior have been reported by conservatives on campus at UC Berkeley. The latest reported by Campus Reform is a series of tweets telling where to stalk a group of campus Republicans having dinner.Naweed Tahmas, the vice president of the Berkeley College Republicans, also condemned the actions of Antifa while noting that intimidation  will not stop us. Conservatives in Berkeley are routinely targeted, harassed, and stalked,  he told Campus Reform.  Knowing that they have sympathizers within both the city administration and university administration, leftist groups will continue to target conservatives as they know there are no consequences to their actions. It has become socially acceptable in Berkeley to physically beat someone for being a conservative,  Tahmas added.  In fact, it is even encouraged. Do you ever feel uneasy when you express conservative beliefs? Do you feel afraid if you wear political attire like a Trump MAGA hat? We d like to know if you ve ever had a bad experience while showing your conservatism.The left has been so successful at hijacking the narrative on what it means to be conservative. They ve been screaming that conservatives are Nazis and white supremacists. Do you see what they re doing? They re trying to shame you into being afraid to announce your conservative views that are nothing close to being anything but devoted to small government, lower taxes and freedom THE VIDEO BELOW IS FRIGHTENING AND IS WHAT S BECOME OF OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH:Ashton Whitty, a UC Berkeley student who was stalked by Antifa because of her conservative views joined Fox News to discuss the state of Free Speech on Campuses in America.

Americans are sick and tired of San Juan s Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz bad-mouthing our President, and now, his wife Melania, every time a liberal network puts a microphone in front of her face.After President Trump s acting DHS Chief gave an optimistic view to reporters of how things were progressing in Puerto Rico, the San Juan mayor lashed out, saying, People are dying in this country. I am begging, begging anyone that can hear us, to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy. On Monday, President Trump took to Twitter to criticize Mayor Cruz for  poor leadership ability.

Really,  in response to President Trump s tweets about her. I have no time for small politics or for comments that really don t add to the situation here,  she added.Just about a minute later in the interview, Cooper said,  the President also says in a tweet early this morning that you had been nice to him early on but that Democrats told you, you have to be nasty towards him. Mayor Cruz responded to Andersen Cooper by taking a swipe at First Lady Melania Trump, saying,  I don t know. Maybe he s used to women who have to be told what to do. That s not who we are in San Juan. Watch:In a 2014 interview, Cruz revealed her feelings about how she believed that woman in politics can t play  nice ,  Politics is a rough game, and sometimes as females, we are taught that you have to play nice. Sometimes you can t play nice.  When your bankrupt country is in desperate need of help, and the nation you are relying on for that help has a leader who is bending over backward to save you, it s probably not the right time to not  play nice.

Valle is a firsthand witness of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) response supporting FEMA in Puerto Rico, and as a Puerto Rican himself with family members living in the devastation, his passion for the people is second to none.  It s just not true,  Col. Valle says of the major disconnect today between the perception of a lack of response from Washington verses what is really going on on the ground.  I have family here. My parents  home is here. My uncles, aunts, cousins, are all here. As a Puerto Rican, I can tell you that the problem has nothing to do with the U.S. military, FEMA, or the DoD. It s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government ..

Mark Steyn responds Posted by Tucker Carlson on Friday, September 29, 2017In case you missed the story of the teacher:Of course, as America has come to expect, Melania  fired back  at the hateful, liberal, public school librarian with class and dignity.  It s so refreshing to finally have a First Lady with class in the White House First lady Melania Trump fired back Friday at a Massachusetts elementary school librarian who rejected her donation of Dr. Seuss books, claiming their illustrations are examples of  racist propaganda. Stephanie Grisham, director of communications for the first lady s office, said in a statement to Fox News that the response was  unfortunate,  and Mrs. Trump wanted to use her platform  to help as many children as she can. She has demonstrated this in both actions and words since her husband took office, and sending books to children across the country is but one example,  she said.  To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate, but the First Lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere. To celebrate  National Read a Book Day,  the first lady had sent out a collection of 10 Dr. Seuss books to one school in each state across the nation. The titles included:  The Cat in the Hat ;  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish ;  Wacky Wednesday ;  Green Eggs and Ham ; and  Oh, the Places You ll Go! She followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who often read Dr. Seuss books to children. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush also read to children at Dr. Seuss-themed educational events.Remember when Mooch read Seuss to a room full of kids at the White House? Hmmm was Mooch promoting racism? To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate.    First lady Melania Trump s office I wanted to send you a special gift. Dr. Seuss s Oh, the Places You ll Go! is a book my son and I have read over and over again, and one that we want to share with all of you,  the first lady wrote in her letter to students.  Please also remember that you are the future of America and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. But despite the gesture, Liz Phipps Soeiro, a librarian at a public school in Cambridge, wrote a letter to the first lady, which was then published on The Horn Book blog, notifying Mrs. Trump that her school would  not be keeping the titles  for their collection, explaining that her school didn t have a  NEED  for the books, due to her school and library s  award-winning  status.  FOX News100 Percent Fed Up  Soeiro on Tuesday penned an editorial for the Horn Book s Family Reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation. My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science,  she wrote. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance,  Soeiro added.Trump s package reportedly included such Seuss classics as  Green Eggs and Ham,   The Cat in the Hat  and  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Soeiro criticized Seuss for being the only author represented in Trump s donation, citing controversy over some of his illustrations. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature,  she told Trump. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. I work in a district that has plenty of resources, which contributes directly to  excellence,  Soeiro wrote.  My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science. Soeiro went on to slam the White House and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for not gifting the books to  underfunded and underprivileged communities,  which she suggested  continue to be marginalized  by DeVos  policies.But Soeiro seemed to be the most offended by the books themselves.Another FACT that many people are unaware that the HYPOCRITICAL and smug liberal librarian was seen CELEBRATING Dr. Seuss only 2 years ago:Here's D.C. librarian who rejected Melania's Dr. Seuss book donation ""steeped in racist propaganda"" as Cat in Hat. pic.twitter.com/pek3pT5q2W  Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 29, 2017",0

Watch:Who can forget the interview Oprah did with Donald Trump on her show when she asked him if he d ever considering running for President. At the time of the interview, Donald J. Trump knew more about the real world and how it works, than Oprah, whose knowledge about how things work in the world ended with her Chicago set, and her on-stage couch where she practiced amateur psychology for decades in front of adoring fans.

9782,MELANIA FIRES BACK At Disgusting Liberal Librarian Who Called Her Gift Of Books To Students “RACIST”,"First lady Melania Trump fired back Friday at a Massachusetts elementary school librarian who rejected her donation of Dr. Seuss books, claiming their illustrations are examples of  racist propaganda. Stephanie Grisham, director of communications for the first lady s office, said in a statement to Fox News that the response was  unfortunate,  and Mrs. Trump wanted to use her platform  to help as many children as she can. She has demonstrated this in both actions and words since her husband took office, and sending books to children across the country is but one example,  she said.  To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate, but the First Lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere. To celebrate  National Read a Book Day,  the first lady had sent out a collection of 10 Dr. Seuss books to one school in each state across the nation. The titles included:  The Cat in the Hat ;  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish ;  Wacky Wednesday ;  Green Eggs and Ham ; and  Oh, the Places You ll Go! She followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who often read Dr. Seuss books to children. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush also read to children at Dr. Seuss-themed educational events.Remember when Mooch read Seuss to a room full of kids at the White House? Hmmm was Mooch promoting racism? I wanted to send you a special gift. Dr. Seuss s Oh, the Places You ll Go! is a book my son and I have read over and over again, and one that we want to share with all of you,  the first lady wrote in her letter to students.  Please also remember that you are the future of America and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. But despite the gesture, Liz Phipps Soeiro, a librarian at a public school in Cambridge, wrote a letter to the first lady, which was then published on The Horn Book blog, notifying Mrs. Trump that her school would  not be keeping the titles  for their collection, explaining that her school didn t have a  NEED  for the books, due to her school and library s  award-winning  status.  FOX News100 Percent Fed Up  Soeiro on Tuesday penned an editorial for the Horn Book s Family Reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation. My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science,  she wrote. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance,  Soeiro added.Trump s package reportedly included such Seuss classics as  Green Eggs and Ham,   The Cat in the Hat  and  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Soeiro criticized Seuss for being the only author represented in Trump s donation, citing controversy over some of his illustrations. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature,  she told Trump. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. I work in a district that has plenty of resources, which contributes directly to  excellence,  Soeiro wrote.  My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science. Soeiro went on to slam the White House and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for not gifting the books to  underfunded and underprivileged communities,  which she suggested  continue to be marginalized  by DeVos  policies.But Soeiro seemed to be the most offended by the books themselves.Another FACT that many people are unaware that the HYPOCRITICAL and smug liberal librarian was seen CELEBRATING Dr. Seuss only 2 years ago:Here's D.C. librarian who rejected Melania's Dr. Seuss book donation ""steeped in racist propaganda"" as Cat in Hat. pic.twitter.com/pek3pT5q2W  Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 29, 2017",0
9783,WATCH: OFFICER WHO CRASHED Motorcycle While Escorting Trump Motorcade Gets Unexpected Call From The President…Here’s What Trump Said That Made Him Smile,"It doesn t matter how many times President Trump has shown himself to be a man of the people, a man of honor, or a man of principle, the media refuses to cover the truth about him. This story should be on every TV and in every news publication, but by now, we ve come to expect that stories like these are usually buried by the anti-Trump media. Help us to spread this heartwarming story about how President Trump responded to an injured police officer who was a victim of a motorcycle accident while he was tasked with protecting the President on his trip to Indianapolis.Initial reports said Trump called the officer during the flight back to Washington, but the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police tweeted Thursday that the president delayed the flight.The official Twitter of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department shared this video of the officer s reaction to President Trump s call: #BREAKING: Thank you @Potus for delaying wheels up to speak with injured Officer Turner. #ThankYou,  the tweet read.#BREAKING: Thank you to @POTUS for delaying wheels up to speak with injured Officer Turner. #ThankYou pic.twitter.com/nJ1TtkP9Bx  IMPD (@IMPDnews) September 28, 2017Robert Turner, a police officer from Indianapolis, broke an ankle in the fall on Interstate 70. A photographer captured the officer on the ground with his uniform ripped.Police released a cellphone video of Turner in the hospital taking the call from the president. He was wearing a neck brace, but laughed and appeared to be in good spirits.The White House initially said Trump called during the flight back to Washington to check on the officer s condition and thank him for his service.

He was present at the union battle for  Right To Work  in Michigan where he was famously punched in the face by a union thug, when he confronted union thugs and demanded they stop cutting down a massive tent with pro-Right-to-Work conservatives inside (including an elderly woman who was trapped inside, while in a wheelchair when the tent was cut down).Crowder is one of unafraid to take on the Islamification of our schools and small towns, while government officials and liberals persecute Christians and Christian groups in America. Crowder is also passionate about exposing the dangers of political correctness. Crowder uses his very popular videos to prove undeniable facts that support our free speech and gun rights.Steven Crowder s latest project should be on every news network across America, however, you will likely only find this blockbuster video confirming that Antifa is indeed, a domestic terror group on conservative sites like ours or on Twitter and other social media platforms. That s because the media has been going out of their way to  soften  the image of ANTIFA. They ve been working in unison to make ANTIFA look like a bunch of rabble-rousers who are simply helping to eradicate speech that Americans the Left doesn t agree with. They re just a group of concerned citizens who want to defeat Nazism Trump supporters in America.  The leftist media has been begging their viewers to see things from ANTIFA s point of view after all, they re just a group of non-violent violent kids looking to solve the problems of the world through passionate activism violence, intimidation and yes, domestic terrorism.Watch ABC Nightline  journalist  Dan Harris  gut-wrenching reaction to the video that clearly exposes ANTIFA as a domestic terror group:",0
9785,Jared Kushner NEVER Registered To Vote As A “Female”…Media Lie BACKFIRES…Shines Bright Light On How Easily Voter Fraud Can Occur,"Meanwhile, as President Trump continues to meet resistance from blue states in his effort to clean up voter fraud, one of his most vocal opponents is none other than the Democrat governor of New York, the same state where the board of elections made the mistake of changing Kushner s identity to a  female  AFTER he registered as a  male . It seems like this may be just the high-profile screw-up the White House has been waiting for in order to revisit the legitimacy of voter rolls in New York.NY refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election. We will not comply with this request.https://t.co/eQC6ORV0v1  Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 30, 2017Kushner, President Trump s son-in-law, and senior adviser did in fact list himself as a male in his New York voter registration   but an elections database error led to him getting listed as a female.Kushner s supposed registration as a woman, which made headlines Wednesday, is actually a data entry error that the New York Board of Elections corrected only after it became public.A Wired story first reported that Kushner   whose father-in-law has been waging a fact-challenged war on voter fraud   was registered as a woman on his publicly accessible New York State voter information.   NYDaily NewsThe Wired story that was written by Ashley Feinberg suggests one of the reasons Kushner registered to vote as a female may be attributed to him committing voter fraud, which according to Feinberg,  would, of course, would be interesting, considering that Trump s White House has been fixated on allegations that rampant voter fraud took place during the 2016 election. The Huffington Post used the fake news story to prove that Jared Kushner is not capable of brokering peace in the Middle East. Here is their headline for an article written by Amanda Terkel:From the Huffington Post article:If people weren t already skeptical that Kushner   a man who inherited his father s real estate empire and has no policy experience in the Middle East or elsewhere   could achieve the impossible, recent developments may give further pause.He registered to vote as a woman.Radical leftist and (sometimes) comedian Jimmy Kimmel did an entire skit on Jared Kushner registering to vote as a  female.  We ll wait for his apology #VeryFakeNewsCNN quickly jumped on the story without verifying why Jared Kushner was registered as a female. Given the incompetence of our government agencies, one would think CNN would give Kushner the benefit of the doubt, but alas, giving anyone close to President Donald J. Trump the benefit of the doubt would be counter-productive to the Trump-hating network who only has one goal, and that is to destroy Donald Trump and anyone who dares to stand with him. CNN has changed the story that was originally attached to this tweet to reflect their update, but their headline that attempts to paint Kushner as either a liar or a cheat stands on Twitter.Jared Kushner is registered to vote as a female https://t.co/MtWq9uHTC7 pic.twitter.com/1ub2dS6OFM  CNN (@CNN) September 27, 2017Another loudmouth liberal who goes by the name of  Ring of Fire  on Youtube and has over 130K followers, has completely embarrassed himself by using Kushner s inability to  fill out a simple form  or  who is so careless, or reckless, or downright stupid that he cannot fill out a form .",0

9787,Hey Packers and Bears: We Don’t Lock Arms for the National Anthem! [Video],"Last night s game between the Bears and Packers is usually a fun-filled event that s become a huge tradition for football fans everywhere. Last night was no exception!The stadium was filled with fans who chanted USA, USA! The fans were ready to see hand over heart during the national anthem but got something very disappointing instead. The players from both teams tried to split the difference and stand for the anthem while locking arms. Outraged fans considered it just as much a protest as taking a knee, the gesture made famous by former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick who kicked off the protest last year. I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free,  Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran Steven Tiefenthaler told the Green Bay Press-Gazette.Packers fans are in a unique position to have their voices heard because unlike the privately owned 31 other NFL teams, theirs is divvied up among over 360,000 fans who own over 5 million shares of the franchise. The division mirrored the stand-off between NFL players and President Trump who last week called for any athlete who kneels during the anthem to be fired.Read more: Daily Mail",0
9788,LOL! ONE HILARIOUS CARTOON Perfectly Illustrates How Embarrassingly Politically Correct The NFL Has Become,"Watching sports on TV or going to a football stadium to watch a game, used to be a great way to unwind and forget about your troubles at home or at work. Watching sports used to be a stress reliever for many. That was before the NFL and the NBA was hijacked by the politically correct police, and social justice warriors, and morphed into something most fans don t  even recognize anymore.One of the worst cases of political correctness was when liberals insisted that the Washington Redskins change their name so as not to offend Native Americans. The left got very little support from Redskins fans and surprisingly, many in the Native American community were unwilling to join the fight to demand a name change for the team. Eventually, the left was forced to walk away from that fight, and accept that the owners of the Redskins were focused on playing football, and were not interested in their foolish game of political correctness.Today, the NFL is facing a huge backlash from fans, as players are being asked to choose activism over their allegiance to their fans who couldn t care less about their political views, they re coming to escape the stresses of everyday life and to watch these professional athletes play football. They don t come to see professional athletes kneeling on the sidelines during our national anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter anti-cop group, who inspired the killings of several innocent cops, shut down major roads, threatened innocent people who got in their way, and looted and burned cities to the ground. Fans come to relax and to forget about their troubles. They come to get away from the divisive politics and challenges of everyday life. They certainly don t travel to stadiums to attend games or watch them on TV so they can be admonished or scolded for not holding the same politically correct views as the snowflakes on the field.This hilarious cartoon by BenGarrison is a perfect example of who fans are paying to see on the field today:It won t be long before fans stop supporting these snowflakes, and politically correct crybabies, and maybe then, they ll remember why we came ",0

9790,ACTOR JAMES WOODS DESTROYS Leftist TIME For Article Suggesting U.S. LIED About N. Korea Torturing Otto Warmbier Who Died After Returning In A Coma,"Yesterday, the parents of the now deceased American student from a Cincinnati, OH, suburb, Otto Warmbier, spoke out for the first time about the brutal condition of their son s body, who was returned from North Korea to the US in a coma. Otto was on a group tour of North Korea when he was accused of trying to steal a propaganda poster. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. After negotiations with the US State Department, Warmbier was returned from North Korea and died less than one week later.Fred and Cindy Warmbier told  Fox and Friends  about the harrowing moment they saw their 22-year-old son Otto on the plane after his return from 17 months in captivity.  When we got halfway up the steps, we heard this howling,  Fred Warmbier said.  We looked in and Otto was on the stretcher across in the plane and he was jerking violently, making these inhuman sounds. Otto s father Fred Warmbier painted a horrific picture of the condition in which they found their son upon his return to the U.S.:  Otto had a shaved head. He had a feeding tube coming out of his mouth. He was blind, he was deaf. As we looked at him and tried to comfort him, it looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth. Today, the leftist Time magazine joined other liberal publications who appear to be working to soften the image of the evil of Kim Jong Un by suggesting the horrific torture committed against American Otto Warmbier may never have happened. Time s headline on Twitter read:  We may never know whether North Korea tortured Otto Warmbier, coroner says We may never know whether North Korea tortured Otto Warmbier, coroner says https://t.co/SspIbxH55c  TIME (@TIME) September 28, 2017Actor James Woods was quick to respond to the disgusting article published by the Trump-hating publication, Time.

9791,GOLD STAR PARENTS Confront Black Activist Spike Lee Over NFL Flag Kneelers [Video],"The backlash from angry fans has only gotten bigger with the refusal of teams like the Packers asking the fans to join in on the protest. How deaf can they be to the sound of angry fans who want teams to stand with hand over heart for our flag and national anthem.The left is busy conflating the NFL protest with their rage over the election of Trump They ve turned Trump s comments into a  dog whistle  of racism Remember when Trump called the players  son s of b*tches ? Well, that s now been interpreted by the eternal victims in the black community as a  dog whistle  of racism. The problem is that anyone with half a brain knows there are white players too but it s just an inconvenient truth to the left. This is where they ve wanted the argument to go because it benefits the left to make Trump out to be a racist.Of course, anyone with a speck of common sense knows President Trump wants ALL Americans to come together to stand for the anthem period! Nothing to it but that Zero racism!The video below is a great example of how the black activists and left are in a rage.

9792,ANGRY GREEN BAY PACKERS Fans and Owners Lash Out After QB Aaron Rogers Asks Fans To Join Players In Protest Against Cops,"Have Americans already forgotten about the real reason Kaepernick was kneeling during the national anthem? He was kneeling in support of Black Lives Matter and their war against law enforcement. NFL players who kneel or stand in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick are protesting against our law enforcement. Should anyone be surprised by the backlash these players are receiving from their fans, as they disrespect our flag to show their support for Black Lives Matter s war on cops?Breitbart   Sports teams ask a lot of their fans, especially in places like Green Bay. Where, depending on the time of year, a fan could get hypothermia while just sitting in his seat. However, one recent request the team has made of the Pack faithful has left fans feeling a little hot.The Packers players, led by their quarterback Aaron Rodgers, issued a call to their fans to join them in interlocking arms during the national anthem. However, some fans have not taken kindly to the request. According to the Green Bay Press-Gazette, Packers Director of Public Affairs, Aaron Popkey, says fan reaction has been intense. We ve had a steady stream of feedback beginning Monday morning and it continued into Wednesday. We ve heard on both sides of the matter. We take note of their concerns. The fact that Popkey alludes to the  concerns  of the fans, would certainly lead one to believe that the  steady stream  of fan feedback has definitely tacked more negative, than positive.The issue of anthem protests, already a hot-button issue, became an even bigger story after President Trump s comments in Alabama last Friday night. Where, he referred to players who protested the anthem as  SOB s,  and said he wished their team owners would fire them.Those comments, led to a backlash from the league last weekend. All told, more than 200 players from all 32 teams protested the president s comments in some form or fashion. The Packers stood with interlocking arms, in their game against the Bengals. With the exception of three players who remained on the bench.However, those demonstrations did not meet with universal fan approval. Steven Tiefenthaler, a Wisconsin native, Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran, told the Green Bay Press-Gazette exactly how the protests made him feel:  I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free. Laura Hapke, another Wisconsin native whose mother is a shareholder of the team, was shocked that the Packers would participate in the protests. Hapke herself is on the waiting list to become a shareholder, though, the team s protests have given her some pause. Hapke said,  If they come out and say they are more into politics than patriotism, I ll have to rethink it. It will break my heart, but I ll have to rethink it. Hapke also had some really good advice for more constructive ways in which the players could protest, while letting the fans just enjoy the game. Hapke said,  If the players association would act outside of the game, I think it would be great. From the Green Bay Press Gazette: I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free,  said Steven Tiefenthaler, a native of Brookfield who now lives in San Antonio. Tiefenthaler is a Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran.Shawano native Lloyd Hohn, who now lives in Bismark, N.D., said he is more disappointed than angry. It was and is a heartbreaker to see my beloved Packers involved in this protest. I doubt injustice is going to be affected by this action. It is style over substance,  he said.  The players during their off time need to be physically and vocally involved to bring change. From Mark Panteo:The arrogant Leftists of the Green Bay Packers want fans to join them in protesting the National Anthem in a supposed show of  unity. Apparently, the only way to show  unity  in the NFL is to protest the National Anthem.Disgusting. This detestable league deserves to go the way of the Hillary campaign. ",0

The Steelers were no exception and are backpedaling like crazy We think the Steelers got the memo from their fans After a huge backlash about standing in the tunnel during the national anthem last Sunday, Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey says the team will stand this Sunday: I promise you one thing, this week we will all be standing out there for the national anthem.

We know there are injustice in this world, but to me, personally, football is football and that s what we need to approach it as. The Steelers decided to remain in the tunnel during the national anthem during their Sunday game against the Chicago Bears. Tackle Alejandro Villanueva was the only Steelers player who stood outside the tunnel.Pouncey says the whole thing was a big misunderstanding. I promise you this week that we ll all be standing out there for the national anthem. Trust me. We respect our flag, and we respect our military and everything that is a part of it,  he said.The Steelers decision didn t sit well with some Steelers fans who took to social media to voice their outrage, and even burn team merchandise.

9794,WOW! LEFTIST LIBRARIAN REJECTS Shipment Of Children’s Books Donated By Melania Trump…Her Reason For Rejecting The Books Is DISGUSTING!,"A school librarian in Cambridge, Massachusetts, rejected a shipment of books that were donated by first lady Melania Trump, according to CBS Boston.#HBFamilyReading: ""Dear Mrs. Trump"": @reflectlibrary says, Thanks but no thanks to the First Lady + Dr. Seuss  https://t.co/98SUPkjUN6 pic.twitter.com/3t6U6vvwPI  The Horn Book (@HornBook) September 26, 2017CBS Boston on Wednesday reported that Liz Phipps Soeiro of Cambridgeport Elementary School turned down the works Trump intended to send.The White House chose one school in all 50 states to receive a package of 10 books authored by children s literary author Dr. Seuss.The initiative was meant to promote education and childhood literacy as part of National Read A Book Day.Soeiro on Tuesday penned an editorial for the Horn Book s Family Reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation. My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science,  she wrote. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance,  Soeiro added.Trump s package reportedly included such Seuss classics as  Green Eggs and Ham,   The Cat in the Hat  and  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Soeiro criticized Seuss for being the only author represented in Trump s donation, citing controversy over some of his illustrations. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature,  she told Trump. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. According to the School Library Journal when social justice warrior, Lizz Phipps Soeiro isn t influencing the minds of young children with her progressive drivel, she s working to influence the minds of the parents: Once a week, she invites a speaker for casual meetings with parents at the library. Guests have included the mayor, school committee members, and local artists. Following President Trump s executive order banning travel from six Muslim nations, she invited a representative from the Council on American Islamic Relations and an attorney from the Muslim Justice League to speak to an audience including some 25 Muslim families about their rights. The lawyer met with individual families afterward. The library s collection reflects Phipps Soeiro s commitment to social justice. Titles such as Margarita Engle s Drum Dream Girl and Debbie Levy and Elizabeth Baddeley s I Dissent: Ruth Bader Ginsburg Makes Her Mark spark discussions about government and fairness. During a field trip to city hall, students sat in council chambers and asked questions of city leaders.(So in other words, a donation of books from the wife of our Republican President just didn t fit into the public school library that employs a narrow-minded liberal librarian.)The Cambridge School system on Wednesday released a statement noting the opinions Soeiro expressed do not represent the district. In this instance, the employee was not authorized to accept or reject donated books on behalf of the school or school district,  it said. We have counseled the employee on all relevant policies, including the policy against public resources being used for political purposes.   CircaSo there you have it the librarian is being  counseled  and NOT fired!If this story happened two years ago, and we inserted Michelle Obama s name into the story instead of Melania Trump s, does anyone think this would be a major news story with the school librarian s face plastered all over every major news network?Liz Phipps Soeiro can be found on Twitter at: @Cport_SpecialHere is the nasty letter that was written by Liz Phipps Soeiro in reply to Melania Trump s sweet gesture:Dear Mrs. Trump,Thank you for the ten Dr. Seuss titles that you sent my school library in recognition of this year s National Read a Book Day. (Sent second-day air, no less! That must have been expensive.) I m proud that you recognized my school as something special. It truly is. Our beautiful and diverse student body is made up of children from all over the world; from different socioeconomic statuses; with a spectrum of gender expressions and identities; with a range of abilities; and of varied racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. According to the White House website, you selected one school per state by  working with the Department of Education to identify schools with programs that have achieved high standards of excellence, recognized by State and National awards and Blue Ribbon Awards  Each of those carefully vetted schools received ten books: Seuss-isms!; Because a Little Bug Went KaChoo; What Pet Should I Get?; The Cat in the Hat; I Can Read with My Eyes Shut!; One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish; The Foot Book; Wacky Wednesday; Green Eggs and Ham; and Oh, the Places You ll Go!. My students were interested in reading your enclosed letter and impressed with the beautiful bookplates with your name and the indelible White House stamp, however, we will not be keeping the titles for our collection. I d like to respectfully offer my explanation. * * * * * My school and my library are indeed award-winning. I work in a district that has plenty of resources, which contributes directly to  excellence.  Cambridge, Massachusetts, is an amazing city with robust social programming, a responsive city government, free all-day kindergarten, and well-paid teachers (relatively speaking   many of us can t afford to live in the city in which we teach). My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance. The American Association of School Librarians has a great infographic on these findings. Many schools around the state and country can t compete. Yearly per-pupil spending in Cambridge is well over $20,000; our city s values are such that given a HUGE range in the socioeconomic status of our residents, we believe that each and every child deserves the best free education possible and are working hard to make that a reality (most classrooms maintain a 60/40 split between free/reduced lunch and paid lunch). This offers our Title I school and the district a lot of privilege and room for programming and pedagogy to foster  high standards of excellence.  Even so, we still struggle to close the achievement gap, retain teachers of color, and dismantle the systemic white supremacy in our institution. But hell, we test well! And in the end, it appears that data   and not children   are what matters. Meanwhile, school libraries around the country are being shuttered. Cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit are suffering through expansion, privatization, and school  choice  with no interest in outcomes of children, their families, their teachers, and their schools. Are those kids any less deserving of books simply because of circumstances beyond their control? Why not go out of your way to gift books to underfunded and underprivileged communities that continue to be marginalized and maligned by policies put in place by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos? Why not reflect on those  high standards of excellence  beyond only what the numbers suggest? Secretary DeVos would do well to scaffold and lift schools instead of punishing them with closures and slashed budgets.So, my school doesn t have a NEED for these books. And then there s the matter of the books themselves. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature. As First Lady of the United States, you have an incredible platform with world-class resources at your fingertips. Just down the street you have access to a phenomenal children s librarian: Dr. Carla Hayden, the current Librarian of Congress. I have no doubt Dr. Hayden would have given you some stellar recommendations.Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. Open one of his books (If I Ran a Zoo or And to Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, for example), and you ll see the racist mockery in his art. Grace Hwang Lynch s School Library Journal article,  Is the Cat in the Hat Racist? Read Across America Shifts Away from Dr. Seuss and Toward Diverse Books,  reports on Katie Ishizuka s work analyzing the minstrel characteristics and trope nature of Seuss s characters. Scholar Philip Nel s new book, Was the Cat in the Hat Black? The Hidden Racism of Children s Literature, and the Need for Diverse Books, further explores and shines a spotlight on the systemic racism and oppression in education and literature. I am honored that you recognized my students and our school. I can think of no better gift for children than books; it was a wonderful gesture, if one that could have been better thought out. Books can be a powerful way to learn about and experience the world around us; they help build empathy and understanding. In return, I m attaching a list of ten books (it s the librarian in me) that I hope will offer you a window into the lives of the many children affected by the policies of your husband s administration. You and your husband have a direct impact on these children s lives. Please make time to learn about and value them. I hope you share these books with your family and with kids around the country. And I encourage you to reach out to your local librarian for more recommendations.

9795,"ANGRY LEFTIST CAUGHT On VIDEO Stealing Student’s Trump Hat…DEMANDS School Makes Him Stop Wearing Hat: “F*** your f***ing freedom of speech, boy!”","***WARNING***This video will make your blood boil. The exchange between this Hispanic woman, (who we re pretty sure is not a legal citizen, based on her comment to the victim, when she screamed,  F*ck your laws!  after he cited his right to free-speech) and the victim is stunning. Over and over again, this ill-informed and unbelievably angry student makes up her own facts with absolutely no basis whatsoever.  Saying things like the signature Trump hat that reads  Make America GReat Again  represents  the genocide of a bunch of people  and  America was never great  and of but of course,  You stole this land!  Just another ungrateful immigrant who is likely one of Obama s  Dreamers. According to Campus Reform, here s how the unbelievable exchange went down:A Trump-supporting student at the University of California, Riverside had his MAGA hat stolen by a peer who demanded that administrators refuse to allow him to continue to wear it.A video of the incident obtained by Campus Reform shows an enraged female student taking the hat to the school s Student Life Department as Matthew Vitale fruitlessly attempts to explain to the young woman that the hat is his property. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t,  she continues as several staffers look on. Are you people not going to do anything? She is stealing my property,  Vitale pleads, though the altercation went on for several more minutes. We will need to return his property to him, but we can talk about  one university employee begins to explain before being abruptly cut off by the student thief. How about we talk about not letting him wear this sh*t on campus?  the thief retorts, while Vitale later tells a growing presence of administrators that  the fact that you people haven t gotten this back for me is sad and wrong. The altercation continued for several minutes until the hat was relinquished to an administrator who then returned it to Vitale, though not before his fellow student got in the last word. F*** your f***ing freedom of speech, boy. F***it. F*** it because your freedom of speech is literally killing a lot of people out there.",0
9796,Sports Bar Owner Bans NFL Games…Will Show Only ‘True American’ Sports: ‘I’d like to speak for rural America’ [Video],"The owner of the Ringling Bar, located south of White Sulphur Springs, is standing behind his Facebook post that criticizes NFL players who take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality. The post was made on the Ringling Bar s Facebook page Tuesday night and has since received hundreds of comments and shares. The post reads:  The Ringling Bar will no longer show any NFL games. This will allow us to air the PBR, Rodeo and NASCAR events whose competitors are true Americans! Sorry for any inconvenience. Ringling Bar Co-owner Kurt Bekemans, who grew up in the Paradise Valley, published the post and said he doesn t care if the post turns some customers away. Seriously, I would not care if non-Americans didn t patronize the place,  said Bekemans.  I d like to speak for rural America: I bet you wouldn t see any farmers or ranchers in our whole country take a knee such as these guys do, I bet you couldn t find one. They appreciate what our great nation has given them and I think that s the least you could do to give thanks to our country is stand for the flag and the anthem. As of Wednesday morning, a majority of the comments were in support of the bar.

What a vile low candy-ass choice you made. I was looking for 100 percent participation, we were gonna be respectful of our football team,  Tomlin told reporters.Your team does not come before America.Why should anyone be forced to act in a way that is against their moral code? The poor boys  millionaire club could not all agree on whether or not to disrespect America so you hid. We Americans understand. Trust me.Let the kneelers kneel, the sitters sit, the Patriots stand, own your beliefs. Own your side. Everyone with a working knowledge of contract law knows that the players disrespecting America could have been fined in accordance with their contract.Remember Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf? He was fined $30,000 after disrespecting the flag and choosing to sit on his butt during the anthem. Once he was fined he worked out a compromise and stood, he recited Islamic prayers under his breath but he did not disgrace his team by disrespecting the American flag, the anthem, America herself.The administrative branch of the NFL is tax exempt. I hope that exemption is revoked. The entire league is subsidized with billions of taxpayers dollars, for what, so you can spit in the faces of the people who support you? No more.You have backed the wrong horse. Sometimes not choosing a side is choosing through omission.You ve taken something that unites Americans of every color, creed, and religion and managed to divide them through your cowardliness and fear of offending the  wrong   people. Fine them or fire them this is behavior that is covered in their contracts  conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the National Football League. Honoring 9/11 is detrimental, wearing pink in your hair to honor breast cancer survivors and casualties is detrimental, twerking is detrimental but dishonoring the American flag is not detrimental to the integrity of the NFL. Hypocrites. You lousy lowlife mamby-pamby, money-grubbing, cowardly, politically correct, assholes can all go to hell.Your decision to hide in the tunnel is disgusting and cowardly. Your decision to criticize Alejandro Villanueva a war veteran, a man who fought for your freedom, a man who saved lives, a man who was willing to lay his life down for you, a bronze heart recipient is beyond words.Mike Tomlin, James Harrison, Ben Roethlisberger and any Steeler who has the audacity to criticize or question Alejandro Villanueva standing for the National Anthem, choosing country over his team, you are what is wrong with America. As a team, you boys get a ball from one of a field to another side of the field and celebrate. As a man, Villanueva rescued wounded soldiers while under enemy fire and you cowardly clowns are hiding in a tunnel because you couldn t decide whether or not to stand or sit for the American flag have the misguided intrepidity to criticize Villanueva s dedication to America?I hope my fellow Americans pray with me for a holy curse on your team, that you not win a single game for the rest of the season. I hope that you lose your tax exempt status, I hope you rethink your disgusting words and actions.May the souls of the faithfully departed brothers and sisters who came home under the American flag haunt your every moment.If you enjoyed  Lovely s  letter and would like to see more of her blog, please visit her blog by clicking HERE.",0

Scalise is in surgery right now and is expected to recover.Rand Paul said Scalise being there likely saved everyone because his presence (he s leadership) meant Capitol Police were there.Scalise, a member of the House Republican leadership as the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, according to Rep. Mo Brooks who was on deck when the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team.NBC News Special Report: Congressman Scalise, aides shot at baseball practice in Virginia https://t.co/KD9i1iP9MZ  Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 14, 2017In a statement, Texas Rep. Roger Williams, one of the team s coaches, said one of his staff members was shot during the incident and is receiving medical attention. There was no information on the staffer s injuries.According to both congressional and law enforcement sources, the shooting appears to be a  deliberate attack. Two law enforcement sources say the suspect  is in police custody, has been taken to a hospital.Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice, at a field where they ve practiced for years, when all of a sudden shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.Congressmen in attendance described  an injured Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base and lying there until the shooter was shot. The Congressmen then ran to help him. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went out to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police. It would have been a massacre without them.  -Rand Paul  We had nothing but baseball bats to fight back against a rifle with.    Congressman Mo BrooksArizona Sen. Jeff Flake added that he saw a member of Scalise s security detail return fire on the gunman for what felt like 10 minutes, even though the police officer was wounded in the leg.  50 shots would be an understatement, I m quite sure,  Flake said when asked about the total amount of gunfire, including police returning fire. Flake said two members of Scalise s security detail were wounded, and another man was wounded in the chest. Brooks said the shooter appeared to be a white male but added that  I saw him for a second or two.  He said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didn t say anything.  The gun was a semiautomatic,  Brooks said, adding that he was sure it was a rifle but unsure what kind.  It continued to fire at different people.

9799,LOL! SNARKY WHITE YAHOO Sports Writer TRASHES Black NHL Player P.K.Subban For Saying He’ll “Never Kneel During National Anthem” Because He Has “Too Much Respect For American Flag”,"How very bold of the white Yahoo sports writer Greg Wyshynski, who affectionately refers to himself as  Puck Daddy  to call out one of only a handful of black men in the NHL for not standing up for the Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement, that disrespects our flag, and our veterans in one fell swoop Wyshynski writes: P.K. Subban said on Tuesday that he will  never  kneel during the national anthem to protest something politically.Subban performed at a fundraiser on Tuesday night at Zanies Comedy Club in Nashville, to benefit Comedy Cares. He told the audience that he would  never  take a knee during the national anthem because he has too much respect for the American flag. His comments were sent to us by two eyewitnesses and confirmed by the Predators. Subban, who is Canadian, is considered the most prominent black player in pro hockey.Earlier in the day, the Nashville Predators announced that, as a team, they would not engage in any protests during the national anthem. This came less than two days after hundreds of NFL players, coaches and executives showed solidarity in rebuking President Donald Trump s comments that players who protested police brutality against African-Americans during the national anthem were  sons of bitches  who deserved to lose their jobs.Said CEO Sean Henry, to the Tennessean: When this all came about, we wanted to get together with our team because everything we do is collaborative. When we say what we re going to be doing, it really is a  we.  Everyone had input on it. We are honoring the anthem and the flag and the country by standing during the anthem. We invite our fans to do so with us.  It is also our way of honoring what else it stands for, and it does provide for the freedom for others to express their views and protests in a manner in which they feel comfortable doing. We just think there s proper forums for all. Our games have become this unifying celebration, so we have decided that we re all going to stand together to honor the country and all that comes with it. According to Seth Dean, a Predators fans who attended the comedy fundraiser event, Subban took the stage and said  he will continue to stand, respect, and sing along with U.S. anthem.  At one point, he pointed out a friend of his in the crowd who was a law enforcement officer from Boston.From Dean: He also addressed why he always shuffles his feet during anthem. He first said it could be ADD but he was never tested. Then he mentioned just being pumped up by crowd and excited to support USA even as a Canadian. He even jokingly suggested we should all stand and sing anthem there at Zanies (which didn t happen). He obviously wasn t going to go against Lavy s proclamation that players were going to stay standing, especially with his coach in the room, but he made his support for anthem as unequivocal as he possibly could. In an email to Yahoo Sports, Hailey, another attendee, described the scene in more detail:Tonight was a comedy fundraiser at Zanies in Nashville, for which Ryan Hamilton was the headliner. As my attendance was spontaneous, I was pretty excited when PK Subban was the first  comedian . Much to my surprise, his allegedly  impromptu  set ended with a tense promise from PK that despite his previous dancing antics during the national anthem, he would NEVER kneel during the national anthem, followed by a long rant about his  respect  for the American flag.

What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?  Donald J.

The LFL recognizes everyone s First Amendment right to protest, but our nation s flag and anthem are far too sacred,  the league said.  Too many fellow Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice, so that our flag and anthem continue in all its majesty. It symbolizes all the blood, sweat, and tears that have been shed so that we as Americans can raise our flag across our nation,  the organization says during the video.

9802,Shocking Report: Mind Blowing Cost of Illegals Is Highest Ever…Numbers Released Show Huge Burden To States [Video],"EVERY American taxpayer should be outraged at the numbers in the report below. Open borders under 8 years of Obama is costing American taxpayers a tremendous amount more than ever before! Don t forget the thousands upon thousands of illegal alien minors who flooded the border during Obama s presidency. The bottom line is that open borders have consequences and the unfortunate consequence for taxpayers is we re footing the bill for illegals and THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE!The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.DON T FORGET THAT OBAMA HELPED FACILITATE THE ARRIVAL OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL MINORS THAT WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR: Spanish-language media and human rights activists are actively educating illegal immigrants on how to break the law, avoid immigration agents and remain in the country even after a judge has ordered them to be kicked out, a top Obama administration official testified to Congress on Tuesday.HERE S THOMAS HOMAN S TESTIMONY FROM 2014: Despite claims from pro-illegal immigration advocates that the aliens pay significant off-setting taxes back to federal, state and local treasuries, the Federation for American Immigration Reform report tallied just $19 billion, making the final hit to taxpayers about $116 billion. State and local governments are getting ravaged by the costs, at over $88 billion. The federal government, by comparison, is getting off easy at $45 billion in costs for illegals.n.The report, titled  The Fiscal Burden Of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers,  is the most comprehensive cost tally from FAIR. It said that the costs have jumped about $3 billion in four years and will continue to surge unless illegal immigration is stopped. It was provided in advance exclusively to Secrets. Clearly, the cost of doing nothing to stop illegal immigration is far too high,  said FAIR Executive Director Dan Stein.  President Trump has laid out a comprehensive strategy to regain control of illegal immigration and bring down these costs,  said Stein.  Building the wall, enhancing interior enforcement and mandating national E-Verify will go a long way in bringing these ridiculously high costs under control,  he added.Over 68 often shocking pages, FAIR documents the average $8,075 in state, local and federal spending for each of the of 12.5 million illegal immigrants and their 4.2 million citizen children.Broadly, the costs include $29 billion in medical care, $23 billion for law enforcement, $9 billion in welfare, $46 billion for education.Just consider the cost of teaching an illegal alien child who doesn t speak English. FAIR estimates an average cost of over $12,000 a year, and that can reach $25,000 in New York. Add to that welfare, health care, school lunches, and the per student price soars.In state costs alone, California leads the list at $23 billion per year, followed by Texas at $11 billion, and New York at $7.4 billion.And it also documents the taxes paid and how they don t come close to offsetting the costs. What s more, FAIR noted that 35 percent of the illegal population operate in an underground economy hidden from tax collectors. And worse, employers hire illegals and either pay them cheaply or under the table. The United States recoups only about 14 percent of the amount expended annually on illegal aliens. If the same jobs held by illegal aliens were filled by legal workers, at the prevailing market wage, it may safely be presumed that federal, state and local governments would receive higher tax payments,  said FAIR.Key findings pulled from the report are shocking:The staggering total costs of illegal immigrants and their children outweigh the taxes paid to federal and state governments by a ratio of roughly 7 to 1, with costs at nearly $135 billion compared to tax revenues at nearly $19 billion.The nearly $135 billion paid out by federal and state and local taxpayers to cover the cost of the presence of 12.5 million illegal aliens and their 4.2 million citizen children amounts to approximately $8,075 per illegal alien and citizen child prior to taxes paid, or $6,940 per person after taxes are paid.On the federal level, medical ($17.14 billion) is by far the highest cost, with law enforcement coming second ($13.15 billion) and general government services ($8 billion) third.At the state and local level, education ($44.4 billion) was by far the largest expense, followed by general public services ($18.5 billion) and medical ($12.1 billion).The top three states based on total cost to state taxpayers for illegal immigrants and their children: California ($23 billion); Texas ($10.9 billion), and New York ($7.5 billion).Read more: WE ",0

9805,MICHIGAN STATE POLICE CHIEF Under Fire For Sharing Meme On Social Media About NFL Players Anti-Cop Movement,"Has the Left and the leftist media managed to make Americans forget why this whole  kneeling in protest against the American flag  in the NFL started? Have Americans forgotten the statement made by Colin Kaepernick when asked why he kneeled during our national anthem while every other player stood in respect for our flag?When the San Francisco 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick was asked why he kneeled during our national anthem, his response was about police brutality, and about his belief that cops were essentially getting away with murdering blacks with no consequences.Here is Kaepernick s official statement:One day before 5 police officers were murdered in Dallas, TX by a Black Lives Matter supporter, Cleveland Browns player Isiah Crowell posted an image on his Instagram account of a man wearing an ISIS-like image of a man wearing an all-black outfit and black mask standing behind a police officer and stabbing him in the neck with a knife.The Cleveland Browns made the following statement on behalf of Crowell for his disgusting actions: We have spoken to Isaiah regarding his extremely disturbing and unacceptable social media decision. It was completely inappropriate and we have made him aware of our high level of disappointment. Isaiah has apologized but also knows that just an apology is insufficient and that he must take steps to make a positive difference after a very negative and impactful post. The NFL made no apology for Crowell s terrorist-like post aimed to incite violence against our law-enforcement officers. Should law enforcement officers be forced to remain silent in the face of a movement created to disparage and discredit the amazing work they do every day because of a Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement that has permeated the NFL?Stephen Loomis, President of Cleveland Police Patrolmen s Association spoke out against Cleveland Brown s player Isiah Crowell. Lommis said he thinks the  store-bought apology  isn t enough.  He needs to go to Dallas, help the families who lost their loved ones last week, write them a check, look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology. Loomis says Crowell s post was as  offensive as putting a picture of historical African-American men being hung from a tree in the 60s.  He adds that if Crowell doesn t go to Dallas and make a donation,  I will pull Cleveland officers, sheriffs, state troopers out of First Energy Stadium this season if he doesn t make it right. As for Crowell admitting he was wrong and acted out of rage   Loomis says,  You re a grown ass man, and you claim you were too emotional to know it was wrong? Think we ll accept your apology? Kiss my ass.    TMZOn Sunday, the Patriots were booed wildly by fans when the team took a knee during our national anthem. Today, the leftist Detroit Free Press attempted to smear Michigan State Police Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue for sharing a message on social media criticizing the NFL players  protests.Here is the post that Etue did NOT create, but shared privately with her friends on Facebook. The message in this post is pretty clear. It s a message to the NFL letting them know that Americans will not sit back silently and allow millionaires who are obviously not grateful to be living in the United States disrespect our flag, our law enforcement officers, and our veterans.The Detroit Free Press used a statement from ONE SOURCE, Leonard Mungo, a Detroit attorney who, in 2015, filed a class action lawsuit against the Michigan State Police, who Mungo claimed were not hiring enough black and Hispanic troopers. The Detroit Free Press quote from Mungo said the posting demonstrates  kind of a dangerous mindset for someone in her powerful position. It s  scary that they don t understand that America is defined by its freedoms, and one of these freedoms is freedom of speech,  Mungo said. It also  has implications for why the state police   don t have representative numbers of African Americans in their ranks,  he said.Shanon Banner, a spokeswoman for Etue, said the colonel s Facebook post was not about race and was posted not publicly, but so that only Etue s friends would see it. As a public servant, Col. Etue has great respect for the armed forces and those who fight to protect our freedoms, Banner said in an e-mail to the Free Press.Etue did not create the post, Banner said.  It s a meme that is posted in other places around the Internet,  she said.Etue, who heads the statewide police department, shared the meme entitled  Dear NFL  on her Facebook page Sunday. It was a post widely shared on social media by those critical of hundreds of NFL players this past weekend who locked arms and/or kneeled during the pre-game playing of the national anthem. Some forms of the meme are calling for a boycott of the NFL until these silent gridiron protests end.The Michigan State Police issued an apology from Etue on their Facebook page. Americans should be asking why Etue has to apologize for standing up for law enforcement officers and veterans she defended in her post? While the left is screaming about the rights of the NFL players to disrespect our flag,  perhaps someone should ask them when Col. Etue s First Amendment Right become null and void? As a side note, The Detroit Free Press is home to Stephen Henderson, the race-obsessed, angry editorial editor who attempted to label Kid Rock (the single father of a black son and NAACP award winner) as a  racist , stirring up hate and negativity towards the beloved Detroit rocker who does so much for the residents of the city of Detroit.

9806,Bill O’Reilly On Hannity: Reveals Who Threatened Them If They Had The Interview [Video],"Bill O Reilly revealed last night during his segment with Sean Hannity that they were threatened by Media Maters NOT to have the interview (PLEASE SEE BELOW). These two are great together! O Reilly calls out the main stream media in a big way.The interview is fantastic! They should do this more often.Fox News reported:Bill O Reilly blasted left-wing groups for trying to  wipe out speech  they disagree with.Sean Hannity said the media has become corrupt and  bitterly ideological. O Reilly agreed that progressive groups like Media Matters track and threaten independent voices in the media who do not conform to progressive orthodoxy or talking points. These people want to wipe out any speech with which they disagree,  O Reilly said.Hannity said Media Matters, which was founded by left-wing political operative David Brock, threatened him and O Reilly over their planned interview.THEY EVEN HAVE A WEBSITE TO STOP HANNITY! GET A GRIP!MEDIA MATTERS RIPPED HANNITY  FOR IGNORING THEIR THREATS: By bringing back Bill O Reilly, Sean Hannity proves he s a reckless loose cannonHannity s unhinged behavior threatens to have a real impact on his bottom line. Advertisers have started dropping Hannity. Thanks in part to Media Matters  Stop Hannity advertiser education effort, advertisers are learning that financially supporting his political chicanery and Trump s political interests is bad for business. We ve seen this story unfold in the past, with O Reilly and Glenn Beck before him.Hannity s apparent decision to add O Reilly to his stable of guests is a disaster for Fox. The move gives ad buyers who were already concerned that Fox couldn t control Hannity a new reason for alarm. It gives advertisers who previously abandoned O Reilly s show a reason to fear that their ads elsewhere on the network could end up promoting him. And it gives British regulators   who were already reviewing Fox as part of Rupert Murdoch s $15 billion bid to purchase Sky   a reason to worry about the network s corporate governance and commitment to changing its seedy culture.Fox knows all this, so it seems more likely that the network was blindsided by a host who s out of its control than that it is willingly complicit in his effort to promote his former colleague. And Hannity knows it too. He just doesn t care.This may be the beginning of Fox s nightmare   the last remaining member of its former dream team, openly revolting and daring the network to fire him and let him take his audience somewhere else. It won t end until Hannity gets his way, or is sent on his way.MEDIA MATTERS WANTS TO DESTROY HANNITYThe two also discussed how such forces have tried to silence or  destroy  pro-Trump voices and  anyone who voted for him.

9808,Is This Dem Senator Switching Parties? Calls Out NFL Owners In Player Protest: ‘Right thing to do’ [Video],"Rumors continue to swirl around West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin who told voters during a Facebook live Q & A that he thinks NFL owners should step in and tell players protesting during the national anthem they won t tolerate it. The Democrat Senator has been brushing off talk that he s switching parties to become a Republican. He often agrees with the Republican party and has recently commented that he doesn t  give a sh*t  if he s reelected. Manchin came down on the side of the president in the NFL controversy and had some heartfelt comments about why he stands for our anthem. He called on the NFL owners to address the disrespect in kneeling during the anthem:SENATOR JOE MANCHIN:  This is something the owners have to address. The owners of these football teams, that have these contracts with these players and the conditions these players are going to be playing under, has to step in here and say, I m not going to tolerate it. The only thing that you and I can do right now is turn off the TV if you don t want to watch, don t go to the game if that s a team you don t respect for whatever reason. I think everyone should stand and show respect for the flag that represents the greatest nation on earth that s shed more blood and lost more lives for the cause of freedom that you and I enjoy. HEARTFELT COMMENTS ON  THE RIGHT THING TO DO Senator Manchin spoke about why he believes this is the  right thing to do :  When I was a young person it was just taught to me that was the right thing to do. When I got older and I realized all the sacrifices that were made for me people that went to war, people that didn t return when I realized all of that, I said that s my patriotic duty that I can say thank you for the flag that represents the greatest country on earth. Well said! ",0
9809,BREAKING NEWS: Controversial ALABAMA GOP Senate Primary Race Winner Announced,"Luther Strange will likely be the first and last establishment candidate Trump will make the admitted  mistake  of supporting Roy Moore defeated Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in Tuesday s Alabama Republican Senate primary runoff.The primary took on national importance as President Trump endorsed Strange, while traditional Trump allies, such as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, backed Moore. They re going to say,  Donald Trump, the President of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line. It is a terrible, terrible moment for Trump,  the president said while imitating news anchors at a Friday rally in Alabama in support of Strange.Strange become a senator when Jeff Sessions left his seat to become attorney general. The senator is a former lobbyist and was backed by a super PAC linked to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Chamber of Commerce, a typical establishment GOP partner. Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country. They think you re a pack of morons. They think you re nothing but rubes,  Bannon said at a rally Monday in support of Moore.  They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do. However, Trump contended at his Friday rally in support of Strange that the senator barely knew McConnell, and that the Alabama senator is  determined to drain that swamp. The president would go on to say,  I ll be honest, I might have made a mistake,  and said he would campaign  like hell  for Moore if he were to win the primary. The former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice led the race throughout in the polls, and was up by 11 points in the final public poll.Moore is a major figure in Alabama and became nationally known in 2003 when he was removed from office after defying a federal court s ruling to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama state Supreme Court building.Like Trump, the former judge has a brash and sometimes offensive manner of speaking. Now we have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting. What s going to unite us? What s going to bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No. It s going to be God,  Moore said in a campaign speech.  Daily Caller ",0
9810,WATCH: SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN Tells TMZ Sports Reporter He’s Okay With NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag,"John McCain really doesn t care what topic reporters ask him about, he only cares how President Trump feels about it, so he can take an opposing view.  If President Trump agrees with a social or political issue, McCain disagrees with it. If Trump disagrees, McCain thinks it s a great idea.The cantankerous John McCain has become so predictable, it s almost laughable to hear his opinions anymore.  He s become an embarrassment to the Republican Party but refuses to give up the R behind his name to save the party of the humiliation of his antics.McCain s latest embarrassing interview happened today when TMZ caught up with him to ask him his thoughts on the NFL players taking a knee in a show of disrespect for our flag, as a way to support the anti-cop Black Lives Matter movement.  Instead of standing up our flag, or for his fellow veterans and the country he once fought so valiantly for, McCain took the cowardly way out and made a statement supporting the NFL player s right to disrespect our flag. Not surprisingly, McCain s remarks stood in contrast to strong admonition President Trump had for the disrespectful athletes in the NFL.Watch:",0

The customer service rep he talked to said he had already received five calls to cancel on Tuesday alone, Alvarado said.DirecTV did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Alvarado said the policy change happened overnight.

If I have to sit in jail for the rest of eternity, that s my choice,  Reitman said. I guess I m being stubborn   but I m not going to back down from what I believe. The Hill",0

ALL of the cable channels had Dem talking heads claiming Trump spoke directly to ONLY the black players when he condemned the protest.

Even though President Trump NEVER made this about race, you knew it would happen, didn t you? The left has nothing else nothing!!!WHAT DID SHE JUST SAY???Jackson Lee explained.  The only reason he is doing is because someone had the lack of judgment to provoke the situation and call their mothers a name. I refuse to accept that as a standard of leadership for the highest office in the world. Jackson Lee continued by saying:  there is no basis in the First Amendment that says you cannot kneel in the national anthem or in front of the flag. I kneel in honor of them. I kneel in front of the flag and on this floor,  Jackson Lee declared while taking a knee. I kneel in honor of the First Amendment. I kneel because the flag is a symbol for freedom.

He is currently in the field until Friday and unable to answer detailed questions, but a Medium post authored by the Infantry Officer details some of his views. He wrote, following the murder of socialist Heather Heyer during the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rallies:The toppling of the Confederate Soldiers Memorial in Durham, North Carolina has sounded the death knell for any and all displays of Confederate aggrandizement in the United States as well as abroad. Yet, the shadow of the Confederacy and its efforts to preserve slavery is not limited to the southern United States.The response to Rapone s tweet has been mostly supportive though some have raised concerns about his personal and job safety and the image is quickly approaching viral status. He later sought to clear up any confusion by posting another image of himself. This time, sporting a Che Guevara t-shirt underneath his half-buttoned uniform, Rapone tweeted,  In case there was any lingering doubt, hasta la victoria siempre,  a popular slogan attributed to the late Marxist revolutionary, physician, and guerrilla leader who was ultimately killed and captured by the United States  own CIA.

9815,WATCH: DETROIT ARTIST Takes Knee and Raises Fist While Singing National Anthem At Lions Game…Young Boys Standing Next To Him Appear To Be Confused,"Local artist Rico Lavelle was given the distinct honor and privilege of singing the national anthem on the Ford Field at the start of the Lions football game on Sunday. Singing the national anthem has always been about honoring our flag and the brave women and men it represents who have given their lives for our nation. The seriousness of what happened near the end of Lavelle s performance cannot be understated. Rico Lavelle used his privilege to honor our flag and our military to instead, take a stand against our current President, to support a divisive, Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement, and to salute the violent Black Panthers on a national stage.The video in and of itself is very disturbing as it shows a total and utter lack of respect for the honor bestowed upon Lavelle, but if you watch closely, you ll see 3 or 4 young black boys who also had the privilege of taking part of the national anthem on the field. Sadly, the young boys appear to be confused about what the local artist Rico Lavelle, aka Midwest Rico, is doing when he kneels and raises his fist. Perpetuating the lie that America is more racially divided now than ever before, or that all police officers are bad people is (hopefully) not why the Lions asked Lavelle to honor our flag with his rendition of the  Star Spangled Banner .Watch:Rico Lavelle sang the anthem AND took a knee pic.twitter.com/mgno4HCzZQ  Jasmine (@JasmineLWatkins) September 24, 2017Lavelle s performance didn t end on the field, he immediately took to Twitter to criticize President Trump for being  Un-American .How can the ""leader"" of the free world be so UN-American?  rico lavelle   (@midwestrico) September 24, 2017Later on Twitter, Lavelle retweeted a message of encouragement from the Boston Globe Deputy Washington Bureau Chief and CNN contributor, Matt Visor:Here is the tweet of encouragement from the  NOT very objective Washington bureau chief of the Boston Globe and #VeryFakeNewsCNN political analyst Matt Viser:While hitting the last note of the national anthem in Detroit, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee as young black boys looked on pic.twitter.com/lVkQvKV7Sk  Matt Viser (@mviser) September 24, 2017To which Lavelle responded by calling himself an  example :Be the example https://t.co/UavKROgfl6  rico lavelle   (@midwestrico) September 24, 2017As a side note, FBI released data yesterday showing Detroit as the winner (again) as the nation s most violent big city.At 84.3%, Detroit has the highest percentage of black residents.Perhaps the players and owners of NFL teams would be better served to try and find ways to save black youths from killing each other, rather than manufacturing racial issues or putting targets on the backs of our brave law enforcement officers. The stunning chart below from the Brookings Institute provides a pretty strong argument that racism and law enforcement is not what s harming the black community:",0

9817,WOW! TOP SPONSORS OF NFL Issue Statements About National Anthem Protests,"Despite massive boycott threats by consumers, at least 3 major sponsors of the NFL have come out in support of players disrespecting our flag and our veterans. NFL players have joined the now unemployed 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick to take a knee on the field during our national anthem as a way to show support for the Black Lives Matter anti-cop movement. The protest exploded over the weekend when President Trump spoke out against the disrespect NFL players are showing for our flag, turning the protest into an anti-Trump protest for players who many believe are still angry that Trump won the election, defeating the seriously flawed Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.Ford Motor Co., Armour Inc., and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA issued statements that affirmed NFL players  rights to kneel during the pre-game national anthem, while also sounding patriotic notes and affirming their support for the flag.Ford Motor Co, one of the biggest sponsors of the NFL just revealed that they are supporting the national anthem protests. We respect individuals  rights to express their views, even if they are not ones we share,  Ford stated.  That s part of what makes America great. Ford Motor Co chairman Martha Firestone Ford took her support for the players anti-cop, Black Lives Matter and anti-President Trump protests one step further when she joined her players on the field and linked arms with her daughters. The tangled responses are the latest version of the challenges faced by corporations in a world in which the president makes public demands and denouncements of companies via Twitter. General Motors Co., Campbell Soup Co., ESPN parent Walt Disney Co. and Uber Technologies Inc. have all faced calls for boycotts related to their perceived support of   or distance from   the White House.  BloombergAmericans are not as easily fooled by the actions of these disrespectful athletes and the team owners, as they work together with the media in an attempt to weaken and discredit our President for having the audacity to stand up for America, our flag and for the honor of every brave man and woman who have sacrificed their lives for our great nation.One of the great things about America is that consumers can decide not to purchase merchandise or goods from companies who continue to advertise with the NFL.

9819,WATCH: Why NFL Players Taking A Knee Is Total Bullsh*t…It’s Really About “Trump-Derangement-Syndrome”,"Outspoken conservative Paul Joseph Watson is, as usual,  spot on  with his analysis of what is happening today with the overpaid, petulant athletes in the NFL who are  taking a knee  during our national anthem, as a way to protest the  injustices  against blacks by cops. Watson points out that while they re protesting the deaths of blacks at the hands of cops in their communities, they completely ignore the rampant black on black crime and the actual high crime rates by blacks in the cities where the alleged  injustices  are taking place. Watson also claims the NFL players are ignoring the fact  that white people are more likely to be shot dead by cops  than blacks.This week, NFL players and even some coaches, turned their ire against President Donald Trump for daring to suggest that NFL owners should be taking disciplinary action against players who disrespect our flag that represents the lives sacrificed by so many brave men and women who died giving them the right to protest.Paul Joseph Watson reminds Americans how prevalent violence is with many of the  thugs  who play in the NFL. Watson even suggests,  Maybe they all hate the police so much because the cops are the only ones stopping them from beating up their own wives and girlfriends. This new incarnation of  take a knee  isn t about protesting police murders of black people.  There haven t even been any high-profilee cases of that for months.  It isn t about patriotism. It isn t about free-speech.  It s just the latest manifestation of mass hysteria of Trump-derangement-syndrome. Watch: ",0

Unfortunately I threw my teammates under the bus, unintentionally,  Alejandro Villanueva said on Monday. Every single time I see that picture of me standing by myself I feel embarrassed. Villanueva then explained that he had asked to stand in the front of the team with the captains of the squad at the last second so that they showed some respect for wounder veterans.That plan backfired though when he did not stop to check that the captains were by his side as he walked to the opening of the tunnel, which is how the 6ft 9in lineman ended up in plain view on the field as the national anthem began to play.Watch:His admission comes after thousands across the country declared him a hero for his actions, and began purchasing his jersey in record numbers to show support for what they thought was a calculated move.Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger also said on Monday that he was meant to be by Villanueva s side at the time, but got held back by the melee in the tunnel after the tackle walked too far out.

RoethlisbergerCAN T YOU BE UNIFIED AS A TEAM BY STANDING FOR THE ANTHEM? The idea was to be unified as a team when so much attention is paid to things dividing our country, but I wish we approached it differently. We did not want to appear divided on the sideline with some standing and some kneeling or sitting.  He closed out by saying:  I appreciate the unique diversity in my team and throughout the league and completely support the call for social change and the pursuit of true equality. Moving forward, I hope standing for the Anthem shows solidarity as a nation, that we stand united in respect for the people on the front lines protecting our freedom and keeping us safe. God bless those men and women.  He also spoke on Monday during practice in Pittsburgh and confirmed that the Steelers will not skip the anthem again this season. Read more: Daily Mail",0
9823,MAN WALKS OFF JOB With Buffalo Bills After 30 Years After NFL Players Disrespect “Our Veterans That Fight and Die For Us”,"Stadium worker Erich Nikischer quit his job at New Era Field after almost 30 years. I waited until the National Anthem ended, I took off my shirt, threw my Bills hat on the ground, walked out,  Nikischer said in a sit-down interview with Channel 2 at his West Seneca home.Nikischer says he has no problem with players protesting before the National Anthem. It s when the kneeling continued into the song that strong feelings took over. During the National Anthem the song that is about our country, our veterans that fight and die for us, it s just something I feel you shouldn t disrespect that way,  he said.  I believe people have the right to protest; I just don t believe that s the proper venue for it. He s not alone in that latter sentiment. Safety Jordan Poyer s fianc  says that s how the couple feels, and that Saturday night, they decided he wouldn t partake in an on the field protest. I feel like there s a certain time or place where you should make a stand for something, and we both agree that it s not in your workforce, your work field,  Rachel Bush said.  So yeah, I agree there s something that should be done, but we both mutually don t agree that it should be done during their work during their football season. Nikischer said it was a hard decision, and that he will miss those he worked with. I will never step foot in that place again, I will never watch an NFL football game again until this ends,  Nikischer said.Watch his interview here: WGRZ",0

Sen. Orrin Hatch responded to protestors whose shouting prevented the hearing s start, saying,  If you want a hearing, you better shut up.

9826,WILL AND GRACE Writers Explain How Their HATE For PRESIDENT TRUMP Inspired Them To Bring Show Back After 11 Years [VIDEO],"When Will & Grace creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick reunited the stars of the NBC comedy in fall 2016, more than 10 years after its finale, a reboot was not on their minds.  There was not one word about,  Let s figure out a way to do this again!    insists Kohan, 53. The pair were so sure that the project   a video in support of then-candidate Hillary Clinton   would be their last with the gang that they hired a film crew  as a way to memorialize the event for our daughters,  explains Mutchnick, 51.But NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt had other plans. Less than two weeks later, the creators were back at the NBC commissary discussing a revival. The multicam returns Thursday, Sept. 28, for season nine, with a tenth season already greenlighted.Picking up  11 years later,  as the season premiere title suggests, the new episodes will largely ignore the events of the series finale, in which Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) both married, had kids and went their separate ways. Instead, the two are single and living together, still, with Jack (Sean Hayes) across the hall and Karen (Megan Mullally) just as rich and outrageous as ever.The other big change since the foursome last graced the small screen? The new president in the White House   despite Kohan and Mutchnick s best efforts on Clinton s behalf.  There s a lot of tension in the air, so there s a lot of things to write and there are a lot of reasons to make an audience laugh,  Mutchnick says.  THR3 weeks before the election, Will and Grace s writers produced a video using the cast the show s former cast to beg liberal viewers to vote for Hillary. The entire 9 minute and 37-second video was created for the sole purpose of trashing then-candidate President Trump. David Kohan From Bob Greenblatt were so inspired by the number of Trump-hating liberals who viewed their video received, that they decided to start the series back up again.The video includes classy lines from Will about then-candidate Trump being a  dick . When Grace reminds Will that the election is  all going to come down to undecided Pennsylvania s voters anyway, to which Will replies:  Right, the unemployed, uneducated, angry white man.   And there you have it, the arrogance of the liberal Hollywood writer, who expects Americans to sit down once a week and watch themselves be mocked and berated, as the writers refer to middle-America as UNEDUCATED, UNEMPLOYED, ANGRY WHITE MEN Watch the video that inspired the writers to bring back the angry new Trump-bashing sitcom: ",0

THRIt s pretty clear by Ellen s reactions to Kelly s answers that she s not a fan, and that as an employee of NBC, she s being forced to  take one for the team  with this very forced interview of the very unpopular Megyn Kelly prior to the debut of her new show.Watch, as Kelly attempts to convince Degeneres that after several years of making a fortune on FOX News where she became popular for what appeared to be her passionate political views, that she was  never a political person . LOL! :Kelly spent a good time of her interview with Degeneres deflecting from her unpopularity with the general public by blaming President Trump for her decision to accept $17 million from NBC to make the move to fluff journalism. Donald Trump has a way of clarifying one s life choices and that was true in my case, too,  Kelly said, explaining how she was struck by how her primetime news coverage  became all political.  When Kelly contemplated if Fox News was the right place for her,  the universe came and sort of shone a light and it was clear to me what I wanted to do. DeGeneres asked if any of Trump s infamous tweets targeted at Kelly were particularly what motivated her move, but Kelly said it was more than just the tweets:  The country s so divided right now and it s so political. It s like politics has become like race, you can t discuss it at all. Degeneres, who is known for being funny, only appeared to laugh twice during the entire segment. The first time was when Kelly wasn t honest with the audience when she claimed her ratings at FOX went up after she disrespected the President. (See chart below from Oct. 13, 2016, following her full-blown feud with then-candidate Donald Trump:)The second time was when she made Kelly look like a complete jackass by suiting her up in a sumo wrestler costume, to which Megyn responded in a very awkward and NOT funny way.

9831,Hero Church Member With CCL Stops Sudanese Shooter Who Stormed Church in Tennessee Kills and Injures Churchgoers,"The main stream media is totally ignoring the horrific case of a Sudanese immigrant who stormed into a Tennessee church this morning and killed 1, injured several. Nashville Police have identified the suspect of a mass shooting at a church Sunday morning as 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson.Samson is being charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder in the attack that killed one and left at least seven other people injured at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, a town just south of Nashville, Tenn.IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE: One brave church member, 22-year-old Caleb Engle, confronted the Samson before being pistol whipped in the face. Engle then went to his car to retrieve a gun, which he has under a concealed carry license (CCL). Engle returned to the church to confront the gunman again. The gunman shot himself in the face when the man returned, possibly by accident. He s the hero here,  Nashville police chief Steve Anderson said.  He s the person who stopped this madness in its tracks. Later today, Engle released a statement: Samson is a bodybuilder who attended high school in Tennessee and is originally from Karthoum, Sudan, according screenshots of the suspect s Facebook page. Emanuel K. Samson came from Sudan in 1996. He was a legal US resident but not necessarily a US citizen.A Nashville Police Department spokesman said the shooter entered the church after 11 a.m. CST wearing a neoprene ski mask. One woman was shot in the parking lot before the shooter entered the church and opened fire on about 42 people still inside.That s when Caleb Engle became the hero that he is It could have been so much worse!SAMSON S BOOKING PHOTO:This is Emanuel Kidega Samson s booking photo. pic.twitter.com/z0Or6rJFAK  Metro Nashville PD (@MNPDNashville) September 25, 2017",0
9832,"LIFETIME VICTIMS of Injustice, MICHELLE and BARACK OBAMA Are Looking To Buy $15 Million Piece Of Land From Caroline Kennedy On Martha’s Vineyard","Remember when Michelle Obama told an adoring crowd at the DNC Convention how she had to suffer through living in the White House that was  built by slaves ?Remember in 2015, when President Barack Obama used the  n  word during an interview where he talked about racism in America, and actually tried to convince the host that blacks are victims of racism today, as much as they were 200-300 years ago.Barack Obama invoked the most charged racial slur in American society during an interview published on Monday, as part of an argument that while the US has made great strides toward equality, racism still pervades the nation. Racism, we are not cured of it. And it s not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not,  Obama told comedian Marc Maron, who interviewed the president for his popular podcast on Friday and released their conversation online on Monday. It s not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don t, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior. The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives,  he continued,  that casts a long shadow and that s still part of our DNA that s passed on. Watch:Well, it appears that lifetime victims, Barack and Michelle Obama have finally broken the chains of oppression that have been holding them back since they moved from their mansion in Chicago in 2008, to the White House, and then to their multi-million pad in DC, as they set their sites on 2 separate pieces of VACANT land on Martha s Vineyard valued at $12 million and $15 million each.Word around the island is that the Obamas, who ve rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Martha s Vineyard   Harvard professors Henry Louis  Skip  Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few   and they would like to own a place of their own on the island.The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused  up island,  looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (It s worth noting that the Obamas have always rented  up island,  including for a two-week stay this summer.)No one s talking, least of all realtors, but we re told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market.Both are still available   but they don t come cheap. Sotheby s International Realty is listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million.The listing broker, George Ballantyne of Gibson Sotheby s International Realty, declined to talk to us. The properties appear on multiple sites, including Hancock Real Estate and Sand Piper Realty, which are both located on the Vineyard.  Boston Globe ",0
9833,REVEALED: HOW BARACK OBAMA IS FUNDING The “Resistance” Movement Against President Trump,"Wall Street might be shocked to learn it is helping bankroll the anti-Trump  resistance  movement that s aggressively fighting policies it favors   including corporate tax cuts and the repeal of Obama-era banking and health-care regulations.The payola is potentially earmarked for third-party interest groups approved by the Justice Department and HUD without requiring any proof of how the funds will be spent. Many of the recipients so far are radical leftist organizations who solicited the settlement cash from the administration even though they were not parties to the lawsuits, records show. During the Obama administration, groups committed to  revolutionary social change  sent proposals and met with high-level HUD and Justice Department officials to try to get their pieces of the settlement pie,  Cause of Action Institute vice president Julie Smith told The Post.Some of the chosen beneficiaries are now actively militating against the Trump administration and its policies, including:The Hispanic-rights group strenuously protested the Republican-led  skinny  repeal of the Affordable Care Act after receiving at least $1.5 million from the Obama regime s bank settlement funds, congressional researchers say.La Raza works closely with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has teamed up with the anti-Trump resistance group, Indivisible, which was co-founded by La Raza alumnus Angel Padilla. Indivisible is working with La Raza and its affiliates to make sure  any bill that punishes sanctuary cities never goes to Trump s desk to become law.  They are encouraging activists to send postcards with pre-printed messages on immigration and health care to moderate GOP senators.NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUEAfter receiving at least $1.2 million from the bank-settlement slush fund, the African-American advocacy group solicited its supporters to oppose efforts to repeal ObamaCare by signing a letter to senators arguing  African-Americans stand to be disproportionately impacted.  It claimed more than 5 million black people would lose coverage under repeal legislation.NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITIONSince hauling in at least $2.6 million in funds under settlement in the Obama-era mortgage suits, the liberal housing-rights group has slammed tax-reform proposals by the Trump administration as unfair, while trying to block efforts to privatize mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming doing so would  deepen the racial wealth gap. NCRC is also actively lobbying against regulatory repeal of many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.The Washington-based group boasts more than 600 member organizations who lobby lawmakers through list-serves, mailings, sign-on letters and conference calls. Though it s assumed that funds distributed to such  qualified organizations  will be used for housing assistance, the bank-settlement agreements do not enforce how the funds are spent. It stands to reason that some of the settlement funds have helped bankroll the resistance  bent on stopping the Trump agenda for America, Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow John Berlau said.It s not clear how much money, in all, has been diverted from settlement funds to these and other left-wing organizations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a full audit of the funds while discontinuing the practice of funneling Justice Department settlements to third-party groups. Any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people [through the US Treasury]   not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,  Sessions said in a recent statement.Still, The Post has learned that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to force financial institutions it prosecutes to donate to third-party community organizers. More, penalties in such cases are deposited into the Bureau s now-$170 million-plus Civil Penalty Fund, which has, in turn, channeled almost $30 million to  consumer advocacy  groups.For entire story: NYP ",0

Wolfe, who is white, did not reference whether he agrees with the basis of the protest that gained steam Sunday following President Trump s condemnation: to object to the treatment of minorities in the United States.Entering Sunday, only one white player, Seth DeValve of Cleveland, had joined the movement. I stand because I respect the men who died in real battles so I have the freedom to battle on the field,  Wolfe, 27, told ESPN in a statement.  Paying tribute to the men and women who have given their lives for our freedom is why I stand. But everyone these days likes to find a reason to protest and that s their right. It s America and you are free to speak your mind. I just feel it s disrespectful to the ones who sacrificed their lives and it s the wrong platform. But like I said to each their own it s AMERICA! The greatest country in the world and if you don t think we are the greatest country in the world and you reside here, then why do you stay? A lot worse places in the world to call home. Proud to be an American. Several of his Broncos teammates took a kneel Sunday, days after Trump urged owners to kick the  son of a bitch  who protests off the team. Wolfe s teammate Brandon Marshall knelt throughout last season.Wolfe, in his sixth NFL season, grew up in Ohio and played at the University of Cincinnati. He skipped visiting the Obama White House following the Broncos  Super Bowl win in 2016, saying,  I just had a lot of stuff going on, things to do.   NYP",0

THE LEFT IS MAKING THIS ABOUT POLITICS BUT IT S ABOUT RESPECTING OUR FLAG AND ANTHEM FOR ALL AMERICANS PERIODMartha Ford spoke out against President Trump s announcement that NFL players should be  fired  if they refuse to stand for our anthem: Our game has long provided a powerful platform for dialogue and positive change in many communities throughout our nation. Thanks primarily to our players, the NFL also has been a unifying force in our country and impactful change has and hopefully will continue to be the result of peaceful expression, done so in order to highlight social injustices of all kind. Negative and disrespectful comments suggesting otherwise are contrary to the founding principles of our country, and we do not support those comments or opinions.

According to the Boston Herald, there were shouts of,  Stand up,  as they knelt.Tom Brady, the face of the team and the league, did not take a knee but stood with his arms locked with other players and his hand over his chest.The Patriots have been intertwined with Trump, with Brady, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft pals with the president. After Trump s attack on the protests, though   saying owners should cut ties with  the son of a bitch  who kneels during the anthem   Kraft said he was  deeply disappointed  in Trump.It s been a Sunday in which not just players, but owners, executives, and fans have been forced to take a side.

This is not a political stance but a  love of Country  stance. These players need to understand the difference and honor those who have fought and died for America.A Facebook fan has the best take on this yet:  THEN TAKE A KNEE Take a little trip to Valley Forge in January. Hold a musket ball in your fingers and imagine it piercing your flesh and breaking a bone or two. There won t be a doctor or trainer to assist you until after the battle, so just wait your turn. Take your cleats and socks off to get a real experience. Then take a knee.Then, take one at the beach in Normandy where man after American man stormed the beach, even as the one in front of him was shot to pieces the very sea stained with American blood. The only blockers most had were the dead bodies in front of them, riddled with bullets from enemy fire.Take a knee in the sweat soaked jungles of Vietnam. From Khe San to Saigon Anywhere will do. Americans died in all those jungles. There was no playbook that told them what was next, but they knew what flag they represented. When they came home, they were protested as well..and spit on for reasons only cowards know.Take another knee in the blood drenched sands of Fallujah in 110 degree heat..Wear your Kevlar helmet and battle dress..Your number won t be printed on it unless your number is up! You ll need to stay hydrated but there won t be anyone to squirt Gatorade into your mouth. You re on your own. There are a lot of places to take a knee Americans have given their lives all over the world. When you use the banner under which they fought as a source for your displeasure, you dishonor the memories of those who bled for the very freedoms you have. That s what the red stripes mean. It represents the blood of those who spilled a sea of it defending your liberty.While you re on your knee, pray for those that came before you, not on a manicured lawn striped and printed with numbers to announce every inch of ground taken but on nameless hills and bloodied beaches and sweltering forests and bitter cold mountains..every inch marked by an American life lost serving that flag you protest. No cheerleaders, no announcers, no coaches, no fans just American men and women delivering the real fight against those who chose to harm us blazing a path so you would have the right to  take a knee.  You haven t inkling what it took to get you where you are but your  protest  is duly noted. Not only is it disgraceful to a nation of real heroes, it serves the purpose of pointing to your ingratitude for those who chose to defend you under that banner that will still wave long after your jersey is retired If you really feel the need to take a knee, come with me to church on Sunday and we ll both kneel before Almighty God. We ll thank him for preserving this country for as long as He has. We ll beg forgiveness for our ingratitude for all He has provided us. We ll appeal to Him for understanding and wisdom.

So these commies want to tell their fellow Americans what to do? Their judgement isn t so great if they re supporting communism Ya think? The cops should stand strong against the tyranny that is happening right now.Chanting their way through downtown Austin, the capital of Texas, demonstrators denounced Confederate symbolism and called for the dismantling of public works and streets that bear the name of Confederate icons like Robert E.

People on both sides fought and died black and white! Only Virginia has more Confederate symbols (which include roads, schools, statues and county names) than Texas.Austin has already been taking steps to remove public reminders of its history as part of the Confederacy. Just last week Texas House Speaker Joe Strauss called for removal of a plaque near the Capitol that asserts slavery was not the underlying cause of the Civil War.

9842,Burn! George Clooney Turns On Hillary After Saying ‘There Will Never Be A President Trump’,"George clooney probably gave the folks at The Daily Beast a coronary when he admitted what everyone has known for months, years Hillary didn t have it. Ya think? Clooney said he believes she wasn t fit for the job.George Clooney, who supported Hillary Clinton amid the 2016 presidential campaign and once hosted a fundraiser for her, said he believes she wasn t fit for the White House. Being qualified for the job does not necessarily mean you re the right person to be president,  Clooney said in the interview. It was frustrating because I never saw her elevate her game. I saw it. And I had a lot of liberal friends who were like,  She s not good at this.  And I see that, and I understand it.Clooney has been a huge critic of President Trump so chances are he s not turned totally to the right but he s seeing that Hillary just didn t have the right stuff.OUR PREVIOUS COVERAGE OF CLOONEY IS PRETY FUNNY BECAUSE HE IS WRONG ON PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING: THERE WILL NEVER BE A PRESIDENT TRUMP There s nothing quite like an arrogant actor who lives in Europe, supports Hillary, blames the press for making Trump popular, and for not properly vetting him, while hanging out at the White House with the least vetted President in American history.George Clooney is making his disdain for Donald Trump known not just here in the United States but also overseas.The actor was interviewed by members of the international press at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday afternoon, and took some time to share with them his opinion of Trump. There s not going to be a President Donald Trump,  said Clooney, who held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton last month in Los Angeles where tickets reportedly went for $353,400 per couple. That s not going to happen. Fear is not going to be something that drives our country. We re not going to be scared of Muslims or immigrants or women. We re not actually afraid of anything. That whole  We re not afraid of Muslims  thing ought to go over pretty well with the victims and families of victims who have been attacked in Paris twice over the past couple of years. Tell that to French residents who live in or near  no-go-zones  George. Of course, you wouldn t know, because you have the best security detail money can buy hypocrite!Clooney, who was on the Croisette to promote his film Money Monster, went on to say;  Trump is actually a result in many ways of the fact that much of the news programs didn t follow up and ask tough questions.

9843,PRESIDENT TRUMP SLAM DUNKS Golden State NBA Punk Stephen Curry Who Bragged About Not Going To White House To Celebrate Championship,"In June of 2017, it was reported that the newly-crowned NBA champions the Golden State Warriors were preparing  a political statement  by refusing an invitation to the White House to visit President Donald Trump.The Oakland-based basketball team, led by head coach Steve Kerr, decided immediately after Trump s election on November 9 that it would shun the new president if it won the NBA championship, according to Comcast SportsNet.Golden State Warrior player Kevin Durant bragged about not visiting President Donald Trump at the White House if the NBA champion Golden State Warriors are invited. Nah, I won t do that,  said Durant, the 2017 NBA Finals MVP.  I don t respect who s in office right now. Yesterday, Stephen Curry bragged about not visiting the White House. Stephen Curry doesn't hold back on whether he'll vote to visit White House. pic.twitter.com/n2PBAtYQdA  Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) September 22, 2017Today, President Trump who is clearly sick and tired of all of these overpaid athletes spewing a completely bogus narrative about him being a  racist  or supporting racism, shot back and rescinded Stephen Curry s invitation to the White House. In his tweet, President Trump reminding Curry that it s a  privilege  to be invited to celebrate their victory with the President. Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn! Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017President Trump should have also reminded the petulant Stephen Curry that there s a high likelihood most of his fans couldn t care less about his political opinions, and that whining to the media about not wanting to go visit the President (who was elected by the majority of Americans) at the White House will probably not help his brand for future marketing gigs.If Americans are fed up with professional sports turning into political arenas, they can start by turning off so-called  Sports networks  like Disney owned ESPN, whose hosts are nothing more than political hacks promoting the hate and giving these overpaid athletes political views more attention than they deserve.  Americans need to start turning off programs with controversial, race-obsessed hosts like Chris Hayes (who tweeted Curry s statement) and Trump-hating Jemele Hill who are more concerned about starting a race war in America than discussing sports.",0
9844,Great Answer! Sean Spicer Asked To Name CNN Reporter Who ‘Did Good Work’ During His Time In The Trump Administration,"Sean Spicer was asked during a Washington Post interview,  which White House reporters  did good work . He was able to rattle off eight names and then said,  I m missing a bunch, for sure. Spicer was then asked if he forgot to include anyone from CNN who did good work during his time in the White House YOU KNEW THIS WAS COMING:Spicer gave the best answer ever Oh, no   We have to agree that the CNN correspondents have had it out for President Trump from day one. This is also  a dig at  combative WH correspondent Jim Acosta. How could we forget the exchanges with Acosta! A bulldog!CNN s Jim Acosta keeps trolling President Trump and keeps making a total fool of himself! The latest moment was after signing a trade bill when Acosta asked why the president didn t hold a press conference Trump s response is priceless!President Trump to @Acosta:  I like real news. Not fake news. You re fake news.  https://t.co/TssGvNyUct pic.twitter.com/sQ3IR8IRdX  CSPAN (@cspan) August 14, 2017REMEMBER THIS JIM ACOSTA MOMENT?We wish President Trump could clone SENIOR ADVISOR Stephen Miller! He s so brilliant and knows immigration like no other! We can t say the same for the White House Press Corp! The Trump administration made some positive announcements on immigration and the left went nuts! Miller got the best of them!ANOTHER GREAT TAKEDOWN!Fox News reported:Trump and Acosta have famously traded jabs since the president called Acosta  fake news  during a press conference earlier this year. If Spicer was going to compliment anyone from CNN, it would presumably have been the reporter he dealt with on a regular basis   but the former press secretary failed to mention Acosta when he had the chance.Acosta comes off as combative toward the White House on a regular basis and some insiders feel his grandstanding was one reason press briefings weren t televised over an extended period this summer. In addition to Trump and Spicer, Acosta sparred with White House adviser Stephen Miller last month over the administration s immigration policy. Miller famously accused the CNN reporter of having a  cosmopolitan bias. ",0
9845,LAST MAN STANDING’S TIM ALLEN On Why He Wasn’t Allowed To Call Obama A “Communist” On TV And Why Hillary Reminds Him Of HERPES,"Before ABC cancelled Tim Allen s number one show  Last Man Standing,  Allen spoke with the Hollywood Reporter. They asked him why he has such strong political views. They wanted to know if he was a fan of Donald Trump s, what he thought of Hillary and Bill Clinton, and if it s really true that he wanted to run an episode that included raising a communist flag over the White House when Barack Obama was President. Whose idea was it for Mike Baxter to have loud, conservative political views?I brought that to the table. I wanted to be provocative. Mike Baxter is an educated Archie Bunker.Definitely. But you know what? I ve earned it. I don t say that lightly. I ve been on a successful show and learned from the best. But I find Last Man Standing actually rougher than Home Improvement. We re getting away with a lot of stuff. I m really shocked. This is a meaner, sharper comedy than I m used to. There s a lot of times our very liberal writing staff will come up with stuff that even my character would say,  I don t know if I can say that. How much is playing this right-leaning character an outlet for you to express your own political views?It s getting more and more comfortable. These guys know me so well that they re writing stuff that is exactly what I would ve said. It s a marvelous thing when you have lib eral people writing for [a show like this]. I believe Stephen Colbert was like that. He was pretending to be a conservative, I think. Someone said that. I never got that, but maybe I didn t watch it enough.Has the line between you and your character blurred over the years?For most of my life, I ve been taxed above 38 percent. When you re a young guy working the road and literally close to half of what you make goes to people who don t help you at all but just bitch about it the whole time, that s where I come from. I come from  no taxation without representation,  and it manifests itself in very peculiar points of view.How are you different from Mike?He s milder than I am. You wouldn t want to hear what I have to say. Escalate Mike Baxter with profanity and that s basically me. He s much more tepid because he s a business owner. Mike Baxter is calmed way down, and I m definitely not that guy.What riles you up the most?Unearned responses, unearned praise, unearned income: I have opinions about it. When you watch the debates, on both sides you see clowns who say shit that ain t ever going to happen, but lately, one party is the free shit party. They are just telling people they re going to get all sorts of free shit. When you say you re going to get free education, free healthcare   f , free brown loafers   of course, everybody s going to say yes to that.But you don t mean it. That s how you rack up debt, and debt is killing us. Whatever party is going to get us out of debt is my party.Who scares you?Well, we asked the female writing staff if they d vote for Hillary just because she s a woman, and they all said yes. So then the question was,  So if Sarah Palin was the female?  They all choked and they had to say,  Oh God, yes, we d vote for her.  I didn t quite buy it. I don t think you should vote for somebody just because they re tall, thin, yellow, green, whatever. Bernie Sanders, as nice a guy as he is, none of that shit s going to happen. And Trump can t send everybody to Mexico or whatever the f  he said. But give that guy the roads, bridges, infrastructure, power grid   just have him fix that shit for four years. He s good at that. And he s a businessman so he understands how debt load works. Forget the stupid shit he says about immigrants. That s just ignorant. But he might be able to do the stuff that really needs fixing.So you re not opposed to Trump?I m not opposed to anybody if their workload matches their bullshit load.Why has the show gone after Hillary but not Trump?It s a little surprising to me. We have a very liberal writing staff, so I m surprised they haven t taken a shot at him. But we re not sure he s going to last, whereas the Clintons are like herpes: Just when you think they re gone, they show up again.Didn t you try a bit about Obama raising the communist flag at the White House that never made it to air?We got network notes saying you can t call the president a communist. So, of course, I really wanted to. I do it in rehearsal all day long. ",0

Well, John McCain is no different and should be taken to the woodshed one final time for his role in repeatedly destroying any hope we have of getting rid of Obamacare.BEWARE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has paid millions to the GOP to keep Obamacare on behalf of multinational corporations who exploit and erode the U.S. economy. The largest beneficiaries of those payments has long been the RINOS within the senate. McCain s position is not a surprise. INSURERS PROFIT FROM OBAMACARE NO VOTE:Shares of U.S. insurers gained after news that McCain would not support the bill. Insurers had fallen over the past week as investors worried about spending cuts.Centene Corp gained 1.6 percent to $92.22 while Molina Healthcare rose 4.5 percent to $65.32. Both specialize in government-funded healthcare.The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists oppose the bill.WASHINGTON (Reuters)   U.S. Senator John McCain said on Friday he opposes the latest Republican bill to dismantle Obamacare, dealing the measure what could be a fatal blow given the party s slim Senate majority.With several other Republicans still undecided on the measure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this week he intended to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote next week, though he did not promise to do so.A vote would set the stage for another dramatic Capitol Hill decision on the 2010 law that brought health insurance to millions of Americans and became former Democratic President Barack Obama s signature domestic achievement.Read more: Reuters ",0

A BUNCH OF WHITE GUYS . WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR Obama urged computing companies to invest in and hire more women and people of color  Changing that composition, Obama said, will take encouraging girls at a young age to study science and math. It will mean bridging  the technology gap  that persists in low-income districts. It requires revisions to the public-school system. And it warrants forming hiring committees with more women and people of color.  You can t just say you want to fix the problems, you have to mean it,  Obama said.  If a bunch of white guys are sitting around the table trying to get more women involved, they re not going to come up with the answer.  For Utah s Silicon Slopes and elsewhere, she added, a behavioral change in the office environment at IT corporations will need to accompany that shift. You can t hire women and then they come in and they re working for chimps. No offense   you guys aren t all chimps,  Obama said to laughs from the crowd.

The 38-year-old political pundit joined the show as a permanent co-host in 2016 after serving as a guest host several times in 2015. Bila revealed in her exit speech that she was preparing to write a not-yet-titled book that will be released next year, but offered no other plans or explanation for her abrupt departure from the show.

She went from being initially shocked to furious that they would treat her this way,  a source at the network told DailyMail.com.SHE S NOT A REPUBLICAN The network s reasoning for wanting to ditch Bila was because even though she played the role of the conservative on the show, she isn t an actual Republican.

Anyone who looks at cyber warfare will tell you, any honest person, will tell you the Chinese military is the primary culprit in the United States, hacked into the White House not too long ago  Nobody said anything. You guys in Hollywood sell your movies in China. You bow to the imperatives of their propaganda and censorship office. You change your movies to suit them. And yet no one says we re at war with China.Notice how Reiner brings up the Facebook ads that the left is now going after because a Russian group spent $100K on ads during the election. So it comes down to the fact that this is an effort at (ironic) propaganda to convince Americans that Russia stole the election. Did you catch that Clapper is part of this??? WTH? If people want to turn their heads at that, it s at their own peril Really?Who s the propagandist Mr. Reiner? He might want to look in the mirror ",0

9856,Wow! Former U.S. Attorney Fired By Trump Has A New Job At A Major News Network,"This is shocking but once you remember what this lawyer is all about it fits. Former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara is joining CNN as a senior legal analyst, a CNN spokesman said on Thursday.CLINTON FIRED U.S. ATTORNEYS BUT TRUMP TAKES HEAT FOR BEING FORCED TO FIRE BHARARA!Bharara forced President Trump to fire him! The U.S. Attorney was fired in March by President Donald Trump, after refusing to resign his post when asked to do so by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Bharara joins CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc, at a time when the cable network faces numerous accusations of being  fake news  from President Trump on Twitter.CNN declined to give further details on Bharara joining the network.Remember how he went after Dinesh D Souza? He is a ruthless and a very deceitful guy. The first thing that s highlighted inside my case file is  I m a conservative . This should be completely irrelevant in the decision whether to prosecute me. It should be beside the point. But of course in Bharara s case it was the point. This was a political prosecution conducted by Bharara as a henchman for the Obama administration. And so for me this is actually kind of nice. When I was in confinement, Bharara was laughing. Now that he s unemployed, I m kinda laughing. The former U.S. Attorney also launched a weekly podcast called  Stay Tuned with Preet  on WNYC, which aired the first episode on Wednesday. Bharara detailed the story of his firing for the first time, including how President Trump initially asked him to remain in his post after the election, and also spoke with former CIA Director Leon Panetta in the episode.Bharara may also address the circumstances of his firing in a book he is expected to publish in January 2019 with publisher Alfred A. Knopf.Shortly after his firing in March, Bharara joined New York University Law School as a distinguished scholar in residence. He said in a statement he will use the opportunity to address issues such as honest government, corporate accountability and criminal and social justice. Read more: Reuters",0

See the video below for just one of many examples of Waters lying through her teeth saying she never called for the impeachment of Trump. Here she is at a CBC Town Hall revving up the crowd with her phony baloney call for the impeachment of Trump. We re guessing it all depends on who she s talking to. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who previously has called for the impeachment of Donald Trump, on Thursday told a Congressional Black Caucus Town Hall on Civil Rights that she expects other members of the black community to back her up: Impeachment is about whatever the congress says it is.

But when you gonna give me some support?  she asked.  How many of you in your organizations have said,  Impeach 45  ?  Waters urged the crowd not to get hung up on what law to invoke in the impeachment process:Impeachment is about whatever the Congress says it is. There is no law that dictates impeachment. What the Constitution says is  high crimes and misdemeanors,  and we define that.Bill Clinton got impeached because he lied. Here you have a president, who I can tell you and guarantee you is in collusion with the Russians to undermine our democracy. Here you have a president who obstructed justice. And here you have a president who lies every day.Thank God that the special counsel is beginning to connect the dots   and understand Facebook s role in it and social media s role in it.

9860,Daniel Greenfield: Why Obama Really Spied On Trump: ‘It’s not just ideology. It’s raw fear.’,"Daniel Greenfield s take on why Obama spied on Trump is the best yet. He takes you through the twists and turns to expose Obama and his cronies for the liars and cheats they are. We d love to know what you think about this take on why things happened the way they did:Last week, CNN revealed (and excused) one phase of the Obama spying operation on Trump. After lying about it on MSNBC, Susan Rice admitted unmasking the identities of Trump officials to Congress.ACKNOWLEDGED IN A LETTER FROM NUNES AND GOWDY:Rice was unmasking the names of Trump officials a month before leaving office. The targets may have included her own successor, General Flynn, who was forced out of office using leaked surveillance.SUSAN RICE LYING ABOUT THE UNMASKING   IS ANYONE SURPRISED? I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today. What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:Andrew McCarthy said it best: The national-security adviser is not an investigator. She is a White House staffer. The president s staff is a consumer of intelligence, not a generator or collector of it. If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests. GREENFIELD:  LAWS WERE BROKEN The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked Someone s in BIG trouble! While Rice s targets weren t named, the CNN story listed a meeting with Flynn, Bannon and Kushner.Bannon was Trump s former campaign chief executive and a senior adviser. Kushner is a senior adviser. Those are exactly the people you spy on to get an insight into what your political opponents plan to do.Now the latest CNN spin piece informs us that secret FISA orders were used to spy on the conversations of Trump s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort (SEE CLAPPER VIDEO BELOW). The surveillance was discontinued for lack of evidence and then renewed under a new warrant. This is part of a pattern of FISA abuses by Obama Inc. which never allowed minor matters like lack of evidence to dissuade them from new FISA requests. Its possible  President Trump s voice was picked up in a wiretap of Paul Manafort, says former spy chief Clapper https://t.co/2ELM48axAa  CNN (@CNN) September 21, 2017Desperate Obama cronies had figured out that they could bypass many of the limitations on the conventional investigations of their political opponents by  laundering  them through national security.If any of Trump s people were talking to non-Americans, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) could be used to spy on them. And then the redacted names of the Americans could be unmasked by Susan Rice, Samantha Power and other Obama allies. It was a technically legal Watergate.If both CNN stories hold up, then Obama Inc. had spied on two Trump campaign leaders.Furthermore the Obama espionage operation closely tracked Trump s political progress. The first FISA request targeting Trump happened the month after he received the GOP nomination. The second one came through in October: the traditional month of political surprises meant to upend an election.The spying ramped up after Trump s win when the results could no longer be used to engineer a Hillary victory, but would instead have to be used to cripple and bring down President Trump. Headed out the door, Rice was still unmasking the names of Trump s people while Obama was making it easier to pass around raw eavesdropped data to other agencies.Obama had switched from spying on a political opponent to win an election, to spying on his successor to undo the results of the election.RICE AND POWER WERE USED TO  UNMASK  TRUMP ASSOCIATES    ALL THE PRESIDENT S WOMEN? Notice how uncomfortable Brennan is when asked about the Ambassador Power:Abuse of power by a sitting government had become subversion of the government by an outgoing administration. Domestic spying on opponents had become a coup.The Democrat scandals of the past few administrations have hinged on gross violations of political norms, elementary ethics and the rule of law that, out of context, were not technically illegal.But it s the pattern that makes the crime. It s the context that shows the motive.Obama Inc. compartmentalized its espionage operation in individual acts of surveillance and unmasking, and general policies implemented to aid both, that may have been individually legal, in the purely technical sense, in order to commit the major crime of eavesdropping on the political opposition.When the individual acts of surveillance are described as legal, that s irrelevant. It s the collective pattern of surveillance of the political opposition that exposes the criminal motive for them.If Obama spied on two of Trump s campaign leaders, that s not a coincidence. It s a pattern.A criminal motive can be spotted by a consistent pattern of actions disguised by different pretexts. A dirty cop may lose two pieces of evidence from the same defendant while giving two different excuses. A shady accountant may explain two otherwise identical losses in two different ways. Both excuses are technically plausible. But it s the pattern that makes the crime.Manafort was spied on under the Russia pretext. Bannon may have been spied on over the UAE. That s two different countries, two different people and two different pretexts.But one single target. President Trump.It s the pattern that exposes the motive.When we learn the whole truth (if we ever do), we will likely discover that Obama Inc. assembled a motley collection of different technically legal pretexts to spy on Trump s team.Each individual pretext might be technically defensible. But together they add up to the crime of the century.Obama s gamble was that the illegal surveillance would justify itself. If you spy on a bunch of people long enough, especially people in politics and business, some sort of illegality, actual or technical, is bound to turn up. That s the same gamble anyone engaged in illegal surveillance makes.Businessmen illegally tape conversations with former partners hoping that they ll say something damning enough to justify the risk. That was what Obama and his allies were doing with Trump.It s a crime. And you can t justify committing a crime by discovering a crime.If everyone were being spied on all the time, many crimes could be exposed every second. But that s not how our system works. That s why we have a Fourth Amendment.Nor was Obama Inc. trying to expose crimes for their own sake, but to bring down the opposition.That s why it doesn t matter what results the Obama surveillance turned up. The surveillance was a crime. Anything turned up by it is the fruit of a poisonous tree. It s inherently illegitimate.The first and foremost agenda must be to assemble a list of Trump officials who were spied on and the pretexts under which they were spied upon. The pattern will show the crime. And that s what Obama and his allies are terrified of. It s why Flynn was forced out using illegal surveillance and leaks. It s why McMaster is protecting Susan Rice and the Obama holdovers while purging Trump loyalists at the NSC.The left s gamble was that the Mueller investigation or some other illegitimate spawn of the Obama eavesdropping would produce an indictment and then the procedural questions wouldn t matter.It s the dirty cop using illegal eavesdropping to generate leads for a  clean  case against his target while betting that no one will look too closely or care how the case was generated. If one of the Mueller targets is intimidated into making a deal, the question of how the case was generated won t matter.Mueller will have a cooperative witness. And the Democrats can begin their coup in earnest. It will eventually turn out that there is no  there  there. But by then, it ll be time for President Booker.There s just one problem.If the gamble fails, if no criminal case that amounts to anything more than the usual investigational gimmick charges like perjury (the Federal equivalent of  resisting arrest  for a beat cop) develops, then Obama and his allies are on the hook for the domestic surveillance of their political opponents.With nothing to show for it and no way to distract from it.That s the race against the clock that is happening right now. Either the investigation gets results. Or its perpetrators are left hanging in the wind. If McMaster is fired, which on purely statistical grounds he probably will be, and a Trump loyalist who wasn t targeted by the surveillance operation becomes the next National Security Adviser and brings in Trump loyalists, as Flynn tried to do, then it s over.And the Dems finally get their Watergate. Except the star won t be Trump, it will be Obama. Rice, Power, Lynch and the rest of the gang will be the new Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Mitchell.Once Obama and his allies launched their domestic surveillance operation, they crossed the Rubicon. And there was no way back. They had to destroy President Trump or risk going to jail.The more crimes they committed by spying on the opposition, the more urgently they needed to bring down Trump. The consequences of each crime that they had committed spurred them on to commit worse crimes to save themselves from going to jail. It s the same old story when it comes to criminals.Each act of illegal surveillance became more blatant. And when illegal surveillance couldn t stop Trump s victory, they had to double down on the illegal surveillance for a coup.The more Obama spied on Trump, the more he had to keep doing it. This time it was bound to pay off.Obama and his allies had violated the norms so often for their policy goals that they couldn t afford to be replaced by anyone but one of their own. The more Obama relied on the imperial presidency of executive orders, the less he could afford to be replaced by anyone who would undo them. The more his staffers lied and broke the law on everything from the government shutdown to the Iran nuke sellout, the more desperately they needed to pull out all the stops to keep Trump out of office. And the more they did it, the more they couldn t afford not to do it. Abuse of power locks you into the loop familiar to all dictators. You can t stop riding the tiger. Once you start, you can t afford to stop.If you want to understand why Samantha Power was unmasking names, that s why. The hysterical obsession with destroying Trump comes from the top down. It s not just ideology. It s wealthy and powerful men and women who ran the country and are terrified that their crimes will be exposed.It s why the media increasingly sounds like the propaganda organs of a Communist country. Why there are street riots and why the internet is being censored by Google and Facebook s  fact checking  allies.It s not just ideology. It s raw fear.The left is sitting on the biggest crime committed by a sitting president. The only way to cover it up is to destroy his Republican successor.A turning point in history is here.If Obama goes down, the left will go down with him. If his coup succeeds, then America ends.Read more from Daniel Greenfield",0

9862,FBI and DOJ Refusing To Comply With Subpoena Over Trump Dossier…Hello Jeff Sessions?,"Hello Jeff Sessions! Where is the DOJ s leader these days? Something tells us the Trump Dossier will end up being the bombshell that exposes Comey, Brennan and Clapper and all of the other criminals who used this dossier to spy on Trump. Obama used the dossier to spy on Trump!Anyone who followed the Obama White House intel policy outcomes will know that DNI Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan were the two primary political operatives weaponizing intelligence.But it gets better Comey comes into play:Remember the bombshell testimony of the Hermitage Capital CEO where the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed? CEO Browder stated the Russian government paid Fusion GPS to create the Steele propaganda dossier on candidate Donald Trump. That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign. BOMBSHELL: Comey was using propaganda commissioned by Russia, funded in part by the FBI, to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.CEO BROWDER S ADMISSION BELOW:This is getting good.What does Nunes do now after several attempts at getting documents related to the dossier?After two previous deadlines came and went, House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes has set a new date for the FBI and Justice Department to turn over documents relating to the Trump dossier.Nunes originally subpoenaed the FBI and Justice on Aug. 24, demanding dossier documents by Sept. 1. When none were produced, Nunes agreed to extend the deadline to September 14. During that time, arrangements were made for intelligence committee investigators to visit the Justice Department to make sure officials on both sides understood precisely which documents the committee seeks.No documents were produced by Sept. 14, and now Nunes, apparently unsatisfied with the results of the staff meeting, has sent a new letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In it, Nunes set a deadline of this Friday for the documents to be produced. If the documents are not produced by then, Nunes directed that Wray and Sessions appear in an open committee hearing Sept. 28, to explain why they did not hand over the materials.The document request in the original Aug. 24 subpoena has not changed. It focuses on the FBI s relations with Christopher Steele, the former British spy retained by the American opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig dirt on Donald Trump in Russia as part of an effort funded by wealthy supporters of Hillary Clinton. Among other things, the original subpoena demanded all internal FBI reports  incorporating, relying on, or referring to  information provided by Steele, his sources, or Fusion GPS.The original subpoena also asked for  any information, if it exists, provided by Mr. Steele as an informant/source (confidential or otherwise) or in any other capacity,  as well as any documents relating to whether the FBI paid or offered any benefits to Steele. The subpoena also asked for all documents relating to FBI and Justice  efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate  information provided by Steele.Finally, the original subpoena requested any court applications for surveillance that included any information provided by Steele, plus any court orders, if there were any, that were based in any part on Steele s information.So far, the FBI and Justice Department have not provided the information. Now, they have a new deadline.Read more: WE",0

9867,‘One for the Ages’ Full Video and Transcript of Trump’s Incredible UN Speech [Video],"A speech for the ages was given today by President Donald Trump. He addressed the 72nd meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time in his presidency. The transcript is below.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high   a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars   they re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time,  Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution   the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are:  We the people. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government s first duty is to its people, to our citizens   to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. (Applause.)All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America s interests above all else.But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.We were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea s spies.If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That s what the United Nations is all about; that s what the United Nations is for. Let s see how they do.It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime   one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran s leaders are, in fact, its own people.Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad s dictatorship, fuel Yemen s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. (Applause.) The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don t think you ve heard the last of it   believe me.It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?The Iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens   even innocent children   shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.We also thank   (applause)   we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. (Applause.) From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the  independent strength of its members.  If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations   nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.In remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats   we can t do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was  effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.",0
9868,NFL’S PHONY PATRIOTISM: US Defense Department Paid NFL DISGUSTING $4.5 Million For On-Field Flag Appearances…Welcome Home Tributes,"Every day, the NFL gives fans another reason to stop supporting them. Although the NFL agreed to refund a small portion of the money our Defense Department (US taxpayers) have paid them to show support for our military, it s the idea that Americans have been duped into believing it was something they did out of honor or reverence for our military. The NFL has reached a new low with their acceptance of players who are disrespecting our flag to promote Obama s race war while disallowing the Dallas Cowboys to honor the 5 police officers slain in their hometown by a Black Lives Matter terrorist. Don t forget, they also looked away when Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell posted an Instagram picture of a cop with his neck being slit open. The NFL never said a word. They never even acknowledged what some considered to be a terrorist type threat to our law enforcement.In May 2016, the NFL announced that they would return more than $700,000 of taxpayers  money that was paid to teams for sponsored military tributes.After being criticized for  paid patriotism,  in which money came out of the armed forces budget for various measures of public recognition during games, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league would pay that money back.In a letter written to Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain on Wednesday, and disclosed on Thursday, Goodell said that   following an audited review of 100 marketing agreements from 2012 to 2015 by accounting firm Deloitte & Touche   teams were deemed to have received $723,734 for acts of sponsored patriotism. Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer,  the report said.  Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks.   PGLast year, Flake and McCain disclosed that the U.S. Department of Defense had spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams from 2011 to 2014. Some of those contracts disclosed that payment was for on-field flag ceremonies and tributes to welcome home veterans. One team, the Atlanta Falcons, had made more than $1 million from the department over those four seasons.The National Guard spent $6.7 million on contracts with NFL teams from 2013 to 2015. Via: ESPNThere has never been a better time to boycott the NFL, their merchandise and any of their sponsors.",0

9870,ILLINOIS: ENTIRE TEAM OF 8-Yr Old Kids Perform Disgusting Act of Disrespect For Our Flag and Law Enforcement Under Guidance Of Coach,"Every player on the Cahokia Quarterback Club football team (8 and under) took a knee during the national anthem ahead of Sunday s game at Little Devil s Field in Belleville. One of the kids asked me if I saw (people) protesting and rioting in St. Louis. I said yes; I said,  Do you know why they are doing it?  said Coach Orlando Gooden.Coach Gooden said his player responded,  Because black people are getting killed and nobody s going to jail. Gooden, who played football at Mizzou, said the kids knew about the Jason Stockley decision. I felt like it was a good teaching moment for me to circle the team and have a meeting,  he said.Watch:Here are just a few shocking statistics the coach could have shared with his players about neighboring E. St. Louis, IL:WND- Before Ferguson exploded in reaction to the August shooting of black teen Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson, the St. Louis police chief raised eyebrows when he called for the use of drones to monitor high-crime areas.The proposal was a response to what St. Louis police authorities called  subhuman, antisocial, urban terrorist  behavior by criminals.St. Louis also is homeof the notorious  Knockout Game,  a random but racially motivated assault that has claimed at least six lives.St. Louis is 44 percent white and 49 percent black, but statistics shows a racial imbalance in crime. Based on the city s official crime data for 2012   the most recent year which data are available   97.6 percent of those arrested for murder were black and 2.4 percent were white. More than 82 percent of those arrested for serious crimes like murder, aggravated assault and larceny were black, while just 17.5 percent arrested were white.Black males in St. Louis were responsible for the vast majority (63.5 percent) of crimes committed. Other groups contribute significantly less to the serious crimes in St. Louis. White males made up 17 percent of arrests, black females were 14 percent of arrests and white females only 5.3 percent of arrests.There are other strange imbalances in arrests: Black females were arrested for 14 murders compared with three white males arrested for murder. Black females were arrested for more robberies, aggravated assaults and larcenies than white males.These are just a few of the lowlights in a city on the verge of becoming, as U.S. News said, the most dangerous city in America.Consider one violent night in St. Louis last June when 18 people were shot in seven different shootings. Bloody Night Leaves Many in St. Louis Outraged  read one headline.However, some of the shooting victims were not outraged enough to cooperate with law enforcement. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay described the  no snitchin  mentality of many crime victims: These are disputes, and there are victims who won t talk to the police,  the mayor said.  Trying to make an arrest isn t that simple. In one case, they ve got (multiple) people shot and not one of them would identify the shooter. Slay remarked,  In the vast majority of these cases, people are using their guns to settle their own petty feuds, and that s really what s very unfortunate and outrageous about this. Local news reported on a shooting in a housing complex involving an AK-47 in which  a black male armed with the AK-47 came around the corner [and] started shooting  at an 18-year-old woman and four of her friends.Juanita Sparks, 60, of St. Louis told reporters,  I am tired of thugs. Colin Gordon, author of  Mapping Decline: St. Louis and the Fate of the American City,  calls St. Louis  the poster child of white flight.  However, middle- and upper-middle class blacks are also leaving the city in significant numbers.The Cahokia football coach, who had the perfect opportunity to educate these young minds about getting a good education and staying away from a dead-end life of crime, instead, took the opportunity to disrespect the law enforcement officers tasked with protecting these crime-ridden neighborhoods.  The coach said he spoke to them about that and other situations that have happened in our country. He then explained why former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the anthem.

9872,LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD IMPLODES! Ratings Are In For The Trump-Bashing Emmys…Insignificant Celebrities Are Dealt MAJOR BLOW!,"This summer s box office numbers were the worst they ve been in over 25 years, and now this   KNOCK, KNOCK! Who s there? Karma Adjustments might take a little of the sting out of the news that Sunday night s Emmy telecast was a ratings catastrophe, but any adjustment will only make the nightmare a little less nightmarish. Instead of being the lowest-watched Emmys in its 69-year history, Sunday night s telecast might be able to squeak into the second-lowest.As of now, though, it looks as though all that promised Trump-hating resulted in a record low, which is especially shocking (at least to bubbled Hollywood) because last year everyone was certain the bottom had been hit.Regardless, the die is cast. Last night was yet-another ratings flop for Hollywood s Beautiful People. As of now, it looks as though fewer than 11.3 million viewers tuned in to watch host Stephen Colbert s hate-fest. That would mean the 69th Emmy telecast had fewer viewers than last year s 68th, which currently holds the all-time low ratings record.What we do know for sure is that the 8.2 overnight rating is lower than 2016 s 8.4. Even in the coveted 18-49 age group, TVs Greatest Night flopped with a pathetic 2.8, which proves that even young people are tired of watching rich elites publicly work through their inability to come to terms with losing the 2016 presidential election.This news, of course, comes just days after the ratings for the MTV Awards hit their own record low.What has to be especially galling to Colbert and his fellow social justice glitter-warriors, is that in a country of 330 million, fewer than five percent tuned in, cared to watch even a minute of the show, was not in the least interested in their Big Thinks on issues n  stuff, including President Trump who, despite the unrelenting hate campaigns from the media and Hollywood, still holds (if you believe the polls) a 40% approval rating. We all know it is higher, especially in the only states that matter.As Hollywood has gotten more political, more divisive, more bigoted towards Normal People, and more hateful, take a look at the nuclear fallout. America is more red, more Republican-led than at any time since Reconstruction. On every level, Democrats have been wiped out of electoral office.

Such warrants require the approval of top Justice Department and FBI officials, and the FBI must provide the court with information showing suspicion that the subject of the warrant may be acting as an agent of a foreign power. Very wrong!PAUL MANAFORT WIRETAPPED US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump. Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, according to three sources familiar with the investigation. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.Special counsel Robert Mueller s team, which is leading the investigation into Russia s involvement in the election, has been provided details of these communications.A secret order authorized by the court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms for Ukraine s former ruling party, the sources told CNN. The surveillance was discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence, according to one of the sources.The FBI then restarted the surveillance after obtaining a new FISA warrant that extended at least into early this year. Sources say the second warrant was part of the FBI s efforts to investigate ties between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian operatives. Such warrants require the approval of top Justice Department and FBI officials, and the FBI must provide the court with information showing suspicion that the subject of the warrant may be acting as an agent of a foreign power.Read more: CNN",0
9875,LOOK WHO “THE VIEW” HIRED To Replace Only “Conservative” On Their Panel After She Dared To Ask Hillary The Wrong Question [VIDEO],"Jedediah Bila is at most, a lukewarm conservative. She s a hardcore Trump hater, so the show gave her a little leeway when it came to expressing her lukewarm conservative views. Apparently, no one gave her permission, however, to ask Hillary Clinton to accept some responsibility for her loss during a taped segment last week.When Hillary agreed to appear on The View to hawk her new book,  What Happened  that explains why everyone else is to blame after was clobbered in the 2016 presidential election by Donald J. Trump, she certainly didn t expect to be challenged by the token conservative, who clearly hates President Trump. In other words, Hillary and likely the entire panel of dingbats on The View believed she was entering a  safe space , but that didn t turn out to be the case, as Bila zinged her with an unexpected question, that forced Hillary to scramble for an acceptable answer to her question. Of course, Hillary s answer had nothing whatsoever to do with the question Bila asked her, as Hillary hilariously attempted to blame the media for her loss. The 5:30 point is where Bila crosses Hillary Not surprisingly only one week after Bila s question of Hillary, the token conservative host finds herself in the unemployment line, while Meghan McCain, the daughter of one of the worst RINO s in the Senate will be taking Bila s spot, as the lukewarm conservative on the panel of hosts with the dingbats of The View.Meghan McCain told liberal rag PEOPLE magazine that she shed tears when Donald Trump officially won the GOP nomination for president at the Republican convention.For anyone who thinks Bila expected to be exiting The View, a quick look at a couple of her most recent posts on Facebook show that she was gearing up for the next season with the dingbats at The View:Only 5 days ago, Bila posted about hoping that Hillary would come back to discuss the issues with her:Most of her questions were softball questions and she spent a great deal of time trashing our president, but something happened lately, as Jedediah seemed to be actually defending her conservative principles. She recently challenged the racist, Trump-hating CA Congresswoman, Maxine Waters and her over-the-top rhetoric about our sitting President. The hyena s on the panel and the clapping seals in the audience would have nothing to do with an opinion that is contrary to anything other than the hard left. Why Bila put up with those dingbats for so many seasons is a mystery to many who watched. Apparently hating Donald Trump is enough to land a semi-talented female a coveted seat at The View s leftist propaganda table.Watch:Maybe it was just the Clinton interview that ended her career, or maybe it was a combination of the Waters and then Clinton interviews, either way, The View can sit back and rest easy, as Meghan McCain doesn t have a conservative bone in her body, and the  Goebbels Sisters  can now carry on, uninterrupted with their disinformation campaign about President Trump and about the American people who support him.",0

9879,Colbert Debut on Emmy Awards Panned for Glaring Anti-Trump ‘Overkill’…Proves Donald Trump Lives Rent-Free In Hollywood’s Head,"The hateful Hollywood crowd just couldn t help themselves. The Emmy Awards show was a night of all Trump, all the time. Stephen Colbert went into overkill mode with three hours of bashing our president. The real winner of the night was President Trump. He just proved he lives rent-free in the minds of the Hollywood crowd. Alex Baldwin even  won an Emmy for his ridiculous Trump portrayal:Stephen Colbert was the host of the 69th annual Primetime Emmy Awards on CBS tonight, and The Handmaid s Tale was a big winner. But it was Donald Trump who was more often in the spotlight in a case of glaring overkill. In a way, this is all your fault,  Colbert, the host of CBS  Late Show, told the well-heeled crowd early on at the Microsoft Theatre of Trump s rise to the White House   because the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host was denied an Emmy win back in the day. As he has said in the past few weeks and night after viewership-topping late-night, Colbert was quick to reiterate his belief Sunday that Trump is the biggest TV star around.

9880,HEY DEMOCRATS! Judicial Watch Just Discovered Hillary Invited Putin To 2009 Clinton Foundation Gala…Is This The Collusion You’ve Been Looking For?,"The March 13, 2009, email from the Clinton Foundation showed that Putin and about 200 other leaders (including others just as controversial) were invited to attend a gathering that occurred at about the same time that the newly appointed secretary of state was attempting a  reset  with Moscow.The email, which was sent from Clinton Foundation director of foreign policy Amitabh Desai to Assistant Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro and then forwarded to top Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, also highlights the potential massive conflict of interest between a non-profit foundation and the federal government.Even after losing the election, Clinton has continued on the warpath against President Trump s stance on Russia. He doesn t just like Putin, he wants to be like Putin,  Clinton said of Trump on MSNBC s Rachel Maddow show Thursday night.But as secretary of state, Clinton took pains to engage with the Kremlin. Just one week prior to sending out the invites, Hillary flew to Geneva and presented the Russian foreign minister with an actual  reset button  to symbolize a new beginning in U.S.-Russia relations.Beyond the Putin invite, many serious conflicts of interests arose from the sitting secretary of state s invite list.Judicial Watch explains further:The list includes dignitaries from Saudi Arabia, which gave $14.5 million to the Clinton Foundation; Kuwait, which gave between $5 and $10 million; Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar   all of which donated between $1 and $5 million over the years. In February 2015, the Washington Post reported,  A third of foundation donors who have given more than $1 million are foreign governments or other entities   and foreign donors make up more than half of those who have given more than $5 million.

9881,WHOA! BILL O’REILLY DROPS BOMBSHELL Report About Key Accuser In Sexual Harassment Case That Could Prove He Was Unjustly FIRED By FOX News,"Bill O Reilly needs to ask the investigators assigned to defend him in a sexual harassment case that eventually led to his firing for a full refund. O Reilly s reputation, as well as his career, were destroyed by a woman, who it turns out, is not only a two-bit phony, but a liar as well.O Reilly tweeted,  Sorry to have to post this article but it is necessary to expose the evil in play in this country. More to come.  after Newsmax broke the story about a key accuser in the O Reilly sexual harassment case that eventually led to his firing by the liberal Murdoch brothers at the Fox News network.Newsmax has obtained two documents that cast doubt on Burgess s credibility.A Detroit Police report dated Feb. 11, 2015, documents Burgess s arrest on charges of making a false report and obstructing a court order.According to the police document, Burgess called authorities and alleged her boyfriend had struck her in the face with a gun. Police said when they arrived at the scene Burgess  appeared intoxicated. The arresting officer stated:  I asked Ms. Burgess where the gun was that she was struck with in the face, she replied there is no gun. I again asked her where the gun was, and if she had been assaulted. Ms. Burgess stated there was no gun, and he didn t assault me! The boyfriend told police she had threatened him, saying she would call  the cops saying you hit me with a gun! According to the police document, Burgess was arrested for filing a false felony report and for violating a personal protection order.In a statement provided to Newsmax, Lisa Bloom, Burgess s attorney, acknowledges the police report involving her client, but states that Burgess and her former boyfriend  both believe the charges were based on a misunderstanding and were not pursued by the police or prosecutors. In another document, a social media user thought to be Burgess tweeted on Nov. 24, 2012:   up until 10 years ago Laurence Fishburne could get every oz. of my hot chocolate. Addressing that tweet, Bloom stated:  Ms. Burgess has used many terms to refer to herself, including on occasion  bitch  and the N word. That does not give others   especially her superiors in her workplace   permission to use offensive language about her. Here is attorney Lisa Bloom celebrating with her client, Perquita Burgess who we now know, has a history of filing false reports against men:With my beautiful and brave client Perquita Burgess as she walked through her fear and emerged triumphant yesterday. pic.twitter.com/Qw1wihd0zh  Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) April 21, 2017In April, O Reilly was fired from Fox News shortly after Perquita Burgess claimed the host made sexually suggestive comments to her, including calling her  hot chocolate. Burgess worked at Fox News for several weeks in 2008 as a clerical temp.Shortly after an April 1st New York Times report detailed sexual harassment allegations by several women against O Reilly, Burgess called a 21st Century Fox hotline claiming alleged workplace misconduct by O Reilly. 21st Century is the parent company of Fox News.At the time her charges emerged, O Reilly s program,  The O Reilly Factor,  was already in the throes of an advertiser-boycott campaign being pushed by several liberal organizations. I had no idea who this woman was,  O Reilly told Newsmax. O Reilly denied ever having a conversation with her. So when it came out, it was stunning,  he said.The day after O Reilly was fired, Burgess went public with her account in a high-profile appearance on ABC s  The View.   NewsmaxBill O Reilly accuser Perquita Burgess told the dingbats at The View that she felt triumphant when the Fox News Channel host was fired following an investigation into claims of harassment by women. Perquita Burgess, a former clerical worker at Fox, went on  The View  Thursday to talk about encounters with O Reilly nine years ago.Watch Perquita tell The View dingbats how Bill O Reilly allegedly calling her  Hot chocolate  is racist.  Not only was it sexual, I took that as very  plantational  remark. You know, I ve been around enough racism, whatever. ",0

Security scrambled and beat the piss out of the unidentified puncher.While all the attention was on the nasty rapper who got knocked out, the person who cold-cocked him on stage was pummeled by security. Is it part of the security detail s job to mob beat anyone who harms the performer they ve been hired to protect, or is it their job to capture and detain him until the proper authorities have arrived? Let s hope this guy who jumped on stage and gave this disgusting rapper a little dose of karma has a good lawyer because he needs to sue those security guards for using excessive force XX was eventually carried offstage. One of his tour managers tells us he was unconscious for at least 2 minutes. We re also told XXX and his camp believe the attacker was hiding backstage.Cops say another fight broke out later in the parking lot as well.

9884,Comedian Adam Carolla Slams NYC Mayor de Blasio’s Statue Commission,"Thank goodness for a little common sense! Adam Carolla is spot on in his rant over the ridiculous  statue commission  that the NYC Mayor has created to point out any  oppressive  landmarks in the city. Here s his take on the idiocy of the censorship:Comedian Adam Carolla thinks Mayor Bill de Blasio s statue commission belongs in the toilet.He can t understand the outrage the mayor and others have toward historical statues  displayed in cities  but are mum about the art installation where people can poop on a golden toilet called  America.  PHOTO BELOWThe Guggenheim wants you to crap all over  America Here s a novel idea     I would say to de Blaiso, I will support him and his statue quest   if he supports the commission I put together to see what gets into the Guggenheim,  Carolla quipped in an exclusive interview with the New York Post.Carolla s become an outspoken critic    even  testifying before Congress this year   of Americans who get so easily offended that they want to shut down anything th ey deem  controversial.He s making a movie about coddled college students who can t tolerate free speech on campus.GO SEE THIS GUY!He ll be in Brooklyn Nov. 29 for a show his with radio host Dennis Prager. Carolla sees similarities between college uprisings over conservative speakers like Ann Coulter, Ben Shapiro and  Milo Yiannopoulos and the current war against statues in the Big Apple. How come the same people who are outraged over the  Columbus statue have no feelings toward the golden toilet that people defecate in called  America  after so many people   men and women, veterans   have given their lives to that golden toilet,  Carolla said.  Why no outrage in that department?! PICTURED BELOW: THE STATUE WAS VANDALIZED WITH RED PAINT AND BLACK WRITING:  HATE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED  and #SOMETHINGSCOMINGThe Central Park Columbus statue was vandalized last week with red paint on the explorer s hands. Meanwhile, de Blasio has vowed to find the city s  oppressive  landmarks and tag them for potential removal with a new commission: OPPRESSIVE  MONUMENTS?  Mayor de Blasio named a diverse group of 18 artists, historians and other professionals to take hold of what s become a political hot potato.Hizzoner dubbed Ford Foundation President Darren Walker and the city s Department of Cultural Affairs commissioner Tom Finkelpearl as co-chairs of the panel.The body includes an anthropologist of the Native American Mohawk people, a historian of Chinese American people in New York, and the director of a gay and lesbian art museum.Longtime de Blasio supporter Harry Belafonte   an entertainer and civil rights advocate who had a Manhattan library named in his honor in May   was also tapped to join the commission. Over the next 90 days, the commission will develop guidelines on how the City should address monuments seen as oppressive and inconsistent with the values of New York City,  the mayor s office said in a press release on Friday.CAROLLA S IDEA:Carolla suggests keeping the statues but adding educational plaques around the controversial figures who were on the wrong side of history and maybe even a warning:  You don t want this to be you one day.

9886,WATCH: FOX and FRIENDS Host BRIAN KILMEADE Immediately Makes WHOOPI Regret Telling Him To “Read A Book”,"You almost have to feel sorry for Whoopi Goldberg. Her emotional arguments are no match for the very smart conservative Brian Kilmeade, who prefers to use facts and rely on actual history to support his positions.On the 16th anniversary of 9/11, Fox News  Brian Kilmeade asked Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke about the future of the 9/11 Memorial given the current climate of removing memorials that negatively affect some snowflake s politically correct sentimentalities. Do you worry 100 years from now that someone s going to try and take that memorial down like they re trying to remake our memorials today?  Kilmeade asked. I m one that believes we should learn from history,  Zinke responded,  and I think our monuments are part of our country s history. We can learn from it. And since we don t put up statues of Jesus, everyone s going to fall morally short, and I think reflecting on our history, both good and bad, is a powerful statement and part of our DNA. The next day on The View, co-host Whoopi Goldberg had a few choice words for Kilmeade Victims, 9/11. Perpetrators, Confederacy. You understand the difference?  Goldberg said, referring to the Fox News host.  When you see something that is put together to intimidate  and that is celebrating a group of people who decided that they wanted to fight for their right to own slaves. I think it s kind of you can t it s beyond apples and oranges. Get a book, read a book, crack a book, read something. But Kilmeade wasn t about to take any of it lying down. Firing back on his radio show, The Brian Kilmeade Show, that afternoon, the Fox News host said he couldn t  wait to clarify something that they skewed. They are now putting a definer on the Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC. They are now defiling the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. They are chopping off heads of Columbus who I don t think fought in the Civil War but I gotta crack a book according to Whoopi Goldberg,  Kilmeade said. To put your values on people that lived 200 years ago, I think it shows the arrogance of our generation,  Kilmeade responded. What about all those people who thought it was perfectly okay for women not to vote?  Kilmeade asked.  What about all those people  that thought it was perfectly okay for blacks to go to the back of the bus? Are they all horrible people? They re brought up in a time where for some reason that was considered the norm. But as a society, we kept getting better. We always keep improving. But you can t say that Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson are bad because you don t agree with everything that they did.   BizPacReviewWatch Kilmeade s epic response below, via Fox News Radio:",0

HUNGARY’S PRIME MINISTER Follows Through On Promise To Build Border Wall…George Soros Will Be Furious When He Sees The STUNNING Number of Illegal Immigrants He’s Kept Out So Far,"Hungary has slashed illegal immigration by over 99 per cent after rolling out a series of powerful border fences in response to the European migrant crisis, possibly providing a lesson as to the potential impact of constructing President Trump s much-discussed southern wall in the U.S.A razor-wire fence built along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia has helped to sharply reduce the number of migrants from the hundreds of thousands who last year moved up from the Balkans towards northern Europe, especially Germany.Hungary says it has registered 19,140 asylum applications in 2016 and more than 14,000 migrants have crossed its southern borders illegally.Speaking on the second anniversary of the government s move to seal Hungary s border with Serbia   which is also an external border for the European Union   Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s Chief Security Advisor Gy rgy Bakondi announced that the fences have caused illegal immigration to collapse from 391,000 in 2015, to 18,236 in 2016, to just 1,184 in 2017.In February 2017, Prime Minister Orb n took his war against George Soros public:Hungary s populist prime minister on Friday lashed out against billionaire financier George Soros, claiming he and groups backed by him want to secretly influence the country s politics.In his annual state of the nation speech, Viktor Orban said groups partly funded by Soros, who was born in Hungary, needed to be made transparent and identifiable. Large-bodied predators are swimming here in the waters. This is the trans-border empire of George Soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery,  said Orban, who received a Soros-funded scholarship as Hungary was transitioning from communism to democracy in the late 1980s. It is causing trouble   that they are trying secretly and with foreign money to influence Hungarian politics,  Orban said.Breitbart:  The system of technical barriers is the key to the success of border security, and without it, it would be impossible to stop the mass arrival of immigrants , the security chief explained.Hungary had to respond rapidly to the migrant influx which burst upon Europe after Germany s Angela Merkel announced there was  no limit  on the number of asylum seekers her own country would accept, so its frontiers are defended by twin fences peppered with watchtowers and patrolled by thousands of newly recruited border guards rather than a solid wall   which would have taken longer to construct.Nevertheless, as it has been steadily reinforced illegal migration has slowed to a trickle   drawing the ire of open borders activists like billionaire financier George Soros and globalist officials at the European Union and the United Nations.In June 2017, Orb n told the Hungarian parliament that his country  will not give in to blackmail from Brussels and we reject the mandatory relocation quota.  Schulz shot back swiftly at Orb n in his speech on Tuesday.His comments came as the European Commission voted to launch infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary for not taking in refugees under a mandatory 2015 quota system advocated by Germany that aimed to relocate 160,000 refugees across the Continent.Hungary s badass Prime Minister Viktor Orb n has consistently stood up to leftist EU bullies who are demanding that all EU nations take their  fair share  of the mass influx of mostly Muslim refugees. We shall not allow others to tell us whom we can let into our home and country, whom we can live alongside.    Prime Minister Viktor Orb nWatch Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s historic speech in March 2016, where he demands other European leaders find their backbone and save Europe before it s too late. His speech will make you want to stand up and cheer! Mr.Orb n says  That s a German problem,  Schulz said.  Let me make this perfectly clear: When it comes to agricultural policy, it s all  Yes, please.  When it comes to subsidies, it s all  Yes, please.  And when it comes to solidarity in refugee policy, it s  No, thank you    that s not acceptable. ",0

Loomer is the same awesome activist who bravely stormed the stage in Central Park and disrupted the Trump assassination play (click HERE for the video), this summer. Last week, Loomer was forcibly removed from Hillary s book signing in New York. When it was her turn to have her book signed, Loomer asked Hillary questions like,  Where are your 33,000 emails?  and  What happened to Seth Rich?  (Click HERE for Hillary ambush video).

9891,BOOM! FORMER SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE Has A New Nickname For Racist Maxine Waters…And It’s PERFECT!,"FOX News   The New York Times reported earlier this week that Sessions felt  humiliated  after Trump accused him of  disloyalty  because he recused himself from the Justice Department s investigation into the Trump campaign s ties to Russia.Trump  unleashed a string of insults  at Sessions, who would later go on to say Trump s reprimanding was the most humiliating event he experienced as a public servant, according to the Times.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., tweeted Friday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions now knows how African-Americans feel after he was reportedly  humiliated  by President Trump over his recusal in the Russia investigation.On a podcast in May, Waters referred to Sessions as  very dangerous,  before adding,  I think he s a racist, and I think that he absolutely believes that it s his job to keep minorities in their place. To Jeff Sessions, how does it feel to be dragged & humiliated?

9892,Trump Posed For Pic With Two Kids And Everyone Immediately Noticed One Shocking Thing In It,"As one of the most approachable presidents in history, President Donald Trump didn t hesitate to partake in a picture when two kids approached and asked for a photo. He s seen smiling in between a brother and sister duo in the picture. As soon as the photo hit the Internet, everyone noticed one shocking thing in it.The photo looks like every other fan shot out there, with two beaming children who happened to get the opportunity to meet the president. However, it s now gone viral after viewers realized who the children were and why their paths had crossed with the president s.Elijah and Gianna Lucas live in Fresno, California but were in Washington, D.C. on Monday to attend a ceremony in honor of National Peace Officers  Memorial Day. Like thousands of others, they sat in the crowd and listened to our Commander-in-Chief speak about the importance of police work in America and the sacrifice it often is, which has gone without recognition for eight years under Barack Obama. Trump not only showed deep appreciation for the men and women in law enforcement but their families as well, many of whom are left to pick up the pieces after losing their hero in the line of duty.While Obama routinely recognized thugs shot by cops and incited riots around it, Trump does just the opposite in addressing the senseless loss of life by those who work to serve and protect everyone and mentions them by name. This means more to Elijah and Gianna than it does for most since these siblings are two of five in their family who are now growing up without their father, who died while on duty on October 31, 2016. President Trump holds Fresno County Sheriff s Sgt. Rod Lucas  sheriff s identification card as he poses with Lucas  children, Elijah and Gianna Lucas, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.I don t recall Obama ever announcing his condolences when an officer of the law was killed, let alone take time to meet personally with their families and take a selfie with their children. He did this for thugs  moms seeking vengeance in their criminal child s death by cop but refused to give the same attention and respect where it really belongs   on the true victims.What s seen in this shot of the president with Fresno officer Sgt. Rod Lucas  kids is a genuine joy that the Trump had to be a part of this day for them, to personally tell them that their dad was a hero who is appreciated for his service. Lucas died an accidental death at the hands of one of his law enforcement colleagues on October 31, 2016. They were shifting guns around, talking about different ways to carry a second gun, when a gun was accidentally discharged, and a bullet struck Lucas in the chest,  Breitbart reports.  Investigators determined no foul play was involved. Rather, Lucas, a 20-year-veteran of the force, was  having a conversation with a nine-year veteran detective about the various ways to carry backup weapons when the shot was fired . In years past during Police Week, families and children of fallen officers didn t get the recognition they deserved from our president. Now that Trump is in office, he s more than making up for that lost time under Obama and ensuring children who woke up to bad news that their mom or dad wasn t coming home, feel that they aren t forgotten.In an incredible moment at the same event on Monday, held in front of the U.S. Capitol in D.C., Trump turned his speech to a 6-year-old boy named Micah, who he saw in the audience. Micah had lost his officer father in a shootout he was involved in while on the job in Phoenix, Arizona. Trump wanted to give him something special and personal and did so by tossing the boy his hat he had under the podium, which he was saving for himself to wear after the event until he found a far better use for it.Until Trump took office, the presidency was more concerned about disarming our officers and sympathizing with the families of thugs who died in the commission of a crime. Whenever a cop was killed, the past president wouldn t have even addressed it. However, that era officially ended on Monday when Trump posed for a selfie with two fatherless kids and tossed his hat to this little boy before saying,  I want you to know that patriotic Americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police.

9893,PBS HOST ASKS HILLARY:“Do You Believe The President Is Racist?…Her Answer Proves That She Is The REAL Racist [VIDEO],"PBS host Judy Woodroof asked Hillary if she believed President Trump is racist? Hillary pauses for effect and then delivers her very scripted answer to Woodruff:  Here s what I believe, I believe that he has given a lot of encouragement and rhetorical support to the Ku Klux Klan, he accepted the support of David Duke. Hillary knowingly pushed the lie that Trump accepted the support of KKK member David Duke. It s the same lie she s been peddling since Trump became her opponent in the presidential race, even though she knows there isn t one shred of evidence or proof to back up her sick claim. Her answer to Woodruff is nothing more than a lame attempt to pin Trump a false allegation on our sitting President while deflecting from the truth about her ACTUAL ties to the KKK. Watch Hillary attempt to paint President Trump as a  racist .When President Trump was dropping out of the Reform Party primary in 2000, he clearly condemned David Duke during an interview with Matt Lauer.When pressed by Matt Lauer on why he saw the Reform Party as self-destructing, Trump commented: Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Watch Trump s 2000 interview with Lauer here:What Hillary Clinton didn t mention to Judy Woodruff during her interview, was that her presidential campaign received more than $20,000 in donations contributed by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Vocativ reported that a prominent member of the hate group Will Quigg of the California Grand Dragon for the Loyal White Knights said,  For the KKK, Clinton is our choice . Mr. Quigg, the leader of the Klan s California chapter, announced last month that he had abandoned supporting Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in lieu of backing his likely Democratic opponent. The Klansman claims that members have raised more than $20,000 for Mrs. Clinton and have donated it anonymously to her campaign.  She is friends with the Klan,  Mr. Quigg told Vocativ.  A lot of people don t realize that. Hillary never made any secret of her love and admiration for her  mentor,  the late Klan leader Democrat Senator, Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen. Byrd by saying,  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd. ",0
9894,Socialist Utopia of Venezuela Tells People to Eat Their Pets," GENERALLY, VENEZUELANS DO NOT EAT RABBITS AND SEE THEM AS PETS The Venezuelan government just urged its citizens to eat their pet rabbits so they won t starve to death. A severe food crisis is part of the socialist utopia that just keeps going downhill. What s next? Cannibalism?President Nicolas Maduro unveiled a government program called  Plan Rabbit  at a meeting with his agriculture minister, Freddy Bernal, that was broadcast on Periscope, CNN Money reported. It s a plan to distribute rabbits to communities across Venezuela to breed and eat. Maduro noted that rabbits breed quickly and are a good source of protein, but not cholesterol.GOVERNMENT PUSHES A  CHANGE IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS The rabbit isn t a pet, it s only two and a half kilos of meat,  Bernal stressed in the streamed announcement. He then invoked President Donald Trump to push the program. Trump s attack against the Venezuelan people is an opportunity to revise and change cultural consumption patterns,  he said.Venezuelan opposition leaders immediately slammed the move. Are you serious?  asked former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles in a video response.  You want people to start raising rabbits to solve the problem of hunger in our country? A 2016 study found that three-fourths of Venezuelans had lost almost twenty pounds on average over the course of the year. Meat is particularly scarce in the South American nation, with citizens even resorting to butchering zoo animals, according to police.Most economists agree the mass hunger is the result of socialist government policies spearheaded by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Maduro, his successor. Chavez instituted price controls on many food items, which helped lead to shortages and massive inflation.We ve previously reported on shortages of food and even toilet paper in Venezuela.BYOTP! NO TOILET PAPER AND NO FOODSocialism doesn t work but I guess Venezuela didn t get the memo. No toilet paper? No food? Yes, it s come to that in this socialist hellhole Venezuela s product shortages have become so severe that some hotels in that country are asking guests to bring their own toilet paper and soap, a local tourism industry spokesman said on Wednesday .  It s an extreme situation,  says Xinia Camacho, owner of a 20-room boutique hotel in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada national park.  For over a year we haven t had toilet paper, soap, any kind of milk, coffee or sugar. So we have to tell our guests to come prepared.  Montilla says bigger hotels can circumvent product shortages by buying toilet paper and other basic supplies from black market smugglers who charge up to 6-times the regular price. But smaller, family-run hotels can t always afford to pay such steep prices, which means that sometimes they have to make do without.READ MORE: WFB ",0
9895,U2 SUDDENLY CANCELS Huge St. Louis Concert Tonight…Why Bono’s Decision To “Cut and Run” Makes Him Look Like Ridiculous Hypocrite,"In 2016, celebrities came together to create an emotional video that minimized crimes committed or incidents that led to the death of black men and women, both young and old, across America. One of those celebrities was U2 s lead singer, Bono.For many, Bono s part in the video was even more controversial because he attempted to link the death of 9 black church members in South Carolina, who died while conducting a bible study at the hands of a young racist man, Dylann Roof, (who has since been sentenced to death for his heinous crime) with white cops who have killed blacks and have been found not guilty of intentional murder.The video doesn t just shine a light on injustices by white police officers, it promotes an atmosphere of hate and distrust for white people in America.It seems rather unusual that after U2 s Bono would cancel his concert in St. Louis that was scheduled for tonight, following a night of violent protests that led to the breaking of windows in the St. Louis Mayor s home (who supports BLM) and the shutting down of traffic for  safety  reasons. Isn t this the same group he stood by when he participated in the controversial video above? Why would Black Lives Matter protesters harm anyone who came to see an entertainer who stood by them in such a powerful and emotional video?Why not host the concert? Let your fans know you support the people rioting in the streets. Give everyone a chance to sing kumbaya Here s U2 s announcement on Twitter that they are canceling their concert out of concern for their fans  safety .

Travis attempted to explain how he was passionate about the defense of Hill s First Amendment Right, but felt that ESPN needs to be consistent with who they retain and who they fire over controversial remarks. Travis took it one step further when he told Baldwin: I m a First Amendment absolutist, I believe in only two things completely, the First Amendment and boobs. Brooke Baldwin, who has laughed at CNN host Don Lemon as he remarked about Kathy Griffin s  rack  on live tv, pretended to be shocked and offended by Travis  remarks.Baldwin responded,  Hold hold hold on.

In a Friday letter to Karol Mason, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Lynch demanded the  immediate dismissal  of Isaacson  on behalf of nearly 50,000 active and retired New York City police officers who are members of the Patrolmen s Benevolent Association of the City of New York. Recent media reports have revealed Mr. Isaacson s disgusting anti-police attitudes and his gleeful embrace of political violence, including violence against police officers, as expressed in his own social media postings,  Lynch wrote.Lynch continued:  It is absolutely outrageous that an individual who holds and expresses these views could be employed by any academic institution, much less one that counts an overwhelming number of New York City police officers as among its students, alumni and faculty members. He wrote that Isaacson s  continued presence will make it next to impossible for John Jay College to maintain any respect or credibility among the women and men who have dedicated their lives protecting this city, or among prospective students considering a law enforcement career.

9902,"Like Mother, Like Daughter: Chelsea Clinton Spreads Lie Claiming Outrageous Michigan Anti-Gay Law Passed","Like mother, like daughter Brainiac Chelsea Clinton falsely tweeted today that the Michigan House had voted to allow emergency medical providers choice in treating patients, specifically giving EMTs the option to deny treatment to gay patients.Chelsea is often wrong on twitter. It s becoming embarrassing and evident that Steve Bannon was right about Hillary not being very smart. Looks like the apple doesn t fall far from the tree Absolutely appalling,  the former First Daughter tweeted,  Michigan House Passed Bill Allowing EMTs To Refuse Treatment To Gay People. The story Clinton cited was from a website for the LGBT New Now Next Awards, and was posted in 2014. When followers pointed out the story was old, Clinton deleted her tweet.Not only was the story old, but the actual premise was deeply flawed. What the Michigan House actually passed was a garden variety Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which would have exempted religious individuals from laws that infringed on their religious beliefs.Like most state RFRAs, the Michigan bill contained a clause that allows the state to infringe on religious beliefs when there s a  compelling government interest.  The preservation of human life is widely considered to qualify, according to legal experts.The misconception that the bill would allow ambulance drivers to let gay people bleed out in the streets evidently stems from a local CBS story, which was later picked up by CBS News  national website.Huh?  A Jewish butcher would not have to handle non-Kosher meat Yes, he REALLY said that: For example, a Christian doctor who does not believe in a gay lifestyle would not have to treat a gay patient,  CBS Detroit legal analyst Charlie Langton said at the time.  Or perhaps, a Jewish butcher would not have to handle non-Kosher meat. When the original CBS story was published, a Stanford law professor told the Weekly Standard that Langton was simply wrong.

LOUIS   Former St. Louis police Officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty Friday of murdering a man while on duty.St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson s highly anticipated verdict found the white former St. Louis police officer not guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the December 2011 shooting death of a black drug suspect after a high-speed pursuit and crash.Activists, with support from some of the city s black clergy, had pledged disruptive protests ahead of Wilson s verdict.Wilson addressed such statements in his order:  A judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism. Immediately after the verdict was issued, protesters gathered downtown near Tucker Boulevard and Market Street. They blocked a ramp to Interstate 64 off Clark Street, but were blocked by police from entering the highway. Protesters then headed to police headquarters.St. Louis Police reminded protesters that blocking traffic is illegal and is not protected by the First Amendment: Per Ord. 17.16.275, it is unlawful for a person to obstruct & impede the reasonable movement of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. #STLVerdict  St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) September 15, 2017As the protests grew, Wells Fargo and Nestle Purina PetCare sent their nearly 7,000 employees home for the day.Police officers were seen preparing for potential riots:Bike cops are seen amassing in #DowntownSTL. #JasonStockley has been found NOT GUILTY   https://t.co/eLmJAKkagx pic.twitter.com/Kvd7aThPZe  KMOV (@KMOV) September 15, 2017Damone Smith, 52, an electrician headed to work, was among the motorists being rerouted from the protest area. I think the verdict is disgusting,  said Smith, who is black.  I m proud of these people protesting. If you look like me, then you feel like there is no other way to express yourself in the face of this kind of verdict. Time and time again, African American men are killed by police and nobody is held accountable. The judge explained his rationale for the verdict in a 30-page document filed about 8:30 a.m. Friday. No one promised a rose garden, and this surely is not one,  he wrote of the case. This court, as the trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant s guilt. Agonizingly, this court has pored over the evidence again and again   This court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Because the state did not prove Stockley did not act in self-defense, Wilson wrote that he could not address lesser charges of homicide or manslaughter. St. Louis Police Department called for peace:We know emotions are running high, however we ask that those who choose to protest, do so peacefully. #STLVerdict  St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) September 15, 2017The fiance of the victim Anthony Lamar Smith, Christina Wilson, bravely stood in front of a microphone just prior to the court s announcement and asked for protesters to not resort to violence.

I am sobered by this outcome. Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingled. I encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion, to recognize that we all have different experiences and backgrounds and that we all come to this with real feelings and experiences,  she wrote.Krewson s comment drew a rebuke from Neil Bruntrager, Stockley s lawyer. How do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances?  Bruntrager said.  It is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that. It s an insult to Judge Wilson to make statements like that. And it falsely encourages the belief that an injustice was done here when in fact justice was done.   St. Louis Dispatch",0
9904,Michigan Teacher Accused of Assault for Trying to Make Student Stand for Pledge of Allegiance [Video],"So we disrespect the flag in class now? Whether this teacher tried to get this child to stand is one thing another thing is the fact that children AND adults aren t being taught why we stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. MAYBE THIS KID COULD TALK TO THE KID WHO WON T STAND: The video below was created by a student to teach students the importance and meaning behind saying the Pledge of Allegiance:STAND FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE!A student in Farmington Hills, Michigan is accusing a teacher of assault. The teacher tried to get the boy to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance but the boy says he doesn t do that.The teacher was put on leave and is under investigation now.A Black Publication is trying to spin this as just more racism after other black athletes refused to stand for the National Anthem. Notice how The Root spins this alleged assault: Everybody is all about freedom of speech and expression until a black person (hey, Colin Kaepernick; hey, Jemele Hill) decides to exercise his or her right to do so. And in this particular case, a black sixth-grader out of Michigan says he was assaulted by his homeroom teacher all because he was exercising his rights and declined to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.STONE CHANEY:Stone Chaney is a sixth-grader and had just started his first week of school but may not go back because he feels his rights were violated.Stone claims:  The teacher consultant comes up behind me and snatches me out of my chair violently. I was so confused. I didn t know what was going on. He says the homeroom teacher tried to force him to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance. I PLEDGE TO GOD AND FAMILY Click on Detroit reported: I don t stand because I don t pledge to a flag,  Stone said.  I pledge to God and family. The alleged incident happened Sept. 7. Stone said the next day, another teacher yelled at him for sitting down during the Pledge. I don t feel safe going to that school anymore because I don t know what they re going to do next,  Stone said.His father addressed the district directly during their last board meeting. It s his choice to sit,  Brian Chaney said.  I don t make him sit. And they should respect that. Marine veteran Stephen Stevens sees things differently. I would love to be able to talk to them and get their side and explain my side so maybe we could come to an understanding,  Stevens said.  Because I get they have that right, but I don t believe they understand what that right really entails. If they re fighting for freedom, they re fighting for us to have choices,  Brian Chaney said.  Then it s our choice. The superintendent of Farmington Public Schools released the following statement: The District fully supports the right of each student to participate or not in the daily Pledge. The teacher allegedly involved in the incident has been placed on administrative leave. At this time, the District cannot speculate about the outcome of the pending investigation. The family is exploring its options. Stone hasn t gone back to school, but they re probably going to leave the district.",0

What a difference a presidency makes!FLASHBACK TO MARTHA S VINEYARD:  Where was President Obama when the most serious natural disaster happened during his 8 years in office? He was golfing on Martha s Vineyard, and refused to leave his golfing vacation to assess the situation.President Obama is stirring resentment over his refusal to interrupt his Martha s Vineyard vacation to survey the Louisiana flood   the worst U.S. natural disaster since 2012   while drawing comparisons to President George W. Bush s hotly criticized response to Hurricane Katrina in the same state.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended Mr. Obama at a press conference Thursday, insisting that the president is  closely monitoring  the situation but that he will not cut short his two-week breather in the tony Massachusetts resort. The president can t be everywhere,  Mr. Johnson told reporters in Denham Springs, Louisiana.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, backed him up, saying at the press conference that he is  not complaining in any way about our federal partnership. Even so, Mr. Obama s lack of urgency is drawing unflattering parallels to the federal response in 2005, when Mr. Bush was branded as uncaring and even racist for not touching down during a flyover two days after Hurricane Katrina.

Bob Menendez s corruption trial, without ever mentioning Menendez s party affiliation.Both in print and on social media, the NYT failed to inform its readers that Sen. Menendez is a Democrat. For the first time in 36 years, a sitting United States Senator is facing a federal bribery trial,  read a NYT tweet promoting the story, which was titled:  Menendez Trial Set to Begin With Tensions High and Washington Watching. The NYT wasn t without opportunities to inform its readers which party Menendez belonged to: the paper referred to Menendez 29 times in the story, without once ever mentioning that Menendez is a Democrat.The paper referred to him as  The senator,   Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey,  and  Mr. Menendez, a senior senator,  before referring to him as  Mr. Menendez  or  the senator  for the rest of the story.

In fact, Schumer was caught on a hot mic today saying Trump  likes us.  After a couple dinners at the White House, Schumer thinks he s got a little bromance going with POTUS. Here s how it went down:The senator was speaking to staffers shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s floor speech when, in reference to Trump, the senator said,  he likes us. He likes me anyway,  according to a transcription from the Washington Examiner.The comment came the day after Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had dinner with Trump at the White House. The topic of conversation was centered on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration amnesty program, according to the Democratic lawmakers. After the dinner, Schumer and Pelosi released a statement claiming Trump agreed to support DACA legislation in exchange for the Democrats  support in passing a border security package, one without border wall funding. The White House came out afterwards, denying any such agreement was made. Look, what we said was exactly accurate,  Schumer said to staffers in reference to his statement.The Democratic senator then recounted to aides what advice he gave the president.

9911,"NATIONAL PET CHAIN Linked To Outbreak of Bacterial Infection Sickens 39 People In 7 States, 9 Victims Have Already Been Hospitalized","The CDC is investigating an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to puppies sold through the national pet store chain Petland.The outbreak of Campylobacter infections has sickened 39 people from seven states, including Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.So far nine people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.Campylobacter can cause a gastrointestinal illness in humans with symptoms of diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. The illness typically lasts about a week and symptoms appear within two to five days after exposure. People more likely to get a severe infection include children younger than 5, adults older than 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, including those with the genetic blood disorder thalassemia or HIV or people receiving chemotherapy.Investigators say evidence indicates that puppies sold through Petland stores are a likely source of this current outbreak. The bacteria can spread through contact with dog feces. It usually does not spread from one person to another.Twelve of those affected are Petland employees from four states. The other 27 people either recently purchased a puppy at Petland, visited a Petland store, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through Petland before illness began.The CDC says the pet store chain is cooperating with health officials to address the outbreak.

It warns potential customers that staff may say things like  Merry Christmas,   Happy Easter,  and will also offer free sundaes to veterans on Veterans Day. It also says  In God We Trust. I felt the sign was appropriate to hang in terms of being transparent about the views of the owner and staff supporting God and country,  said owner Kevin Scheunemann. It just seems that those kinds of values and principles are becoming controversial in society,  he said.Watch Dairy Queen franchise owner Kevin Scheunemann explain his decision to post the sign here:The sign was posted close to four years ago after a customer was upset when he heard Christian music inside the restaurant. Scheunemann decided to post the warning and said he hasn t had many problems since then.One time, a customer was upset at the offer of free ice cream for veterans, but Scheunemann said he is open to talking with anyone who may have concerns about the sign.

9914,Illegals Voting in Maryland City Elections Just the Tip of the Iceberg in Trend of Illegal Alien Voting?,"We ve been reporting on this unbelievable trend in non-citizen (green card holders AND illegal aliens) voting across Maryland since August. The city of College Park,  Maryland is the latest to decide on non-citizen voting by a slim margin. Tucker Carlson is as outraged by this as we are:A city council in Maryland has voted in favor of allowing resident non-citizens such as illegal immigrants to participate in local elections. The charter amendment passed with its original wording with a vote of 4-3, with one abstention from District 1 Councilman Fazlul Kabir.The city council in College Park, home to the University of Maryland campus, has joined six other towns that allow green-card holders, illegal immigrants and other non-citizens to vote in local elections.In August, most of the residents voiced their opposition to the amendment letting all non-citizen residents to vote in local elections, but by Tuesday night, the majority wrote to the mayor in support of the proposal, Wojahn told the Post.The city hall meeting was packed and almost two-dozen people spoke against or for the motion expanding the voting privileges, Fox 5 DC reported. Local police were on hand due to previous threats and harassment over the motion.Both sides clashed verbally   with one man allegedly being called a Nazi while waiting to voice his opinion against the motion.The College Park City Council meeting is about to begin @thedbk pic.twitter.com/09ZVCwv3WA  Leah Brennan (@allhaeleah) September 12, 2017THIS IS SHOCKING! THE HISTORY OF ILLEGAL VOTING:The shocking thing is that Wikipedia says people who feel like they are citizens can vote Huh???The right of foreigners to vote in the United States has historically been a contentious issue. A foreigner, in this context, is an alien or a person who is not a citizen of the United States.Since 1996, a federal law has prohibited non-citizens from voting in federal elections, punishing them by fines, imprisonment, inadmissibility, and deportation. Exempt from punishment is any non-citizen who  reasonably believed at the time of voting that he or she was a citizen of the United States,  had a parent who is or was a citizen, and began permanently living in the United States before turning 16 years old. The federal law does not prohibit non-citizens from voting in state or local elections, but no state has allowed non-citizens to vote in state elections since Arkansas became the last state to outlaw non-citizen voting in 1926. 12 local governments, 11 of them in Maryland, allow non-citizens to vote in their local elections (Takoma Park, Barnesville, Martin s Additions, Somerset, Chevy Chase Sections 3 and 5, Glen Echo, Garrett Park, Hyattsville, College Park, and Mount Rainer). San Francisco allows noncitizens parents to vote in School Board elections (beginning in 2018).However, over 40 states or territories, including colonies before the Declaration of Independence, have at some time given at least some aliens voting rights in some or all elections. For example, in 1875, the Supreme Court in Minor v. Happersett noted that  citizenship has not in all cases been made a condition precedent to the enjoyment of the right of suffrage. Thus, in Missouri, persons of foreign birth, who have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, may under certain circumstances vote. By 1900, nearly half of the states and territories had some experience with voting by aliens, and for some the experience lasted more than half a century. At the turn of the twentieth century, anti-immigration feeling ran very high, and Alabama stopped allowing aliens to vote by way of a constitutional change in 1901; Colorado followed suit in 1902, Wisconsin in 1908, and Oregon in 1914. Just as the nationalism unleashed by the War of 1812 helped to reverse the alien suffrage policies inherited from the late eighteenth century, World War I caused a sweeping retreat from the progressive alien suffrage policies of the late nineteenth century. In 1918, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota all changed their constitutions to purge alien suffrage, and Texas ended the practice of non-citizen voting in primary elections by statute. Indiana and Texas joined the trend in 1921, followed by Mississippi in 1924 and, finally, Arkansas in 1926. In 1931, political scientist Leon Aylsworth noted:  For the first time in over a hundred years, a national election was held in 1928 in which no alien in any state had the right to cast a vote for a candidate for any office   national, state, or local.

9918,Ramadan Abdullah Set Free On Bail After Police Make Shocking Discovery Of Weapons In Storage Locker Destined For Secretive Islamic Compound In Upstate NY,"How is a man with ties to a US based terror organization, who according to authorities, was caught planning to deliver a large cache of weapons to a secretive Islamic compound in upstate New York allowed to roam the streets while he awaits a trial that won t take place until  November? This incredible story should make every American wonder how serious we are about fighting homegrown terrorism in the United States A long-time associate of a U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), was arrested in New York following the discovery of a large cache of weapons that were intended for MOA s  Islamberg  headquarters in Hancock, NY.Ramadan Abdullah, 64, was arrested in Johnson City, NY, and is no stranger to law enforcement. Abdullah was previously arrested along with another man in 1977 for attempting to rob a Brooklyn candy store, resulting in a murder.At the time, police searched Abdullah s home and discovered enough material to build 50 bombs. Even so, the charges against Abdullah were ultimately reduced.Abdullah was arrested on May 31 after attempting to steal four boxes of ammunition from a local Gander Mountain store. When asked by police about the purpose of the ammunition, Abdullah s answers raised suspicion among police who obtained a search warrant for a storage locker he was renting in the town of Union.During the search, the police discovered the following:8 assault weapons 4 loaded handguns 1 loaded shotgun 2 rifles 64 high-capacity ammunition feeding devices flak jacketsThousands of rounds of ammunition, including .50-caliber armor-piercing roundsPolice searched other residences linked to Abdullah and found a loaded handgun, and more high-capacity ammunition feeding devices and ammunition, including .38-caliber rounds.New York State Police Major Jim Barnes declined to confirm whether Abdullah was associated with terrorist groups or organizations but noted that police believe Abdullah had traveled overseas. There s no indications there was a plan in place to commit an act of violence. However, it begs the question, what was he doing with all this and what were his intentions down the road?  Barnes said.Johnson City Police Chief Brent Dodge said,  It s just a tremendous blessing to be able to take all these high power weapons and high power ammunition off the streets, and who knows what kind of large scale tragedy that this investigation may have prevented later down the road. Abdullah is a longtime associate of the U.S.-based Islamist cult Muslims of America.Apparently, a Muslim man with a large cache of weapons set to be delivered to a secretive Islamic compound in upstate New York, who also has a prior criminal record, doesn t pose enough of a security threat in the eyes of the judge, to keep him in jail until he is tried. The Johnson City man facing 16 charges in a massive weapons bust was granted release on bond Tuesday, as he awaits a Nov. 13 trial in Broome County Court.Ramadan Abdullah, 64, has pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging more than a dozen felonies connected to his arrest in June, which police described as being one of the area s largest gun takedowns in recent memory.Judge Kevin Dooley granted Abdullah s release from jail on bond Tuesday, after defense lawyer Matthew Ryan presented the court with two Binghamton properties that would be put up for collateral.(MOA), which has been described as a terrorist organization in documents from the FBI and other agencies. A 2003 file says MOA is linked to terrorists in Pakistan, including Al-Qaeda affiliates.The group s headquarters is a 70-acre compound in Hancock, NY called  Islamberg.  It is just a 50-minute drive from where Abdullah was arrested.Dennis Michael Lynch visited Islamberg to see what was really going on in the remote Islamic compound. Here is a clip from his visit:MOA is led by a radical cleric in Pakistan named Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani, who demands a cultish loyalty from his followers in America. Gilani indoctrinates them to follow a hate-filled extremist ideology that includes violent jihad against perceived enemies of Islam and a belief that they are fulfilling apocalyptic prophecies.The group has claimed to have 22  Islamic villages  across the U.S., mostly in rural areas, which have been used as guerilla training compounds. The group also has a history of committing acts of terrorism and crimes including murder, gun smuggling, narcotics trafficking and money laundering.A 2007 FBI report warns that MOA  possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S.  It says  members of the MOA are encouraged to travel to Pakistan to receive religious and military/terrorist training from [Sheikh] Gilani. Confidential sources inside MOA say that Ramadan Abdullah has been a significant member of the group since it first formed in the United States in 1980 and helped buy the land that became  Islamberg.  Additional research substantiates their information that he is close to MOA members.They say that he is an  elder  and often visits Islamberg to spend time with older members but does not live inside the commune. He s also provided firearms instruction for MOA, they report.The sources say that Abdullah s weapons were destined for the group, specifically Islamberg.Via: Clarion Project ",0
9919,Hillary Clinton’s Voodoo Doll Obsession Revealed: ‘Stick them full of pins’,"Hillary Clinton has a  thing  for voodoo her new book describes a voodoo moment but she s gone down this path before. Who does this? Hillary Clinton reveals she was  tempted  to make voodoo dolls of  certain members  of the news media and Congress, and then  stick them full of pins.  So Clinton wrote in her 494-page new memoir, What Happened, which was released today.In the book, Clinton complained that the  attacks  against her use of the private email server  were untrue or wildly overstated, and motivated by partisan politics. CLINTON SPOKE ABOUT HER VOODOO DOLL OBSESSION:It was a dumb mistake. But an even dumber  scandal.  It was like quicksand: the more you struggle, the deeper you sink. At times, I thought I must be going crazy. Other times, I was sure it was the world that had gone nuts. Sometimes I snapped at my staff. I was tempted to make voodoo dolls of certain members of the press and Congress and stick them full of pins. Mostly, I was furious at myself.VOODOO MOMENT #2!In her previous memoir, Hard Choices, Clinton described attending a voodoo spirit ceremony with a  voodoo priest  during her honeymoon with Bill Clinton in Haiti in 1975.SHE SPOKE ABOUT VOODOO IN HER MEMOIR  HARD CHOICES : One of the most memorable experiences of our trip was meeting a local voodoo priest named Max BeauvoirHe invited us to attend one of his ceremonies. We saw Haitians  seized with spirits  walk on hot coals, bite the heads off live chickens, and chew glass, spit out the shards, and not bleed. At the end of the ceremony, the people claimed the dark spirits had departed.BILL SPOKE ABOUT THE VISIT TOO:In his memoir  My Life,  the former president wrote a vivid account of a trip the couple s first trip to Haiti in 1975:A voodoo priest gave what Clinton described as a  brief course in voodoo theology.  And then the late-afternoon ceremony began. Clinton wrote: After several minutes of rhythmic dancing to pounding drums, the spirits arrived, seizing a woman and a man. The man proceeded to rub a burning torch all over his body and walk on hot coals without being burned. The woman, in a frenzy, screamed repeatedly, then grabbed a live chicken and bit its head off. Then the spirits left and those who had been possessed fell to the ground. Is this supposed to make the Clintons more relatable to the voodoo community? Haitians are probably sticking pins in Bill and Hillary voodoo dolls after the Clintons robbed them of funds raised after the earthquake in Haiti.Read more: Breitbart News ",0

The protesters who are likely being organized by the Democrat Party and George Soros are hilariously protesting Kid Rock for speaking out against the unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during our national anthem. Some of them are using the excuse that he used a confederate flag as a backdrop to his concerts years ago to protest Rock, who is likely going to challenge the 2-term liberal Democrat US Senator Debbie Stabenow in 2018. Kid Rock is the recipient of the Detroit NAACP Great Expectations award for his exceptional contribution to the black community of Detroit and is the single father of a black son.Here s a look at the small group of protesters whose numbers were estimated from between 50-200.

As Hillary began signing her book, the young lady told Hillary it was great to see her. Hillary in turn, hilariously replied,  Well, it s great for you to be here.  When the young woman waiting for her book to be signed started to ask Hillary a few questions the mainstream media couldn t be bothered to ask during the election, things started to get interesting.Young woman:  So the American people would really like to know, what happened to your 33,000 emails?  <Hillary cackles>  What happened in Benghazi? What happened to the millions of dollars that was supposed to go to the people Haiti? What happened to your health Hillary?Hillary: <Cackles> Ya know what?

9925,WATCH: TOP 5 VIDEOS The Leftist Media Doesn’t Want You to See Of KID ROCK Giving Back To Others,"Organized protesters took to the streets outside of the brand new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit to protest Kid Rock s concert tonight, calling him a  racist  for using a confederate flag in his southern concerts years ago. The truth is that Kid Rock, who is a single father of a black son, and the recipient of the Detroit NAACP s great expectations award in acknowledgment of his work in helping the black community in Detroit, doesn t have a racist bone in his body. Liberal protesters are also pointing to Rock s public remarks expressing his disgust for Colin Kaepernick for disrespecting our flag by kneeling during our national anthem.  We all know the protests are being organized because the left fears Rock is serious about challenging the 2-term liberal US Senator Debbie ( rubber stamp ) Stabenow:Kid Rock has done more to help the city of Detroit than any elected official in recent history, yet people like Stephen Henderson, the race-obsessed editorial editor of the Detroit Free Press just can t help but criticize the rocker with a heart of gold and a passion for helping others who have either fallen on hard times or have bravely served our nation, by suggesting that Rock is a  racist. This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem. Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his nonsensical rhetoric, that will keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well Here are just a few of many examples of how Kid Rock has given back to so many. These are videos you ll never see in the mainstream media. #1. 30-year old Dan Bawita is one of Kid Rock s biggest fans. As he sat at a table in a local restaurant in Michigan celebrating his birthday with friends and family, he got the surprise of his life when a very unexpected guest showed up to help him celebrate. Not only did Robert Ritchie, aka Kid Rock show up to surprise Dan, he spent over 2 hours hanging out with him and sharing a few pretty special gifts with his new friend.#2. In 2011, U.S. Army Sgt. Davin Dumar lost his left leg and suffered several other injuries during a deployment to Afghanistan. After 70 surgeries, Dan and his wife Dana wanted to move back to Michigan and settle down where they grew up. Kid Rock worked a local Michigan builder, Pulte Homes, and Operation Finally Home to build a home for the wounded vet and his wife. Watch Kid Rock, as he helps to surprise the couple with their new home:#3. Kid Rock didn t just visit the troops in Baghdad, he visited our troops while they were in a combat zone. A true American badass #4. In 2008, Kid Rock visited the troops in Al Asad, Iraq, for a Christmas concert. He started the concert by giving a speech thanking the troops for helping to protect our freedom of speech.    Watch him sing  All Summer Long  for the troops. ***Language warning***#5. In 2012, when the Detroit Symphony Orchestra was in danger of folding due to lack of funds, Kid Rock stepped up to the plate and performed a full-blown concert with the symphony to help raise money for the amazing group of musicians, who 5 years later, are still playing.***As a bonus (and because I also attended Romeo High School) we decided to include this video of Robert Ritchie surprising the high school he attended with a $5K gift to be used to help boost their arts program.",0

9928,TRUMP’S DOJ CHOOSES SIDES In Supreme Court Case Of Baker Who Refused To Make Cake For Gay Wedding,"The double standard in our judicial system today, as it relates to the protection of religious rights for Christians in America is stunning. Activist judges have been legislating from the bench for far too long when it comes to the protection of religious rights. Will President Trump s DOJ put an end to the persecution of Christians with this very important upcoming case?  In a major upcoming Supreme Court case that weighs equal rights with religious liberty, the Trump administration on Thursday sided with a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.The Department of Justice on Thursday filed a brief on behalf of baker Jack Phillips, who was found to have violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act by refusing to created a cake to celebrate the marriage of Charlie Craig and David Mullins in 2012. Phillips said he doesn t create wedding cakes for same-sex couples because it would violate his religious beliefs.The government agreed with Phillips that his cakes are a form of expression, and he cannot be compelled to use his talents for something in which he does not believe. Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights,  Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall wrote in the brief.  WaPoComedian Steven Crowder made a powerful (and hilarious) video that was seen by over 5 MILLION viewers, exposing how the left twists the narrative to promote their radical ideology. Crowder went undercover to several Muslim bakeries in Dearborn, Michigan to see how many of them would be willing to bake a cake for a gay couple. Keep in mind, the left is the champion of Muslim communities in America when it comes to protecting their rights.Watch:In 2015, Star Transport lost a high profile case after two Muslim Somali immigrant drivers who worked for them were fired for refusing to deliver alcohol, as part of their job.

9930,Democrats Caught in Major Lie About DREAMERS [Video],"Democrats have been spouting the narrative that DACA recipients are overwhelmingly serving in the military. That s a lie! Fewer than 900 DACA recipients out of 800,000 are serving in the armed forces. The Democrats have been lying about who makes up DACA but this is a HUGE glaring lie.Breitbart News reports that fraud is rampant for DACA:Fraud is rampant and  huge  for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a former official with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency alleges. Under DACA, nearly 800,000 illegal aliens were given temporary protected status and work permits to remain in the United States. Experts have told Breitbart Texas that during the Obama Administration, background screening was lax.In an interview with LifeZette, former USCIS manager of the agency s investigative unit, Matt O Brien, alleged that the fraud rate for DACA is roughly  40 to 50 percent  and potentially even  higher : Based on what I had seen and what I discussed with my colleagues, the fraud rate is 40 to 50 percent. It s possible that it was higher,  he told LifeZette this week.IN CASE YOU WANT MORE INFO ON DACA: WATCH AG Jeff Sessions Explain Why Obama s Unconstitutional Act Has Harmed Americans US Attorney General Jeff Sessions brilliantly lays out the case for America and against those who believe it s okay to break our laws, as long as you have lawmakers who are willing to look the other way The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives. ",0
9931,Is Conservative Firebrand Laura Ingraham Joining Fox News?,"Will radio host and television commentator Laura Ingraham become a prime time host at Fox News? The word is that Ingraham will be taking the ten o clock spot.The rumor started when Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report hinted that Ingraham had a spot on Fox lined up.Ingraham has been telling friends that the deal is essentially done, with just a few details to iron out, CNN reports.Ingraham s taking over of ten o clock is part of a larger restructuring of Fox s lineup. Sean Hannity s show will move from its current ten o clock slot to nine p.m. And  The Five  will move back to five p.m. from its current nine o clock time.This shift was almost certainly prompted by the firing of Eric Bolling and concurrent cancelling of Bolling s panel show,  The Specialists,  which previously filled the five o clock slot. Bolling had been under internal investigation following accusations of sexual misconduct on his part, claims which Bolling fervently denies.Bolling s sudden exit is part of a larger shake-up at Fox prompted by allegations of sexual misconduct. Fox Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes left in July 2016, while Bill O Reilly left in April after 21 years at the network, both for similar reasons.It is not known when the show will begin airing, but CNN s sources say that the deal has been confirmed.

9932,"DONALD TRUMP JR., JUST HUMILIATED Michael Moore In Front Of Millions On Social Media…And It Was SPECTACULAR!","Leftist activist and mediocre filmmaker Michael Moore made a very lame attempt at shaming President Donald Trump on Friday. Moore feigned concern on Twitter that Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, FL wasn t being used as a shelter. Moore tweeted on Friday,  Has he [President Trump] opened up Mar-a-Lago as a shelter yet? , suggesting that President Trump should have opened the doors to his public club to help those looking for shelter from Hurricane Irma that was set to pound the southern and eastern shores of Florida.Has he opened up Mar-a-Lago as a shelter yet?  Michael Moore (@MMFlint) September 8, 2017After Micheal Moore s tweet got over 56K likes and 17K shares from equally ignorant liberals, Donald Trump Jr., gave Moore a lesson on geography.It's on an island on both the ocean & intercostal and in a mandatory evacuation zone  probably not the best idea, but you know, narrative! https://t.co/Ji5V5lh7ya  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 10, 2017In other words, Mar-a-Lago is the last place anyone who s looking for shelter from a hurricane would want to be.Here s an ariel shot of Mar-a-Lago, confirming that indeed, Moore s statement, which he apparently thought was very clever, was instead about the dumbest remark to date, that anyone has made about possible locations for shelters from the hurricane.Keep up the good work Michael. The more you hate on Donald Trump and his family, the more voters the Democrat Party will lose in 2018 and beyond As a side note, Trump ruffled a lot of feathers in the exclusive enclave of Palm Beach, FL when he opened the doors to Mar-a-Lago to both Blacks and Jews, when other private clubs in the area were excluding them.

9933,‘Empty Barrels Make the Most Noise’ – General John Kelly Just Ripped Democrat Who Said He’s a ‘Disgrace to the Uniform’,"Fox News received an email from General John Kelly last night in response to a personal shot taken at him by a member of Congress This is not just any member of Congress it s the bitter open borders Democrat Luis Gutierrez. This Chicago Democrat is all for opening the flood gates for illegals Last week, you may remember that Democrat Luis Gutierrez, in slamming President Trump s decision on DACA, went after Kelly in particular and said the following:General Kelly, when he was the head of Homeland Security, lied straight to the faces of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about preventing the mass deportation of DREAMers. Now as Chief of Staff, this former general is executing the plan to take away their lifeline and taking steps to criminalize young people who live and work here legally. General Kelly is a hypocrite who is a disgrace to the uniform he used to wear. He has no honor and should be drummed out of the White House along with the white supremacists and those enabling the President s actions by  just following orders. Gutierrez received a lot of criticism but Gutierrez is standing by his criticism. He told The Washington Examiner last week,  He s a politician. He works for Donald Trump and now supports Donald Trump s xenophobic, racist policies, and he s carrying them out as his chief of staff. I m not talking about him as a general; I m talking about him as a politician. What Gutierrez forgets is that Obama in 2012 said this about DACA: Now, let s be clear   this is not amnesty, this is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure   Congress needs to act. There is still time for Congress to pass the DREAM Act this year, because these kids deserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments. GENERAL KELLY STRIKES BACK:Fox News reports today that Kelly reacted to Gutierrez s remarks thusly:In an email to Fox News late Sunday, Kelly responded by saying Congress did  nothing  to help so-called Dreamers when they had the chance. As far as the congressman and other irresponsible members of congress are concerned, they have the luxury of saying what they want as they do nothing and have almost no responsibility,  Kelly said.  They can call people liars but it would be inappropriate for me to say the same thing back at them. As my blessed mother used to say  empty barrels make the most noise. He concluded,  The congressman has a right to his opinion. Kelly also said in the letter,  Every DOJ and DHS lawyer says DACA is unconstitutional. Every other legal scholar   right and left   says the same thing. Trump didn t end DACA, the law did. That said, I worked and succeeded to give the congress another six months to do something. I am not confident. Read more: FOX News ",0
9934,WOW! POPE FRANCES Tells Journalists That People Who Don’t Believe In Man-Made Climate Change Are “Stupid” and “Stubborn”,"Here is a portion of the interview that was conducted by a group of journalists and Pope Frances today:Vatican Insider    I leaned out to greet the children and didn t see the glass, and  pum! The Pope with a smile and an obvious dark bruise framing his left cheek, answers the question on how he feels after the small accident that happened to him in Cartagena. Immediately after the Avianca flight took off from Cartagena, Francis spoke for 38 minutes with journalists on immigration, climate change, Trump s latest measures and the situation in Venezuela. He confirmed that he had a private meeting with the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, but denied that there was talk of immigration. He expressed his support to Italy for what the country is doing by trying to manage the emergency landings and regulate immigration flows. Here is a list of US Senators who are also Catholics. Their pro-life ratings are listed in front of their names.: Senate100% Mike Johanns, R-Neb.100% Jim Risch, R-Idaho100% David Vitter, R-La.94% Pat Toomey, R-Pa.**68% Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska50% Robert Casey Jr., D-Pa.31% Mary Landrieu, D-La.23% Susan Collins, R-Maine11% Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.4% John Kerry, D-Mass.2% Richard Durbin, D-Ill.2% Tom Harkin, D-Iowa2% Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.2% Patty Murray, D-Wash.2% Jack Reed, D-R.I.1% Robert Menendez, D-N.J.0% Mark Begich, D-Alaska0% Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.0% Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.0% Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.Does anyone see a pattern here? Yet, no open condemnation for these lawmakers who actually have the power to stop the barbaric practice of abortion by the Pope. Italy is starting to feel the climate change. There have been many deaths in recent days and so much damage  Why is it that governments are delaying this realization, whereas on other issues they keep soliciting, like on the Korean arms race, for example?How ironic that the Pope would suggest climate-change deniers who ve been screaming that phony climate change data and peddlers are part of a scheme to extort money from citizens that will somehow  fix  the NOT resolved science behind  man-made climate change. I have heard of the abolition of this law, but I have not been able to read the articles on how and why this decision was taken. I do not know the situation well. However, detaching young people from their family won t bear any good fruit for young people or the family. This law comes from the executive and not from Parliament: if that is the case, I hope that they will think it over again a little bit. I have heard the President of the United States speak, who presents himself as a pro-life. If he is a good pro-life, he understands the importance of family and life: the unity of the family must be defended. When young people feel exploited, they ultimately feel hopeless. And who steals it? Drugs, other kinds of addictions, suicide  achievable when your roots are cut off. Anything that goes against the roots steals hope. ",0
9935,BREAKING REPORT: MITT ROMNEY To Make Huge Announcement About Running For Major Political Office…There’s Only ONE Thing Standing In His Way,"Sources tell UtahPolicy.com that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is preparing to run for Senate in 2018 if Sen. Orrin Hatch decides to retire.Sources close to Romney say the two-time presidential candidate will jump into the 2018 Utah Senate scrum if Hatch opts not to.So far, Hatch has not made up his mind as to whether he ll run for an eighth term in 2018. He has previously said he was planning on running as long as his and his wife s health holds up.Dave Hansen, a longtime political advisor to Hatch, told UtahPolicy.com last month that he didn t expect Hatch to decide on his political future until October. However, sources now tell UtahPolicy.com that Hatch may not make up his mind until December.Hatch s reticence to make a definitive announcement is presenting other candidates from getting in the race, but Romney has the financial resources to mount a campaign no matter when Hatch decides.A UtahPolicy.com poll shows Romney would be in great shape to win a Senate race against Democrat Jenny Wilson. Romney pulls 64% of the vote to Wilson s 26%. The poll shows Stewart would only be ahead of Wilson 34-30, but that s likely due to Stewart being less familiar to Utah voters.Earlier this year Hatch said he would be willing to step aside if an  outstanding person  like Mitt Romney were to run for the seat he currently holds.

The Murdoch s appear to be cleansing the network of any passionate and outspoken Trump supporters.  The allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced after a  Huffington Post reporter Yahsar Ali interviewed women who said he sent them inappropriate texts that contained sexual content.Eric Bolling, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, decided to fight back, and not take what he calls  false allegations  sitting down. Sean Hannity was a target of washed up blogger and lawyer Debbie Schlussel until he hired a team of lawyers who threatened to sue her. Like magic, the false allegations went away.Eric Bolling tweeted about his decision to fight the allegations by suing the author of the story on August 9, 2017:I will continue to fight against these false smear attacks!

The Murdoch brothers also fired Roger Ailes, the then-head of Fox News Channel, for sexual harassment. Roger Ailes died shortly after his firing, many believed the firing took a huge toll on his health. It appears as though the Murdoch brothers have no intention slowing down on the firing of their most popular conservative hosts, regardless of the consequences.On September 9, Eric Bolling and his wife Adrienne lost their only son, 19-yr. old Eric Chase Bolling. The details of his death are still unknown, but rumors have been circulating that he took his own life after watching his father being smeared in the hate-filled, anti-Trump mainstream media. It wasn t enough that Fox News fired Bolling, or that he is suffering the unimaginable loss of his only son, the hate-filled alt-left liberals wanted him to suffer even more, as they took to Twitter to let Bolling know he  deserved  it.Bolling tweeted about the death of his son on September 9, making it clear that the details of his death were still  unclear .

Speaking to journalists at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday to promote his new film, the racially-charged Suburbicon, Clooney unloaded on Bannon, who will appear on Sunday s 60 Minutes for his first televised interview since leaving the White House last month. I like picking fights. I like that Breitbart News wants to have my head.

He is the supervising attorney for the firm s three Austin offices.When Rob isn t busy chasing ambulances or using a bullying incident his daughter allegedly faced at school to gain celebrity, he s publicly telling the world he d be okay if Betsy DeVos, a mother, grandmother and US Secretary of Education was sexually assaulted. It looks the real bully has been exposed Here s Rob Ranco s vile tweet, that he quickly deleted after it started to get traction on Twitter:This is what Rob s Twitter account looks like now:Here is a link to the archived tweet and to the responses Ranco got to his disgusting comment: https://archive.fo/xNdigRob Ranco, a partner in the Texas Carlson Law Firm was apparently referring to a decision made by Betsy DeVos, that she announced earlier in the week regarding changes that would be made to  Title IX as it relates to the unfair and unlawful way sexual assault cases are currently being tried on college campuses.Betsy DeVos spoke on Thursday, September 7, at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Click HERE for video of Betsy DeVos making her announcement that has the Ivy League educated attorney so angry.Ranco brags about his huge settlement against the Austin Police Department in 2016, for excessive use of force against an innocent citizen. Rob offered to give up his salary before the case was even settled in an effort to get the Austin Police Department to admit guilt before the settlement. The Youtube videos showing him asking for an apology for his client have all been mysteriously scrubbed, but we have managed to locate the grandstanding video and can be seen below:Rob mentions his wife Tonia, who has her own website and Youtube channel that caters to women in his profile on Twitter.Tonia has also shut down her Twitter account, as her husband s disgusting remarks are sure to harm her business whose primary market appears to be women.Leave it to a liberal to be so filled with hate for anyone who doesn t agree with him, that he s willing to destroy his own career, and in the process, destroy his wife s career as well.Here s a video of Rob promoting himself and his excellent skills as a lawyer: ",0

9950,Breaking: #EricBolling Out At Fox News,"The woman pictured above (SEE MORE BELOW) is a serial accuser of sexual harassment against several men. She gives women a bad name. Notice that Eric Bolling allegedly did something to harass the woman.Eric billing was NEVER found guilty anything but the whispers were enough to bury him. He was one of the best anchors on Fox with his bold style. He supported and defended President Trump throughout the 2016 campaign. We believe he was a great asset to Fox News and see this as a trend of accusations against men the left wants to see taken down. This is a great loss for true conservatives and for Fox News. another reason NOT to watch as the network slides to the left a little more every day Variety reported:Fox News will part ways with host Eric Bolling, a host and contributor whose on-air presence at the 21st Century Fox-owned network had been growing in recent months, after allegations surfaced that he had harassed colleagues there, the network confirmed Friday. Fox News Channel is canceling  The Specialists,  and Eric Bolling and Fox have agreed to part ways amicably,  the network said in a statement.  We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck.  A Huffington Post report had disclosed allegations that Bolling had sent lewd messages to colleagues via smartphone.Bolling, a former commodities trader and best-selling author, had been a longtime co-host of  The Five,  and more recently helped launch a new late-afternoon show,  The Fox News Specialists.  He also anchors the Fox News program  Cashin  In.  Fox News intends to keep Bolling s co-hosts, Eboni Williams and Kat Timpf, as contributors. The show will be replaced at 5 p.m. eastern with an hour of news coverage for the foreseeable future, with rotating anchors holding down the slot.IN CASE YOU DIDN T KNOW: Yesterday, Fox News announced that they were suspending Eric Bolling after accusations that the popular host sent lewd photos to at least three female coworkers   two at Fox Business and one at Fox News. Many believe the accusations against Eric Bolling are just more lies in a series of false sexual misconduct allegations levied against Fox News  top personalities, like Bill O Reilly and the now deceased Roger Ailes. The woman who attempted to smear Fox News host Sean Hannity quickly dropped her accusations when Hannity took off the gloves announced he would fight accuser Debbie Schulssel with  some of the finest and toughest lawyers in the country  after she accused the Fox News host of sexually propositioning her as allegations of sexual harassment continue to roil the network.Philly.com   Suspended Fox News host Eric Bolling s first public accuser is a major left-wing activist who held a protest sign at President Trump s inauguration accusing the president of being a rapist.Caroline Heldman, an Occidental College professor who appeared on Fox News, reportedly  filed a sexual harassment complaint just hours before Fox News announced O Reilly s departure,  according to People magazine.Now, she is back to accuse Eric Bolling, a major Trump supporter at the network. Here is Philly.com s report:Hours after Fox News announced it was suspending Bolling, Caroline Heldman, a politics professor at Occidental College and frequent guest on the network from 2008 to 2011, claimed the Fox News host made an unspecified number of unsolicited sexual advances to her. [Bolling] said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have  fun.  He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go,  Heldman wrote in a lengthy Facebook post.  Once, he took me up to his office in New York, showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex. Bolling s team is denying the accusations. Heldman s social media profiles show her to be a staunch left-wing feminist activist.  Big League PoliticsMany brought up #pizzagate in response to my ""good people don't vote for rapists"" sign at Trump's inauguration. https://t.co/lTDtBEhhgh pic.twitter.com/T2S8UfIF5O  Caroline Heldman (@carolineheldman) June 22, 2017Seriously though, the fact that accuser Caroline Heldman would use a picture of themselves with the pal and high-profile, media whore lawyer Gloria Allred at the top of their Twitter account is pretty interesting.Here is Caroline Heldman s Twitter profile:Social media users attempted to accuse Michelle Fields of being one of the women accusing Bolling of sexual harassment.

9951,BAD NEWS FOR THE SPEAKER: Many Republicans Agree…Trump’s Debt Deal Was Better Than Paul Ryan’s,"Trump knows the art of the deal like no one else! He d had enough of do-nothing Paul Ryan so he went around him and made a better deal with Democrats that actually helps the hurricane victims. The three month deal was much better than the commitment of 18 months that Speaker Ryan had proposed: President Trump shocked and angered Republicans on Wednesday by agreeing with Democrats on a bill to suspend the debt ceiling for three months, but by Thursday, Republican lawmakers and aides were acknowledging that Trump s plan was better for Republicans than the plan put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.Many Republicans weren t all that happy with either proposal. Ryan was proposing an 18-month suspension of the debt ceiling that would have let the government keep borrowing as much as it needed, and said the long time frame was needed to provide for market stability.But Democrats said they could only agree to a three-month suspension since they wanted leverage more immediately for other issues they want to pursue in the coming weeks. Trump s decision to take the Democratic plan was seen by some as a betrayal of Republicans, and a sign Trump was abandoning the GOP on a key legislative package.After the dust settled, however, Republican lawmakers and aides made it clear they saw the three-month plan as a slight improvement over Ryan s plan.The reason was simple.Neither plan involved a commitment to new spending cuts as a condition for allowing more government borrowing, something many conservatives wanted to see. With that key piece lacking, many Republicans preferred a shorter term agreement for the same reason Democrats did: it will let them try much sooner to leverage the next debt ceiling fight for their own policy prescription, in this case, spending cuts.A source with the conservative House Freedom Caucus said that group has not met to discuss the plan that Trump settled on Wednesday. But this source said many members of the group seem to agree that both deals were bad because neither included a commitment to spending cuts. Lots of members think the three-month deal is bad, but so is an 18-month deal,  this source said. But the source added that the shorter time frame will at least let them try again soon, and in that way, is better for Republicans. [HFC] members don t want to sit on their hands,  the source said.HFC members, in particular, see the debt ceiling deadline as a chance to threaten not to vote for an increase in the borrowing limit until spending cuts are included. When the battle heats up again, the HFC is expected to push for a cap on federal spending based on a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product.The HFC is a relatively small group of conservative lawmakers known for clashing with House GOP leaders. The Republican Study Committee, in contrast, is more mainstream and is comprised of most House GOP lawmakers for the purpose of advancing conservative policies.But even the RSC indicated Wednesday that Trump s deal is better for Republicans than what Ryan was pushing. For example, RSC member Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Wednesday that he preferred Trump s plan over Ryan s. I think a short-term deal is much easier to vote for than an 18-month or two-year extension with no offsets,  he said on MSNBC, describing the choices that were put before the GOP. Cole cast the deal Trump reached as a slight delay that will let Republicans try again soon for spending cuts. I think a much worse deal would have been to extend the debt ceiling with no spending cuts,  he added.  So we live to fight another day. For entire story: Washington Examiner ",0

9956,"NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTER FRAUD BOMBSHELL: New Report Reveals How Over 5,500 Votes Were Illegally Cast On Election Day 2016"," Kris Kobach   For years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter.New Hampshire was a must win for Hillary. Watch CNN explain the significance of winning the state of New Hampshire for Hillary: New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote.New Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes.Now there s proof.According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn t prove that any fraud occurred   theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver s license.So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017   nearly ten months after the election   only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire.So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State.5,513 is a big number   more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds.It s also possible that New Hampshire s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well.If the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result.   Breitbart ",0

9958,BOOM! LIBS GO NUTS After BETSY DEVOS Announces “Due Process” Barack Obama Stripped From College Students In Sexual Assault Cases Will Be Restored [VIDEO],"President Trump s Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos spoke today at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Students, families, school administrators are generally not lawyers, and they re not judges. We shouldn t force them to be so for justice to be served.The era of rule by letter is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. Watch:Liberals immediately attempted to twist the facts in this decision to uphold the law by allowing every American the right to due process, into  Trump adminstration supports rape on college campuses.  Liberals are so used to a president and an administration who flagrantly disregards the law, they can t even comprehend why due process is one of our most sacred rights.Twitter user, Makada does a great job of explaining to the leftsits who are criticizing DeVos and Presdient Trump that men should be entitled to the same rights as women, and that it is NOT okay to determine that they are guilty of sexual assault without a fair trial in a court of law:Leftists are tweeting #StopBetsy because she wants men to be innocent until proven guilty.

The home has 7 bedrooms and 9 bathrooms. She clearly has enough room for hundreds of illegal aliens.From Zillow:Last August, we reported that Cher s Malibu home was up for sale for $45 million. The place didn t sell and according to the LA Times, Cher withdrew the listing in May, spending the past few months re-doing the interior.Well, it looks like Cher is satisfied with the re-do; her home at 25142 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, CA is back on the market   this time for $41 million.

Trump went around Ryan and McConnell to make a deal to get funds to the hurricane victims in Texas. Ryan tried to grandstand on it but Trump wasn t having any of Ryan s BS so he met with party leaders and made a deal right in from of the RINO leaders of the GOP. The art of the deal in action Trump also pushes the issue on the debt limit to right before the election in 3 months brilliant! SHOCKING  PIVOT BY POTUS:He turned on Republican leaders in Congress when he caved to Democrats  demands to raise the debt limit and fund the government for three months, setting up a brutal year-end fiscal cliff. The move shocked everyone, as top White House officials and GOP leaders had been gearing up to raise the debt ceiling through the 2018 midterm election, looking to pass legislation as soon as Friday.But even after Mnuchin, Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back on the Democratic demands in the meeting, Trump agreed to the three-month deal that will also head off the possibility of a government shutdown until mid-December.During the meeting, Ryan sharply criticized the Democratic proposal, a source familiar with the exchange said. But Schumer reminded him that Ryan had supported short-term increases in the past intended to help create bipartisan deals in 2013.So after Democrats rejected GOP proposals to raise the debt ceiling for 18 months, and then six months   Trump endorsed Schumer s three-month pitch.The Treasury Department will likely be able to buy more time for Congress on the debt limit into 2018. But the Wednesday deal still means Congress will have to raise the debt ceiling, negotiate a massive trillion-dollar spending bill, and potentially hash out a deal on immigration all at once or in quick succession.Trump s statement on the deal:President Trump:  We had a great meeting with Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and the whole Republican leadership group.  pic.twitter.com/ArHkodzr92  CSPAN (@cspan) September 6, 2017",0

9964,Senator Feinstein Attacks Fed Judge Nominee’s Faith: ‘The Dogma Lives Deep Within You’ [Video],"Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told a federal judicial nominee on Wednesday that reading her past speeches revealed how the Catholic  dogma lives loudly  within her. We kid you not! She was downright nasty to Notre Dame Law School Professor Amy Coney Barrett:WATCH: Sen. Feinstein to appeals court nominee Amy Barrett, @NotreDame law prof/#Catholic mother of 7:  The dogma lives loudly within you.  pic.twitter.com/mpDgNZGRsa  Jason Calvi (@JasonCalvi) September 6, 2017Senator Feinstein is a ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. She got really nasty during a confirmation hearing for  Barrett: When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for, for years in this country. Barrett had already stated at the beginning of the hearing that it is  never appropriate for a judge to apply their personal convictions, whether it derives from faith or personal conviction. IS THERE A TREND TO BLOCK TRUMP NOMINEES BY TARGETING THEIR RELIGION?This line of questioning is disturbing and isn t the first time recently that a Senator has berated a nominee for his religion:In June, Bernie Sanders got really nasty and snarky with nominee Russell Vought.  Voight was President Trump s nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Just like Barrett, Voight had written about his Christian faith and was drilled by a relentless Sanders:BERNIE SANDERS decided to go after the religion of a nominee for Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget This was a vicious attack on RUSSELL VOUGHT who has strong Christian beliefs that have absolutely nothing to do with what he was being questioned about. Religious beliefs aren t budgetary concerns. This was a personal attack on a DEVOUTLY RELIGIOUS man who had written an article years past defending his Christian College.PART OF THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN SANDERS AND VOUGHT:Sanders is quoting from an article that Vought wrote:  Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.  Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic?Vought: Absolutely not, Senator. I m a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith.Sanders: Forgive me, we just don t have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view?Vought: Again, Senator, I m a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College.Sanders: I understand that. I don t know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that these people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned too?Vought: Senator, I m a Christian.Sanders: I understand you are a Christian, but this country [is] made of people who are not just I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?Vought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian that s how I should treat all individuals.Sanders: Do you think that s respectful of other religions?I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about. I will vote  no. CAN THE US GOVERNMENT IMPOSE RELIGIOUS TESTS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE:The Constitution says the U.S. government can t impose religious tests for public office. But scholars say Sen. Bernie Sanders can without consequence apply his own religious rubric in opposing a presidential nominee who believes non-Christians risk going to hell.The Vermont independent, who is Jewish but  not particularly religious,  grilled Russell Vought, nominee to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Wednesday, focusing on an article he wrote that said Muslims  do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned. Sanders asked if that view was Islamophobic, and if Jews also stand condemned.Vought responded that he is a Christian.  In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?  Sanders asked. Vought began to answer before Sanders interrupted, asking if that viewpoint was  respectful of other religions. National Review columnist David French writes that Sanders was  imposing a religious test for public office in direct violation of Article VI of the United States Constitution  and that he was objecting to  entirely orthodox Christian beliefs  about access to heaven.Constitutional scholars say Sanders, who said he will vote against Vought, may violate the spirit of the Constitution, but arguably not Article VI, which states:  no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. No senator should vote against a nominee based on his or her religion. It would violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution. But senators can vote against nominees for any reason or no reason at all. There would be no legal consequence, and the nominee would have no forum for complaint. Allan Vestal of Drake University Law School says the Constitution s religious-test ban  does not provide a mechanism for inquiring into the motivations of individual senators and representatives in the votes they cast. There is no constitutional constraint on yea or nay votes, so yes he can do it,  agrees Richard Epstein, a New York University law professor.So now Trump nominees will all be attacked for their religion? This is really dangerous territory.Read more: US News",0
9965,WASHINGTON POST PRAISES MICHELLE OBAMA For “Reclaiming her image”…For Openly Supporting Racist and Cop-Hating Black Lives Matter,"Washington Post: Is this the woman that Michelle Obama sees when she looks in the mirror now, free of the White House and the media scrutiny of presidential politics? After more than a decade in public life, can she freely shed the sheath dress and pearls for a wide brim black hat and dookie braids?She just did.By allowing herself to be photographed alongside 15 other members of Beyonc s inner circle, Obama reclaimed her image from the annals of stodgy first lady portraits. And, she did it by embodying Beyonc s.The image, in case you haven t seen it, is part of a birthday tribute to the singer who posted portraits of black women   some famous, others not   dressed in one of her iconic looks from the  Formation  video.For those who aren t able to pick out Michelle without seeing her perpetual scowl or eyeballs rolling, she s the one in the middle:The Washington Post took great pains to make sure there is no room for interpretation when it comes the reason Michelle Obama chose to publicly throw her support behind Beyonce s divisive, cop-hating music.From the Washington Post:Both the former first lady and Queen Bey are two women who don t put images out into the world without carefully considering their meaning. So what s the former first lady telling us with this one?First, that she loves Beyonc . Well, duh: Their track record of public support dates back to the first inauguration, when the singer serenaded the Obamas with Etta James s  At Last. Second, that she loved  Formation,  undeniably one of  Beyonc s  most overtly political tracks. The video featured stark images of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, along with graffiti supporting the movement for Black Lives Matter, a police cruiser sinking into a body of water and a young black boy dancing in front of a line of officers outfitted in riot gear. That s all before Beyonc  throws up her middle fingers.In other words There can be no denying that Michelle has given up the front, and is coming out as a full-fledged supporter of the anti-law enforcement Black Lives Matter domestic terror group.The Washington Post wrapped up their piece by reminding their readers how painful it s been for Michelle to be stuck in the White House, and how she s looking forward to living a  normal  life again, unlike the  stodgy  former first ladies before her:In one of her final interviews as first lady, Obama told Oprah Winfrey that she longed for a  normal  life after living in the nation s fish bowl. So it seems counter intuitive for her to participate in this such a public display of adulation for one of the world s most famous women.Add to that the controversial nature of the look   which hearkens to Beyonc  in one of her more militant moments. Remember that satirical New Yorker cover, which cast Michelle Obama as a fist-bumping, combat boot-wearing, afro d commando? That image, Obama has said,  knocked [her] back. ",0
9966,VANITY FAIR LEAVES MELANIA Off “BEST DRESSED” List…But Look Who Did Make The List,"Immediately following the election, a few leftist designers announced they wouldn t work with Melania Trump. Their decision to not offer their fashion creations to Melania hasn t seemed to have had much of an effect on her. Melania has brought elegance, class and most of all, style back to the White House that we haven t seen since the Jackie Kennedy era.Apparently, Vanity Fair missed the excitement and enthusiasm so many women (and men) seem to have for seeing photos of the always meticulously dressed First Lady Melania Trump, because somehow, her name was kept off their  Best Dressed Women of 2017  list, but several names that appeared on their list have many Americans scratching their heads in disbelief.Melania made her first major fashion statement on the day her husband was inaugurated as our 45th President, where she was seen wearing a stunning two-piece, robin s egg blue, Ralph Lauren suit.Later in the evening, Melania stunned again in a sleek white, off-the-shoulder column dress with a modest slit revealing her toned legs, as she and President Trump danced to Frank Sinatra s  My Way. There have been countless photos of Melania carrying herself with grace, class, and elegance as truly one of the most well-dressed First Lady s in history.Melania stunned the world in her luxurious black pants suit on her first overseas trip to Saudi Arabia with President Trump:Again, Melania pulled off another amazing pants suit on her trip to Saudi Arabia, that even made some of us forget about the damage Hillary Clinton had done to the image of pants suits on women.But Vanity Fair s list apparently is less a list of  well dressed  individuals and couples, and more a list of individuals who lean left. Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s list:Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s  Best Dressed Women  list:Beyonce s sister, (Yes, the same sister who was caught on camera beating and kicking Jay Z in an elevator.) Solange Knowles made the list.  Because why?We don t need to go into the whole love-fest between Solange s much more famous sister Beyonce and the Obama s, do we?And the entertainer Rhianna, who usually looks like she just walked out a freak show, and calls women up to the stage while she s performing to grind on them in front of a packed house, was also named as one of Vanity Fair s  Best Dressed . Did we mention that she was a huge Obama supporter? When she visited the White House, she told her fans that the best part of the visit was that Obama was  black . She probably just forgot that he is also white. Anyhow, it s probably pretty clear why Vanity Fair chose her.Vanity Fair even had a  Best Dressed Couples  category, and to the surprise of no one, the Obama s and the Macron s made the list that should have been renamed the  High Profile People On The Left Who Wear Clothes . Of course, Michelle and Barack made the list. Even funnier, is the fact that Vanity Fair chose this photo to highlight Michelle s great taste in clothing.And then there s the leftist first couple of France, the Macron s. We must concede, that Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron are the only leftists on this list that we believe actually have any business being on a  Best Dressed  list. Like Melania Trump, France s first lady never disappoints when it comes to fashion. Vanity Fair did however mention Melania and her fashion sense in arecent article, but it was anything but flattering, as they attempted to accuse her of copying (of all people) Michelle Obama, as a way to make her more appealing to Americans. LOL!From the Vanity Fair article:Melania Trump appears to be taking a page out of the Michelle Obama book of fashion. The usually designer-clad Trump flew from Camp David to D.C. over the weekend wearing a surprisingly affordable $75 pink gingham shirt from J.Crew along with a pair of matching J Brand pink pants and Manolo Blahnik flats. According to Yahoo Style Canada, the button-up top is a discontinued piece from the brand s 2012 collection. Perhaps she s been waiting to save the economical top for just the right moment in her First Lady reign.The mall brand is a major departure from the First Lady s typical designer wardrobe, which is occasionally criticized for being over the top and out of touch. Trump s predecessor Michelle Obama was often lauded for wearing J.Crew during her time in the White House, coming across as a more relatable and accessible First Lady than many in the past. It seems entirely possible that Trump is ripping out a page from the Obama handbook in order to drum up some much-needed goodwill from the public. ",0
9967,N KOREA JUST REVEALED Plans To Unleash An Unimaginable  Attack That Could Lead To Electronic Armageddon,"WFB  North Korea for the first time this week revealed plans for using its nuclear arms for space-based electronics-disrupting EMP attacks, in addition to direct warhead ground blasts.The official communist party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, published a report Monday on  the EMP might of nuclear weapons,  outlining an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack produced by detonating a nuclear warhead in space. In general, the strong electromagnetic pulse generated from nuclear bomb explosions between 30 kilometers and 100 kilometers [18.6 miles and 62 miles] above the ground can severely impair electronic devices, electric machines, and electromagnetic grids, or destroy electric cables and safety devices,  said the article authored by Kim Songwon, dean of Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang. The discovery of the electromagnetic pulse as a source of high yield in the high-altitude nuclear explosion test process has given it recognition as an important strike method,  he stated.The official discussion by North Korea of plans to conduct EMP strikes will likely fuel debate over the threat. Former CIA Director James Woolsey has said North Korea is capable of orbiting an EMP nuclear weapon in a satellite.Some liberal arms control advocates have dismissed the EMP threat from Pyongyang as far-fetched, such as arms control advocate Jeffrey Lewis, who in April dismissed the threat of an EMP attack by laughing at a reporter s question.  This is the favorite nightmare scenario of a small group of very dedicated people,  he told NPR.Disclosure of North Korea s intention to use its nuclear force for EMP attacks comes as U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing to analyze the latest underground nuclear test by North Korea on Sept. 3 that the regime said was its first hydrogen bomb explosion.Senior administration officials said initial assessments of the nuclear blast in northeastern North Korea indicate it was the largest test detonation so far, and much larger than an underground test carried out last year. It was the regime s sixth nuclear test.U.S. nuclear technicians have not made a definitive conclusion about the specifics of the device. Specialists are trying to determine if the test involved a hydrogen bomb, as Pyongyang asserted, or a device designed for EMP attack. They are also assessing whether the test used boosted fission technology.Hydrogen bombs are advanced devices that use a two-stage explosion process to produce a massive explosion. Boosted fission devices are less sophisticated technologically and require more nuclear fuel. We re highly confident this was a test of an advanced nuclear device and what we ve seen so far is not inconsistent with North Korea s claims,  a U.S. intelligence official said.However, a final conclusion on the type and yield of the blast is not expected for several days. Data from the test is being analyzed by nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.Also, the large explosion perhaps more than 100 kilotons, or the equivalent of 100 tons of TN likely produced significant venting of radioactive particles into the air.Special U.S. intelligence aircraft, including the WC-135 nuclear  sniffer  jets, are conducting flights near the test zone to gather samples of particles from the test.EXPERTS ARE SAYING AN EMP ATTACK BY N KOREA IS A VERY REAL AND DARK POSSIBILITYAccording to the Business Insider, some experts believe that the more realistic threat at this point in time is an EMP attack. To make that happen, all North Korea has to do is launch a low-yield nuclear missile from a submarine, ship, or even by balloon and explode it at high altitude, above the atmosphere.The potential result: a blackout of the Eastern grid that supplies 75% of power to the United States.If an EMP attack did take place, it would be beyond anything we have seen before. The Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, which was established by Congress in 2001, estimates that within 12 months following a nationwide blackout,  up to 90% of the US population could perish from starvation, disease, and societal breakdown. Electronic ArmageddonIn practical terms, a catastrophic blackout would be worst in cities, because it would instantly deprive the population of access to drinking water, refrigeration, heat, air conditioning, and telecommunication. Food stores would be looted within a matter of days, and gas stations would cease to function without electricity.Without Internet access and power, all commerce and advanced methods of communication would stop. There would be no TV, radio, phones. Credit card transactions and cash withdrawals at banks would be impossible. Paper money would become worthless, and Bitcoin would cease to exist, along with the stock market.Newt Gingrich, speaking at the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources earlier this month, said an EMP attack  would send us back to the 18th century. But that s not the only problem. If no outside help arrives, within days, chaos begins to reign. Civilization is a rather thin veneer that humans have acquired over centuries, a mask covering our hard-wired survival instincts. Once the mask slips, it could mean the end of the world as we know it.We are Ill-Prepared For An EMP AttackUS politicians and major utilities have kicked the can down the road when it comes to EMP preparation. Edison Electric estimates that shielding transformers for the US grid system could cost $20 billion.Granted, American power companies have been studying ways to protect our electronic grids against attack, but tangible results are slow in coming.The only current option after an EMP attack would be to replace damaged or destroyed transformers. However, says Scott Aaronson, managing director for Cyber and Infrastructure Security at Edison Electric, replacements for those transformers must be procured from foreign suppliers, which could take up to 18 months.Peter Vincent Pry, leader of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, believes North Korea is closer to launching an EMP attack than many analysts believe. He wants Congress to work harder and cut the red tape to allow the innovation necessary to mitigate the threat.In Pry s opinion, an EMP attack would ultimately kill more Americans than a direct nuclear blast could. His book, The Long Sunday, describes several plausible EMP attack scenarios.Pry thinks that  the first nation to use nuclear weapons today even a rogue state like North Korea or Iran will immediately become the most feared and credible nuclear power in the world, a formidable force to be reckoned with, and perhaps the dominant actor in a new world order. Is there a sensible way to prepare for an EMP attack?Maybe not, but stocking some food, water, fuel, and batteries for emergencies is always a good idea as well as owning a stash of gold coins as hard assets.While  you can t eat gold,  as some preppers say, it is the only kind of money that has prevailed over the millennia. Kim, the North Korean technical university dean, stated that high-altitude explosions can be conducted in the stratosphere or in space where the blast wave is limited by the lack of air or the thinness of air. In explosions occurring at such altitudes, large amounts of electrons are released as a result of ionization reactions of high-energy instant gamma rays and other radioactive rays,  he said.  These electrons form a strong electromagnetic pulse (EMP) through interaction with the geomagnetic field. The detonation would create a strong electric field of 100,000 volts per meter when it approaches the ground and  that is how it destroys communications facilities and electricity grids,  the report said.The EMP report was published Monday, a day after the same state-run outlet reported on a visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to a nuclear weapons facility that also mentioned plans for using nuclear weapons in EMP attacks. Our hydrogen bomb whose power as a nuclear bomb can be adjusted at will from tens of kilotons to hundreds of kilotons according to the targets of strike is a multifunctional thermonuclear warhead which not only has enormous lethality and destructibility, but also can even carry out super-powerful EMP attack over an expansive area through detonation at high altitudes according to strategic goals,  the report said.

9968,RINO SENATOR From “Red State” Tells Illegal Aliens: “You Have Done Nothing Wrong”…Joins Dems To Push DREAM ACT Legislation Only Hours After Trump Rescinds DACA [VIDEO],"Here are a few facts explaining who the DACA recipients really are.  The National UnDACAmented Research Project was compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales and published by the Center For Immigration Studies (CIS):In April 2016, the Washington Times reported that a massive anti-deportation infrastructure had emerged to try to protect illegal immigrants from President Trump s crackdown, with advocacy groups coaching potential deportees on how to massage encounters with police, and lawyers and judges working to shield them from charges that would make them priorities for deportation.A video released Monday by a coalition of advocates instructs illegal immigrants not to open the door to federal agents, what proof to demand if they are being arrested and what to say if accosted outside their homes.Meanwhile, attorneys are working to lower charges from some illegal immigrant criminals, hoping to blunt their crimes so they don t show up as high-priority deportation targets.The Washington Times reported on a recent case in California, where an immigrant from India was accused of abusing his wife. The Santa Clara prosecutor told The Daily Beast that he reduced a felony assault charge to a felony accessory after the fact charge in order to spare the man a sentence that would have made him a deportation risk.IJR- The same day that President Donald Trump  rescinded  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) held a joint press conference in which they reintroduced legislation that would see Congress tackling many of the issues that DACA comprises. What Senator Graham and I want to deliver is the message today, is that we need to do our job right here in the United States Senate,  Durbin said.  We need to pass, in this month of September, a DREAM Act, a permanent law in this country, that says that these young people will have their chance to become part of America s future. The DREAM   Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors   Act has been circling Congress for more than a decade, having first been introduced by Durbin and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in 2001. The legislation has failed to pass each time it has been introduced.Durbin then took a moment to speak directly to the DREAMers, saying,  Do not give up hope. If you are one of those DREAMers,  Durbin continued,  one of those protected by DACA, you need to be part of America in its future. We made a promise to you that if you gave this information to our government about you and your family, it wouldn t be used against you. I don t want that to ever happen. Durbin then turned over the podium to Graham, who said right out of the gate, speaking to the DACA participants,  you have done nothing wrong. You ve demonstrated your ability to be beneficial to the country now and in the future,  Graham said.  The only thing that stands between you and certainty in your life is the Congress. That cannot be that reassuring. Congress is going to have to up its game,  Graham opined. ",0

CHICAGO REPORTEDLY FINDS At Least 14,000 More Votes Than Voters In 2016 Election","The head of the Chicago Republican Party is claiming the city reported thousands of more votes cast than voters in the 2016 election   sparking a battle with Chicago officials who call the allegations overblown.First reported by the Chicago City Wire, the Chicago GOP filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Chicago Board of Elections in January for a list of voters who had cast ballots in November. According to the party, the board responded with a list of 1,101,178 individuals, though its website reflects 1,115,664 votes cast. There should never be more votes than voters every ballot cast should be recorded against a registered voter,  Chairman of the Chicago GOP Chris Cleveland told Fox News, explaining that after receiving the data, the party  immediately  contacted the board for  clarification.   This is either massive fraud or massive incompetence, but we have no way of telling the difference because they won t give us the data. The discrepancy totals more than 14,000, though Cleveland claims it could be as high as 16,000.Cleveland told Fox News he filed a number of FOIA requests the original in January, and  several follow ups  for updated numbers.

The DACA program is unlawful: Just listen to Obama s own words at a 2011 town hall with Univision:The DACA program is unlawful. For an explanation, look no further than President Obama s own words at a 2011 town hall with Univision. pic.twitter.com/E4MxN5JZD9  ForAmerica (@ForAmerica) September 5, 2017Obama defended DREAMers   people brought here illegally as children   as  patriots  who are  American in their hearts    and cast Trump s move as  political  decision WAS IT NOT A TOTALLY POLITICAL DECISION FOR OBAMA TO SIGN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON DACA? To target these young people is wrong   because they have done nothing wrong,  Obama wrote in a Facebook post published hours after Trump announced his decision in a written statement following a speech by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  It is self-defeating   because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. No, what s cruel is having open borders to allow these people in. What s cruel is to have this unConstitutional policy that now Trump has to deal with. President Trump is the adult in the room of a bunch of lawless cowards.OBAMA S STATEMENT: Immigration can be a controversial topic. We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules. But that s not what the action that the White House took today is about. This is about young people who grew up in America   kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag. These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they re undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver s license. Over the years, politicians of both parties have worked together to write legislation that would have told these young people   our young people   that if your parents brought you here as a child, if you ve been here a certain number of years, and if you re willing to go to college or serve in our military, then you ll get a chance to stay and earn your citizenship. And for years while I was President, I asked Congress to send me such a bill. That bill never came. And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country. We did so based on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion, deployed by Democratic and Republican presidents alike, because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm. Deportations of criminals went up. Some 800,000 young people stepped forward, met rigorous requirements, and went through background checks. And America grew stronger as a result. But today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again. To target these young people is wrong   because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating   because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. What if our kid s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak? Let s be clear: the action taken today isn t required legally. It s a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us. They are that pitcher on our kid s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. It is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today. And now that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, it s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future. I m heartened by those who ve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel. Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. What makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray. What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals   that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation. That s how America has traveled this far. That s how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union. Read more: DM",0
9975,BIG MISTAKE? MASKED ANTIFA COWARDS Target KID ROCK’S DETROIT Concert Opening Of Little Caesars Arena Tonight,"Detroit s own Kid Rock will open the all-new Little Caesars Arena on Tuesday, Sept. 12, but a group is planning a rally outside of the arena ahead of his concert.The rally will take place from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. outside of the arena. The concert is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m.According to the Facebook event, the group plans to  rally against symbols of white supremacy and hate in our amazing city of Detroit. Kid Rock has previously used the Confederate Flag at his concerts, and in 2015, the National Action Network asked General Motors to stop sponsoring his tour over the use of the flag.At the time, General Motors found Kid Rock has not flown the Confederate Flag since around 2011.  WXYZStephen Henderson, the race-obsessed Editorial Page Editor of the Detroit Free Press had this to say about Kid Rock and the Illitches, who never gave up on the city of Detroit, and continued to throw tens of millions of dollars at new ventures, even when many of us in the suburbs believed they were wasting their money on a city that could never be resecutated:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem.Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his embarrassing attempts to shame the white man, that will help to keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well ",0
9976,BREAKING NEWS: DACA IS DONE! WATCH AG Jeff Sessions Explain Why Obama’s Unconstitutional Act Has Harmed Americans,"President Trump keeps another promise. The winning streak for Americans continues The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives. ",0

9978,OBAMA THREATENS TO SURFACE FROM LEFTIST BUNKER To Speak Out Against Trump’s Plan To End DACA,"Contrary to what the media would like us to believe, Obama has not remained silent when it comes to policy that President Trump put in place by executive order. Neither he nor his Democratic henchmen remained silent when President Trump desperately tried to convince Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, or when he had the opportunity to attack him over his handling of the Charlottesville controversy. The media celebrated Obama s post-Charlotseville tweet designed to make our former President look like he was in favor of uniting the nation (which we all know is a bald-faced lie), while falsely giving the impression that President Trump was choosing sides.Before the media gets into a full-blown tizzy about Obama using social media to bash our current president over DACA, they might consider that most of America aren t stupid enough to believe that Valerie Jarrett didn t move into Barack Obama s DC home because he needed a friend to play checkers with. He may not be making public statements to voice his opposition against our current president, but one thing we do know is that he and Valerie Jarrett aren t sitting on their hands, while President Trump unwinds everything they worked so hard to make happen, including DACA.Hotair   You know it s killing this guy not to be on camera every day scolding Trump in his usual  that s not who we are  terms but that would be a strategic disaster so obvious that silence is really the only option. A  Trump vs. Obama  fight over almost any issue would unify most of the right behind the president and O knows it; the most brutal thing he can do to Trump is to deny him that our-guy-versus-their-guy dynamic. I don t think it s crazy to believe that Trump s job approval would be five to 10 points higher if Obama had spent the last seven months sniping at him regularly. By withholding his criticism, he s made it possible for  soft  Republicans and right-leaning independents to criticize POTUS without fear of being accused that they re carrying O s water.Two days before President Trump s inauguration, Obama warned him that he would come out against him if Trump rescinded his unconstitutional DACA.Why attack Trump now? I think there s more to it than DACA just being near and dear to Obama s heart. He knows that congressional Republicans are going to be jammed up here to an unusual degree. Immigration is a fraught issue for the GOP under the best of circumstances but DREAMers are an especially hard case due to their having come here as children. They re the one class of illegals about whom even Trump speaks warmly. In fact, the president s going to end DACA not because he wants to but because Republican AGs are squeezing him to do so, replete with the threat of a court battle; even then, Trump is still so reluctant to pull the plug that he s willing to hold off for another six months. The entire GOP (apart from Steve King) will spend those six months telling every voter who listens that they re open to legalizing DREAMers. All they ask in return is some face-saving security measures so that they can semi-plausibly argue to their base that they didn t roll over completely on amnesty.Having Obama wade in publicly on the side of DREAMers will complicate all of that. With O banging the drum for amnesty, Republican voters who are lukewarm on the idea in the first place will start to turn frosty. Populists will have a field day attacking Ryan and McConnell (and Trump?) for essentially doing Obama s bidding by negotiating for a DREAM bill. Some congressional Republicans might start to get cold feet. The more hostile Trump and the congressional GOP become towards a DREAM deal as part of a backlash towards Obama, the more ammo Schumer will have to say that Republicans are being cruel to poor illegal children whose only mistake was trusting the federal government. The whole GOP  we like DREAMers too!  messaging effort will be scrambled. Either negotiations will end up collapsing in Congress, with Dems using the DREAM failure against Republicans next fall, or Trump, Ryan, and McConnell will have to swallow hard and approve an amnesty cheered on by Barack farking Obama, which is about the RINO-iest move a modern Republican is capable of making. Either the GOP base ends up angry at the White House or everyone else does. Obama  speaking out  is tinder for the match Trump is about to strike.Let s hope President Trump will be able to locate and tweet this pesky little video of candidate Obama telling his constituents how he disagrees with law breaking illegal aliens living and working in America:",0

9980,"Trump ‘Diversity Council’ Member Threatens to Quit If Trump Ends DACA…Bye, Bye!

Bye Bye!Trump diversity council member tells @Acosta he may quit the council if Trump moves ahead to end DACA https://t.co/CCn90EgSdn  CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 4, 2017 I want to remind him and his team that from an economic standpoint, and again, we re business people if you look at this from a purely economic standpoint again, none of these young people gets government benefits of any sorts so they re not costing us anything. They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP",0

9982,Gov. Cuomo Defends Not Endorsing Mayor de Blasio…Speaks Up On ‘Offensive Statues’ Of Christopher Columbus,"NY Governor Andrew Cuomo made two shocking announcements regarding the Christopher Columbus Statues and about his decision not to endorse NY Mayor de Blasio.During an appearance at the West Indian Day Parade on Monday, Gov. Cuomo said statues of the famous Italian explorer should remain in the public square: The Christopher Columbus statue is really about honoring Italian Americans. I for one for obvious reasons happen to believe in the Italian-American heritage. I believe in the contribution Italian-Americans have made, just as I believe in celebrating the Caribbean and the Israel day parade. NO ENDORSEMENT?   A BATTLE ROYAL BETWEEN TWO DEM HEAVYWEIGHTSGov. Andrew Cuomo said he isn t endorsing Mayor Bill de Blasio for re-election   because he lives in Westchester. I don t vote in the primary election. I m a Westchester resident,  he said.  I m not voting in this election, so I don t have any primary endorsements at this time. The Democratic primary is Sept. 12, and de Blasio is heavily favored to win. The mayor endorsed Cuomo months before the Democratic primary in 2014.Cuomo s non-endorsement of de Blasio is just the latest example of sniping between the two Democratic Party power brokers. We didn t ask for his support,  said de Blasio campaign spokeswoman Monica Klein. A FIRESTORM OF CRITICISM If this doesn t sink the mayor s reelection efforts, we don t know what will! When de Blasio announced he would form a committee of people who would decide which statues are  offensive  then take them down, we knew it was going to be a rough go for de Blasio. You don t tell the Italian community to take down Christopher Columbus statues! Cuomo said it best when he finally came out with a statement in support of keeping the statues: The Italian American contribution and the Italian American culture is a big part if what makes New York, New York,  Cuomo said.There have been several protests regarding this move by de Blasio so he s now backtracking on his decision:Mayor de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito have come under a firestorm of criticism for mulling the removal of a Christopher Columbus statues   including the 76-foot structure in Columbus Square   as part of a review of offensive monuments. The mayor has backtracked following the outcry. There s no plan to remove the Columbus statue,  said de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips.While the Italian explorer is revered for discovering the New World, Columbus  detractors said he mistreated and enslaved native Caribbean populations and doesn t deserve to be extolled.CUOMO NEEDED TO FIRST PUT HIS WET FINGER INTO THE WIND TO SEE HOW OPINION WAS GOINGIt s the first time Cuomo has waded in on the controversy after declining comment last week.

Is Hollywood s rapidly declining appeal really so surprising to most Americans who are 100% FED UP with their hate for middle-America?As Hollywood wraps up the all-important summer box-office season this Labor Day weekend, a sobering reality has gripped the industry.The number of tickets sold in the United States and Canada this summer is projected to fall to the lowest level in a quarter-century.The results have put the squeeze on the nation s top theater chains, whose stocks have taken a drubbing. AMC Theatres Chief Executive Adam Aron this month called his company s most recent quarter  simply a bust. Such blunt language reflects some worrisome trends. Domestic box-office revenue is expected to total $3.78 billion for the first weekend of May through Labor Day   a key period that generates about 40% of domestic ticket sales   down nearly 16% from the same period last year, according to comScore. That s an even worse decline than the 10% drop some studio executives predicted before the summer began.  LA TimesBreitbart   Even before this catastrophic Labor Day weekend is factored in (more on this below), the domestic 2017 box office is in hideous shape. This year is  6.3% behind 2016 and continues to fall behind 2015, 2013, and 2012.If you figure in inflation, those numbers are even worse. For example, in 2012 the average ticket cost $7.96. Today it is almost a full dollar more at $8.89. Yeah, things are that bad and will look even worse on Tuesday.With no apparent faith in their own product, this is the first Labor Day in 25 years where a new title has not been released on more than 1,000 screens. Over this weekend last year, the box office hauled in nearly $130 million. This year will do about a third of that.Summer attendance is at a 25-year low.The summer box office is down a whopping  16% compared to 2016.Can a handful of titles   It, Kingsman 2, Bladerunner 2, Thor 3, Justice League, Star Wars 8   save an entire year? Doubtful. Pull out of a dive? Maybe. Still, we are talking about only six big titles over four months, which is about on par with last year s Passengers, Rogue One, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Inferno, Sully, and Magnificent Seven.",0

9988,CNN Publishes Inauguration Day Letter from Obama to Trump: ‘Keep International Order’,"CNN has published the Inauguration Day letter from Obama to incoming President Trump. The letter includes the usual pleasantries then asks Trump to keep the  international order  going. Hummm, that s a loaded demand because then-candidate Trump s stump mantra was to put America first. Um, yeah no May of 2010 is when Obama declared a  new international order was needed: President Obama is facing criticism for his declaration over the weekend that he would seek a new  international order,  with some questioning how much U.S. sovereignty the administration is willing to cede in exchange for more global cooperation. Trump campaigned on upsetting the apple cart for this new globalism and liberal political hack Fareed Zakaria wrote about the end to this  international order  in a Washington Post OpEd in which he bashed Trump s America first policy:In his first days in office, President Trump has begun to reverse the domestic policies of the previous eight years. But with regard to the United States  relations with the world, Trump seems far more radical. In word and deed, he appears to be walking away from the idea of America at the center of an open, rule-based international order. This would be a reversal of more than 70 years of U.S. foreign policy.CNN reports:During his final moments in the Oval Office, President Barack Obama folded into thirds a handwritten letter to Donald Trump, slid it into an envelope, and in neat capital letters addressed it to  Mr. President. Now, the contents of that letter   the last direct communication between the 44th and 45th presidents   have emerged for the first time after CNN obtained a copy.Full text of the letter:Dear Mr. President  Congratulations on a remarkable run. Millions have placed their hopes in you, and all of us, regardless of party, should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure.This is a unique office, without a clear blueprint for success, so I don t know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful. Still, let me offer a few reflections from the past 8 years.First, we ve both been blessed, in different ways, with great good fortune. Not everyone is so lucky. It s up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that s willing to work hard.Second, American leadership in this world really is indispensable. It s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.Third, we are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions   like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties   that our forebears fought and bled for.

She s even called for his impeachment.Is this all she s got?She never speaks about what she s doing for the district in California that she doesn t even live in. She refuses to hear any opposing views during town halls. She has opposing voices removed so the adoring masses can rant and rave about Trump. It s truly a Banana Republic in Maxine s world. We ve reported in the past about her bizarre behavior but the best question was asked by Tucker Carlson:Maxine Waters is so filled with hate for anyone who disagrees with her, that she s decided to appoint herself as the Democrat s chief attack dog for President Trump and his administration.

But we don t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans.And if the president can interrupt his vacation for a swanky fundraiser for fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, as he did on Monday, then surely he can make time to show up for a catastrophe that s displaced thousands.Obama playing golf at Martha's Vineyard with Larry David today  Manu Raju (@mkraju) August 18, 2016These pictures of @realDonaldTrump with children at a Houston shelter are fascinating.

9993,"Banana Peel In Tree Causes Freak Out On Ole Miss Campus: ‘Hurt, frightened, and upset’","You won t believe what passes for offensive these days A BANANA PEEL! Yes, a banana peel  caused a Greek Life retreat to be cancelled at Ole Miss (University of Mississippi) Doesn t this make you wonder how these college kids will handle real life if they re triggered or offended by just about everything they come across? Wow!HERE S THE LOWDOWN ON THE OFFENDING BANANA PEEL:A Greek Life retreat at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) was promptly cancelled this weekend after a banana peel was found hanging in a tree. To be clear, many members of our community were hurt, frightened, and upset by what occurred at IMPACT,  Interim Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life Alexa Lee Arndt remarked in an email between Greek leaders, according to The Daily Mississippian.  Because of the underlying reality many students of color endure on a daily basis, the conversation manifested into a larger conversation about race relations today at the University of Mississippi. UNABLE TO FIND A TRASH CAN Apparently, student Ryan Swanson admitted to discarding the banana peel in a tree after he was unable to locate a garbage can, and it was later spotted by Alpha Kappa Alpha President Makala McNeil, who leads one of the campuses historically black sororities:She was walking with friends to their group session across camp when one of her sorority sisters pointed at a tree 15 feet away. She said that about six feet up the tree s trunk sat a lone, fresh-looking banana peel. It was so strange and surreal to see it there,  McNeil said.  We were all just sort of paranoid for a second. The totally innocent student who placed the banana peel in the tree has issued the standard cringing apology Oy vey! Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill: Although unintentional, there is no excuse for the pain that was caused to members of our community Meanwhile, Vice Chancellor for Diversity and Community Engagement Katrina Caldwell (pictured above) is  talking to people on campus who have some experience working across diversity to help the students process what happened. No doubt Katrina receives a six-digit salary perhaps this is a way to try and legitimize her HUGE salary.

9995,LOL! SHAKEDOWN ARTIST JESSE JACKSON TELLS CROWD: “President Trump Would Not Qualify To Get Into Jesus’ Kingdom” [VIDEO],"Here s a 1999 video of Jesse Jackson praising Donald Trump for his contribution to the black community, awarding him with a lifetime achievement award for African Americans:What a difference a few years (and an [R] behind your name can make:WFB   While speaking to a crowd at the  Ministers March for Justice  Rev. Jesse Jackson suggested that President Trump should be worried about gaining citizenship in heaven. Trump says you must be able to speak the language of English, [be] qualified, and have a job skill,  Jackson said Monday.  Jesus would not qualify to come in Trump s country he would not qualify to get into Jesus  kingdom. It s difficult to understand Jackson in the video below, as he mumbles through much of his commentary. (For translation, see quotes above):The  Ministers March for Justice,  was spearheaded by Rev. Al Sharpton and featured ministers from various traditions united in opposing the Trump administration. The event took place on the 54th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. s March on Washington, and Jackson did not shy away from using religious language to judge the president.After judging Trump s ability to enter heaven, he quoted part of a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus says what he will tell his followers at the Final Judgment.Is the notorious shake down artist Jesse Jackson really one to be deciding who will and who will not be given admittance to heaven? In 2006, government watchdog Judicial Watch released a report that revealed new details about the intimidation and shakedown tactics of Jesse Jackson s Rainbow Push Coalition.WND   The report,  Jesse Jackson Exposed,  claims Jackson is  an extortionist who uses his influence as a civil rights leader to essentially blackmail wealthy corporations with absurd discrimination threats. Included, the group says, are  incriminating admissions from Jackson made under oath at trial. Among the tactics highlighted in the report are:Jackson lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to block companies seeking government approval to merge until they donate money to Rainbow Push.Jackson publicly chastised Toyota for running an ad Jackson deemed  racist.  After Toyota pulled the ad, Jackson threatened a boycott the automaker to force it to launch a $7.8 million  diversity program. Jackson installed one of his friends, J.L. Armstrong, in a management position at Toyota to determine which organizations would receive $700 million in contracts awarded by Toyota.Minority businesses pay Jackson s  Trade Bureau  a fee to help extort lucrative contracts from corporations. During the trial, Jackson compared the Trade Bureau to  Noah s Ark,  claiming minority businesses and organizations had to be inside the  ark  to survive. Judicial Watch brought the lawsuit against Jackson, his son Jonathan Jackson and Rainbow Push Coalition on behalf of Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, a black minister and founder of the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Organization for a New Destiny.Peterson wrote a book titled,  Scam,  that takes Jackson to task as one of America s  self-appointed  black leaders. I don t recall the entire black race in this country taking a national vote to elect Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan, the NAACP, California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus or liberal black preachers as our leaders,  Peterson writes,  yet they ve seized the mantle of leadership and claim to speak for all blacks in this nation. Another expose of Jackson, Kenneth Timmerman s book  Shakedown: Exposing the real Jesse Jackson,  goes back several decades, including his ordination as a reverend. I describe a two to three year process for earning that title,  Timmerman said.  Jesse Jackson got himself ordained two months after Martin Luther King was shot. It was essentially a  political ordination,  a  shotgun ordination.  He did not go through the long procedure. He was not licensed to preach, as far as I could determine. I went to the church where he was ordained. He did not go through this two-year process. He never submitted himself to the authority of the church. He has never had a church himself, and he has been accountable to no one.  Timmerman asserts Jackson  is not doing things to help the black community. Jesse Jackson is   to help himself first. ",0

Jesse Jackson Proclaims That Trump ‘Would Not Qualify to Get Into Jesus’ Kingdom’,"Jesse Jackson thinks he s Heaven s gatekeeper The arrogant  reverend  proclaimed that President Trump might not qualify to enter Jesus  Kingdom.

Jesus would not qualify to come in Trump s country he would not qualify to get into Jesus  kingdom. Jackson used religion to bash Trump during the event: He quoted part of a passage from the gospel of Matthew: I was hungry, you fed me; naked, you clothed me; captive, you set me free. Jackson was referring to the fact that he believes in open borders and welcoming arms for everyone. Nice try, it s just not true that a nation can survive without borders.

Shame on him!It starts out with a statement about how horrible the white supremacists are and then goes on to discuss Congress getting back to order. It s a snoozer of an OpEd until you get to the last part In a shocking slam on President Trump s character and knowledge of government, McCain shows his bitterness towards Trump. He claims that,  We don t answer to him   but also say that,  We must respect his authority WTH!MCCAIN: IT S TIME CONGRESS RETURNS TO REGULAR ORDER: We can fight like hell for our ideas to prevail. But we have to respect each other or at least respect the fact that we need each other.That has never been truer than today, when Congress must govern with a president who has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don t answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power. And we should value our identity as members of Congress more than our partisan affiliation.I argued during the health-care debate for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts.We won t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions. And all of us in Congress have the duty, in this sharply polarized atmosphere, to defend the necessity of compromise before the American public.SEE WHAT HE DID THERE? He basically said our president is clueless and impulsive so we don t need to listen to him. Unreal! Is McCain bitter and trying to get back at Trump? It s unheard of for a sitting Senator of the party in power trashes the president that is from the same party! Read more: WaPo",0

This woman pulls the race card when confronted with her crime?Just in case you haven t heard of Sarsour:Approximately 200,000 people participated in a  Women s March  in D.C. on Saturday. One of the organizers of the march, Linda Sarsour is a Pro-Palestine Muslim activist.She also advocates for Sharia Law in America and has ties to terrorist organization, Hamas.Linda Sarsour, one of the organizers behind Saturday s Women s March, being held in Washington, D.C., was recently spotted at a large Muslim convention in Chicago posing for pictures with an accused financier for Hamas, the terrorist group.Sarsour, the head of the Arab American Association of New York and an Obama White House  Champion of Change,  was speaking at last month s 15th annual convention of the Muslim American Society and Islamic Circle of North America.While there, she posed for a picture with Salah Sarsour, a member of the Islamic Society of Milwaukee and former Hamas operative who was jailed in Israel in the 1990s because of his alleged work for the terrorist group.Though she avoids discussing it now, Sarsour has acknowledged in past interviews that she has cousins serving prison time in Israel because of their work for Hamas.Sarsour has denied having any contact with the terror group. She told The New York Times in 2012 that she would not have been appointed an Obama  Champion of Change  if she had.The activist has risen to national attention recently. She served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and she is one of four lead organizers for the Women s March.  Daily CallerThe fact that an Islamic faction was one of the organizers of the Women s March is laughable at best. Islam is responsible for the worst abuses of women and children not only throughout history, but at present day. Islamic supremacists who wish to impose Sharia law in America have infiltrated various leftist movements in order to appear as an oppressed minority.  GP",0

They care and we know it that s all that matters!Fox News reported:The White House announced Thursday that President Donald Trump pledged to donate $1 million in personal funds to Harvey relief efforts.Trump visited Corpus Christi, Texas, and Austin on Tuesday for briefings on Harvey s devastation. He praised first responders, telling everyone who has been affected by the storm that  we are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover and rebuild. First responders have been doing heroic work. Their courage & devotion has saved countless lives   they represent the very best of America! pic.twitter.com/I0gvCQLTKO  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2017On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that on his Tuesday trip to Texas he had witnessed  first hand the horror & devastation  wrought by Harvey. He wrote that after seeing the widespread damage,  my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas! He plans on returning to Texas on Saturday. VP Pence and the Second Lady Karen Pence visited the storm victims today and pitched in to clear debris. ",0
10006,LOL! Shelia Jackson Lee Declares that Houston is 50′ Below Sea Level [Video],"Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee joined Roland Martin to talk about the devastation left from Hurricane Harvey. To get a picture of what s happening in Houston the congresswoman tried to explain at the 2:20 mark that,  Many people don t know that we are 50 feet below sea level and are still flooding.  HUH??? WHAAAAT???? Yes, she opened her mouth and removed all doubt she s clueless!FACTS: SEA LEVEL = HOUSTON: Downtown Houston stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet (38 m) in elevation. Land along the Texas Gulf Coast is sinking at the rate of about 2 inches per decade, which may not seem like much.DON T FORGET THAT RACE CARD: 3:45 Martin starts to talk about the  black folks Is the storm racist now?Jackson Lee and Martin went on to pull out that race card: Houston neighborhoods have been hit, but a majority of them have been African American neighborhoods that are underwater.  That s where we keep going back to,   explained Lee.As of now, Congresswoman Lee wants to,  Make sure the President complies and keeps the promises that he made. That people can return to their lives. ",0

First graders were asked not to use the words  God ,  Jesus  or  devil  in an Indiana classroom Why? Political correctness in action Parents aren t happy about this!First graders asked not to use the words  God  or  devil  in Indiana classroom pic.twitter.com/35l4xgPv6O  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) August 31, 2017MCCORDSVILLE, Ind. (FOX59)   Parents of students at an Indiana elementary school are not happy after a first grade teacher sent home a note asking children not to talk about God, Jesus, or the Devil, FOX 59 reports.According to a statement from McCordsville Elementary School, a debate about God happened in the first grade classroom earlier in the week, so the teacher sent the letter about her expectations to parents. The section of the letter reportedly asked parents to have a talk with their children about the time and place to discuss faith.A parent submitted the letter to FOX 59, which in part reads:  With Mccordsville Elementary being a public school, we have many different religions and beliefs, and I do not want to upset a child or parent because of these words being used. A letter from the superintendent said it is okay for students to speak about their religion as long as it does not interrupt class:  Trying to limit a student s view on religion is a violation of a student s first amendment rights. However, if the discussion becomes an academic disruption, then as a district, we can intervene to maintain the integrity of the educational process while at the same time being sure to not violate a student s constitutional rights.

10010,DISCOVERED: FORMER PAKISTANI-BORN MUSLIM IT AIDE Under Investigation By FBI For Stealing Data From Congress Has ACTIVE House Email Account TIED TO MUSLIM US Rep André Carson,"A former IT aide suspected of stealing equipment and data from Congress still has an active, secret email account on the House computer system, even though he has been banned from the congressional network because of a criminal investigation into the alleged cybersecurity violations, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Imran Awan s still-active email address is linked to the name of a House staffer who specializes in intelligence and homeland security matters for Indiana Democratic Rep. Andr  Carson. Court documents and emails obtained by TheDCNF show Awan used the address 123@mail.house.gov in addition to his standard imran.awan@mail.house.gov account.He and two of his Pakistani-born brothers, as well as his wife, are at the center of an FBI investigation over their IT work with dozens of Democratic congressional offices. Authorities shut down Awan s standard email account Feb. 2, and he was arrested by the FBI at Dulles International Airport trying to board a flight to his native Pakistan on July 25.Authorities apparently did not realize Awan has a second account that is not linked to his identity. While his main email address began rejecting mail after it was shut down, the 123 address was still accepting mail Tuesday.Mail sent via Gmail fills in the name of the account-holder of 123 as Nathan Bennett, whose LinkedIn profile says his individual legislative portfolio covers  national security and foreign affairs  and includes work on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.The member Bennett works for, Andre Carson is a member of both the House Intelligence and House Homeland Security Committees, and previously employed Awan.Carson is ranking member of the House intelligence subcommittee on emerging threats, which oversees the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The subcommittee oversight extends to the National Counterterrorism Center and information-sharing programs. For entire story: Daily Caller So who is US Rep. Andre Carson, and why should we be concerned about the Pakistani born Muslim IT Aide hired by the former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz? Andre Carson is one of only two Muslims serving in Congress. The other is Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who became the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2006. Andre Carson has openly stated that American schools should be modeled after Islamic Madrassas. America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students. Watch at the 6:25 mark:Shoebat- The next time the American people are told by a U.S. member of Congress that they can t know something because it is  classified  or  still under investigation , they should point their collective finger directly at one man   Andre Carson. The reason is that Carson is not just one of the only two Muslim members of Congress; he is now a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), appointed by House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).If ever there was a committee that has been able to hide behind the claim that it can t answer a question because that answer would reveal classified information, HPSCI is such a committee.The problem isn t solely that Carson is a Muslim. It s also that he s accepted contributions from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and is tied to other Muslim Brotherhood front groups. CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) trial, which actually represents an additional problem. That problem is that it reveals another extremely fundamental flaw in the Bill Clinton strategy of treating acts of terrorism as criminal acts instead of as acts of war. ",0

10018,LOL! WATCH DEMOCRAT DINGBAT Sheila Jackson Lee Repeatedly Confuse “Hurricane Sandy” With “Sandy Hook”,"CNN s Allison Camerota started out her interview with Democrat Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee telling her that it was being pointed out that,  A whole bunch of Texas lawmakers voted against sending financial aid to the victims of Superstorm Sandy when they needed it in 2012 and 2013. Why didn t you vote at that time to help Sandy victims?   Camerota asked. Well, at the time, we helped Sandy victims. The Democrats wanted more money. We didn t get all the money we needed. Frankly, um we did vote. I did vote on the maximum money. Unfortunately, it did not pass. Why didn t you vote for H.R. 152, that was the Appropriations Act of 2013, that all sorts of Texas lawmakers voted against and you just did not vote? Why did you skip that one? As I said, I voted on legislation to help the Sandy Hook victims,  Jackson Lee responded. Camerota corrected her, Sandy superstorm, At the conclusion of the interview,  Allison Camerota took the time to clarify that Just so that we re clear, we re talking about  Superstorm Sandy, not the Sandy Hook shooting.Immediately following Camerota s clairification, Jackson Lee clarified that yes, she is complete bafoon, as she ended the interview by clarifying that she was indeed talking about the mass murder of small children in New Jersey vs. the superstorm:  Let me be clear, I voted on many votes for Sandy Hook funding. Another reporter attempted to point out that Repbulican Senator Ted Cruz voted aginst a $50 billion bill that was supposedly intended to help Sandy Superstorm victims. Unlike dingbat Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, Senator Cruz offered a legitimate reason for not supporting the bill that was filled with pork by legislators who weren t acting in the best interest of Sandy Superstorm victims. The accurate thing to say is that I and a number of others enthusiastically and emphatically supported hurricane relief for Sandy,  the senator told the MSNBC host.  The problem with that particular bill is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork it s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster when people are hurting to pay for their own political wish list.

10019,WOW! Rebel Media Finds Shocking Evidence Implicating Son of DEM APPOINTED Judge In “Hate Crime” Trump Supporter Was FALSELY Charged With [VIDEO],"Rebel Media: Attacking someone for their politics could be expected from private citizens acting out against each other, but what about government and law enforcement officials?The Rebel has investigated the case of Mark Feigin, a California Trump supporter who was wrongfully accused of and charged with an anti-Muslim hate crime.On October 19, 2016, Feigin was arrested and charged with making a  criminal threat  and  annoying phone calls  against the Islamic Center of Southern California by the Los Angeles Police Department, and then by California Attorney General Kamala Harris.LAPD officers accused Feigin of making two threatening phone calls and claimed that they had traced the phone calls back to him, later labeling the calls a hate crime against Muslims.On October 19th, 2016, Feigin s home was raided by the LAPD and his weapons were confiscated and placed on display for the media during a press conference where the California Media and LAPD were complicit in portraying Feigin as a potential mass murderer.Cmdr. Horace Frank with the Los Angeles Police Department stated in a press conference in October 2016: The male caller threatened to kill the person who answered the phone along with other members of the center because of the caller s hatred for Muslims and his belief that Muslims will destroy the United States. The Rebel has obtained new documents and evidence through police disclosure surrounding the case which proves that the first phone call made to the Islamic Center came from the phone of a different California man, Michael Slawson.Michael Slawson is the son of Democratically appointed Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Slawson.In other words, Slawson s father is a judge in the same justice system under which Feigin was charged.",0
