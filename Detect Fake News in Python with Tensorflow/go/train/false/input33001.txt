9875,John Podesta Told Cheryl Mills ‘Dump All Those Emails’ on Day News of Clinton’s Private Email Server Broke,"Trending Articles: Trending Articles: John Podesta Told Cheryl Mills ‘Dump All Those Emails’ on Day News of Clinton’s Private Email Server Broke   Source: Jay Syrmopoulos 
Washington, D.C. – In what could prove to be the proverbial nail in the coffin of Hillary Clinton’s presidential ambitions, an email released by WikiLeaks this morning – the 25th batch of emails from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta – reveals potential criminal intent to violate a court order for subpoenaed documents. 
John Podesta sent the message only hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton might have violated federal records requirements by using the server, according to the latest batch of Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks. 
The email in question , sent by Podesta on March 2, 2015, reveals the Clinton campaign chair directing Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s attorney and Chief of Staff, to destroy emails that had already been subpoenaed. 
The email exchange between Podesta and Mills came suspiciously on the same day that news broke regarding Clinton’s use of a private email server. 
After news of Clinton’s private email server became public, Podesta wrote to Mills: 
“Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later,” Podesta told Mills. 
Mills responded: “Think you just got your new nick name.” 
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out exactly what Podesta meant by “dump” the emails, when taking into account the fact that this was transpiring just as news of the private server was breaking. What this email does is provide insight into the coverup process — and exposes a willful intent to break the law. Additionally, it reveals exactly how swiftly the Clinton camp moved to obscure the truth from both investigators and the public alike. 
According to a report by the New York Post : 
In December 2014, Hillary Clinton — now the Democratic presidential nominee — turned over about 55,000 pages of work-related email to the State Department, but that fact wasn’t revealed until the Times reported on her use of the private server. 
On March 10, 2015 — a week after the Podesta-Mills exchange — Clinton addressed the email scandal, and announced she had deleted about 30,000 personal emails. 
The email’s reference to “Lanny” is likely in reference to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to then-President Bill Clinton, as well as spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters regarding campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues. 
Interestingly, Zero Hedge reports that a search for Lanny Davis reveals a suspicious exchange between Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the above mentioned exchange in which Mook tells Podesta: 
“We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can’t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.” 
Hillary’s team was apparently upset that Bill Clinton’s special counsel was engaging in a transparent course of action, and moved to “zap Lanny out of our universe.” 
While it isn’t clearly spelled out exactly which emails Podesta is referring to in his email, the fact that he wrote “better do so sooner than later,” on the day news broke publicly regarding Clinton’s email server, strongly indicates that the actions were a responsive measure meant to obscure any investigation into the matter. 
Clinton’s entire narrative regarding her private email server has seemingly unraveled, and her methodical plan to strategically impede the State Department/FBI investigation, by deleting the evidence, is now on full display for the public to see. 
Hopefully WikiLeaks’ next upcoming Podesta email dumps can provide even further context to this already damning email. Of course, Hillary’s spin doctors are hard at work thinking up a new narrative to work around this latest revelation regarding the willful attempt by Clinton’s team to usurp a federal investigation.

9876,1984 Unfolding as Public Surveillance Technologies Deployed Without Consent,"Waking Times 
We are fast approaching an era when humanity will be subjugated by a technological tyranny managed by an untouchable organization of elites, bureaucrats and paid public minders hired to monitor our behaviors, emotions and thoughts. In an environment like this, law and justice will be meaningless, as the tools of a technocracy can used to enforce the policies and whims of whoever monitors us, whether it be corporate employees, criminals, or abusive state actors. 
Recent developments and roll-outs of advanced facial recognition technology are a hint of the coming ubiquitousness in using biometric, face-scanning, emotion-reading, all-seeing technology to govern every detail of daily life. Consider the following developments: It was recently reported that around half of Americans are already in police facial recognition databases, the vast majority having never been even accused of committing a crime or consenting to being included in the database. [ Source ] Increasingly, facial recognition is being used to scan concert and festival goers creating permanent databases of partiers. [ Source ] An experimental town in China is now using facial recognition to grant citizens entry. [ Source ] Facial recognition is now capable of reading human emotions, opening the door to a new world of possibility in pre-crime detection. [ Source ] The TSA is using emotion reading facial recognition technology to determine if a traveler is to be treated as a threat. [ Source ] Police nationwide are using the controversial Stingray system which allows them to listen to anyone’s cell phone conversations. [ Source ] California police are already using a computer system called ‘Beware’ to predict crime and preemptively stop it. [ Source] Microsoft recently conducted a major test during the 2016 Republican and Democratic conventions, using emotion reading facial recognition technology to survey the crowd for threats. [ Source ] A Russian software developer has released an App that allows you to turn your smart phone into a facial recognition device. [ Source ] Some U.S. churches are using a consumer version of facial recognition to keep tabs on who is in attendance for Sunday service. [ Source ] Facial recognition, finger-print reading, and iris scanning is now being included in consumer technologies. [ Source ] 
The justification for using this technology against a public who is never given the opportunity to consent or to op-out is, as always, public safety, as police and government agencies claim the technology is needed to spot criminal elements, gang members and other threats to the public. Here, a quote from George Orwell offers a glimpse of what the inevitable outcome of this is: 
“It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: FACECRIME, it was called.”– 1984 , George Orwell 
Here, RT discusses how Microsoft used emotion reading facial recognition technology at political conventions and how some are resisting the way this technology is being introduced into our society. Final Thoughts 
Privacy and anonymity are the enemies of the state, and it is being destroyed without our consent by both government and corporations who are deploying technology with no consideration of the human consequences. The possibilities for a techno-totalitarian future are grim, but without awareness and without motivation to resist, it is all but a forgone conclusion. 
Orwell himself warned us of how this dark vision would force itself into fruition unless we stood against it. At the end of his life he even gave us this final warning. Are you listening?   Isaac Davis . About the Author

9878,’White Devils’: Muhammad Ali’s Racist Mosque Speeches Revealed - Breitbart,"FBI files detailing speeches delivered by heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in American mosques in the 1960s show a different, more racist and radical face of the famed sportsman. The speeches feature Ali calling whites “crackers” and “white devils,” and telling black congregants that blacks want to be segregated from whites. [The speeches, which were released after a Freedom of Information Act request by Washington watchdog group Judicial Watch, revealed that Ali had far more radical views about race than his more benign public persona might have led people to believe.  Not only did Ali thunder that the 1964 civil rights act was a “swindle” on blacks, he also went on to excoriate whites, calling them “  devil white people,” and insisting that “the   Negro is the original man and is superior to the white devil. ” The FBI files show that Ali told a crowd at a Washington D. C. mosque that he preferred “dying outright” or going to jail than going into the U. S. Army. In another speech delivered at a Cleveland mosque, Ali said the American flag “represented death and destruction,” but the   “Muslim flag” represents “life and prosperity, justice for all black men. ” According to the FBI reports, the groups Ali spoke to were congregations of the Nation of Islam, an extremist hate group the FBI defined as an “    organization which espouses a line of violent hatred of the white race, Government, law and law enforcement. ” The Nation of Islam is highly   and teaches its followers that whites will all be killed in a coming “War of Armageddon. ” The   heavyweight champion, who passed away in June of 2016 after a lengthy battle with Parkinson’s syndrome, is today portrayed as a courageous crusader for equal rights as well as one of America’s most celebrated sportsmen. But, his   speeches reveal a figure steeped in hate and racist proclamations. Ali’s family recently started a new civil rights campaign to fight   sentiment and have used their famed father’s legacy as a basis to push their effort. Their “Step into the Ring” campaign began after Ali’s son, Muhammad Ali, Jr. was briefly detained at a Florida airport. The boxer’s namesake son said he was racially and religiously profiled by airport authorities. But, the files now reluctantly released by the FBI paint a far more radical Muhammad Ali than his publicly accepted reputation.

9880,"After Losing a Foster Child, Contemplating Another - The New York Times","He’s sitting on a couch with his brothers, presumably in the home in which he’s now growing up. The photo has a graininess to it that is reminiscent of photos from the 1980s, but this picture is much more recent than that. It’s the first visual I’ve had of my former foster son since I hugged him goodbye. The boy we nicknamed “BlueJay” lived with us for almost a year when extended family members stepped forward to take custody of him and his two brothers back in March. In the series Foster Parent Diary, I wrote about the experience of loving and losing him. Now, I zoom in and out of this photo, studying every blurry detail. I know he was 4 years old when the photo was taken, the same age he was when he left our home, but he looks so much older. I can see how his legs are longer, his shoulders broader. His biological mother sent me the picture. She and I have remained in contact since he left. As far as I know, it is the only photo she has received since her son went to live in a home several hours away from her. The updates she gets and passes along to me are sporadic and superficial. I’m not sure even she really knows how he is doing. I dream about him. In my dreams, he’s always a little bit older with slightly more chiseled features. Sometimes he remembers me, sometimes he doesn’t. Sometimes he runs into my arms, sometimes he runs from them. On the days when he remembers me, when I pull him in for a tight hug and he asks me where I’ve been, it feels so real that I wake up with an irrational hope that he had the same dream, too. That maybe we’d found a way to cross the distance between us, just for a moment. My son, Ryan, who is now 6 years old, recently asked me if we could call his former foster brother one day to talk to him, to tell him we miss him. “I’m sorry, buddy, we can’t,” I said. “But why?” But why. It is the central question I have struggled with over the past 10 months. Why couldn’t we stay in his life? Why couldn’t we send him a new outfit for school or call him to wish him a happy birthday when he recently turned 5? Why couldn’t we continue to offer him our love from afar? We couldn’t because his relatives didn’t want us to. They didn’t see the point of it, the value in it. They wanted a clean break. A lot of time has passed since our foster son left. We talk about him more with smiles now than with tears. We’ve given ourselves the time and space needed to figure out whether the hole in our lives is one that only he was meant to fill or whether our family is still incomplete. Finally, we are starting to feel ready. My husband, Mike, and I are preparing, once again, for foster care adoption. We’re being more cautious and more deliberate this time. This time, we are moving slowly. This time, we are more educated and less exuberant. We are setting new parameters. We will consider only children who are legally free for adoption or as close to it as possible. We will not be called one day and asked to pick up a child in need of an immediate, temporary home. This time, we will be matched with a child who may have been waiting for a permanent family for as long as we’ve been waiting to complete ours. Realistically, that probably means a child Ryan’s age or older. There will be fliers with pictures and stacks of files and the child’s own opinions to consider. Caring for a child for almost a year and then being given less than 24 hours to pack him up and say a permanent goodbye changes a person. It strips you of your naïveté. It inflicts a sense of loss that cuts deep. It can harden you with cynicism, sadness and fear, if you let it. Our former foster son looks different in the photo. He is not smiling. He’s staring into the camera with a blank look I don’t recognize on him. He doesn’t look like the happy, spunky little boy I knew. He looks more like how I felt for months after he left: Dazed. The longer I stare at the photo, the more I wish I’d never seen it. Then again, it’s just one picture. One moment out of a billion moments in his lifetime. How could one picture be a fair representation of his current life? Maybe he was tired or bored or cranky when it was taken. Maybe, overall, things are going great for him. Do I have a real reason to believe otherwise? All I have is one picture. We can choose the cynicism, the sadness and the fear, or we can choose hope. We can shrivel up into a hardened ball, or we can pick ourselves up, dust off our arms, shake out our hair and press forward. We can acknowledge our own heartache for what it was: The inevitable result of fully loving a child who was never really ours. There was no mistake in that. We can let go of our worry and instead, believe in him. Believe that he’s strong enough to overcome the hardships of his early life, strong enough to thrive. We can allow ourselves to hope the final piece of our family’s puzzle is still out there. We can close our eyes, take a deep breath, center ourselves. And then we can go in search of that piece.",0
9881,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Ages 68 and 70, Share Few Health Details - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have been more secretive and selective than many recent presidential nominees in providing    details about their personal health  —   a particularly striking departure, experts say, given the candidates’ age. No American election has ever featured two   nominees as old as Mr. Trump, 70, and Mrs. Clinton, 68, and they have kept a grueling pace for more than a year. Yet they have declined to share the latest information about their health or to make their doctors available for interviews. Each released a brief medical statement in 2015 neither has added to it since. Mr. Trump has been especially unforthcoming, even as he has sought to turn health into an issue in the presidential race, questioning Mrs. Clinton’s “physical and mental strength and stamina” as his allies push unfounded rumors that she is ill. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said Monday that he would have “no problem releasing additional records” about his health if Mrs. Clinton did the same. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton, who has released more details than Mr. Trump, said the onus was on him to match her disclosures. Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Mitt Romney have released details in the months before Election Day or directed their doctors to field questions. John McCain allowed some reporters to review more than 1, 100 pages of his medical records. Among Democratic nominees, Al Gore and John Kerry spoke openly about their health Mr. Kerry had survived prostate cancer. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were more reticent: Their aides argued that the two were young men with no health problems, though Mr. Clinton granted an interview on his health in 1996 under pressure from his Republican opponent, Bob Dole. Mr. Trump, who regularly eats fast food and says he does not sleep much or take long vacations, has provided only a   statement from his gastroenterologist last December. It contained no details about his heart rate, respiratory rate, cholesterol level, past medications or family medical history. It did include several laudatory declarations, describing Mr. Trump’s blood pressure ( ) and laboratory test results as “astonishingly excellent. ” The doctor, Harold N. Bornstein of Manhattan, concluded that Mr. Trump, if victorious, “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency”  —   a claim that was widely mocked as unprovable and unscientific. Mrs. Clinton issued a significantly more detailed   letter from her physician in July 2015 that included information about a concussion Mrs. Clinton suffered in 2012, which left her with a blood clot in her head and double vision. Her doctor, Lisa Bardack of Mount Kisco, N. Y. said those symptoms were resolved within two months. Mr. Clinton, however, has said that Mrs. Clinton “required six months of very serious work to get over” the concussion  —   a statement that helped feed conspiracy theories among Republicans that Mrs. Clinton’s concussion was worse than disclosed, though there is no medical evidence to support that conclusion. Doctors and medical experts said they had rarely seen so few details or updated information about the health of presidential nominees. “Voters deserve far more information from Clinton and Trump about their health than we have now,” said Dr. Burton Lee, who was the elder George Bush’s personal physician during his four years as president. “The public has a right to know, but you just don’t have transparency with these two candidates on much of anything. That’s a given. ” Lawrence O. Gostin, a lawyer on the faculty of medicine at Georgetown, said Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump had both fallen short of releasing    medical information, which he described as “extremely important,” given their age. “A person’s fitness, particularly at an older age, can change very quickly, and the rigors of a campaign  —   all the speeches, travel, long days and nights  —   can take a toll on your health as well,” said Mr. Gostin, who worked with Mrs. Clinton on her health insurance overhaul effort in 1993 and 1994. “The campaign is a kind of trial run on a patient’s ability to serve as president, so the public deserves details on their health after a year of running. ” Mr. Gostin, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said he was not implying that she had any health problems. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton said Monday that she had provided sufficient information about her personal health in the 2015 statement and had no plans to release more, though they pointed to remarks last week by Dr. Bardack reiterating that Mrs. Clinton “is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States. ” The statement last week was a response to fake documents, purportedly by Dr. Bardack, claiming that Mrs. Clinton had suffered seizures and memory loss after her concussion. Her advisers pushed back forcefully when asked if Mrs. Clinton or her doctor would give an interview about her health, arguing that the 2015 statement disclosed far more details about past examinations, vital signs and incidents like Mrs. Clinton’s concussion than Mr. Trump’s medical summary last year. “Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in the race who has met the standard expected of presidential candidates,” said Glen Caplin, a Clinton spokesman. “Donald Trump needs to produce a real doctor’s letter, written by a credible doctor, that details the state of his health for voters. ” Trump campaign advisers said Mr. Trump had no plans to grant interviews about his health, insisting that his age was not an issue. They said he was in good shape, disputing the opinion of some friends of Mr. Trump that he has gained weight recently. The Trump campaign declined a request for an interview with Dr. Bornstein. For much of American history, presidents and candidates were secretive about their health. Woodrow Wilson suffered a severe stroke in 1919 that largely incapacitated him, a condition that he and his advisers hid for a time. Franklin D. Roosevelt was rarely photographed in his wheelchair, and John F. Kennedy’s chronic back pain and regimen of medications were concealed. Mental health issues emerged as a liability, too: Thomas F. Eagleton gave up the 1972 Democratic   nomination after acknowledging his past electroconvulsive therapy for depression. But since Reagan’s nomination in 1980 at age 69  —   then the oldest   nominee to date  —   candidates’ medical histories have been routinely disclosed and scrutinized. Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist, recalled that Lloyd Bentsen, the 1988   nominee, provided extensive details about his health “because he was 67, which was considered quite old at the time. ” “I think health transparency is important and candidates have to take that responsibility seriously,” Mr. Devine said. “As transparency goes, Trump’s   statement is preposterous. ” Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser to Mr. McCain in 2008, said most presidential campaigns want to disclose as little as possible while providing enough information to claim to be transparent. But he suggested that the balance should tilt toward more disclosure this year. “You have two candidates around 70 years old, and while it hasn’t happened since 1974, you’ve had many vice presidents succeed to the office of the presidency,” Mr. Schmidt said. “When you have candidates at their ages, the disclosure should be on the burdensome side. ”",0
9882,Kremlin: NATO was Created for Agression,"Kremlin: NATO was Created for Agression 11/07/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Reports of the new reinforcement of NATO troops close to Russia’s borders show “the aggressive character of the organization,” the Kremlin has said, commenting on recently announced preparations to deter an alleged Russian threat. 
The Western military alliance was established “ not for peace-building, but exactly for aggressive actions ,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Despite the fact that blocs which opposed NATO no longer exist, it’s impossible to change the alliance’s “ aggressive nature ” due to its ideological and political bases. 
Earlier on Monday, the Times published a report suggesting that “ hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be put on a higher state of alert amid growing tensions with Russia .” According to the British daily – which cites the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the UK’s outgoing permanent representative to the bloc, Adam Thomson – NATO aims to largely speed up the time its troops can be deployed. 
It reportedly aims to have up to 300,000 military personnel from nations across the alliance at the ready, having shortened their response time to about two months, compared to the current 180 days. 
“ We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War ,” Stoltenberg told the Times . The bloc is looking into how more of its 3 million personnel “ can be ready on a shorter notice ,” he added, saying that NATO defense ministers have already had discussions on the issue. 
Having accused Moscow of “ assertive ” behavior, the NATO chief said Russia had increased its defense spending and was “ developing new military capabilities .” 
“ In regard to its national security, Russia acts within its national borders, undoubtedly posing no threat to anyone ,” Peskov said, commenting on Stoltenberg’s statements. The way the military bloc has reacted “ once again shows the organization’s aggressive nature ,” he added.",0

9884,OpEds | Eric Zuesse: 34 Reasons This Bernie Voter Will Vote Trump,"“Why I Won’t Vote for Hillary Clinton | Evan Edinger” (but then he changes his mind on that) TO CLOSE : Evan Edlinger will vote for Hillary against Trump because he thinks that whereas Hillary’s actual track-record of policies (not mere statements) in public office have been horrific, Trump’s bad statements and lack of any track-record in public office at all, make Trump even worse. That’s what he thinks. I think it makes Trump better — the better choice — as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official, Hillary Clinton. Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a person’s private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying — and that’s Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official. Trump has no record at all as a public official. Edlinger at 1:30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for Hillary,”There’s always one thing that comes in the way, and that’s trust.” He says he doesn’t trust her — but what he doesn’t actually “trust” is her words; when he says he’ll vote for her, he’s simply ignoring her actions, he’s ignoring the real person-as-a-public-official, the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever. Proven selfishness in one’s private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in one’s public-office policies (such as “We came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!” ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my “I’m a Bernie Sanders Voter: Here’s Why I’ll Vote Trump” , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he won’t, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors . About the author Investigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author, most recently, of They’re Not Even Close: The Democratic vs. Republican Economic Records , 1910-2010, and of CHRIST’S VENTRILOQUISTS: The Event that Created Christianity . NOTE: The Greanville Post editors have a clear position on this so-called election: If you MUST vote, vote Green, for the Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka ticket, as a PROTEST VOTE. If that is not possible in your area, do not bother to vote, as all votes serve to legitimate a fraudulent process and the ongoing reign of the corporate/military/media complex. =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

In a newly released audio recording, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi expressed confidence that his forces would succeed in defending Mosul from an ongoing offensive by what he referred to as “enemies of God.,” saying he is convinced this is the prelude to victory. 
Mosul is ISIS’ largest city, with the metro area home to about 1.5 million people. It is their last major city within Iraqi territory, and the US has presented their imminent defeat in the city as spelling the effective end to the ISIS caliphate. 
Baghdadi insisted there could be no surrender in the fight, a statement which is literally true since the US has insisted they intend to kill every ISIS fighter who attempts to flee the city with airstrikes Baghdadi suggested there would be retaliatory suicide attacks abroad that would wreak havoc on “unbelievers,” and “make their blood flow as rivers.” 
The Pentagon, always upbeat about wars everywhere, said Baghdadi’s confident statement proved he is losing control of ISIS in general, and that he was desperately trying to prevent infighting, adding “we don’t believe it is going to work.” Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
9887,Sharapova becomes UN Ambassador for global drug runners!,"Thursday, 10 November 2016 Maria Sharapova is returning between the ""white lines"" as an ambassador for drug runners! 
Banned ex-tennis star and super grunt-er, Maria Sharapova, has been elected by the UN to represent a growing number of illegals whose extremely difficult and dangerous job it is supplying the world's drug consumers with fresh lines of produce. 
The UN feels that ""super-grunter"" Sharapova has the necessary qualifications and experience to help Drug Runners breach frontiers, smuggle illegal drugs into all of the major global drug consuming cities, and be of assistance to top runners by keeping up their fitness levels (a necessary weapon in their armory whilst running from the cops!). 
Maria will even have her own ban shortened by six-months because the UN feel that after yesterday's US election of Trump, life could become even harder for drug-runners, especially the Mexican ones. 
Sharapova has also been studying the life of Pablo Escobar, Colombian gold medalist in drug-running, hoping to gain an insight into the minds and pockets of major drug-runners. In addition, her own personal runners have given inside tips and the UN are most happy with their new ambassador. 
Donald Trump, president-elect, refused to comment on Maria's new status, but did mention the fact that forgotten, ageing, German soccer-star, Bastian Schweinsteiger's wife, Ana Ivanoviç, has the most beautiful rear-end he ever had the pleasure to smack his racket on!

It was a standard day in the life of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, as the Republican nominee spent much of his time on the campaign trail Thursday making outrageous and insulting comments. 
This was on clear display at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, when Trump proposed one of his most ridiculous ideas yet: Cancel the election and just anoint him president. 
Video: Trump jokes: “We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad!” pic.twitter.com/Stz46iDbpf 
— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 27, 2016 
“I’m just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right?” Trump asked the crowd. “What are we even having it for? … Her policies are so bad.” 
Despite Trump’s plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls, it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies – thankfully. 
The remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which Trump claimed the process is rigged against him, and he will only accept the outcome of the election if it’s favorable for him. 
But Trump wasn’t done at his Buckeye State rally. He also made sure to take a dig at minority communities. 
Video: Help me out there. Did Trump just say “we’re going to work on our ghettos” before mentioning inner cities, violence and African Americans? pic.twitter.com/v9KqZSLbh6 
— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 27, 2016 
Trump’s comments: 
We’re gonna work on our ghettos … take a look at what’s going on where you have pockets of, areas of land, where you have the inner cities, and you have so many things, so many problems, so many horrible, horrible problems – the violence, the death, the lack of education, no jobs. We’re gonna work with the African-American community and we’re going to solve the problem of the inner city … You can’t walk out the street. You buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. 
The Republican nominee’s “ghetto” comment is the newest addition to what is the standard Trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes. This particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited North Carolina for a rally and told supporters – mostly white – that he would enact “a new deal for black America.” 
In the closing days of this election, Donald Trump is once again showing that there is no better version of who he is. The man who built a campaign on racial resentment is doubling down on it as this election season comes to a conclusion.",0
9889,"Donald Trump Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On First Full Day In Office As President","NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Donald Trump Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On First Full Day In Office As President On May 14, 2018, Israel will have been officially regathered, in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, for exactly 70 years. In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. by Geoffrey Grider November 3, 2016 God likes to orchestrate events relating to Israel around the number 70 
“In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.” Daniel 9:2 (KJV) 
People, you better buckle up because things are about to become unglued. For well over a year now, we here at NTEB have been telling you that Donald Trump is God’s man for the White House, and that Bible prophecy would be fulfilled in the process. Two very eye-opening articles you need to read are The Real Reason Why Donald Trump Was Chosen To Be The Republican Candidate For President and Why A Bible Believer Is Supporting Donald Trump For President Of The United States . I wrote those articles on May 4 and February 13, respectively. Israel in general and Jerusalem in particular are God’s time clock for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy 
On our Sunday night radio show , which you can access here , we talked about Donald Trump, Bible prophecy and the coming global shaking. And believe me when I tell you it’s coming. In the 9th chapter of Daniel we see that he finally understands what Israel’s Babylonian captivity is all about by reading the prophecy Jeremiah had written. That was Daniel’s “a-ha!” moment. 
“And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years . And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.” Jeremiah 25:11,12 (KJV) 
After digesting that bombshell , Daniel is then visited by the angel Gabriel who gives Daniel his own shocking prophecy of the Seventy Weeks Of Years. All of that prophecy has been fulfilled except the last week, or 7 year period, known as the time of Jacob’s trouble as found in the book of Jeremiah and mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24 as the time of “great tribulation”. 
“Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.” Jeremiah 30:7 (KJV) 
“For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” Matthew 24:21 (KJV) 
On May 14, 2018, Israel will have been officially regathered , in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, for exactly 70 years. In 70 AD, Israel was destroyed by the Romans and the Temple stones toppled to the ground exactly as Jesus said it would happen. When you subtract 70 AD from 2018 AD, where does that leave you? It leaves you square in 1948 AD. Please pause here and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14, 2016. Moving forward another seven months brings you to Jan. 14, 2017, and moving forward another seven days brings you to Jan. 21, 2017. This is happening in the year 5777 according to the Jewish calendar. 
And if Donald Trump wins the election , Jan. 21 will be his first full day in office. Of course Trump would be inaugurated on Jan. 20, but he would only be president for part of that day. So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, seven months and seven days old on his first full day as president of the United States . Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
All this brings us to our last point, and here it is. One of the many campaign promises that Donald Trump has made is that he will move the US Embassy in Israel from its current location in Tel Aviv, to its new location in Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 . By doing that, the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and thus set off the Psalm 83 War as found in the Bible. 
“They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:” Psalm 83:4,5 (KJV) 
For it is Jerusalem, what the Bible calls the “apple of God’s eye”, that the real battle will be fought over. Why do you think that the Palestinians have always rejected the so-called Two State Solution? Because that solution calls for Jerusalem and the Temple Mount to stay with Israel, and the Muslims will not stand for that. They want Jerusalem for the same reason that the Antichrist fights the Battle of Armageddon for it. Because Jerusalem is where Jesus returns to, and where He will rule from for a thousand years. Jerusalem is the reason for all the conflict, all the fighting, all the past wars, and the coming war. 
“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.” Zechariah 12:2,3 (KJV) 
This election is going to usher in a time of amazing fulfillment of Bible prophecy. It is no coincidence of any kind that Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office. It is not luck, fortune, happenstance or karma that he beat his 16 competitors for the nomination. As I have said for over a year now, Donald Trump is God’s man for “such a time as this”, and that we are living in the days of visible fulfillment of Bible prophecy. 
As we started our radio show on this topic on this past Sunday night, do you know what the headline story on the Jerusalem Post website was? It was this: Ivanka Trump says her father will move US embassy to Jerusalem ‘100%’ if elected 
If Donald Trump becomes President on Tuesday , as I believe with all my heart he will, then you better start thinking about the time of Jacob’s trouble beginning sometime on or around May of 2018. That means the Rapture of the Church will have to happen before that. Please pause here as well, and allow that thought to sink in for a moment. 
Are YOU ready for what comes next? Because, brothers and sisters, it sure looks like it’s coming.

9891,Training Your Brain So That You Don’t Need Reading Glasses - The New York Times,"By middle age, the lenses in your eyes harden, becoming less flexible. Your eye muscles increasingly struggle to bend them to focus on this print. But a new form of training  —   brain retraining, really  —   may delay the inevitable   loss of   visual focus so that you won’t need reading glasses. Various studies say it works, though no treatment of any kind works for everybody. The increasing difficulty of reading small print that begins in middle age is called presbyopia, from the Greek words for “old man” and “eye. ” It’s exceedingly common, and despite the Greek etymology, women experience it, too. Every five years, the average adult over 30 loses the ability to see another line on the eye reading charts used in eye doctors’ offices. By 45, presbyopia affects an estimated 83 percent of adults in North America. Over age 50, it’s nearly universal. It’s why my   friends are getting fitted for bifocals or graduated lenses. There are holdouts, of course, who view their cellphones and newspapers at arm’s length to make out the words. The decline in vision is inconvenient, but it’s also dangerous,  causing falls and auto accidents. Bifocals or graduated lenses can help those with presbyopia read, but they also contribute to falls and accidents because they can impair contrast sensitivity (the ability to distinguish between shades of gray) and depth perception. I’m 45. I don’t need to correct my vision for presbyopia yet, but I can tell it’s coming. I can still read the The New York Times print edition with ease, but to read text in somewhat smaller fonts, I have to strain. Any year now, I figured my eye doctor would tell me it was time to talk about bifocals. Or so I thought. Then I undertook a monthslong, strenuous regimen designed to train my brain to correct for what my eye muscles no longer can manage. The approach has been reported in the news media, and perhaps you’ve heard of it. It’s based on perceptual learning, the improvement of visual performance as a result of demanding training on specific images. Some experts have expressed skepticism that it can work, but a number of studies provide evidence that it can improve visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and reading speed. The training involves looking at images called “Gabor patches” in various conditions. Gabor patches optimally stimulate the part of the brain responsible for vision. A great deal of the training involves trying to see Gabor patches placed between closely spaced, distracting flankers. In training, the flanker spacing is varied, the target contrast is turned way down, and the images are flashed on a screen for fractions of a second  —   to the point that one can barely see the target. Do this and similar exercises hundreds of times over multiple sessions weekly continue for months and, gradually, presbyopia lessens, a number of studies show. One study also examined functions of the eye itself and found none of these improvements were because of changes in the eye. They’re all in the brain. Various smartphone apps say they offer this kind of   training I used one called GlassesOff, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies. Perceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called “lazy eye,” which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness). It should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible. One study published in Psychological Science trained 16   adults and 16 older adults (around age 71) with Gabor patch exercises for 1. 5 hours per day for seven days. After training, the older adults’ ability to see   images improved to the level that the   ones had before training. Scientists don’t know exactly how perceptual learning relieves presbyopia, but they have some clues based on how our brain processes visual information. After first taking in “raw data” of an image through the eye, different sets of neurons in the brain process it as separate features like edges and colors. Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word. Once they do so, we’re taking in more information from whatever the eyes focus on next. If we haven’t yet processed the prior set of information, we can’t understand it. Visual processing time is challenged and slowed by noisy images, low contrast or closely spaced information (like small fonts). There is a bottleneck in the brain as it attempts to build and then comprehend the image. Therefore, enhancing and speeding up the ability to process image components  —   through perceptual learning  —   improves a wide range of vision functions. What’s surprising is that this is possible in adult brains. Neuroplasticity  —   the ability of the brain’s processing functions to change to acquire new skills  —   is most strongly associated with childhood. It’s still more pronounced in children than adults, but for some skills, including vision, the brain is more malleable than once thought. The training with GlassesOff is long and challenging. I found it fun initially, perhaps because it was new. But weeks into it, I began to dread the monotonous labor. Yet, after a couple of months, the app reports I can read fonts nearly one third the size I could when I started and much more rapidly. According to feedback from GlassesOff, my vision after training is equivalent to a man about 10 years younger than my age. If I reach 50  —   the age at which almost everyone needs corrective lenses to read  —   and still don’t need reading glasses, I may conclude that the training has paid off. As apps go, GlassesOff is not cheap. I paid $24. 99 for three months of use  —   long enough to get me through the initial program. Upon completion, I was invited to pay another $59. 99 per year for maintenance training. It’s a nice option, but the hard work and price probably mean that the bifocals market will remain strong.",0
9892,States Vie to Shield the Wealth of the 1 Percent - The New York Times,"LAS VEGAS  —   Steven J. Oshins, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in estate planning, has never met the wealthy software entrepreneur Dan Kloiber, but he is nonetheless intensely interested in Mr. Kloiber’s contentious divorce. “I have had a Google news alert on that for a couple years,” Mr. Oshins said as he discussed the case from his office in a squat pink complex about a   drive from the Las Vegas Strip. What animates Mr. Oshins is not the juicy marital feud, but the legal arcana governing a trust in Delaware where the Kloiber family parked assets worth hundreds of million of dollars, sheltered from estate taxes. Mr. Oshins, with a gleeful grin spreading across his face, relished the thought of the    Mrs. Kloiber busting through the trust and exposing a potential chink in  the formidable trust protection armor promised by Delaware  —   which just happens to fiercely compete with Nevada for the lucrative business of shielding assets owned by the superrich. Although most    visitors are drawn to the city’s roulette wheels and slot machines, Mr. Oshins and a battalion of tax lawyers, accountants, advisers, trust administrators and bankers cater to an elite clientele that insists on a much more reliable way to build a fortune. With their backing, Nevada has stoked an aggressive rivalry among a smattering of states to babysit the wealth of the nation’s top 1 percent, pressing public officials to pass laws, streamline regulations, lower fees and replace D. M. V.  service with concierge treatment. Yet even as more and more states seek ways to help the richest Americans protect their wealth from creditors, divorcing spouses and children, as well as some federal and state tax collectors, critics worry that the effort to attract the lucrative trust business is turning into a competitive game of giveaway. “There is no doubt that many, many jurisdictions are committed to being at the bottom,” said Edward McCaffrey, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. “I think the real question now is: ‘Where is the bottom? ’” The federal government leaves it to each state to draw up its own trust laws, and several have tried to go as far as they can without inciting accusations that they are abetting tax evasion or hiding assets, he said. But in pushing the envelope, they can also run into challenges from courts in other states, including the Kloibers’ home of Kentucky, that have different statutes governing trusts. The clear leaders are Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota and Alaska, but other states have also joined the frenzy. New Hampshire, Wyoming, Tennessee and Ohio all hope to dip a spoon in the    pot of cream that had traditionally been preserved in offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands. Over the last decade, for example, New Hampshire has passed nearly a dozen laws affecting trusts that expanded their life span, lowered taxes and made it easier to transfer assets. In 2013, the state created a special trust court subdivision to handle the complex litigation last year, an overhaul of state banking laws simplified regulations. Still, Nevada “is definitely the most aggressive in my experience in terms of asset protection,” Mr. McCaffrey said. Starting with the absence of any state income tax and resilient secrecy protections, Nevada has added a passel of laws and regulations intended to lure trust business. Individuals who establish   irrevocable trusts have more flexibility to transfer assets to a new trust with more favorable terms. Creditors are blocked from access to money held in trusts (making the arrangement also popular among doctors, who worry a malpractice case could bankrupt them). And what are known as dynasty trusts allow the wealthy to pass their fortunes from generation to generation for hundreds of years without paying estate taxes. Defenders of the industry won what was characterized as a “do or die” battle in 2013, fending off legislation that would have opened up Nevada trusts to future claims from spouses and domestic partners for property settlements, alimony or child support. And Nevada has only a narrow   window for creditors to make a claim against a trust’s assets. These sorts of loopholes have been criticized by some legal scholars as “not morally defensible,” but defenders dismissed the potential for abuse. “It’s against the law in this state to conceal assets from legitimate creditors,” said Mark A. Hutchison, Nevada’s Republican lieutenant governor, a lawyer himself. “We’ve got to be aware of phantom threats that could blow up our industry,” he added. Phantom threats, he said, include recent suspicions  —   after the leak of the Panama Papers  —   that citizens and foreigners are illegally hiding assets in the state. Private documents from the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed that the firm had incorporated more than a thousand shell companies in Nevada and Wyoming to hide the real owners’ identities. There are sometimes legitimate reasons individuals and businesses want to conceal their identities, but the papers suggested that evading taxes was often the purpose. Other documents tied the shell companies to corruption scandals in Brazil, Argentina and officials at FIFA, the soccer’s world governing body. If the revelations were a source of embarrassment, however, they were also a source of free worldwide publicity. “It’s actually helped us, believe it or not,” said Greg Crawford, president of the Alliance Trust Company in Reno, explaining that Nevada was not as well known internationally for its   policies as Delaware. “I’ve had more calls from people overseas, established families, who are interested in Nevada. ” Mr. Crawford disputed the idea that the state’s rules were abetting criminal activities. “The honest, ethical taxpaying people around the world who simply want privacy are happy to put assets in the United States,” he said. “Crooks know they can be confiscated, so it actually serves as a   process. ” Monitoring development in other states and bulking up asset protection laws, said Mr. Hutchison, the lieutenant governor, has dependable bipartisan support. “The trust business is a big business,” he added. “We’ve always viewed it as a way to stimulate the economy. ” Although trusts generate little public revenue or direct investment in the state, they do provide a steady stream of work for those in the industry. Supporters also say they generate indirect investment by drawing wealthy people who spend money and might invest later on. Robert H. Sitkoff, a Harvard Law School professor, said that in   states like Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Alaska, trust and estate lawyers “are an effective and important lobby in a way that would be much harder to replicate in a place like New York, a big state with lots going on. ” With the competition so intense, each state tries to exploit marginal advantages and highlight rivals’ weaknesses. The marketing pitch is not always about keeping up with the neighbors, however. Even as Nevada and Delaware blocked   with claims for child support, for example, New Hampshire decided not to follow suit. “We have reviewed that and said that’s not our policy,’” said William F. J. Ardinger, a lawyer at Rath, Young  Pignatelli who has lobbied for changes in New Hampshire’s trust laws. His state is making a different kind of appeal. “There’s a huge amount of wealth on the Eastern Seaboard, and New Hampshire fares well in the mind of those families,” Mr. Ardinger said. “They’ll say, ‘I went to prep school at Exeter,’ or, ‘I went to Camp Winaukee as a kid.’ “Reno is a beautiful place, but it’s not ‘On Golden Pond. ’” The Las Vegas lawyer Mr. Oshins, who almost makes the Kardashians look shy, is unfazed by such comparisons. “New Hampshire is a little bit of a wannabe,” he said. “They’re a   state. ”",0
9893,Angelina Jolie’s Father Speaks Out Against Illuminati,"  Sean Adl-Tabatabai in Entertainment // 0 Comments 
Angelina Jolie’s father, Jon Voight, has publicly spoken out against the illuminati elite’s that he says are attempting to prevent Donald Trump from winning the Presidency. 
In a video uploaded to YouTube , Voight slammed both George Soros and Hillary Clinton, claiming they are attempting to turn America into a country of tyranny. 
“May God protect the real truth and may Donald Trump win this presidency. He will save our America, and he will certainly make it great again,” he said . 
Daily Mail reports: 
Voight has repeatedly supported Trump throughout the election cycle despite the business tycoon’s unprovoked attacks on his daughter Angelina Jolie’s looks. 
In the video, posted on Voight’s social media channels, he said: ‘We were once a country of freedom. Now we’re becoming a country of tyranny. 
‘Thousands of refugees will flood our nation, and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys. It will kill our economy which is at an all time low under the years of Obama’s presidency.’ 
Millions of jobs have been created, unemployment has plummeted, and the economy has grown about two per cent each year under Obama’s administration, with experts grading it a ‘solid B or B+’, CNN reported. 
But Voight also warned that people would lose their Second Amendment rights under Hillary Clinton, even though she has repeatedly disputed similar statements. 
Voight went on to say: ‘Freedom of religion will be attacked…and Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. 
‘Our highest courts will become socialist, and she will restrict what America was founded on – our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams.’ 
Voight also accused Soros of ‘turn[ing] hundreds of Jewish people over to the Nazis to be exterminated during World War II,’ an idea perpetuated by conservative commentator Glenn Beck. 
When Soros was 14, his father bribed an agriculture official in Nazi-occupied Hungary to pose as his Christian godfather. 
Soros once accompanied the man during an inventory of an estate left behind by the wealthy Jewish aristocrat Mor Kornfeld. 
In a 1998 episode of 60 Minutes, Soros said: ‘I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.’ 
While Voight made no reference to Trump’s comments about women in his latest video, he came out to defend the business tycoon days earlier. 
‘I am so ashamed of my fellow actor Bobby DeNiro’s rant against Donald Trump…’ I am so ashamed of my fellow actor Bobby DeNiro's rant against Donald Trump. What foul words he used against a presidential nominee. cont'd 
— Jon Voight (@jonvoight) October 8, 2016 
‘Donald Trump’s words were not as damaging as Robert DeNiro’s ugly rant. Trump’s words did not hurt anyone.’ Voight tweeted in response to the Republican candidate’s comments that he could sexually harass women without consequence. Donald Trump's words were not as damaging as Robert DeNiro's ugly rant. Trump's words did not hurt anyone. Can you imagine. cont'd 
— Jon Voight (@jonvoight) October 8, 2016 
‘I don’t know of too many men who haven’t expressed some sort of similar sexual terms toward women, especially in their younger years,’ Voight added. 
Trump has since been accused of sexual harassment by six women in the days following the 2005 hot mic recording’s emergence. 
The presidential candidate has spoken out against Voight’s daughter over the last decade, saying in 2006: ‘[Angelina Jolie has] been with so many guys she makes me look like a baby, OK, with the other side. And, I just don’t even find her attractive.’ 
In 2007, Trump said: ‘Angelina Jolie is sort of amazing because everyone thinks she’s like this great beauty. 
‘I really understand beauty. And I will tell you, she’s not—I do own Miss Universe. I do own Miss USA. I mean, I own a lot of different things. I do understand beauty, and she’s not.’",0
9894,Citizens in these 3 US states took action on water fluoridation bans,"VIDEOS Citizens in these 3 US states took action on water fluoridation bans In the spring of 2015, the U.S. government lowered fluoride levels in drinking water for the first time in 50 years By Julie Fidler - Thursday, November 17, 2016 11:17 AM EST 
Voters in Kennebunk, Kennebunkport, and Wells Water District in Maine; Healdsburg, California (Sonoma County); and Greenville, Texas went to the polls on November 8 to voice their views on whether to ban fluoride in their drinking water . 
Fluoride was added to the U.S. water supply purportedly to ward off cavities . However, some research does suggest that water fluoridation does nothing to improve dental health . In fact, countries with fluoridated water do not have less tooth decay than non-fluoridated countries. [1] 
Furthermore, about 40% of American teens show signs of fluoride over-exposure, or dental fluorosis . Fluorosis is a tooth enamel defect that makes the teeth look like they are covered in cloudy spots and streaks. In more severe cases, fluorosis results in brown stains and tooth erosion. 
Nobody wants to get their teeth drilled or have a root canal, but the health risks associated with fluoride are far worse than holes in your teeth: Arthritis Thyroid disease Acute toxicity 
In the spring of 2015, the U.S. government lowered fluoride levels in drinking water for the first time in 50 years, after researchers at Harvard University and other institutions found that exposure to high levels of fluoride can cause numerous health problems and lower IQ. 
Let’s take a look at how these communities voted. Maine 
Residents of 7 towns – Kennebunk, Kennebunkport, Wells, Ogunquit, Arundel and parts of Biddeford and York – voted to stop treating drinking water with fluoride . All of the communities get their drinking water from the Wells Water District. [2] 
District superintendent Norm Labbe said in a statement: “The Water District is pleased with the outcome of the fluoride referendum. It’s evident that the voting public is now more informed about the subject than they were back in 2002, when fluoridation was voted in. The water district thanks the Campaign to Reconsider Water Fluoridation volunteers and in particular the voters for their knowledgeable decision to cease the addition of fluoride to our water. We look forward to staying true to our mission of providing the highest quality of water at the lowest reasonable cost.” The ballot referendum was the work of the Campaign to Reconsider Fluoride, a small group of concerned residents who are concerned that water fluoridation equates to mass-medicating and over-fluoridation. 
The water district started adding fluoride to water in 2004 as part of a 2002 referendum. Healdsburg, Sonoma County 
It was a different story in Healdsburg, California. 
For the 2nd time in 2 years, residents there appeared to vote down a measure to remove fluoride from city drinking water. The vote has yet to be finalized, but as of November 9, Measure T was failing, 59% to 41%. [3] 
Shawn Widick, a Healdsburg dentists running the No on Measure T campaign, said: “I’m pretty ecstatic the citizens got it right again. It’s ridiculous because it’s a public health issue and such a benefit to our community. We shouldn’t have to be dealing with this again.” 
Measure T called for a moratorium on adding fluoride to city water until the manufacturer could prove it was “safe and effective.” Fluoride has been added to Healdsburg water for the last 60 years. 
Fluoride opponents rejected a similar measure in 2014 by a majority 66%. 
About 2/3 of Californians have fluoridated water. Greenville, Texas 
The Greenville City Council voted to affirm an earlier decision to resume fluoridating the local water supply , despite several people speaking out against the practice. One of the opponents was Kory Watkins, who argued the measure was an unconstitutional violation of individual rights . [4] 
He said: “Fluoride is poisonous. If you ingest too much of it, it is going to be a problem. There is no control. There is no doctor looking over the dose of the medication.” 
Greenville stopped fluoridating its water in September 2013 after it was determined that fluoridation was causing too much wear and tear on equipment.",0

9896,Downturn in Russo-British relations a danger for global security,"russia-uk relations , uk , patriarch kirill , london Drawing by Alexei Iorsh Source: Iorsh 
After the Brexit referendum and the subsequent change of government in the UK, a number of experts and observers expected an improvement in Russo-British relations. Perhaps unwittingly, former British Prime Minister David Cameron inspired these unfounded expectations. Cameron’s constantly repeated allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported a vote for Brexit made people expect a somewhat softer line on Russia from the new governing team in London who were, after all, supporters of Brexit and opponents of Cameron. 
When Boris Johnson became the new foreign secretary, several MPs were even concerned about him not being “tough enough” with Russia and making “conciliatory” calls to his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. 
Johnson quickly proved these concerns wrong, issuing a call for protests near the Russian Embassy in London as a way to punish Moscow for its actions in Syria. “This is something unprecedented in the world of diplomacy,” Alexey Pushkov, former head of the Duma’s committee on international affairs, said in an interview to Vesti FM radio station. “A diplomat calling for non-diplomatic solutions, with popular anger mobilized – this is something new.” Pushkov also noted Johnson’s tough statement accusing Russia of deliberately killing Syrian civilians with “repeated bombings.”“They drop one bomb and then they wait for the aid workers to come out pulling the injured from the rubble, and then five minutes later they drop another bomb,” Boris Johnson said in an interview with the tabloid The Sun. 
“Boris Johnson is showing a flamboyant attitude where it is needed least of all,” Pushkov replied. 
For their part, the Russian authorities, disappointed by Johnson, are also changing their tone, trying to drive home to both foreign and domestic audiences the message that they are angry. 
“Decent people first provide the evidence, and only later they come out with accusations,” said Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to Johnson’s interview with The Sun. Seeing the bigger picture 
Both Johnson and Zakharova have provided plenty of fodder for the media, but all commentary and posturing aside, the decline in Russo-British relations is detrimental not just for the two countries at hand, but also for global security at large. 
“We should not forget that the world was once brought to the brink of a nuclear disaster not because of European problems, but because of a conflict over a distant land – Cuba. When I hear British voices suggesting that NATO forces should impose a no-fly zone over northern Syria by striking at the airfields of the Syrian or Russian air forces in Syria – I get really worried,” Alexei Pushkov said. “In this situation, tough statements with a strong populist message – such as the talk about “warning strikes” in Syria – such statements are not just tasteless, they are plain dangerous.” Patriarch’s visit to London hailed as step toward reconciliation with West Media tensions were somewhat eased by the visit to the UK by Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill. During his visit, which took place on Oct. 15-18, the Patriarch deliberately avoided controversial issues, playing down the conflict between the Russian and British governments. “Political differences won’t be able to disrupt the relations between Russia and Britain on the basic level, on the level of people-to-people ties,” Patriarch Kirill said, speaking to journalists before his flight back to Moscow. “I am often asked about our church’s position on Ukraine. My answer is that there can be only one position: to reconcile the people, to lessen the tension, to end the bloody clashes.”
Trying to minimize the damage from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church still recognizes Crimea as a canonical territory of its Ukrainian “Orthodox sister church.” For two years, Patriarch Kirill avoided any political comments on the recent “regime change” in Ukraine. When the Ukrainian government barred him from visiting Kiev, the cradle of Orthodox Christianity in ancient Rus, Kirill did not protest. In this way, the Russian Orthodox Church is offering a good example of forgiveness and compromise. Several British MPs protested against what they called a “red carpet reception” for Patriarch Kirill in London because of Kirill’s loyalty to Putin, but the Patriarch did not pronounce a single word of anger or even sadness, meeting instead with Queen Elizabeth, the titular head of the Church of England, and blessing by his presence the opening of a renovated Orthodox cathedral in London. 
“Since the early stages of deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, the church leaders have often been doing the diplomats’ jobs in Russia’s relations with the West,” wrote Moscow-based Nezavisimaya Gazeta, deviating from its usual line, which is very critical of Kirill. 
This is perhaps not the worst of developments: at a time when diplomats are often sacrificing security and professionalism in order to boost their standing in the mass media, the church is trying to remember and celebrate the positive legacy of Russo-British relations. This is done not so much for the sake of history, as for the sake of a secure future. Sooner or later, this cursory attitude towards diplomacy will have to give way to wisdom and responsibility.

9897,Maybe All Those “Smart” Gadgets And Appliances From China Aren’t Such A Smart Idea (VIDEO),"in: Multimedia , Science & Technology , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests You know all of those cool, sci-fi gadgets that people are beginning to get that are connected to the internet in their homes? The voice controlled thermostats, the wireless printers and cameras, the home security systems, the food scale that sends the calories to your phone app, those “smart” appliances that text you to pick up milk, and the DVRS that can be programmed via your phone from work? Apparently, those things may not be so smart after all because they played a big role in the cyber attack that took place last Friday. Security analysts believe that Friday’s attack on popular websites such as Reddit, Twitter, Netflix, and Spotify was the first one carried out by hackers who used the “ Internet of Things. ” Here’s how the Internet of Things works: Who else thinks that this is how Skynet got started? Maybe it’s just me. The attack was on one service, Dyn. The massive attack took down the internet across the country. The website Downdetector provided a map that shows how much of the US was affected: The attack was on one company, and everything else fell over like a row of dominoes. All of the companies involved use Dyn , a cloud-based Internet performance management company. Dyn was the target of the attack, and that, in turn, affected other companies. Dyn is sort of like a phone book that directs users to the internet address of the website. On Friday a distributed denial of service attack, (DDoS) affected Dyn by sending thousands of messages at the same time, which overwhelmed the service. Security company Flashpoint said it had confirmed that the attack used “botnets” infected with the “Mirai” malware. From their site: Flashpoint has confirmed that some of the infrastructure responsible for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Dyn DNS were botnets compromised by Mirai malware. Mirai botnets were previously used in DDoS attacks against security researcher Brian Krebs’ blog “Krebs On Security” and French internet service and hosting provider OVH. Mirai malware targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices like routers, digital video records (DVRs), and webcams/security cameras, enslaving vast numbers of these devices into a botnet, which is then used to conduct DDoS attacks. Flashpoint has confirmed that at least some of the devices used in the Dyn DNS attacks are DVRs, further matching the technical indicators and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with previous known Mirai botnet attacks. While Flashpoint has confirmed that Mirai botnets were used in the October 21, 2016 attack against Dyn, they were separate and distinct botnets from those used to execute the DDoS attacks against “Krebs on Security” and OVH. Earlier this month, “Anna_Senpai,” the hacker operating the large Mirai botnet used in the Krebs DDoS, released Mira’s source code online. Since this release, copycat hackers have used the malware to create botnets of their own in order to launch DDoS attacks. It is unknown if the attacks against Dyn DNS are linked to the DDoS attacks against Krebs, OVH, or other previous attacks. Given the proliferation of the Mirai malware, the relationship between the ongoing Dyn DDoS attacks, previous attacks, and “Anna_Senpai” is unclear. Coincidentally, many of the vulnerable “smart” devices are made in China. Many of the devices involved come from Chinese manufacturers, with easy-to-guess usernames and passwords that cannot be changed by the user – a vulnerability which the malware exploits. According to the BBC : “Mirai scours the Web for IoT (Internet of Things) devices protected by little more than factory-default usernames and passwords,” explained cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs, “and then enlists the devices in attacks that hurl junk traffic at an online target until it can no longer accommodate legitimate visitors or users.” The owner of the device would generally have no way of knowing that it had been compromised to use in an attack, he wrote. Mr Krebs is intimately familiar with this type of incident, after his website was targeted by a similar assault in September, in one of the biggest web attacks ever seen…That attack began around 8 p.m. ET on Sept. 20, and initial reports put it at approximately 665 Gigabits of traffic per second. Additional analysis on the attack traffic suggests the assault was closer to 620 Gbps in size, but in any case this is many orders of magnitude more traffic than is typically needed to knock most sites offline. (source ) I’m sure those easy passwords and vulnerabilities aren’t deliberate. China would never sneak Trojan horses into the USA, would they?

9898,Someone Just Donated $2.5 Million to Bail Out Everyone Arrested at Standing Rock,"By Nick Bernabe 
Following the recent mass arrests of 141 people at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site located near Standing Rock, North Dakota, an anonymous donor just donated $2.5 million to bail out everyone who was arrested at the protests. 
The news came after Tamara Francis-Fourkiller, a tribal leader from the Caddo Nation tribe in Caddo County, Oklahoma, was arrested at Standing Rock. Francis-Fourkiller was released after spending two days in jail, but her family says she was just an innocent observer in the clashes between militarized law enforcement and Native American activists, or “water protectors.” 
[ UPDATE 11/1 4:35 pm EST: A statement from Red Owl Legal Collective/National Lawyers Guild that is advising Standing Rock has issued a statement saying the $2.5 million has not been received yet. We are waiting on confirmation from the Caddo Nation tribe.] 
According to local news affiliate News On 6 : 
Family members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site. They said, however, that Francis-Fourkiller should not have been arrested in the first place. 
Though the donor who sent the $2.5 million remains anonymous, it appears the person is connected to the Caddo Nation tribe in some way .",0

9900,South Korea’s Olympian Winter Moment - The New York Times,"Emerging from the warmth of her car, Jung   watched her husband trudge up a snowy hill, red sled in hand, as their    son bounded excitedly ahead, ready for another run. Like many young South Koreans in the congested capital of Seoul, she and her husband escape to the nearby Taebaek Mountains to hit the slopes several times each winter, though she admitted they are still trying to find their legs as skiers. “We are not really good at it,” she said, “but we do enjoy the sledding. ” There’s another draw that keeps their son enthralled  —   a   indoor water park called Ocean 700, whose attractions include a wave pool, a lazy river filled with bobbing   and a waterslide with the slightly intimidating name of Tornado. In fact, Ms. Jung, a    bank employee, thought the ski season was over on this particular trip in   last year, when some of the smaller resorts began to close, so her family had come only for the waterslides. “It’s very popular in Korea. Maybe even more than the skiing. ” Indeed, compared with neighboring Japan and its ingrained ski culture,   skiing and   resorts, South Korea is in many ways still coming into its own as a skiing and snowboarding destination. But this could soon change when Pyeongchang hosts the Winter Olympics from Feb. 9 to 25, 2018, only the third time the Winter Games will be held in Asia, and the first time outside Japan. It’s a big moment for the country, which views the Winter Games as a huge source of national pride and is eager to put on a memorable spectacle on par with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 2002 World Cup that South Korea   with Japan. With tens of thousands of athletes, journalists and spectators expected to descend on Pyeongchang for the Games, it’s also a   party of sorts for South Korea as a winter sports hub, a chance to show the world that it, too, has   slopes and a   skiing infrastructure that can continue to attract powder hounds long after the Olympics are over. This quiet region of   mountains and potato fields not far from the North Korean border, long one of the country’s   areas, has overcome a number of obstacles just to get to this point. Pyeongchang, largely unfamiliar even to many Koreans before the Olympic bid, was once seen as a sizable underdog to win the Olympics. It finally succeeded in its third bid after   defeats to Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014. Still, name recognition remains a problem. To avoid confusion with the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the Olympic host  was officially rebranded from its original name, Pyongchang, to PyeongChang, adding an   “e” and capital “C. ” The new spelling only partly worked, though, as some international media have not adopted the capital C.  And travelers have still gotten confused, such as the Kenyan delegate headed to the ski center for a United Nations biodiversity conference in 2014 who accidentally booked a ticket to North Korea instead. The preparations have also been rocky. There were struggles initially to find domestic sponsors and disputes over funding for venues and the plan to build a downhill course in a virgin forest on a protected mountainside. (The organizing committee has done damage control by promising to replant trees and return the mountain to its natural state after the Games.) The   corruption scandal involving the country’s president, Park   has threatened to overshadow the Olympics, too, but organizers maintain that preparations have not been affected and that the Games are free of corruption. With one year to go before the opening ceremony, organizers are fervently trying to shift attention back to South Korea’s moment in the sporting spotlight. Most of the venues are nearing completion, including a   Alpine ski center, speedskating oval, figure skating arena and sliding track for the bobsled, luge and skeleton events. The two villages for athletes are about    —   one in the Pyeongchang mountain cluster, the other in the coastal city of Gangneung, where the ice events will be held. A new   rail line is expected to be completed by   too, whisking visitors from Seoul to Pyeongchang in just 69 minutes, compared with the current      drive. And the Olympic spirit is finally starting to seep into Pyeongchang, a sprawling county made up of ski resorts and sleepy towns like Hoenggye, where the athletes’ village and Olympic Stadium are being built. Hoenggye is as far from a typical ski town as it gets. The streets are lined with homey dumpling and Korean fried chicken restaurants, as well as nondescript clothing stores with names like Barbie Fashion Shop that stock   sweaters and windbreakers, but nary a ski jacket in sight. A small truck with a squawking loudspeaker makes the rounds in the afternoons selling fresh crab and squid from the coast, and on the outskirts of town, locals hang pollock on wooden racks for days in the winter sun until they become tough as leather, a popular Korean delicacy called hwangtae. But even in this tranquil hamlet, the excitement is starting to build. The main road into town is already aglow with giant neon letters proclaiming triumphantly to motorists, “Yes Pyeongchang!” In a dry, shallow riverbed, five giant Olympic rings were fashioned from packed snow for the Pyeongchang Winter Festival earlier this year, with tunnels in the curved walls large enough to stroll through and snow carvings of figures like a skiing rooster (for the Year of the Rooster) and the Olympic mascot Soohorang, a smiling white tiger, in the center. A short drive away, the new Alpensia Ski Jumping Center has also become a draw for families, with young children bundled in heavy jackets warily eyeing the top of the steep, icy slope before heading to the observatory for popcorn and photos in front of a less frightening picture of the real thing. The hope is that the Olympics can have a lasting impact on the tourism industry here and help South Korea rival Japan  —   and upstart China  —   as a winter sports destination. It may take some time to catch up to its neighbors. According to the Ski Business Association of Korea, the number of ski visits in South Korea grew slowly from 5. 4 million in   to a peak of 6. 8 million in   but then fell to just 4. 9 million in   in part because of a slowing economy and an aging population. Japan’s ski industry has also seen a sharp decline since the boom years of the 1980s, but still averages more than 30 million ski visits per year. Though the downturn has hit some resorts hard, the attractions in Japan are still legion:   resorts with dozens of trails and steep verticals a lengthy ski season that sometimes stretches into early May a raucous   scene (particularly popular among   Australians) and above all, the endlessly falling snow. In China, meanwhile, skiing is also booming among the newly rich and young urban dwellers, with more than 12. 5 million resort visits registered in  . Developers have been pouring money into resorts across the country, none more grand than the $3. 2 billion Changbaishan resort near the North Korean border, which is now one of the largest in Asia with 43 trails totaling nearly 20 miles. China is sure to attract even more investment as it gears up for its own Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022. South Korea actually has a long skiing history. Its first (and still biggest) resort, Yongpyong, opened in 1975, the same year it imported its first   machine from Europe. (This moment is memorialized at Yongpyong in a grainy photo of officials surveying the foreign contraption above the very   caption: “This artificial snow makes skiing more enjoyable. ”) But one of the main impediments to the country emerging from Japan’s shadow has been geography: South Korea’s mountains are just smaller than its neighbors’ and receive far less natural snow. At Yongpyong, which will host the slalom and giant slalom events during the Olympics, the average annual snowfall is just eight feet, and though it’s cold enough to make artificial snow the entire winter, it’s not quite the same as the deep powder in Hokkaido, the northern Japanese island. At Niseko, one of the most popular resort areas on Hokkaido, the average annual snowfall is an astonishing 50 feet. Yongpyong has 28 slopes, served by 13 lifts and a gondola, but many of the trails are geared toward beginners and intermediates an experienced skier can pretty much cover all the “ ” diamond trails by lunchtime. Safety and proper decorum, not speed, also seem to be paramount concerns  —   fences prevent skiers from going   helmets are ubiquitous, and signs constantly remind visitors to select the appropriate slope for their skill level and slow down. Sharing a Korean Hite beer with friends after a morning on the slopes, Ulrike Pertoll, an Italian who lives in Seoul, said she prefers the pure powder in Japan and the longer runs in the Dolomites back in Italy. But, she added, skiing in South Korea has its benefits: Ski rentals and lodging are cheaper than in Japan, and the proximity of the slopes to Seoul means you can leave work at 5 p. m. on a Friday and be on the slopes several hours later. “Where else can you do that so easily in Asia?” she said. Yongpyong’s slopes stay open until 2:30 a. m. for night owls, too. Kyle Hughes, an Australian who has skied in South Korea for five years and runs an independent online travel guide called Korea Snow, points out other advantages: “The Koreans have the best skiing infrastructure in Asia  —   they have   gondolas, fast quads, fast eights, the latest magic carpets,” he said. “And they’ve become so efficient at making snow, it’s ridiculous. One [resort] manager told me they don’t care if it doesn’t snow, they have the technology to open the whole season. ” Then there’s the cool factor. Many Koreans started taking up snowboarding in the 1990s after a hugely popular   boy band, Seo Taiji and Boys, showed off their boarding  —   and posing  —   skills in one of their videos. Since then, snowboarding has exploded in South Korea  —   as much for the style as for the sport itself. And just like the broader Korean wave sweeping Asia in music, television and film, Korean brands are now at the forefront of snowboarding style in the region, too. These fashions are perhaps most visible at the Welli Hilli Park, a snowboarder’s paradise about an hour’s drive from Yongpyong. There are few downhill runs here rather, the main attractions are the halfpipe, moguls and snowboard ramp where tricksters in hoodies entertain one another with flips and spins, sneaking cigarettes on the side. The standard dress is a hooded sweatshirt down to the knees (and sometimes well beyond) along with hair dyed various shades of blond and   and an obligatory   baseball cap, usually covered by the hood for effect. Some boarders go for a    ensemble in a glaring shade of pink or orange the brighter the color, the bolder the fashion statement. It’s not unusual to see GoPro cameras attached to helmets and, on occasion, a rebel snowboarder with a selfie stick fully outstretched, filming himself as he recklessly, yet    carves his way down the mountain. (A clear violation of the rules, mind you.) It’s part slope, part catwalk, with skiers trying as hard as they can to get noticed. “Koreans are really into appearance,” said Max Kim, founder of an outdoor adventure company called Teamax Adventure. “When they ski, they focus on how beautiful they ski, so they like to show off, take a selfie and post on Facebook. ” Mr. Kim fancies himself a skiing purist  —   most of the time. “I just like an outfit I feel comfortable in. If I go with a girlfriend, that’s a different story  —   then I like to wear Gucci or Chanel. ” As the industry matures, Mr. Kim hopes Koreans move beyond the     aspect of the sport and try something even more daring  —   backcountry skiing on untamed mountainsides far away from the safety of groomed trails. This is difficult to do at the   resorts around Pyeongchang, but his company organizes backcountry tours to snowy Ulleung island. “When Koreans think about skiing, everyone thinks it’s about skiing in a ski resort, surrounded by a fence,” he said. “A couple years ago, people didn’t understand about backcountry skiing, but nowadays lots of people try to do this. ” There’s another change some hope could come with the Olympics: a livelier   scene. Korean resorts are decidedly   with few entertainment options after sundown. At the Alpensia Resort, a small,   facility that’s within minutes of most Olympic venues and will serve as the focal point for the Games, the only   options are a karaoke parlor, a   pool hall and a charmingly rustic bar with Hite beer on tap and a dozen varieties of chicken, from soy sauce chicken to a curiously named “cheese chicken. ” “People tend to go to a restaurant and base everything around food. Then they start drinking and have a good time, or entertain in their apartments,” said Mr. Hughes, of Korea Snow. “As an Australian, I’m used to a bar culture. ” Then again, there are some advantages to a quieter ski destination. In Japan, he noted, “there are so many Australians, I feel like I haven’t left home. When I go to Korea, we’re pretty much the only ones there. ” The Olympics Information about the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang is available at pyeongchang2018. . Getting There Getting to the slopes in Pyeongchang will be much easier when the   rail opens later this year the trip will be 98 minutes from Incheon International Airport and 69 minutes from downtown Seoul. Until then, both Yongpyong and Alpensia resorts have shuttles that leave from the airport several times a day (70, 000 Korean won round trip, or about $60). Renting a car is advisable for visiting more than one resort, as public transportation is limited in the mountains. Where to Stay and Ski Alpensia has three hotels within walking distance of the lifts: the   InterContinental Alpensia Resort (doubles from 135, 000 won) the   Holiday Inn Resort (doubles from 98, 600 won) and the   Holiday Inn  Suites (doubles from 102, 000 won). A   lift ticket is 69, 000 won and rentals are 29, 000 won for skis and 35, 000 won for snowboards. At Yongpyong, the main lodging option is the   Dragon Valley Hotel (doubles from 71, 000 won). A   lift ticket is 76, 000 won and   rental is 33, 000 won. Welli Hilli sells   lift tickets for 70, 000 won. Ski rental is 28, 000 won and snowboard rental is 33, 000. Ski clothing rental is available at all resorts, too.",0
9902,"Bob Dylan, the Newest Nobel Laureate, Maintains His Reticence - The New York Times","What does Bob Dylan think about winning the Nobel Prize? The Swedish Academy, which bestows the award, does not know because it has not spoken to him. And Mr. Dylan, despite performing twice since being named the latest Nobel laureate in literature last week, has yet to make a public statement about the honor. Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the academy, told Swedish public radio on Monday that the academy has been in contact with an associate of Mr. Dylan, but apparently not with the artist himself. Ms. Danius said she did not know whether he planned to attend the award ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10. “Right now we are doing nothing,” Ms. Danius said, according to a translation of her comments reported by the British newspaper The Guardian. “I have called and sent emails to his closest collaborator and received very friendly replies. For now, that is certainly enough. ” It has been four days, as of Monday, since Mr. Dylan, 75, won the Nobel, the first time the award has gone to a musician. The announcement set off a debate in literary circles over whether Mr. Dylan was an appropriate choice. On Thursday night, just hours after the announcement. Mr. Dylan and his band played at a theater in Las Vegas, and he said not a word about winning the world’s highest literary honor. The next day, he was at Desert Trip, the   festival in Indio, Calif. and again made no remarks from the stage, though observers studied his performance for any clue of a reaction, however remote. Mr. Dylan’s set at that show was almost identical to that of the first weekend, with an intriguing addition: “Why Try to Change Me Now? ,” a chestnut written by Cy Coleman and Joseph McCarthy that Mr. Dylan included on his 2015 album “Shadows in the Night. ” (The Rolling Stones, who played next, openly celebrated Mr. Dylan. “We have never shared the stage with a Nobel Prize winner before,” said Mick Jagger. “Bob is like our own Walt Whitman. ”) A spokesman for Mr. Dylan declined to comment on Monday. Mr. Dylan’s reticence is well known. He gives relatively few interviews, and in concert he rarely interacts with his audience. He also maintains a close command over his business affairs, to the extent that even Columbia Records, the label that has been Mr. Dylan’s home for almost his entire   career, seemed to be waiting for a cue from its famous artist, publishing little more than a perfunctory tweet about the Nobel. But it is extremely unusual for a Nobel laureate to respond with radio silence. Even Alice Munro, the Canadian   writer who was not well enough to attend the ceremony when she won three years ago at age 82, sent her daughter to Stockholm to accept the prize on her behalf. In the literary world, early dissent about Mr. Dylan as a choice for the award has turned into a chorus, as some writers, including the poets Amy King and Danniel Schoonebeek, have called on Mr. Dylan to turn the honor down, as   Sartre did in 1964. “Will Bob Dylan even show up to the ceremony? ,” Mr. Schoonebeek, wrote on PEN’s website after the organization asked writers and publishers to respond to the award. “Everyone already knows his records front to back, he’s already a household name all over the world, does this award do anything to effect any change whatsoever?” He added: “If he hasn’t done so already, Bob Dylan should turn down the award. ” The novelist Porochista Khakpour faulted the Swedish Academy for honoring a music icon over international authors who could draw overdue attention to an entire region. “The Nobel, which is a very international prize, is such a great opportunity to introduce us to someone who we’ve never heard of,” Ms. Khakpour said in an interview. Mr. Dylan, who may be a contrarian or may just be unpredictable, has turned up for   honors. He was present at the Golden Globes in 2001 to accept the award for best original song, for “Things Have Changed” (from “Wonder Boys”) giving a speech of about 15 seconds in which he thanked his band, his record company, his family “and that’s about it. ” When he was honored by MusiCares, a charity connected to the Grammy Awards, in 2015, Mr. Dylan stunned a roomful of jaded record executives and journalists with 35 minutes of prepared comments. He went into revealing detail about his songwriting methods and how songs can resonate  —   a glimpse, perhaps, at how he might handle a Nobel speech, should he choose to make one. “These songs of mine,” he said, “they’re like mystery plays, the kind Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now. ”",0
9903,Body Count Rises as Philippine President Wages War on Drugs - The New York Times,"MANILA  —   Since Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines just over a month ago, promising to get tough on crime by having the police and the military kill drug suspects, 420 people have been killed in the campaign, according to tallies of police reports by the local news media. Most were killed in confrontations with the police, while 154 were killed by unidentified vigilantes. This has prompted 114, 833 people to turn themselves in, as either drug addicts or dealers, since Mr. Duterte took office, according to national police logs. Addressing Congress last week in his first State of the Nation address, Mr. Duterte reiterated his    approach, ordering the police to “triple” their efforts against crime. “We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier and the last pusher have surrendered or been put behind bars or below the ground, if they so wish,” he said. But human rights groups, Roman Catholic activists and the families of many of those killed during the crackdown say that the vast majority were poor Filipinos, many of whom had nothing to do with the drug trade. They were not accorded an accusation and a trial, but were simply shot down in the streets, the critics say. “These are not the wealthy and powerful drug lords who actually have meaningful control over supply of drugs on the streets in the Philippines,” said Phelim Kine, a deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia. Critics of the president’s campaign have rallied around the case of Michael Siaron, a    rickshaw driver in Manila, who was shot one night by unidentified gunmen as he pedaled his vehicle in search of a passenger. When his wife rushed to the scene, a photographer took a picture of her cradling his body in the street, and the photograph quickly gained wide attention. Scribbled in block letters on a cardboard sign left near his body was the word “pusher. ” His family members insist that he was not involved in the drug trade, though they said he sometimes used meth. Indirectly acknowledging criticism that his policies trample over the standard judicial process, Mr. Duterte said that human rights “cannot be used as a shield to destroy the country. ” He has called for drug users and sellers to turn themselves in or risk being hunted down, a threat backed up by the bodies piling up near daily on the streets of Philippine cities. The approach appears to be driving down crime: The police say that they have arrested more than 2, 700 people on charges related to using or selling illegal drugs, and that crime nationwide has fallen 13 percent since the election, to 46, 600 reported crimes in June, from 52, 950 in May. Mr. Duterte’s crackdown has been hugely popular. Filipinos, pummeled by years of violent crime and corrupt, ineffective law enforcement, handed him an overwhelming victory in the May presidential election, and have largely embraced his approach. A national opinion poll conducted after his election and just before he took office found that 84 percent of Filipinos had “much trust” in him. The model for Mr. Duterte’s policies is Davao City, where he was mayor for most of the past 20 years. Draconian laws there, including a strict curfew and a smoking ban as well as a   approach to drug users and sellers, have been credited with turning the city into an oasis of safety in a region plagued by violence. The dark side of that approach was that more than 1, 000 people were killed by   death squads during his administration, according to several independent investigations. Mr. Duterte has denied having direct knowledge of death squads, but he has long called for addressing crime by killing suspects, whom he calls criminals and has referred to as “a legitimate target of assassination. ” He has repeatedly said that those hooked on meth, the most popular drug here, were beyond saving or rehabilitation. He ran for president largely on the pledge of applying the same policies nationwide, promising to kill 100, 000 criminals in his first six months in office. While the number may have been typical Duterte bravado, the threat of mass killing appears to have been real. On Tuesday, the International Drug Policy Consortium, a network of nongovernmental organizations, issued a letter urging the United Nations drug control agencies “to demand an end to the atrocities currently taking place in the Philippines” and to state unequivocally that extrajudicial killings “do not constitute acceptable drug control measures. ” Ramon Casiple, a political analyst at the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said that he shared those concerns but that it was too early to decide whether Mr. Duterte’s approach is effective. “Let’s give him his 100 days,” Mr. Casiple said. Mr. Duterte has recently raised his sights beyond   users and dealers, accusing five police generals of protecting drug lords, though he presented no specific evidence. He also publicly accused a mayor, the mayor’s son and a prominent businessman of drug trafficking, threatening their lives if they did not surrender. But the people killed on the street tend to be more like Mr. Siaron, the rickshaw driver. Mr. Siaron lived with his wife in a shack above a   creek. Having never finished high school, he survived on odd jobs like house painting and working in   restaurants. Lately he had been pedaling a rickshaw, earning about $2 a day ferrying passengers through the warren of alleyways in a   part of metropolitan Manila. On the night he died, he had stopped by his father’s fruit stand to ask for an apple. Then he told his father he would seek one more fare before heading home. As he rode off, gunmen on motorcycles sped by, pumping several bullets into him. What happened next turned him into a national symbol of the human toll of Mr. Duterte’s war. When she heard he had been shot, Mr. Siaron’s wife, Jennilyn Olayres, ran into the street, burst through police lines and collapsed next to him on the asphalt. The photographer snapped the picture: a distraught woman cradling her lifeless husband under a streetlight, a Pietà of the Manila slums. The police have not commented publicly about the case and have not accused Mr. Siaron of selling drugs. “My husband was a simple man,” Ms. Olayres said at his wake several days later. “He may have used drugs, but he was not violent and never bothered anyone. His only concern was looking for passengers so we can eat three meals a day. ” During his speech to Congress, Mr. Duterte dismissed the photo, which had appeared on the front page of The Philippine Daily Inquirer the previous day under the banner headline “Thou shall not kill. ” “There you are sprawled on the ground, and you are portrayed in a broadsheet like Mother Mary cradling the dead cadaver of Jesus Christ,” he said. “That’s just drama. ” But if the antidrug campaign has targeted people on the margins of society, Mr. Siaron is an apt symbol. “We’re small people, insignificant,” Ms. Olayres said through sobs as she stood next to her husband’s coffin. “We may be invisible to you, but we are real. Please stop the killings. ”",0
9904,Powerful earthquake hits central Italy for the third time,"October 31, 2016 Powerful earthquake hits central Italy for the third time 
A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 has rocked the same area of central and southern Italy hit by quake in August and a pair of aftershocks last week, sending already quake-damaged buildings crumbling after a week of temblors that have left thousands homeless. 
There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. Residents already rattled by a constant trembling of the earth rushed into piazzas and streets after being roused from bed by Sunday’s 7:40am quake. Many people still had been sleeping in cars or evacuated to shelters or hotels in other areas after a pair of strong jolts last Wednesday.

9905,Garlic Beats Drug In Detoxifying Lead Safely From Body,"in: Natural Medicine , Toxins A remarkable study published in the journal of Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology revealed something very special about garlic: it is a natural detoxifier of lead and is not only as effective as a common chelation drug known as d-penicillamine at pulling this metal out of the body but is also much safer. The study was titled, “ Comparison of therapeutic effects of garlic and d-penicillamine in patients with chronic occupational lead poisoning,” and sought to confirm previous research in animals that showed garlic (Allium sativum) is effective in reducing blood and tissue lead concentrations. [1] The study took the measurements of the blood lead concentrations of 117 workers at a car battery plant who were randomly assigned to two groups of garlic (1.2 milligrams of allicin from approximately 1,000 mg of garlic extract, three times daily) and d-penicillamine (250 mg, three times daily) and treated for 4 weeks. Clinical signs and symptoms of lead poisoning were also investigated and compared with the initial findings. The study found: Clinical improvement was significant in a number of clinical manifestations including irritability (p = 0.031), headache (p = 0.028), decreased deep tendon reflex (p=0.019) and mean systolic blood pressure (0.021) after treatment with garlic, but not d-penicillamine. BLCs [blood lead concentrations] were reduced significantly (p=0.002 and p=0.025) from 426.32±185.128 to 347.34±121.056μg/L and from 417.47±192.54 to 315.76±140.00μg/L in the garlic and d-penicillamine groups, respectively, with no significant difference (p=0.892) between the two groups . The frequency of side effects was significantly (p=0.023) higher in d-penicillamine than in the garlic group . Thus, garlic seems safer clinically and as effective as d-penicillamine. Therefore, garlic can be recommended for the treatment of mild-to-moderate lead poisoning. Clearly, despite the near equal reduction in measurable blood lead concentrations in both groups, improvements in various measured clinical manifestations were only found in the garlic group . Also, side effects were higher in the d-penicillamine group. These results clearly indicate the superiority of garlic over the drug and underscore how drug-based interventions often end up ‘normalizing’ target values, e.g. blood lead concentrations, without resulting in improvement in the quality of life or even the objective clinical signs and subjective symptoms of the treated patient; to the contrary, often the patient feels and is much worse off following drug treatment. Last year, a remarkable study published in the journal Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology revealed something very special about garlic: it is a natural detoxifier of lead and is not only as effective as a common chelation drug known as d-penicillamine at pulling this metal out of the body but is also much safer. The study was titled, “ Comparison of therapeutic effects of garlic and d-penicillamine in patients with chronic occupational lead poisoning,” and sought to confirm previous research in animals that showed garlic (Allium sativum) is effective in reducing blood and tissue lead concentrations. [1] The study took the measurements of the blood lead concentrations of 117 workers at a car battery plant who were randomly assigned to two groups of garlic (1.2 milligrams of allicin from approximately 1,000 mg of garlic extract, three times daily) and d-penicillamine (250 mg, three times daily) and treated for 4 weeks. Clinical signs and symptoms of lead poisoning were also investigated and compared with the initial findings. The study found: Clinical improvement was significant in a number of clinical manifestations including irritability (p = 0.031), headache (p = 0.028), decreased deep tendon reflex (p=0.019) and mean systolic blood pressure (0.021) after treatment with garlic, but not d-penicillamine. BLCs [blood lead concentrations] were reduced significantly (p=0.002 and p=0.025) from 426.32±185.128 to 347.34±121.056μg/L and from 417.47±192.54 to 315.76±140.00μg/L in the garlic and d-penicillamine groups, respectively, with no significant difference (p=0.892) between the two groups . The frequency of side effects was significantly (p=0.023) higher in d-penicillamine than in the garlic group . Thus, garlic seems safer clinically and as effective as d-penicillamine. Therefore, garlic can be recommended for the treatment of mild-to-moderate lead poisoning.

Lead exposure is ubiquitous in our modern age, and has been estimated to account for approximately 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally. [2] Exposure to this heavy metal results in harm to the cardiovascular, skeletal, gastrointestinal, kidney, reproductive and nervous systems of the human body. It has been identified to be particularly harmful to infants and children, whose developing nervous systems are far more susceptible to lead toxicity than those of adults. In fact, a 2008 PLoS study found decreased brain volume in adults who had been exposed to lead as children. [3] The standard of care involving drugs such as d-penicillamine is dismal, considering that the chemical has been linked to the following side effects: Anemia, Aplastic",0

That's not the actual brand or product name, but more of a concept that Hastings introduced at a recent tech conference for the Wall Street Journal. When speaking about the future of Netflix, Hastings said that, while movies and TV shows may be all the rage now, he anticipates they'll eventually become obsolete and will be rivaled by pharmaceutical substitutes, ""like a pill that entertains you."" This according to a tweet from the Wall Street Journal. Netflix's CEO says entertainment pills could be the next big thing This article struck me as funny....so Netflix own CEO is saying the next big thing in entertainment at home is a pill? I wonder how close his ties are with BIG PHARMA? This is a really crazy thing for a CEO of a major company to be suggesting....drugs for entertainment purposes...sounds like he is trying to progress towards legalization of something to actually entertain us while we watch TV.

9907,Dozens of Groups Call on Facebook to End Censorship,"Dozens of Groups Call on Facebook to End Censorship Posted on Oct 31, 2016 
By Deirdre Fulton / Common Dreams Facebook had more than 1 billion monthly active users in the second quarter of 2016. ( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) 
As Facebook comes under fire for its alleged censorship and tracking of activists and protesters, a coalition of more than 70 groups and individuals has demanded the social media behemoth “clarify its policy on removing video and other content, especially human rights documentation, at the request of government actors.” 
A letter —whose signatories include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), 350.org, Color of Change, and the Indigenous Environmental Network—sent Monday cites recent incidents including: the deactivation of Korryn Gaines’ account, the removal of iconic photographs, reports of suppression of Indigenous resistance , continued reports of Black activists’ content being removed, and the disabling of Palestinian journalists’ accounts. 
“These instances of censorship clearly point to the gaps in Facebook’s automation and content guidelines,” said Nicole Carty of the consumer watchdog SumOfUs, which coordinated the letter. “In order to mitigate these issues, Facebook must recognize these broader policy failures as human rights and free speech issues. From Black Lives Matter in the United States to journalists in Palestine, Facebook’s lack of transparency has resulted in reports of censorship on almost a weekly basis, which proves that this is not an individualized ‘glitch’ but a broader policy problem.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
At the same time, the letter notes that with the launch of the live-streaming video function Facebook Live, the site “is taking on an increasingly central role in controlling media that circulates through the public sphere. News is not just getting shared on Facebook: it’s getting broken there.” 
In turn, the letter reads, 
we believe that taking urgent action to increase transparency and protect users is the first step to reaching our shared vision of the world. It is important not only for the integrity of its platform and the trust of its community of users, but also for the future of our media. Because the stories that don’t get shared are as important as the ones that do. 
“Social media platforms are increasingly becoming the avenues for free speech, which makes ending censorship by companies like Facebook all the more critical,” added Chinyere’ Tutashinda, national organizer at the Center for Media Justice. “We are calling on Facebook to create policies that protect the most marginalized voices on their platforms: communities of color and low-income communities in the U.S. and across the globe.” 
Specifically, the letter calls on Facebook to: Make policies about how Facebook makes decisions to censor content clear and accessible to the public: whether those requests are from third-party agencies or through its algorithm—especially with respect to live broadcasting and journalistic content. Create a public appeals platform where users can appeal content censored by Facebook. Undergo an external audit on the equity and human rights outcomes of your Facebook Live and content censorship and data sharing policies. Refuse to disclose customer content and data to third-party agencies unless required to by law. 
Notably, the letter came on the same day that scores of Facebook users attempted to use the site’s “check-in” feature as a way to help shield Dakota Access Pipeline opponents by confusing law enforcement. While the fact-checking website Snopes largely debunked the strategy , it also quoted representatives from Sacred Stone Camp as saying that they “support the tactic, and think it is a great way to express solidarity.” TAGS:",0

9911,Close call: Russia-U.S. ‘near-miss’ problem moves to Syrian air space,"Print 
It looks like the vaunted air space coordination between the U.S. and Russia in Syria isn’t producing a safe flying environment. 
U.S. officials said Friday that a Russian fighter “flew dangerously close” to a U.S. warplane in eastern Syria on 17 October – something that can’t possibly be unavoidable, in light of the prior agreement by Russia and the U.S., in 2015, to deconflict air operations there. 
The AFP report provides this description: 
The near miss occurred late on October 17, when a Russian jet that was escorting a larger spy plane manoeuvred in the vicinity of an American warplane, Air Force Lieutenant General Jeff Harrigan said. 
The Russian jet came to “inside of half a mile”, he added. 
Another US military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the American pilot could feel the turbulence produced by the Russian jet’s engines. 
“It was close enough you could feel the jet wash of the plane passing by,” the official said. 
It appeared the Russian pilot had simply not seen the US jet, as it was dark and the planes were flying without lights. 
“I would attribute it to not having the necessary situational awareness given all those platforms operating together,” Harrigan said. 
One is tempted to go heavy on the sarcasm, in response to that. 
But OK. AFP offers a bit of analysis: 
The incident raises serious questions about the extent to which pilots are able to track the complex airspace they operate in. 
Well, sort of. Basically, there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space – and that’s your problem, right there. Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that U.S. systems can interpret, and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia. 
Looking at the air command/control assets that seem to be available for operations, there shouldn’t have to be a safety or awareness issue, at least not during planned air strike and air support operations. When they have aircraft operating, both coalitions, Russian and U.S., have the technical means to maintain good, fine-grain air pictures in the area in question. (The general area the encounter occurred in can be inferred from where the U.S. coalition conducted air strikes on 17 October . See map.) Locations of coalition air strikes in Syria on 17 Oct 2016. The locations at Ayn Isa, Abu Kamal, Al Shaddadi and possibly Palmyra could qualify as “eastern” Syria, the region reported for the close air encounter. If the Russian fighter was escorting the Tu-214R, the night Russian commanders expected to see ISIS fighters making their way into Syria, the easternmost area where Al-Shaddadi and Abu Kamal — or Al-Bukamal — are located would be the most likely. (Google map; author annotation) 
The Russians have their S-300 and S-400 radars and command vehicles, along with the radars and command center of the Syrian national system. Russia has also operated the A-50 Mainstay AWACS over Syria since December 2015, although there’s no way to know if it was operating on 17 October. The A-50 isn’t forward-based in Syria, but rather operates out of Mozdok in southern Russia. (It may well have been operating that night, given the other things going on.) 
The U.S. coalition has E-2C Hawkeyes from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) airwing, which come up from the Persian Gulf to support operations in both northern Iraq and eastern Syria.

The U.S. coalition can also interoperate right now with E-2Cs from FS Charles de Gaulle , which has been in the Eastern Mediterranean , and flying its airwing over Syria, since September. It’s not clear where Charles de Gaulle ’s E-2Cs are flying, but they are capable of providing interlocking air space coverage with Ike ’s E-2Cs, when both are airborne. French carrier FS Charles de Gaulle. (File image via Le Parisien) 
Working with de Gaulle on 17 October were also two destroyers, USS Ross (DDG-71) and FS Chevalier Paul , one or both of which would have been able to track Russian aircraft to some distance inland over Syria. (Their more-constant but less extensive air picture(s) would complement and enhance that of the airborne Hawkeyes.) 
These operational-level assets keeping up an area air picture supplement the on-scene information an individual aircraft has from its own radar system, as well as enabling the air defense command/control platform to keep each aircraft under combat direction. 
At the time of the encounter, U.S. and French systems had the ability to know where Russian aircraft were, even if the Russians had to be identified by default, rather than by positive confirmation from Identification Friend or Foe (IFF). (The Russians, recall, up in the Baltic, have been going out of their way to not “squawk” IFF in good faith where NATO systems can detect it. They presumably reserve the right to behave the same way over Syria. From what U.S. officials have sometimes been careful not to say, it sounds to me like that’s what they’re doing. That said, there aren’t so darn many unidentified aircraft zorching around over Syria at 500 knots that it would have to take very long to know you’ve got either a Russian or a Syrian jet fighter.) 
Russian systems also had the ability to know where U.S. coalition aircraft were on 17 October. It’s not credible to claim that they had no awareness. And they probably had the IFF codes of those aircraft, and knew whose they were, since the coalition is presumably squawking as per normal. 
The “incredibility” of the claim that the Russian aircraft “couldn’t see” the U.S. warplane is compounded by the fact that the Russian fighter was said to be escorting a “large spy plane.” This was probably the Tu-214R , Russia’s newest, uniquely capable airborne ISR platform, with a sensor suite somewhat similar to the U.S. E-8 JSTARS. If the Russian fighter escort really didn’t know that a U.S. fighter was within weapons range of the “spy plane,” the fighter pilot’s head should have been delivered on a platter 15 minutes after he got back on the ground. (The search sector of his radar isn’t an issue. He’s getting paid to make it comprehensive, maneuvering as necessary, while he’s up their escorting a high-value asset. The fighter plane was probably an Su-30SM using a Bars N011M series radar system, incidentally.) 
So it would take a lot of convincing for me to believe that the close encounter the night of 17 October occurred because of any inadequacy in system capability. The dangerously inadequate coordination arrangements the U.S. is tolerating are the real issue, I suspect. 
A couple of points about those arrangements. One, let’s review the assessment from earlier again: 
Basically, there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space – and that’s your problem, right there. Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that U.S. systems can interpret, and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia. 
This is the situation when two hostile forces are operating in the same air space. Another word for that is “combat.” There’s no political will for combat between the two forces in question, of course. But the mechanical arrangements of military operations in the battle space don’t reflect that. It’s an incredibly stupid situation. 
Two, the close encounter occurred at an interesting time; i.e., the second night of the ground assault on Mosul , which started on Sunday, 16 October. The U.S. had been striking targets around Mosul for about three days at that point, and had started pounding ISIS positions on the outskirts of Mosul with artillery late Saturday or early Sunday, according to local sources. Russia, at the time, was playing up a non-credible report that the U.S. planned to let thousands of ISIS fighters leave Mosul and move into Syria – implicitly to fight Syrian regime forces and thwart the intentions of the Russian coalition. (Trying to track such a stream of guerrilla evacuees, if the Russians really believed their own hype, would have been an ideal mission for the Tu-214R “spy plane.”) 
One more significant thing was happening at exactly the same time. A NATO AWACS contingent was deploying to Turkey to support the U.S. coalition in Syria and Iraq. Russia opposes that move. Although the NATO AWACS hadn’t flown a mission yet, its first mission was three days later, on 20 October. The Russians knew it was there, in Turkey, setting up for operations. 
In other theaters, Russia has been signaling dissatisfaction through dangerous, unsafe military encounters for many months now. We can conclude with strong confidence that that’s what has happened in Syria. We can expect it to happen again.",0

November 2016 Halloween-Horror: Schwer verletzter Junge (9) erhält überall nur Süßigkeiten statt Hilfe Saarbrücken (Archiv) - Pech für den kleinen Timmy (9)! Erst stürzte der Junge am Montagabend aus dem Fenster seines Kinderzimmers im ersten Stock und zog sich eine stark blutende Platzwunde zu. Doch dann kam es noch schlimmer: Als der Neunjährige blutüberströmt und desorientiert an verschiedenen Haustüren klingelte, um Hilfe zu erflehen, erhielt er stattdessen überall nur ein mildes Lächeln und jede Menge Süßigkeiten. Alles hatte wohl damit begonnen, dass der kleine Timmy abends in seinem Zimmer am Fenster saß und anderen Kindern bei ihrem bunten Halloween-Treiben zusah. ""Wir halten nichts von diesem amerikanischen Quatsch"", erklärten die Eltern des Jungen auf Anfrage. ""Deswegen hatte er Zimmerarrest, damit er nicht auf dumme Gedanken kommt."" Doch der Neunjährige war wohl zu neugierig. Er lehnte sich zu weit aus dem Fenster und stürzte drei Meter in die Tiefe. Dabei verdrehte er sich die Schulter und zog sich eine stark blutende Platzwunde an der Stirn zu. Fast genausogut wie Erste Hilfe: Süßkram Da niemand den Sturz mitangesehen hatte, musste der kleine Timmy sich selbst wieder aufraffen. Völlig desorientiert begann er die Suche nach einem Erwachsenen, traf aber nur auf verkleidete Kinder, die johlend davonrannten, sobald sie ihn sahen. Der Neunjährige begann an Haustüren zu klingeln und verzweifelt stöhnend um Hilfe zu betteln – vergeblich: ""Ja, der Kleine hat gestern bei mir geklingelt"", bestätigt ein Anwohner. ""War ganz bleich geschminkt und blutüberströmt. Außerdem baumelte sein Arm so komisch herum. Tolles Kostüm, aber ein wenig übertrieben für meinen Geschmack. Ich habe ihm trotzdem ein paar Hanutas und so saure Zungen gegeben."" Später rekonstruierte die Polizei, dass der kleine Timmy an etwa 50 verschiedenen Türen geklingelt haben muss und dabei über zehn Kilogramm Süßigkeiten geschenkt bekam. Außerdem erhielt er fünf ausführliche Vorträge darüber, dass eigentlich Reformationstag sei und wurde dreimal mit dem Gartenschlauch vertrieben. Ein älterer Herr hetzte sogar seinen Dackel auf den verletzten Jungen. Der kleine Timmy wurde heute in den frühen Morgenstunden bedeckt von einem Berg aus Bonbons, Lutschern und Schokolade in einem Vorgarten entdeckt und in ein Krankenhaus eingeliefert. Er befindet sich mittlerweile in stabilem Zustand. Allerdings konfiszierte die Polizei sämtliche Süßigkeiten, da diese laut einem Sprecher ""unter Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen ergaunert"" wurden. ssi; Foto oben: istockphoto, Foto rechts: © Jenifoto - Fotolia.com; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 1.11.12 Artikel teilen:",0
9913,"How Neocons Got ISIS Wrong, Too","How Neocons Got ISIS Wrong, Too November 2, 2016 
As Islamic State loses ground in Iraq and Syria, earlier demands from Official Washington’s neocons for a major reintroduction of U.S. troops appear to be just the latest misjudgment of these war hawks, as ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar explains. 
By Paul R. Pillar 
The so-called Islamic State or ISIS is on the decline, and its “caliphate” on the ground in Iraq and Syria is shrinking to extinction. In Syria, the group has lost about a quarter of the territory it used to control, including its access to the Turkish border, and recapture of its de facto capital in Raqqa is coming into sight. In Iraq, ISIS has lost half the territory it once had, and a coalition of forces is knocking on the door of the group’s biggest prize, the city of Mosul. 
We should reflect on the arguments we were hearing not very long ago that more force than the Obama administration was using would be needed to defeat the ISIS menace. ISIS was the main focus of the “do more in Syria” cries before the cries shifted more to the Syrian regime and its warfighting methods Journalist James Foley shortly before he was executed by an Islamic State operative. 
Typical was an op-ed by James Jeffrey of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, written not quite one year ago, that called for sending U.S. ground troops into the fight against ISIS and declared, “It’s obvious that defeat of the Islamic State is not going to happen absent a first-class, mobile ground force being launched to mate with overwhelming air power.” 
Well, ISIS is being defeated without such a U.S. ground force. In fact, the defeating is perhaps going too fast, in that the main question is not whether such defeat is happening but rather how unstable will be the situation left in the wake of an extinguished ISIS mini-state. 
The smash-and-run approach that was being advocated by many of those who argued that the Obama administration was not applying enough military force to the problem (Jeffrey advertised his proposal as a “short, crisp” operation that would not be anything like a prolonged counterinsurgency) would be even less likely to yield a favorable answer to that question. 
This is one of those occasions in which it is easy to forget the errors of policy recommendations that were never adopted, because without being put into effect the errors in analysis fortunately never get reflected in actual costs and fiascos. But the analysis can be just as bad as with ill-founded policy recommendations that are put into effect. We ought to take note of that, and to apply the relevant lessons in evaluating similar policy debates now and in the future. 
On one hand, U.S. military escalation already is proving to be unnecessary to squeeze the ISIS mini-state out of existence. But on the other hand, even an escalated U.S. military effort would be insufficient to make ISIS-fomented armed resistance in Syria and Iraq go away, mini-state or no mini-state. 
As Seth Jones explains in an analysis based on experience with prior resistance groups, an ISIS-led insurgency is likely to ensue. So much for short and crisp with any escalated U.S. military intervention. If “mission accomplished” is declared after Mosul and Raqqa fall, whoever is involved in the fight will be facing what U.S. troops faced earlier in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Unlike what smash-and-run proponents might suggest, going after ISIS is not a game of capture-the-flag or checkmating a king. 
Resisting Future Alarms 
Another reality that will be faced after the mini-state is extinguished concerns international terrorism. Anti-Western terrorism associated with ISIS was another of the alarm buttons, along with ISIS’s rapid territorial gains in 2014, that was connected to the cries to do more with military force and to do it fast. Islamic terrorists prepare to execute a wounded policeman after their attack on the offices of French magazine Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7, 2015. 
Jeffrey’s piece was again typical in beginning by stating that the “horrific Paris attacks” and the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt “demand an answer to this question: When will the United States realize that it urgently needs to use real military force to defeat the Islamic State threat?” 
We should note first that despite such supposed urgency, in the ensuing year the West has not been assaulted with any paralyzing wave of ISIS-fomented terrorism, even though ISIS and its caliphate have not yet been extinguished. 
Even after the caliphate is extinguished, however, there still will be terrorism in the West conducted in the name of ISIS, even if not paralyzing. For ISIS to look more and more like a loser rather than a winner will make it less of a lodestar for radicals in the West, but the terrorism that any such radicals conduct has never depended on control of a piece of real estate in the Middle East. 
After Mosul and Raqqa have fallen and Western leaders can declare, with some good reason, that the ISIS caliphate is no more, some bombings and shooting sprees will still occur in the West and will be labeled, at least on the basis of a perpetrator’s claim, as “ISIS attacks.” How will Americans and American politicians react to that? 
Based on experience, much of the reaction will consist of an urge to use military force, amid continuing insurgency in Iraq and Syria, to find and destroy a command center that is thought to organize and order such terrorism. But although some individual extremist leaders will be killed, no such center will be found. 
It will assume a place in U.S. military history comparable to the “Bamboo Pentagon” that was assumed to exist somewhere in Cambodia and to control all of the Communist insurgency in South Vietnam. Military operations aimed at the chimerical terrorist command center identified with ISIS will have the counterproductive effect of stimulating more of the very kind of anti-Western terrorism that the operations were intended to prevent. 
If we are fortunate, maybe instead a more accurate lesson will be drawn from the disjunction between a destroyed ISIS caliphate and continued international terrorism in ISIS’s name. The lesson would be that groups such as ISIS are less prime movers of terrorism and more a name and a cause to which radicals attach themselves to believe that they are acting on behalf of something larger than themselves and their own demons and grievances. 
A corollary is that the likelihood of Americans becoming victims of this brand of terrorism has less to do with battle lines on a Middle Eastern map than with whether our own actions generate and sustain such grievances.

9914,"Donald Trump, Global Warming, Facebook: Your Wednesday Briefing - The New York Times"," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Just a reminder, we’re off tomorrow for Thanksgiving and back on Friday. Here’s what you need to know today: • Team Trump’s possible new members.   Donald J. Trump named Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina to be ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Trump is also moving closer to filling more domestic cabinet positions. His Republican primary rival Ben Carson is being considered for housing secretary. Two Democrats, Harold Ford Jr. who represented Tennessee in the House, and Michelle A. Rhee, the former chancellor for Washington, D. C. public schools, have surfaced as contenders to run the transportation and education departments. • Trump at The Times. The   retreated from vows to pull out of the Paris climate accord and to investigate Hillary Clinton during his interview with Times reporters and editors. Mr. Trump also said that he didn’t “want to energize” white supremacists and that he had no legal obligation to step away from his business empire. Here are more highlights and the full transcript. • West Wing vs. left wing. Resistance is building against Representative Keith Ellison’s bid to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee. His supporters, who include Senators Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, view Mr. Ellison as a fresh face for the party. But President Obama’s advisers, uneasy with the progressive Minnesota lawmaker, are looking for an alternative, according to some party officials. Some in the president’s inner circle hoped that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would want the job, but his office said he’s “not interested. ” • Global warming news. Exxon Mobil, under fire over its past efforts to undercut climate science, is accusing the Rockefeller family of masterminding a conspiracy against it. The descendants of John D. Rockefeller, who founded the company that became Exxon Mobil, have long backed environmental causes.

The item was sold to an anonymous buyer for 140, 000 euros, or about $148, 500, according to Bubb Kuyper Auctions. (The poem was expected to fetch up to €50, 000.) Anne penned the short poem in a notebook belonging to her friend Jacqueline van Maarsen’s older sister, Christiane. The work is dated March 1942, just a few months before Anne, her older sister, her parents and another family went into hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam. Only her father survived the Holocaust. Only a few of her writings aside from the diary she kept while in hiding have emerged. This spring, a Massachusetts museum bought a copy of Grimm’s fairy tales in which Anne had inscribed her and her sister’s names. In 1989, another short piece of verse written in a friend’s notebook went on sale at Christie’s. The poem’s opening features traditional lines of encouragement and can be traced to a 1930s Dutch periodical. The closing verses, which the auction house has not traced, may be Anne’s own. “If others have reproached   what you have done wrong,” the poem ends, “Then be sure to amend your   is the best answer one can make. ” Christopher D.

[Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz said in a statement Monday there was intel regarding a potential “terror attack” against tourists in the Sinai peninsula. The crossing is open for those wanting to return from Egypt.

9916,"NYT: Like Henry VIII’s Thomas Cromwell, Trump’s Steve Bannon Is a ’Brilliant and Cunning’ Strategist ‘Trying to Destroy the Existing Order’","In his latest   New York Times columnist Timothy Egan explores the similarities between President Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon and King Henry VIII’s chief minister Thomas Cromwell, whom Bannon jokingly compared himself to when he told an interviewer last year, “I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors. ”[Egan writes that Bannon, like Cromwell, is a “brilliant and cunning” strategist who is “busy trying to destroy the existing order. ” But Egan ominously warns Bannon to remember the fate of his “historical doppelgänger. ” Cromwell was eventually executed for treason by the mercurial king he served.  From Egan’s New York Times column: Bannon is a voracious reader  —   of philosophy, theory and the hinge moments in history. Cromwell, who altered the course of the Western world in ways still being felt today, was Steve Bannon in feathered Tudor finery.   …     Readers of Hilary Mantel’s revisionist novels, and viewers of the BBC series based on her work, know Thomas Cromwell as a brooding, brilliant master of the court of King Henry VIII, from 1532 to 1540. The real Cromwell was a cunning conspirator who tore up the old order in service of a     king who forced a breakaway religion on his subjects. Or was he serving his own needs, an overarching plan? That’s the question we should ask about Bannon. Like Cromwell, the   in the West Wing is brilliant and cunning, and full of contradictions. He appears to be a   baby boomer, a   member of the Harvard Business   Sachs elite, a   Hollywood director and a   journalist. From his films on Sarah Palin to his time running Breitbart, he learned how to be a very good propagandist. It’s a role that has served him well in the White House.   …     As chief strategist, he recently vowed a daily fight for “deconstruction of the administrative state. ” This is a Cromwellian task aimed at overturning not just the traditional work of the federal government, but also the existing international order of treaties, trade pacts and alliances that has kept the world relatively safe since World War II. Trump’s cabinet is stocked with people whose goal is to neuter the agencies they head. Read the rest here. ",0
9917,Gold Spikes Over $60 Before Pulling Back After Trump Upset Shocks The World! But Here Is The Real Shocker…,"39 Views November 09, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
In the aftermath of what is being called the “greatest upset in political history,” Donald Trump has been elected the next president of the United States and this has markets in shock across the globe. What Trump Promised In His Speech Is Extremely Important In Trump’s speech he discussed “rebuilding America’s infrastructure” and making it “second to none.” The reason this is so important is because Trump has essentially confirmed the recent proposal for the Fed to print trillions of dollars, which will then be given to the U.S. Treasury to spend on rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure. This will not only juice the American economy and create a great many jobs, but it will also be extremely bullish for the gold market over the long-term… A GREAT OPPORTUNITY: To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet and is one of the greatest precious metals investment opportunities in the world CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored At one point the price of gold surged over $60 as it became clear that Donal Trump would be the next president of the United States. Although it has now pulled back and the dollar has bounced a bit, this has clearly not been a good result for the gold bears, who were heavily short the metal before the election results were announced. Silver also surged nearly 70 cents, breaking above $19 before pulling back. With regards to the trillions of dollars that will be injected into the U.S. economy, former Soros associate Victor Sperandeo, who oversees more than $3 billion, told KWN: “Eric, this is pure printing of money, but the theory is that because people don’t directly get that money, it won’t create hyperinflation. But when this begins, this will be the beginning of when serious inflation will come back. If this does happen you will get a huge amount of government spending that is going to juice the economy. But it will be the prelude to hyperinflation. So that is going to be the coming world event that will be the beginning of the end for the U.S. dollar.” Sperandeo then issued this bone-chilling warning: And as the hyperinflation unfolds, it will send the world into total chaos and people need to be prepared for that.” One thing is clear, a Donald Trump America will look very different than what the U.S. has looked like for the past 8 years. The question is, how much of a difference can a president make with the United States’ fiscal state in such a desperate situation? Regardless, like Brexit, this was definitely not what the elite had planned and it really was the greatest upsets in political history.

9918,"America Might Not Deserve Trump, But Dems and Hillary Deserved To Lose","Tweet Widget by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon 
President Donald Trump? How did such a thing happen? A competent and purposeful Clinton campaign should have beaten Donald Trump. How did Hillary Clinton and one-percenter Democrats snatch defeat from the jaws of certain victory? America Might Not Deserve Trump, But Dems and Hillary Deserved To Lose by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon 
It’s over. The crotch-grabbing racist con man beat the lying corporate warmonger. Donald Trump is president-elect of the US. 
It didn’t have to happen that way. Trump’s winning 58 million votes were a hair fewer than Clinton’s popular vote, a million or two less than Republican losers McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012, six and ten million behind Obama’s 2012 and 2008 numbers. The buffoonish Trump was elected with such a low turnout because Hillary Clinton’s campaign was even less competent and credible. To borrow the condescending language Barack Obama deploys before black audiences, Hillary’s campaign never gave Cousin Pookie much reason to get up off the couch and vote. 
Republican and Democratic parties are alike owned by their one-percenter investor/contributors. Democratic party shot callers decided they’d risk losing with Hillary Clinton rather than winning with Bernie Sanders. So Democratic party leadership, their media allies and the entire black political class got behind Hillary Clinton and helped collude and conspire to eliminate VT Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democrat with the best chance against any Republican opponent. 
Once Bernie Sanders was eliminated Hillary waged a lazy and ineffective campaign, playing a hand with just three cards. 
The first was the broken record of how unthinkable and unprecedented a disaster a Trump presidency would be… a clownish sexual predator who pronounced climate change a hoax and would criminalize abortion, open concentration camps, repeal Obamacare, legalize stop and frisk, build a wall, appoint neanderthals to the Supreme Court, deport six or ten million immigrants instead of Obama’s paltry two million and who might be in hock to the Russians. Except for the thing about the Russians, it’s roughly the same picture Democrats have drawn of every Republican presidential candidate since Nixon. A story told that many times just gets old. Party leaders counted on it anyway, and it wasn’t enough. That was incompetence. 
A second and relatively weak card Democrats played was conjuring up an Imaginary Hillary Clinton, a defender of womens’ and human rights who held hands with the moms of killer cop victims, and occasionally mumbled about black lives mattering and the need to reform the criminal justice system. But Hillary’s decades-long record as a tool of banksters, billionaires and one-percenters was so well established in the public mind that Imaginary Hillary was a difficult sell, not credible. 
The one-percenter Democrats’ third card, on which they staked a lot was the early and unconditional endorsement of Hillary Clinton by   and Michelle. This had proven effective in Chicago in 2011 and 2015 where Obama’s blessings in 2011 and 2015 were key to fastening Rahm Emanuel on the city’s jugular vein after a half century of Daley rule. The entire black political class got behind Hillary too, from civil rights icons who ruminated on how they hadn’t seen Bernie Sanders back in the day to some other wise heads who assured us a vote for the Green Party’s Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka was an act of “ narcissism ” or maybe white privilege . But at the end of  ’s time in office, the Obama endorsement didn’t carry the clout it used to. 
Thanks to two generations of lazy Democrats who refused to try to consolidate the victory of the 1965 Voting Rights Act the Supreme Court in 2013 nullified its key provisions, enabling a constellation of laws and practices aimed at limiting access to the ballot on the part of students, minorities, the elderly and constituencies likely to vote Democratic. In the 2016 election cycle these practices stripped another few million Democratic voters from the rolls. 
All in all, Democrats were the authors of their own defeat this presidential election. Hillary couldn’t campaign against the one percent because her party is a party of the one percent. Hillary Democrats including Bernie himself after the convention could no longer acknowledge joblessness, low wages, lack of housing, permanent war or the high cost of medical care or they’d be campaigning against themselves. 
Donald Trump didn’t win because of some mysterious upsurge of racism and nativism. He won because Hillary Clinton’s campaign was even less inspiring and less competent than his own, and worked hard to snatch its own defeat from the jaws of victory. America might not deserve President Donald Trump. But Hillary Clinton didn’t deserve to win, Bruce Dixon is managing editor at Black Agenda Report and co-chair of the GA Green Party.

9919,"Review: In Don DeLillo’s ‘Zero K,’ Daring to Outwit Death - The New York Times","Death stalks Don DeLillo’s characters  —   be it in the form of terrorism, the atomic bomb, assassination, suicide, war, earthquakes, murderous cults or “an airborne toxic event” passing over the landscape “like some death ship in a Norse legend. ” To try to stave off their fear of death, his people compulsively reach for belief systems, drugs, hobbies, organizing principles (from football to mathematical equations to stories) housekeeping rituals  —   anything that might hold the inevitable fact of mortality at bay. “All plots tend to move deathward,” the narrator of “White Noise” says. “This is the nature of plots. Political plots, terrorist plots, lovers’ plots, narrative plots, plots that are part of children’s games. We edge nearer death every time we plot. It is like a contract that all must sign, the plotters as well as those who are the targets of the plot. ” Mr. DeLillo’s haunting new novel, “Zero K”  —   his most persuasive since his astonishing 1997 masterpiece, “Underworld”  —   is a kind of bookend to “White Noise” (1985): somber and coolly futuristic, where that earlier book was satirical and darkly comic. In “Zero K,” two central characters seek to conquer death not by outrunning it but by submitting to it: They plan to be “chemically induced to expire” and frozen at a supersecret cryonics compound so that one day they might be resurrected  —   through a     science involving cellular regeneration and nanotechnology. One day, humans (at least rich ones) will have the option of being reborn as new and improved beings implanted with memories of their choice  —   music, family photographs, philosophical writings, “Russian novels, the films of Bergman, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky. ” “Zero K” gets off to a stilted start  —   with unfortunate echoes of Mr. DeLillo’s recent novels “Point Omega” (2010) “Falling Man” (2007) and “Cosmopolis” (2003) which exchanged his jazzy, tactile feel for contemporary life for strangely stylized, almost abstract musings on identity and fate. A third or so of the way in, however, this new novel kicks into gear as Mr. DeLillo begins to actively use his radar for the incongruities and chimeras of modern life. His story gradually opens outward to examine the ways science and religion have come to clash and converge in a world fearful of terrorism and war and eager to look to technology for solutions, even salvation. At the same time, “Zero K” opens inward to draw a portrait of the narrator Jeffrey’s emotionally fraught relationship with his chilly and controlling father  —   reminiscent of Nick Shay’s filial relationship in “Underworld,” one of the few DeLillo novels to delve beneath the brittle surface of its characters’ lives. At the beginning of “Zero K” Jeffrey is whisked off to a remote compound somewhere vaguely near Kazakhstan, where his billionaire father, Ross, has funded the Convergence project, which freezes and preserves the dead in anticipation of the day when both mind and body can be restored. A special unit called Zero K is for patients who make a conscious decision to “transition to the next level” before their natural deaths. Ross’s beloved wife, Artis, who has several disabling illnesses, has opted for this form of assisted suicide, and Ross, who is perfectly healthy, announces that he intends to accompany Artis on her journey into the afterlife. Jeffrey is understandably perturbed, wondering if his father has been brainwashed into some kind of dangerous cult, or whether his decision is a perverse manifestation, as an immensely wealthy man, of wanting to exert control over his life  —   in this case, by choosing to end it. He realizes that his reaction is complicated by his ambivalent feelings toward his father, who, decades ago, abandoned him and his mother. And that his own alienation (that state of mind shared by so many DeLillo protagonists) has roots in this Oedipal conflict. Mr. DeLillo’s depiction of the Convergence compound will trigger all sorts of associations for the reader. There are labyrinthine hallways with inaccessible rooms behind mysterious doors, reminiscent of those portals that Lewis Carroll’s Alice had difficulty entering in Wonderland. There are also odd, Kafkaesque exchanges with Convergence escorts who speak a New Agey bureaucratese that masks their sinister work and    glimpses of Artis and other patients being groomed for the next stage of their journeys, when their bodies will be placed in superinsulated pods (their brains and other vital organs having already been harvested for separate preservation, like those of Egyptian mummies). If there are echoes in these pages of Stanley Kubrick’s classic 1968 movie, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” Mr. DeLillo’s vision turns out to be considerably darker. He is skeptical of those who might regard human life as a step on an evolutionary ladder between the apes and a futuristic race of star children. In fact, “Zero K” suggests that the hope that technology will supply a solution to the problem of mortality (as religion once did) is both delusional and a dangerous distraction from the here and now. Film footage of natural and   catastrophes play on screens at the Convergence, and its robotlike employees seem to welcome the impending   as a new beginning. All the themes that have animated Mr. DeLillo’s novels over the years are threaded through “Zero K”  —   from the seduction of technology and mass media to the power of money and the fear of chaos. This novel does not possess  —   or aspire toward  —   the symphonic sweep of “Underworld” it’s more like a chamber music piece. But once the novel shakes off its labored start, “Zero K” reminds us of Mr. DeLillo’s almost   powers as a writer and his understanding of the strange, contorted shapes that eternal human concerns (with mortality and time) can take in the new millennium.",0

Breitbart’s Jerome Hudson reported on the event “which featured speeches from political figures including New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and actors Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, and Mark Ruffalo. ” Moore told the crowd that America has entered into a “very dangerous” time, after electing a “sociopath. ” “With a lot of work on our part, we will stop this man,” Moore shouted. “He will not last four years. ” “If your rep is a Democrat, tell   you expect them to AGGRESSIVELY fight the Trump agenda  —   and if they don’t, you will work with others to support a true progressive in the Democratic primary in 2018,” Moore added.  10:40 PM:   protestors continue to gather outside the National Press Club in Washington, D.

McCabe (@NeilWMcCabe) January 20, 2017,  10:09 PM: AP reports: 10 Promises Trump Made for His First Day, WASHINGTON (AP)  —   Behind in the polls in late October, Donald Trump ventured to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to give American voters a “contract” detailing what he would achieve during his first day in office. Beneath a list of 18 major actions was the flourish of Trump’s familiar signature and a blank space for voters to sign. But as Trump becomes president on Friday, it remains hazy as to which actions he will immediately take. The list included several items likely to fire up Republican voters but backed up by scant policy. It includes “begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants” and “cancel every unconstitutional executive action   …     by President Obama. ” Trump has already backed down from one pledge to label China a currency manipulator, recently saying he would first like to speak with the Chinese leadership. A look at 10 of the key promises Trump made for his first day as president:  —  Introduce a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits.  —  Freeze hiring for the federal government to reduce payrolls, although the military, public safety and public health agencies would be exempt.  —  Ban White House and congressional officials from becoming lobbyists for five years after they leave the government.  —  Announce plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico or withdraw from the deal.  —  Formally withdraw from the   Partnership.  —  Lift restrictions on mining coal and drilling for oil and natural gas.  —  Remove any   roadblocks to energy projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline.  —  Cancel U. S. payments to U. N. climate change programs and redirect the money to U. S. water and environmental infrastructure.  —  Stop all federal funding to “sanctuary cities,” places where local officials don’t arrest or detain immigrants living in the country illegally for federal authorities.  —  Suspend immigration from regions associated with terrorism where vetting is difficult. 9:58 PM: Breitbart News’ Ian Hanchett reports: During a live report on Thursday’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on the Fox News Channel, a young man protesting in Washington, DC claimed to have started a fire in the street, “Because I felt like it.

C. on the eve of his inauguration. He told a cheering crowd that in 2018 Republicans are going to win more seats in the Senate. Breitbart’s Neil Munro reports: “We have an election coming up in two years,” Trump told the crowd after thanking his early and his late donors. “We’re going to get a lot of them elected  …     [GOP Sen.] Mitch McConnell is here, he’s smiling so big,” Trump joked. McConnell is the GOP leader of the Senate. In 2018, he will have the opportunity to push his narrow 52 to 48 majority up to dominant 58 or even 60 seats. If the GOP reaches 60 Senate seats, then McConnell will usually be able to break the Democrats’s “filibuster” ability to block legislation. Forty Senators are needed to maintain a filibuster.   Senate Democrats face   in November 2018, while only eight Republicans must face the voters. Among the Democrats, nine Senators are either freshmen or won less than 53 percent in their prior election, and four will face the voters in states won by Trump.

I also have to thank our incredible military right here. Thank you. Stand up, please. You guys were really great. Thank you. So this journey began 18 months ago. I had something to do with it, but you had much more to do with it than I did. I’m the messenger. I’m just the messenger. And we were tired. And I love you. Believe me, I love you. We all got tired of seeing what was happening. And we wanted change, but we wanted real change. And I look so forward to tomorrow. We’re going to see something that is going to be so amazing. So many people have poured into Washington, D. C. This started out tonight being a small little concert, and then we had the idea maybe we’ll do it in front of the Lincoln Memorial. I don’t know if it’s ever been done before. But if it has, very seldom. And the people came by the thousands and thousands, and here we are tonight, all the way back. All the way back. So it’s a movement that began, it’s a movement that started, and it’s a movement like we’ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say. There’s never been a movement like this and it’s something very, very special. And we’re going to unify our country, and our phrase  —   you all know it, half of you are wearing the hat  —   “Make America Great Again. ” But we’re going to make America great for all of our people, everybody. Everybody throughout our country. That includes the inner cities, that includes everybody.  And we’re going to do a special job, and I can only tell you that 18 months ago, we never knew, a lot of people didn’t know, some people had a feeling. A lot of people didn’t give us much of a chance, but we understood what was happening. And that last month of the campaign, when I traveled around to every place that you can imagine. State after state after state, speech after speech. And we had ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand people. There was never an empty seat, just like tonight. We didn’t know if anybody would even come tonight. This hasn’t been done before. And you look. It was the same way. And we all knew that last month of the campaign. I think a lot of us knew the first week of the campaign, but that last month of the campaign we knew that something special was happening.  And I can only tell you this: The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn’t want to give us credit. Because they forgot about a lot of us. On the campaign I called it “the forgotten man” and “the forgotten woman. ” Well, you’re not forgotten anymore. That I can tell you. Not forgotten anymore. So I want to thank my great family, my incredible wife Melania. They’ve been so supportive, and it wasn’t easy for them. But they have been so supportive. I want to thank you, most importantly. And I promise you that I will work so hard. We’re going to get it turned around. We’re going to get our jobs back. We’re not going to let other countries take our jobs any longer. We’re going to build up our great military. We’re going to build it up. We’re going to strengthen our borders. We’re going to do things that haven’t been done for our country for many, many decades. It’s going to change. I promise you it’s going to change. So I’ll see you tomorrow. And I don’t care frankly if it’s going to be beautiful or if it’s going to rain like crazy. Makes no difference to me. I have a feeling it’s going to be beautiful. But I will see you tomorrow, and I’m going to be cheering you on. You’re going to cheer me on, but I’m going to be cheering you on. Because what we’ve done is so special. All over the world they’re talking about it. All over the world. And I love you folks, and we’re going to work together. And we are going to  —   make America great again. And I’ll add: Greater than ever before! Thank you very much and enjoy the fireworks.

9921,Obama Confronts Complexity of Using a Mighty Cyberarsenal Against Russia - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Over the past four months, American intelligence agencies and aides to President Obama assembled a menu of options to respond to Russia’s hacking during the election, ranging from the obvious  —   exposing President Vladimir V. Putin’s financial ties to oligarchs  —   to the innovative, including manipulating the computer code that Russia uses in designing its cyberweapons. But while Mr. Obama vowed on Friday to “send a clear message to Russia” as both a punishment and a deterrent, some of the options were rejected as ineffective, others as too risky. If the choices had been better, one of the aides involved in the debate noted recently, the president would have acted by now. In his last weeks in office, that Situation Room debate has confronted a naturally cautious president with a complex calculus that   Donald J. Trump will soon inherit: how to use the world’s most powerful cyberarsenal at a moment when the United States, as the election showed, remains highly vulnerable. “Is there something we can do to them, that they would see, they would realize 98 percent that we did it, but that wouldn’t be so obvious that they would then have to respond for their own honor?” David H. Petraeus, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Mr. Obama, asked on Friday, at a conference here sponsored by Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. “The question is how subtle do you want it, how damaging do you want it, how do you try to end it here rather than just ratchet it up?” The idea of exposing Mr. Putin’s links to oligarchs was set aside after some aides argued that it would not come as a shock to Russians. Still, there are proposals to cut off leaders in Mr. Putin’s inner circle from their hidden bank accounts in Europe and Asia. There is an option to use sanctions under a   executive order to ban international travel for senior officials in the G. R. U. the Russian military intelligence unit that American spy agencies say stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, then doled them out to WikiLeaks, betting that media outlets eager for insider details would amplify them, doing the Kremlin’s work for it. The National Security Agency and its military cousin, the United States Cyber Command, which is responsible for   warfare, have worked up other ideas, officials said, though some have been rejected by the Pentagon. Those plans could deploy the   arsenal of cyberweapons assembled at a cost of billions of dollars during Mr. Obama’s tenure to expose or neutralize some of the hacking tools favored by Russia’s spies  —   the digital equivalent of a   strike. But the selection of targets by Americans and the accuracy of that retaliation could also expose software “implants” that the United States has patiently inserted and nurtured in Russian networks, in case of future cyberconflicts. And the revelation in August about some of the N. S. A. ’s own tools for breaking into foreign computer networks has raised the possibility that the Russians are already inside American networks and are sending a warning that they can respond in kind. All of this has led Mr. Obama to ask how the Russians might escalate the confrontation, and whether the United States in the end may have more to lose than Russia. “He doesn’t have great options,” said Michael D. McFaul, formerly one of Mr. Obama’s top national security aides and then his ambassador to Moscow. Mr. Obama is the president who, in his first year in office, reached for some of the most sophisticated cyberweapons on earth to blow up parts of Iran’s nuclear facilities. Now, at the end of his presidency, he has run headlong into a different challenge in the cyberwarfare arena. The president has reached two conclusions, senior officials report: The only thing worse than not using a weapon is using it ineffectively. And if he does choose to retaliate, he has insisted on maintaining what is known as “escalation dominance,” the ability to ensure you can end a conflict on your terms. Mr. Obama hinted as much at his news conference on Friday, as he was set to leave for his annual Hawaii vacation, his last as president. “Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you,” he said. “But it is also important to us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it, we will do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will. ” He rejected calls for a big, symbolic show of power, dismissing the idea that if the United States “thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians. ” The goal, Mr. Obama said, was to come up with a response “that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future but does not create problems for us. ” There is not much new in tampering with elections, except for the technical sophistication of the tools. For all the outrage voiced by Democrats and Republicans in the past week about the Russian action  —   with the notable exception of Mr. Trump, who has dismissed the intelligence findings as politically motivated  —   it is worth remembering that trying to manipulate elections is a   American art form. The C. I. A. got its start trying to influence the outcome of Italy’s elections in 1948, as the author Tim Weiner documented in his book “Legacy of Ashes,” in an effort to keep Communists from taking power. Five years later, the C. I. A. engineered a coup against Mohammad Mossadegh, Iran’s democratically elected leader, when the United States and Britain installed the Shah. “The military coup that overthrew Mosaddeq and his National Front cabinet was carried out under CIA direction as an act of U. S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government,” the agency concluded in one of its own reports, declassified around the 60th anniversary of those events, which were engineered in large part by Kermit Roosevelt Jr. a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt. There were similar interferences over the years in Guatemala, Chile and even in Japan, hailed as a model of   War II democracy, where the Liberal Democratic Party owes its early grip on power in the 1950s and 1960s to millions of dollars in covert C. I. A. support. The only differences this year are that the effort was directed at the United States, and that it was cyberenabled, giving Moscow a tool to amplify its efforts through the echo chamber of social media and news organizations that quoted from the leaked emails. “What has changed is that this was using cyberspace for advancing a political objective,” said Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr. who served as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until he retired last year. Cybertechniques, he said, have amplified an old form of “political warfare, and the issue is not whether it successfully influenced the election  —   but the fact that they did it. ” Over the past few months, an administration that prided itself on its work on cyberoffense and cyberdefense has learned a hard lesson: When it came to the 2016 election, an economically failing Russia, dismissed by Mr. Obama on Friday for its inability to grow or to innovate, exploited giant holes in the American system. Mr. Obama conceded that he first heard about the attack on the Democratic National Committee “early last summer,” or nine months after the F. B. I. first alerted   D. N. C. officials about what had happened. That now appears to be critical lost time. If Mr. Obama had confronted the Russians immediately, in public or in the kind of private warning he said he delivered to Mr. Putin only three months ago during a meeting in China, the United States might have derailed the hacking campaign before it harvested and revealed thousands of emails. But the election hacking also raised questions about whether the American fixation on a “cyber Pearl Harbor”  —   a devastating attack on the power grid, cellphone network, financial system or   gas pipelines  —   overlooked a more obvious vulnerability. As a detailed account in The New York Times last Wednesday revealed, the D. N. C. had virtually no protections for its electronic systems, and Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, had failed to sign up for the “  authentication” on his Gmail account. Doing so probably would have foiled what Mr. Obama called a fairly primitive attack. Now the question facing Mr. Obama is how public a retaliation to execute. The president laid out a case on Friday for acting with subtlety, so as not to start a    conflict. But as Joseph Nye, a strategist on   soft power, noted on Friday, “The reason to make some of this public is not just to deter the Russians, it is to deter others as well,” in future elections. It is possible, said Mr. McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, that Mr. Obama’s most lasting contribution may be to get the details of the Russian hack declassified and to publish a report he has instructed the intelligence community to assemble before he leaves office. “Given that Obama only has a few more weeks in office, I think he needs to focus his remaining time on attribution  —   that is declassification of intelligence so that there is no ambiguity about the Russian actions,” Mr. McFaul said. That “is completely within his powers,” he added, and would spur more congressional investigations regardless of the stance taken by Mr. Trump on the hack. Mr. Obama’s comments on Friday have led Democrats to demand further action. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the response should mix “additional economic sanctions along with our allies, and clandestine means of exacting a cost on the Russians for their flagrant meddling in our election. ” “I have little confidence,” he continued, “that the incoming president will take the actions necessary to make the Russians pay any price for the most consequential ‘active measures’ campaign against us in history. ”",0
9922,"Roger Moore, Star of 7 James Bond Films, Dies at 89 - Breitbart","LONDON (AP)  —   Roger Moore, the suavely insouciant star of seven James Bond films, has died in Switzerland. He was 89. [The British actor died Tuesday after a short battle with cancer, according to a family statement posted on Moore’s official Twitter account.  “We know our own love and admiration will be magnified many times over, across the world, by people who knew him for his films, his television shows and his passionate work for UNICEF, which he considered to be his greatest achievement,” the statement said. Moore’s relaxed style and sense of whimsy, which relied heavily on the arched eyebrow, seemed a commentary on the essential ridiculousness of the Bond films, in which the handsome British secret agent was as adept at mixing martinis, bedding beautiful women and ordering gourmet meals as he was at disposing of   trying to take over the world. “To me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous, so outrageous,” he once said. “I mean, this man is supposed to be a spy and yet, everybody knows he’s a spy. Every bartender in the world offers him martinis that are shaken, not stirred. What kind of serious spy is recognized everywhere he goes? It’s outrageous. So you have to treat the humor outrageously as well. ” While he never eclipsed Sean Connery in the public’s eye as the definitive James Bond, Moore did play the role of secret agent 007 in just as many films as Connery did, and he managed to do so while “finding a joke in every situation,” according to film critic Rex Reed. The actor, who came to the role in 1973 after Connery tired of it, had already enjoyed a long career in films and television, albeit with mixed success. He was remembered warmly by fans of the popular U. S.   TV series “Maverick” as Beauregarde Maverick, the English cousin of the Wild West’s Maverick brothers, Bret and Bart. He also starred in the 1959 U. S. series “The Alaskans. ” In England, he had a   TV hit with “The Saint,” playing Simon Templar, the enigmatic action hero who helps put wealthy crooks in jail while absconding with their fortunes. By the time the series, which also aired in the United States, ended in 1969, his partnership with its producers had made him a wealthy man. Such success followed a Time magazine review of one of his earliest films, 1956′s “Diane,” in which his performance opposite Lana Turner was dismissed as that of “a lump of English roast beef. ” In the 1970s, film critic Vincent Canby would dismiss Moore’s acting abilities as having “reduced all human emotions to a series of variations on one gesture, the raising of the right eyebrow. ” Born in London, the only child of a policeman, Moore had studied painting before enrolling in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He played a few small roles in theater and films before his mandatory army duty, then moved to Hollywood in the 1950s. He appeared opposite Elizabeth Taylor in 1954′s “The Last Time I Saw Paris” and with Eleanor Parker in “Interrupted Melody” the following year. In 1970, he became managing director for European production for Faberge’s Brut Productions. With the company, he   with Tony Curtis in “The Persuaders!” for British television and was involved in producing “A Touch of Class,” which won a   Oscar for Glenda Jackson. Three years later, he made his first Bond film, “Live and Let Die. ” He would make six more, “The Man With the Golden Gun,” ″The Spy Who Loved Me,” ″Octopussy,” ″Moonraker,” ″For Your Eyes Only and “A View to a Kill” over the next 12 years. And while the Bond of the Ian Fleming novels that the films were based on was generally described as being in his 30s, Moore would stay with the role until he was 57. He continued to work regularly in films after handing over Bond to Timothy Dalton, but never with the same success. His   films included such forgettable efforts as “The Quest” with   Van Damme and “Spice World” with the Spice Girls. In 1991, Moore became a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF, having been introduced to the role by the late actress Audrey Hepburn. As Hepburn had, he threw much of his energy into the task. “I felt small, insignificant and rather ashamed that I had traveled so much making films and ignored what was going on around me,” he said in describing how the work had affected him. In 1996, when his UNICEF job took him to the World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, he disclosed that he too had been a victim. “I was molested when I was a child  —   not seriously  —   but I didn’t tell my mother until I was 16, because I felt that it was something to be ashamed of,” he told The Associated Press. He gave no details, but said it was important to encourage young victims not to feel guilty. “They’re being exploited. We have to tell them that,” Moore said. Moore received the Dag Hammarskjold Inspiration Award for his work with UNICEF and was named a commander in France’s National Order of Arts and Letters in 2008, an award he said was worth “more than an Oscar. ” That same year he published an autobiography, “My Word Is My Bond,” which included details about his work on the Bond films, his friendship with Hepburn, his encounters with Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor and other stars, and his health struggles  —   including a bout with prostate cancer, which he beat. Moore was divorced three times, from skater Doorn Van Steyn in 1953, English singer Dorothy Squires in 1969 and Italian actress Luisa Mattioli, the mother of his children Deborah, Geoffrey and Christian, in 2000. He married a fourth time, in 2002, to Swedish socialite Kristina Tholstrup.",0
9923,Young White Men 'Excited' to Ruin Country With Third-Party Vote,"Topics: Hillary Clinton , Donald Trump , 2016 Presidential Election , Men , Hillary Clinton emails , Jill Stein   Ah, the USA. You had a nice run. Well, not 'nice' really, but not awful. Well parts of it were awful, but - oh, never 
NEW YORK, NY - A mere twenty-four hours before Election Day, it appears there's one group of voters Hillary Clinton still hasn't managed to win over: young, white men. A recent survey revealed that this group is overwhelmingly reluctant to cast their vote for the only candidate in the 2016 election with any real chance of defeating Actual Yam in a Wig and Part-time Hitler Impersonator Donald Trump. 
Chad Chadderdon, one such millennial, says that Clinton still doesn't seem trustworthy to him. 
""She's been in politics for like thirty years, so it seems like maybe she's been plotting to be president this whole time, like she had career goals or something, and that seems suspicious to me. 
""With Bernie it always seemed like he'd just rolled out of bed and decided to run for president,"" he adds, tearing up at the mention of the beloved Senator. ""Maybe if Hillary stopped brushing her hair, I'd feel better about her."" 
But the real problem with Clinton? Her emails. 
""It just shows how out-of-touch she really is,"" says Mark Markman, one of Chad's fraternity brothers. ""I mean who even uses email anymore? It's all about Snapchat now."" 
So, if not Clinton, who will these young, white men be voting for on November 8th? 
""I'm going with Jill Stein,"" says Chad. ""Sure, she's been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers and it's unclear whether she actually knows how the government works, but at least her voice doesn't irritate me."" 
Mark, on the other hand, plans to vote for former CIA operations officer Evan McMullin, who's been gaining ground in the state everyone would forget about if it weren't for Mormons, Utah. 
""Nobody's ever heard of him, and I like that,"" he says. ""And if he gets enough votes, maybe he'll have a real run of it in 2020. I wanna be able to say I voted for McMullin before everybody else did."" 
Overall, young white men seem energized to cast their votes tomorrow, probably because they don't really have that much at stake here. 
""It's nice to finally feel like we don't need our parents to ruin the country for us, anymore,"" says Chad. ""We can fuck shit up all on our own.""

9924,Comment on Nomi Prins: Hillary Clinton Will Continue the Big Bank Protection Racket by EndOfTheWorld,"by Yves Smith 
Yves here. It’s hardly a secret that the Clintons are deeply loyal to Wall Street. Bob Rubin and his numerous well-heeled followers are a powerful, arguably dominant, faction in the Democratic party, and they are tightly aligned with the Clintons. 
Nomi Prins gives a useful overview of how Hillary has attempted to blame the financial crisis on everything but the deregulation that her husband supported and the reckless behavior that resulted and how her anti-bank noises, like her criticism of Wells Fargo, is tepid and late in coming. 
However, I quibble with some of her article. It’s surprising to see her single out Gary Gensler, former head of the CFTC, as a bank crony. Gensler is widely seen as pushing for much tougher oversight and enforcement despite being in the disadvantaged position of being at a secondary regulator. Recall that he was up against Bernanke and Geithner, a weak Mary Shapiro at the SEC, and an indifferent-to-captured Obama at the helm. 
It’s also surprising to see Prins fail to mention the cronies rumored to be Clinton’s top picks for Treasury Secretary: Larry Fink of BlackRock and Tony James of Blackstone. Both firms would profit ginormously if the Wall Street looting plan that Hillary supports and James is promoting, that of having all workers pay 3% of their pay into mandatory retirement accounts, were to become law. 
As we’ve indicated, the cost of this “fix” is greater than any of the ideas proposed to shore up Social Security (as opposed to cut it by stealth). I hate to say it, but I believe Prins’ failure to flag this risk is due to her still hewing to orthodox financial views and thus believing that Federal deficits are a problem, as opposed to desirable, most of the time, and regarding senior members of the asset management heavyweights as less dangerous than executives of TBTF banks. Since even the modest re-regulation that has taken place since the crisis has increased shadow banking, and firms like Blackrock and Blackstone are major players, it would be naive to depict them as problem-free and disinterested. 
By Nomi Prins, a former Wall Street executive and the author of six books of which the most recent is All the Presidents’ Bankers: The Hidden Alliances That Drive American Power (Nation Books). Originally published at TomDispatch 
As this endless election limps toward its last days, while spiraling into a bizarre duel over vote-rigging accusations, a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order. The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office — given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street’s practices and predation. 
At the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn’t be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn’t paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag , and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we’re offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn’t look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. 
With less than two weeks to go before E-day — despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year — the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on November 9th, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton’s America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump’s version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. 
None of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn’t even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, too big to fail, or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of “ Trumped-up, trickle down economics ” (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). 
In this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007-2008 was not mainly due to “tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy” or a “failure to invest in the middle class,” two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people’s bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. 
Given that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it’s reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she’ll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. 
Consider President Obama’s current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton’s White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president. Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street — as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do. He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton’s former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman ) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors. In 2009 , Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. 
Lew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton’s Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs , Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama’s first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state . 
One possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton’s Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was — I’m sure you won’t be shocked — a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary’s, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its “mistakes.” 
This thru-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the “talking heads” and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality , declining social mobility , and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn’t an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation’s main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks — Citigroup was the exception — still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis. 
Exploring a Two-Faced World 
Politicians regularly act one way publicly and another privately, as Hillary was “outed” for doing by WikiLeaks via its document dump from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s hacked email account. Such realities should be treated as neither shockers nor smoking guns. Everybody postures. Everybody lies. Everybody’s two-faced in certain aspects of their lives. Politicians just make a career out of it. 
What’s problematic about Hillary’s public and private positions in the economic sphere, at least, isn’t their two-facedness but how of a piece they are. Yes, she warned the bankers to “ cut it out ! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors!”— but that was no demonstration of strength in relation to the big banks. Her comments revealed no real understanding of their precise role in exacerbating a fixable subprime loan calamity and global financial crisis, nor did her finger-wagging mean anything to Wall Street. 
Keep in mind that, during the build-up to that crisis, as banks took advantage of looser regulations, she collected more than $7 million from the securities and investment industry for her New York Senate runs ( $18 million during her career). In her first Senate campaign, Citigroup was her top contributor. The four Wall-Street-based banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) all feature among her top 10 career contributors. As a senator, she didn’t introduce any bills aimed at reforming or regulating Wall Street. During the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, she did introduce five (out of 140) bills relating to the housing crisis, but they all died before making it through a Senate committee. So did a bill she sponsored to curtail corporate executive compensation. Though she has publicly called for a reduction in hedge-fund tax breaks (known as “closing the carried interest loophole”), including at the second debate , she never signed on to the bill that would have done so (one that Obama co-sponsored in 2007). Perhaps her most important gesture of support for Wall Street was her vote in favor of the $700 billion 2008 bank bailout bill. (Bernie Sanders opposed it.) 
After her secretary of state stint, she returned to the scene of banking crimes. Many times. As we know, she was also paid exceedingly well for it. Friendship with the Clintons doesn’t come cheap . As she said in October 2013, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments’ Symposium, “running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle.” 
Between 2013 and 2015, she gave 12 speeches to Wall Street banks, private equity firms, and other financial corporations, reaping a whopping $2,935,000 for them. In her 2016 presidential run, the securities and investment sector (aka Wall Street) has contributed the most of any industry to PACs supporting Hillary: $56.4 million . 
Yes, everybody needs to make a buck or a few million of them. This is America after all, but Hillary was a political figure paid by the same banks routinely getting slapped with criminal settlements by the Department of Justice. In addition, the Clinton Foundation counted as generous donors all four of the major Wall Street-based mega-banks. She was voracious when it came to such money and tone-deaf when it came to the irony of it all. 
Glass-Steagall and Bernie Sanders 
One of the more illuminating aspects of the Podesta emails was a series of communications that took place in the fall of 2015. That’s when Bernie Sanders was gaining traction for, among other things, his calls to break up the big banks and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Clinton administration’s dismantling of that act in 1999 had freed the big banks to use their depositors’ money as collateral for risky bets in the real estate market and elsewhere, and so allowed them to become ever more engorged with questionable securities. 
On December 7, 2015, with her campaign well underway and worried about the Sanders challenge, the Clinton camp debuted a key Hillary op-ed , “How I’d Rein in Wall Street,” in the New York Times . This followed two months of emails and internal debate within her campaign over whether supporting the return of Glass-Steagall was politically palatable for her and whether not supporting it would antagonize Senator Elizabeth Warren. In the end, though Glass-Steagall was mentioned in passing in her op-ed, she chose not to endorse its return. 
She explained her decision not to do so this way (and her advisers and media apostles have stuck with this explanation ever since): “Some have urged the return of a Depression-era rule called Glass-Steagall , which separated traditional banking from investment banking. But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, weren’t traditional banks, so Glass-Steagall wouldn’t have limited their reckless behavior. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall help contain other parts of the ‘shadow banking’ sector, including certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank institutions.” 
Her entire characterization of how the 2007-2008 banking crisis unfolded was — well — wrong. Here’s how traditional banks (like JPMorgan Chase) operated: they lent money to investment banks like Lehman Brothers so that they could buy more financial waste products stuffed with subprime mortgages that these traditional banks were, in turn, trying to sell. They then backed up those toxic financial products through insurance companies like AIG, which came close to collapse when what it was insuring became too toxically overwhelming to afford. AIG then got a $182 billion government bailout that also had the effect of bailing out those traditional banks (including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which became “traditional” during the crisis). In this way, the whole vicious cycle started with the traditional banks that hold your deposits and at the same time could produce and sell those waste products thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. So yes, the loss of that act caused the crisis and, in its wake, every big traditional bank was fined for crisis-related crimes. 
Hillary won’t push to bring back Glass-Steagall. Doing so would dismantle her husband’s legacy and that of the men he and she appointed to public office. Whatever cosmetic alterations may be in store, count on that act remaining an artifact of the past, since its resurrection would dismay the bankers who, over the past three decades, made the Clintons what they are. 
No wonder many diehard Sanders supporters remain disillusioned and skeptical — not to speak of the fact that their candidate featured dead last ( 39th ) on a list of recommended vice presidential candidates in the Podesta emails. That’s unfortunately how much his agenda is likely to matter to her in the Oval Office. 
Go Regulate Yourselves! 
Before he resigned with his nine-figure golden parachute, Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf addressed Congress over disclosures that 5,300 of his employees had created two million fake accounts, scamming $2.4 million from existing customers. The bank was fined $ 185 million for that (out of a total $10 billion in fines for a range of other crimes committed before and during the financial crisis). 
In response, Hillary wrote a letter to Wells Fargo’s customers. In it, she didn’t actually mention Stumpf by name, as she has not mentioned any Wall Street CEO by name in the context of criminal activity. Instead, she simply spoke of “he.” As she put it, “He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.” She added, “Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch.” 
She does have a plan to fine banks for being too big, but they’ve already been fined repeatedly for being crooked and it hasn’t made them any smaller or less threatening. As their top officials evidently view the matter, paying up for breaking the law is just another cost of doing business. 
Hillary also wrote, “If any bank can’t be managed effectively, it should be broken up.” But the question is: Why doesn’t ongoing criminal activity that threatens the rest of us correlate with ineffective management — or put another way, when was the last time you saw a major bank broken up? And don’t hold your breath for that to happen in a new Clinton administration either. 
In her public letter, she added , “I’ll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress.” On the other hand, at that same Goldman Sachs symposium , while in fundraising mode, she gave bankers a pass relative to regulators and commented: “Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and [I have] a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it.” 
She has steadfastly worked to craft explanations for the financial crisis and the Great Recession that don’t endanger the banks as we presently know them. In addition, she has supported the idea of appointing insider regulators, insisting that “the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” (Let’s not forget that former Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Hank Paulson ran the Treasury Department while the crisis brewed.) 
Among the emails sent to John Podesta that were posted by WikiLeaks is an article I wrote for TomDispatch on the Clintons’ relationships with bankers. “She will not point fingers at her friends,” I said in that piece in May 2015. She will not chastise the people who pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop to speak or the ones who have long shared the social circles in which she and her husband move.” I also suggested that she wouldn’t call out any CEO by name. To this day she hasn’t. I said that she would never be an advocate for Glass-Steagall. And she hasn’t been. What was true then will be no less true once she’s in the White House and no longer has to make gestures toward the platform on which Bernie ran and so can once again more openly embrace the bankers’ way of conducting business. 
There’s a reason Wall Street has a crush on her and its monarchs like Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein pay her such stunning sums to offer anodyne remarks to their employees and others. Blankfein has been coy about an official Clinton endorsement simply because he doesn’t want to rock her campaign boat, but make no mistake, this Wall Street kingpin’s silence is tantamount to an endorsement. 
To date, $10 trillion worth of assets sits on the books of the Big Six banks. Since 2008, these same banks have copped to more than $ 150 billion in fines for pre-crisis behavior that ranged on the spectrum of criminality from manipulating multiple public markets to outright fraud. Hillary Clinton has arguably taken money that would not have been so available if it weren’t for the ill-gotten gains those banks secured. In her usual measured way, albeit with some light admonishments, she has told them what they want to hear: that if they behave — something that in her dictionary of definitions involves little in the way of personalized pain or punishment — so will she. 
So let’s recap Hillary’s America, past, present, and future. It’s a land lacking in meaningful structural reform of the financial system, a place where the big banks have been, and will continue to be, coddled by the government. No CEO will be jailed, no matter how large the fines his bank is saddled with or how widespread the crimes it committed. Instead, he’s likely to be invited to the inaugural ball in January. Because its practices have not been adequately controlled or curtailed, the inherent risk that Wall Street poses for Main Street will only grow as bankers continue to use our money to make their bets. (The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to help on this score, but has yet to make the big banks any smaller.) 
And here’s an obvious corollary to all this: the next bank-instigated economic catastrophe will not be dealt with until it has once again crushed the financial stability of millions of Americans. 
The banks have voted with their dollars on all of this in multiple ways. Hillary won’t do anything to upset that applecart. We should have no illusions about what her presidency would mean from a Wall Street vs. Main Street perspective. Certainly, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t. He effectively endorsed Hillary before a crowd of financial industry players, saying , “I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle.” 
For Wall Street, of course, that aisle is essentially illusory, since its players operate so easily and effectively on both sides of it. In Hillary’s America, Wall Street will still own Main Street. 0 0 0 0 0 0",0
9925,Эксперт: Хэллоуин запретить невозможно,"0 комментариев 1 поделились Фото: AP 
""По мнению РПЦ, моему мнению, а также мнению ряда общественных организаций, празднование Хэллоуина в России нарушает действующее российское законодательство. Хэллоуин — праздник, отвергающийся и осуждающийся религией. По сути, Хэллоуин - это противопоставление святым и религии. Ритуал вхождения в образ нечисти через костюмы и грим, ритуал выпрашивания сладостей (подкормки нечисти), ритуал ночных танцев — по сути, беснование"", — сказал Ярослав Михайлов. 
Адвокат уверен, что повсеместное празднование кануна Дня всех святых в общественных местах грубо нарушает действующее законодательство России, а потому должно быть запрещено. 
Он подчеркнул, что Хэллоуин — это языческое (религиозное) течение, которое осуществляется на территории России. А значит, его празднование попадает под действие положений ст. 24.2 ""Порядок осуществления миссионерской деятельности"" ФЗ №125-ФЗ 1997 года. 
Он добавил, что в России должны существовать религиозные объединения, отвечающие за проведение этого праздника, а также специально отведенные места для совершения хэллоуинских обрядов. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила юриста, судебного эксперта-религиоведа, члена экспертного совета по проведению государственной религиоведческой экспертизы при министерстве юстиции России, действующего эксперта в области нетрадиционных религиозных движений и сект Игоря Иванишко. 
— Есть какие-то юридические основания для запрета Хэллоуина? 
— Этот праздник в России не является официальным. Он не внесен у нас как нерабочий день в Трудовой кодекс. Он не имеет никакого статуса. Поэтому что-либо запретить, если не установлен статус какого-то мероприятия, невозможно. 
А прогнозировать можно, что у Генеральной прокуратуры будет примерно такой ответ: что если некий праздник Хэллоуин был использован конкретной религиозной организацией для вербовочно-миссионерской деятельности и если факт будет доказан, то виновные в этом конкретном случае будут привлечены к ответственности. 
Но запретить в целом данное мероприятие на территории России, чтобы какие-то общественные организации проводили на улицах маскарады, — это невозможно. 
Если вы спрашиваете о моем мнении, то я тоже считаю, что для России, для нашей истории, культуры, в целом, для народов, которые проживают на территории нашей страны, этот праздник не является аутентичным, не является естественным. 
То есть, это такое западное веяние, и то, что под маской Хэллоуина действительно с 31 октября на 1 ноября проводят различные религиозные группы, в том числе радикальные и сатанистские, какие-то свои мероприятия, это не есть хорошо. Поэтому я бы относился к этому празднику крайне осторожно. Но, с точки зрения закона, запретить его на территории РФ невозможно.

9928,California Today: Winemakers Wonder: Who Will Pick the Grapes? - The New York Times," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, for today’s introduction. It will be many months before any grapes are ready to pick but winemakers in the Napa and Sonoma valleys are already fretting that they will not have enough workers for the harvest. “I’m   about it this year,” said Nico Cueva, winemaker at Kosta Browne, a   winemaker in Sonoma County. “Our industry is based on immigration. ” More than   of California farmworkers are undocumented immigrants and the Trump Administration’s threatened crackdown is scaring many of them away, winemakers say. The labor crunch is hurting all types of agricultural businesses in California but the upscale vineyards of Napa and Sonoma have particular needs. Unlike the industrial grows of the central coast, where grapes are often mechanically harvested, grapes in Napa and Sonoma are almost always handpicked. Winemakers say this helps avoid bruising the fruit, among other advantages. Another factor, says Mr. Cueva: California’s cannabis industry has been poaching some workers and   marijuana and grapes are harvested at around the same time. Austin Peterson, winemaker at Ovid, a boutique winery on the hills overlooking Napa Valley, says winemakers have already had trouble finding workers to prune the vines this year. “There’s already a shortage of labor  —   more than in recent memory,” he said. “Everyone in agriculture is hopeful that immigration reform comes soon. ” The shortage has overtaken water concerns as the No. 1 problem for vineyards, says David E. Block, the chairman of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis. At elite wineries the optimum harvest window can sometimes be as short as six or 12 hours  —   even less if unfavorable weather arrives around harvest time. So having crews available is crucial to the quality of the grapes. Could the labor shortage hurt the quality of this year’s top California wines? “I’m not sure it’s gotten bad enough to where people are thinking it will compromise the quality of the harvest,” Mr. Block said. “But everyone is racing to get a crew ready to pick. ” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, will step aside from an inquiry into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

[The Mercury News] Before Indianapolis, the heart of American auto racing was in Los Angeles. It was this week in 1910 that the inaugural race was held at the Los Angeles Motordrome, the world’s first wooden plank track built for automobile racing. Until then, races commonly happened in the dirt and across big distances. At the Motordrome, erected near the beach in Playa del Rey, fans had a view of all the   action on a   circular track. Crowds of more than 10, 000 people came to see the early stars of the sport push the limits of the big machines at more than 90 miles an hour around the banked track, essentially a   version of a bicycle velodrome. The racers included characters like the   Barney Oldfield, the millionaire playboy Caleb Bragg, and a native son, “Terrible” Teddy Tetzlaff. “It was a crazy, great time,” said Harold Osmer, a racing historian. “They called it the days of chain drive, wooden spokes and   . ” The Motordrome burned down after three years, but by then a number of other board tracks had been constructed to cater to Angelenos’ growing racing obsession. Later, around the 1930s, said Mr. Osmer, the sport’s center of gravity began to shift to Indiana, home of the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But auto racing in Southern California never died  —   it rather became just one of a menu of entertainment options as the region developed. There are still plenty of tracks  —   in Fontana, Bakersfield, and Ventura, among other places. The Long Beach Grand Prix takes place on a street circuit this weekend.

9929,"How Donald Trump Keeps Changing His Mind on Abortion, Torture and Banning Muslims - The New York Times","  on issues can be kryptonite to presidential candidates. In 2004, President George W. Bush tagged the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, as an equivocator with no core principles after Mr. Kerry inexplicably (but accurately) noted that he had actually voted for an Iraq war appropriation “before I voted against it. ” One particularly devastating ad showed Mr. Kerry windsurfing, reversing course with the breeze. He never recovered. Donald J. Trump’s own proposals have often been vague, his prepared statements often contradicted by his own    remarks in speeches and interviews. Yet he has so far avoided much harm, despite reversing himself  —   sometimes within hours  —   on   campaign issues like immigration, abortion and economic policy. Here, we count some of the ways Mr. Trump has vacillated. Mr. Trump said in September that he was willing to let some Syrian refugees enter the United States despite the security risks. “Something has to be done,” he said. “It’s an unbelievable humanitarian problem. ” In December, after the Islamic   attack in San Bernardino, Calif. Mr. Trump shocked even many Republicans by proposing a religious test. “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,” he read aloud from a written statement. A day later, he elaborated, saying that customs agents would be directed to ask incoming travelers if they are Muslim, and that those who said yes would be turned away. In May, with the Republican nomination his, Mr. Trump retreated slightly, now calling the ban merely an idea, not a proposal. “It’s a temporary ban, it hasn’t been called for yet,” he said, adding, “This is just a suggestion until we find out what’s going on. ” On June 13, Mr. Trump offered a slightly new formulation: The ban would be geographical, not religious, applying to “areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies. ” But not just any kind of terrorism, he clarified on Twitter two hours later: The ban was only for nations “tied to Islamic terror. ” Then, in Scotland last weekend, Mr. Trump said he would allow Muslims from allies like the United Kingdom to enter the United States. Mr. Trump, who supported abortion rights until 2011, has struggled to articulate his evolution to the   camp and has shown a lack of fluency on the details. Pressed by MSNBC’s Chris Matthews in March, he said that abortion should be banned and then said that women violating the ban should face “some sort of punishment. ” He recanted within hours, saying that doctors who perform abortions should be held legally responsible women, he said, were the victims. On Monday, when the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that would have restricted access to abortions, many Republicans said the ruling was further evidence that a Republican president was needed to restore the court’s conservative majority. But Mr. Trump, perhaps out of caution, remained silent. At a Republican presidential debate in November, Mr. Trump said that “wages are too high,” and that American workers will need to “work really hard” if they want their incomes to rise. “I hate to say it, but we have to leave it where it is,” he said. Interviewed on CNN in May, Mr. Trump said he was “open” to raising the minimum wage, though he remained concerned about the ability of American companies to compete globally. “I’m very different from most Republicans,” he said, acknowledging that the federal minimum wage of $7. 25 was too low. “You have to have something that you can live on. ” Mr. Trump was long known for his warmth toward gays, including Elton John, whose civil union he publicly applauded. But since he became a candidate, his views have meandered. He has consistently opposed   marriage, speaking out last year against the Supreme Court decision that legalized it, and pledging to work to overturn that ruling. In April, he thrilled some gay rights supporters when he weighed in on a transgender bathroom bill in North Carolina, saying that people should be allowed to use whatever restroom they felt comfortable in. But hours later, he said that states should make their own decisions. Then, after the June 12 massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Trump railed against the gunman for trying to hinder people’s ability to “love who they want and express their identity”  —   language lifted right out of the gay marriage movement. Mr. Trump rose to prominence by describing the United States’ response to terrorism as flaccid. During a debate in February, he inched toward endorsing torture as a way to counteract the Islamic State’s barbarism. “Not since medieval times have people seen what’s going on,” Mr. Trump said of hostages decapitated by the Islamic State. “I would bring back waterboarding, and I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. ” Later, he declared that “torture works,” and called for killing the families of terrorists, a violation of international law. In March, he released a statement acknowledging the limitations imposed by laws and treaties and saying that he would not “order our military or other officials to violate those laws. ” But just a day later, he told a crowd that he would seek to change the laws barring torture. “We’re like a bunch of babies  —   but we’re going to stay within the laws,” he said. “But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to have those laws broadened. Because we’re playing with two sets of rules  —   their rules and our rules. ”",0
9930,Дональд Трамп – расплата за 25 лет беззакония? | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: США в мире Как отмечает в своей новой статье известный журналист и аналитик Фил Батлер, победа Дональда Трампа на президентских выборах в США — это не индивидуальное поражение Хиллари Клинтон, которая не смогла бы проиграть самостоятельно с той поддержкой со стороны правящих элит, которая у неё была. Трамп победил потому, что западные политические элиты на протяжении последних 25 лет занимались незаконным разграблением мира и разрушением системы международного права, в то время как простые американцы нищали, теряли рабочие места и умирали в ходе незаконных интервенций Вашингтона. Американские политики обещали, что расширения НАТО на Восток не будет, однако сегодня солдаты США стоят у российских границ, как будто никаких обещаний и не было. Не трудно догадаться, почему Трамп вызывает такой жуткий ужас у политиков в Вашингтоне. Ведь он говорит именно то, что думает. А потому его обещания «выгрести авгиевы конюшни» американской политики и начать расследование против Хиллари Клинтон и её пособников — это не просто слова, а, скорее, краткий список дел на ближайшее будущее. В конечном итоге вне зависимости от того, получится ли у Трампа осуществить задуманное, он лишь симптом того, что люди по всему миру, включая США, наелись «западного капитализма» и «американской демократии» досыта. А потому грядут тектонические перемены, которые никакая коррупция остановить не сможет. С полной версией статьи вы можете ознакомиться здесь . Популярные статьи ",0
9931,"California Farmers Backed Trump, but Now Fear Losing Field Workers - The New York Times","MERCED, Calif.  —   Jeff Marchini and others in the Central Valley here bet their farms on the election of Donald J. Trump. His message of reducing regulations and taxes appealed to this Republican stronghold, one of Mr. Trump’s strongest bases of support in the state. As for his promises about cracking down on illegal immigrants, many assumed Mr. Trump’s pledges were mostly just talk. But two weeks into his administration, Mr. Trump has signed executive orders that have upended the country’s immigration laws. Now farmers here are deeply alarmed about what the new policies could mean for their workers, most of whom are unauthorized, and the businesses that depend on them. “Everything’s coming so quickly,” Mr. Marchini said. “We’re not loading people into buses or deporting them, that’s not happening yet. ” As he looked out over a crew of workers bent over as they rifled through muddy leaves to find purple heads of radicchio, he said that as a businessman, Mr. Trump would know that farmers had invested millions of dollars into produce that is growing right now, and that not being able to pick and sell those crops would represent huge losses for the state economy. “I’m confident that he can grasp the magnitude and the anxiety of what’s happening now. ” Mr. Trump’s immigration policies could transform California’s Central Valley, a stretch of lowlands that extends from Redding to Bakersfield. Approximately 70 percent of all farmworkers here are living in the United States illegally, according to researchers at University of California, Davis. The impact could reverberate throughout the valley’s precarious economy, where agriculture is by far the largest industry. With 6. 5 million people living in the valley, the fields in this state bring in $35 billion a year and provide more of the nation’s food than any other state. The consequences of a smaller immigrant work force would ripple not just through the orchards and dairies, but also to locally owned businesses, restaurants, schools and even seemingly unrelated industries, like the insurance market. Many here feel vindicated by the election, and signs declaring “Vote to make America great again” still dot the highways. But in conversations with nearly a dozen farmers, most of whom voted for Mr. Trump, each acknowledged that they relied on workers who provided false documents. And if the administration were to weed out illegal workers, farmers say their businesses would be crippled. Even Republican lawmakers from the region have supported plans that would give farmworkers a path to citizenship. “If you only have legal labor, certain parts of this industry and this region will not exist,” said Harold McClarty, a   farmer in Kingsburg whose operation grows, packs and ships peaches, plums and grapes throughout the country. “If we sent all these people back, it would be a total disaster. ” Mr. McClarty is not just concerned about his business, but also about his work force, he said. Many of them have worked for him   for more than a decade, making at least $11 an hour. After immigration officials audited his employee records a few years ago, he was forced to let go of dozens of employees. “These people had been working for us for a long time, and we depended on them. ” Now he worries that a Trump administration could mandate a Homeland Security Department program called   which was aimed at stopping the use of fraudulent documents. In all but a few states, the program is voluntary and only a small fraction of businesses use it. Farmers here have faced a persistent labor shortage for years, in part because of increased policing at the border and the rising prices charged by smugglers who help people sneak across. The   stream of people coming from rural towns in southern Mexico has nearly stopped entirely. The existing field workers are aging, and many of their children find   jobs outside agriculture. Many growers here and across the country are hopeful that the new administration will expand and simplify   visas, which allow them to bring in temporary workers from other countries for agricultural jobs. California farmers have increasingly come to rely on the program in the last few years. But Mr. McClarty and others say that legalizing the existing work force should be the first priority. While they support the idea of deporting immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, they oppose forcing people to leave the country for minor crimes, like driving without a license. Since the election, they have continued to call their congressional representatives and lobbied through trade associations, like the Western Growers Association, whose chief executive is part of Mr. Trump’s agricultural advisory board. Farmers are also anxiously awaiting the administration’s plans to alter longstanding trade agreements. Mr. Trump has said he will pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if he cannot negotiate better terms for the United States. Growers would benefit if Mr. Trump negotiated more favorable terms. But backing out of the agreement entirely could provoke retaliation from Mexico that would hurt California’s agricultural industry, which earned $21 billion from trade last year. Yet, many of Mr. Trump’s supporters say they are counting on him to follow through on his promises. Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said that limiting the use of foreign labor would push more Americans into jobs that had primarily been performed by immigrants. “It doesn’t matter if it’s programming computers or picking in fields,” he said, “Any time you’re admitting substitutes for American labor you depress wages and working conditions and deter Americans. ” The prospect has business owners in the valley on edge. Patricia Pantoj runs a travel agency in Madera, north of Fresno, where the city’s approximately 60, 000 residents are predominantly Latino and work in the fields. This year, she said, fewer people than ever before traveled back to their hometowns in Mexico. “They didn’t want to risk it,” she said. “Everyone is scared, even if they have papers. ” A few doors away from the travel agency, Maria Valero said all the customers at her gift shop were undocumented. “If they went away, I would be out of business tomorrow,” she said. Jhovani Segura, an insurance agent in Firebaugh, near the southern end of the valley, said that as much as 80 percent of their new car insurance policies came from undocumented immigrants who, under a new state law, became eligible for driver’s licenses in 2015. “If there were mass deportations, we would have to cancel half of our policies,” he said. In Ceres, north of Merced, the public school district is the largest employer by a large number, and many of the jobs were created to support the children of immigrants. Administrators say any crackdown would result in huge job losses and would reduce funding, which is distributed by the state based on need, for all the children in the district. Most of the workers in Mr. McClarty’s vineyards and orchards have   lives in the area. Javier Soto, 46, bought a home for his family of five in Reedley, a city of 25, 000 that calls itself “the world’s fruit basket. ” He has worked for Mr. McClarty’s farm for the last six years and his supervisor knows he is here without papers. “It is more scary now that he is really the president and we see what he is doing,” Mr. Soto said. They are hopeful Mr. Trump will not make good on most of his threats. “Quien más habla, menos hace,” they tell each other  —   the more you talk, the less you do. There are too many of them, they reason, to throw them all out. “We’re just waiting and praying, hoping that somebody can convince them that we are not hurting anyone by being here,” said Isabel Rios, 49, who has been picking grapes for the last two decades. Like most women in the fields, she covers her face with a bandanna to protect against the blaring sun, dust and pesticides. Her two children, 9 and 18, are   citizens and she worries what will happen to them if she is sent back to Mexico. “Who will benefit if we are not here?” Mr. Marchini, the radicchio farmer, said he felt similarly after seeing generations of workers on his family farm send their children to college and join the middle class. Mr. Marchini’s family has farmed in the valley for four generations and he grew up working side by side with Mexican immigrants. He said that no feasible increase in wages or change in conditions would be enough to draw   Americans back into the fields. It was the other conservatives, Mr. Marchini said, who were out of touch about how to deal with foreign workers. “If you find a way to get in here,” he said, “there’s a need for what you do. ”",0
9932,Foes of Russia Say Child Pornography Is Planted to Ruin Them - The New York Times,"CAMBRIDGE, England  —   His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K. G. B. and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K. Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride. But he got knocked sideways when British police officers banged on the front door of his home on a sedate suburban street here early one morning while he lay sick in bed and informed him that they had “received information about forbidden images” in his possession. “It was all very bizarre and disturbing,” Mr. Bukovsky said. “This is not normally the language of a free society,” he added, recalling how his old K. G. B. tormentors used to hound him and his friends over texts and photographs declared forbidden by the Soviet authorities. The images sought by the British police, however, had nothing to do with politics but involved child pornography, a shocking offense in any jurisdiction. The officers hauled away a clunky desktop computer from Mr. Bukovsky’s study  —   a chaos of books and papers dusted with cigarette ash  —   and a broken computer from his garage. In April last year, the veteran Soviet dissident, a onetime confidant of Margaret Thatcher, finally found out what was going on: The Crown Prosecution Service announced that he faced five charges of making indecent images of children, five charges of possession of indecent images of children and one charge of possession of a prohibited image. The case was supposed to go to court in May in Cambridge but, after Mr. Bukovsky, 73, entered a   plea it was delayed until Dec. 12. This followed a prosecution request for more time to review an independent forensic report on what had been found on Mr. Bukovsky’s computers and how an unidentified third party had probably put it there. “The whole affair is Kafkaesque,” Mr. Bukovsky said in an interview. “You not only have to prove you are not guilty but that you are innocent. ” He insisted that he was the victim of a new and particularly noxious form of an old K. G. B. dirty trick known as kompromat, the fabrication and planting of compromising or illegal material.   kompromat featured doctored photographs, planted drugs, grainy videos of liaisons with prostitutes hired by the K. G. B. and a wide range of other primitive entrapment techniques. Today, however, kompromat has become allied with the more sophisticated tricks of   where Russia has proved its prowess in the Baltic States, Georgia and Ukraine. American intelligence agencies also believe that Russia used hacked data to hurt Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump in the U. S. presidential election, according to senior officials in the Obama administration. Russia’s cyberwarriors serve a multitude of goals, including espionage, the disruption of vital infrastructure  —   as happened in Ukraine last year when nearly a quarter of a million people lost electricity after a cyberattack on three regional energy companies  —   the discrediting of foes and the shaping of public opinion through the spread of false information. Hacking is not only a good way to get real information, like the emails of the D. N. C. but a relatively easy and usually untraceable way to plant fake information. For example, when unidentified hackers last year broke into the computers of a government research center in Lithuania, they stole nothing, but planted bogus reports on its website that the country’s stoutly   president had worked as an escort and K. G. B. informer while a student in Leningrad during the Soviet era. A similar   affecting the Lithuanian military’s website replaced a bland announcement about a coming NATO exercise with a fake statement that presented the exercise as part of a plan to annex Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea, and join it with Lithuania, a member of NATO. The supposed NATO plan outlined in the phony text closely mimicked methods used by Moscow in 2014 to annex Crimea and stir up unrest in eastern Ukraine, including the seizure of military posts and police stations and calls for the establishment of the Kaliningrad People’s Republic. Written in faulty Lithuanian, the statement was “immediately obvious as a fake,” said Rimtautas Cerniauskas, the director of Lithuania’s National Cyber Security Center, which was set up last year in response to increased alarm over Russian aggression. But, he added, the stunt nonetheless succeeded in distracting cyberdefense staff members from their normal work for days and in spreading a lie that, though immediately exposed, polluted discussion about NATO. “I don’t believe in aliens, but if you see enough articles about aliens visiting Earth, you start to think ‘Who knows, maybe the government is hiding something,’” Mr. Cerniauskas said. Seemingly, no target is too small to warrant attention, no attack too petty. Trained to believe that the ends always justify the means, Russian security service operatives “have sick minds,” Mr. Bukovsky said. “They live in a virtual reality. ” This blurring of all boundaries between truth and falsehood in the service of operational needs has created a climate in Russia in which even the most serious and grotesque accusations, like those involving pedophilia, are simply a currency for settling scores. Mr. Bukovsky is far from the only one fending off such allegations. Yoann Barbereau, the French director of the Alliance Française in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, has been struggling since early last year to defend himself against charges that he posted child pornography on a website for Russian mothers. His lawyers, pointing to evidence that his computer was tampered with after his arrest, believe that the material was planted by local security service officers to punish Mr. Barbereau for an extramarital romance with a woman connected to a powerful local official. In September, after months under house arrest, Mr. Barbereau fled. Konstantin Rubakhin, an environmental activist who lives in exile in Lithuania, also got a visit from police officers looking for child pornography. Mr. Rubakhin speculated that that raid, in June last year, may have been part of an effort to derail his application for political asylum or his work for the   Civil Society Forum, a research group that investigates corruption. In the end, the Lithuanian police dropped the case. Getting someone labeled a suspected pedophile has the added benefit of fitting “perfectly with the Kremlin’s line that human rights activists are all just degenerates,” said Vytis Jurkonis, a Lithuanian human rights activist who works with Russian exiles. Russia has denied any involvement in all of these incidents. “Of course they do,” scoffed Linas Linkevicius, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “They never have anything to do with anything that is going on in the world,” he said, describing Russian hackers, whether working directly for the state or as freelance vandals, “as part of their weapons system. ” “They have very efficient hybrid warfare means,” he added. In the case of Mr. Bukovsky and the others involving pornography stored  —   or planted  —   on the computers of Kremlin critics, the high degree of deniability offered by the shadows of cyberspace has left the accused struggling to salvage their reputations. “To use a technical term, you are completely screwed,” said Jeffrey Carr, the head of Taia Global, an American cybersecurity company, and the author of a book on cyberwarfare. “If something like this is sponsored by the Russian government, or any government or anyone with sufficient skill, you are not going to be successful. It is terrible. ” Russia first flexed its cybermuscle publicly in 2007 with a blitzkrieg attack across a broad front in Estonia, a Baltic nation often at odds with Moscow. The computer systems there of the police, military, banks, media and government offices faced a lengthy barrage of superfluous requests designed to crash their networks, a tactic known as a distributed    attack. Taimar Peterkop, the director general of Estonia’s Information System Authority, which watches over the core pillars of the country’s highly digitalized economy and government, said that after that early assault the cybermischief linked to Russia has only expanded in both range and sophistication. “Nowadays it seems they want to show they are everywhere,” Mr. Peterkop said. “Like flying bombers close to our and other countries’ borders, they perhaps simply want to show they have an important global footprint. It is almost as if they want to be seen, or maybe we are just responding better. ” Last year’s assault on Ukraine’s energy system involved far more elaborate tools than those used in the 2007 distributed    attacks on Estonia and were the first known successful effort by Russia or its proxies to knock out vital civilian infrastructure with hackers worming their way into control rooms. Robert Lee, the director of Dragos Security, a cybersecurity company in Maryland, who helped investigate the electricity shutdown in Ukraine, said that identifying the culprits would “never be certain” but that “when we look at tradecraft, capabilities and motive of the group involved, we can come to a   assessment that the group was   and a   assessment that there were members in the government that knew this was going to happen. ” This gray zone of uncertainty has been seized on by Russia as proof that it is the victim of “Russophobic” hysteria over its role in cyberspace. It has also left Mr. Bukovsky  —   and others caught in what they believe are   kompromat traps  —   at the mercy of Western police and courts that demand hard evidence, not guesswork and accusation from defendants. Inside Russia, kompromat has featured for years in political and business disputes. Under President Boris N. Yeltsin in the 1990s, it was a dirty game played by both the Kremlin and its foes but, under Mr. Putin, compromising videos and other embarrassing material invariably target only the Kremlin’s opponents. Before becoming president at the end of 1999, Mr. Putin played a prominent role in a particularly spectacular example of this Russian specialty. As head of the Federal Security Agency, or F. S. B. in 1997, Mr. Putin won the trust of Mr. Yeltsin by helping to destroy the career of Russia’s prosecutor general, Yury Skuratov, who, after starting an investigation into Kremlin corruption, was disgraced on national television by the broadcast of a video that showed a man who looked like him in bed with two young women. Mr. Putin certified in public that the man in the video, widely believed to have been arranged and then filmed by the F. S. B. was indeed the prosecutor general. Mr. Skuratov resigned. The corruption investigation ended. A grateful Mr. Yeltsin named Mr. Putin prime minister and then president. For the Kremlin’s supporters, the verdict on Mr. Bukovsky is already in. On learning of the charges against him, Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the   television outlet RT, posted a sneering message on Twitter: “The Pedophile Plan: rape a child, sign up in the opposition, emigrate, expose the flaws of the motherland and all will be well. Or not. ” The idea that Europeans and Russian opponents of the Kremlin are sexual deviants with a taste for pedophilia is a strange but recurring theme in Russian propaganda. The Russian   of a Norwegian man gained wide attention in state media, for example, with fabricated claims, made after she lost a child custody battle in Norway, that her former husband dressed up their    son in a “Putin costume” and raped him. Foes of the Kremlin have sometimes picked up the same ugly club and used it to beat Mr. Putin, as did Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K. G. B. agent who died in London in 2006 from poisoning by a highly toxic radioactive isotope. Four months before his death, which a British inquiry ruled was probably   murder approved by Mr. Putin, Mr. Litvinenko published an article that, without any evidence, asserted that the Russian president was himself a pedophile. Mr. Bukovsky, who was a close friend of Mr. Litvinenko, said he had strongly urged him not to publish. “I was very angry with him,” Mr. Bukovsky recalled, noting that in many ways Mr. Litvinenko, despite his ferocious hostility toward the Kremlin, still had the   of a security officer and “could not understand the difference between truth and operational information. ” On the “dark web,” an area of the internet that requires special software and authorization codes to enter, suspected Russian hackers openly offer to plant evidence of pedophilia as a way to destroy an enemy. “I’ll do anything for money,” promised an advertisement placed by a hacker who offered to ruin “your opponents, business or private persons you don’t like. I can ruin them financially and or get them arrested, whatever you like. ” Boasting that it was possible to destroy both individuals and businesses, the hacker added, “If you want someone to get known as a child porn user, no problem. ” He gave a price, denominated in Bitcoins, of around $600 per job. Paulo Shakarian, the chief executive officer of IntelliSpyre and the director of the   Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Arizona State University, said his team had analyzed the advertisement and concluded that it was probably posted by a Russian (or at least a  ) hacker. He said the price was in the normal range of what hackers demand for character assassination. No matter what the court in Britain decides, Mr. Bukovsky has already had his reputation  —   and, by association, that of other Kremlin’s critics  —   trashed in Russia. Russian state television, in a report on the case, described the dissident as “a lover of child porn. ” Mr. Bukovsky complained that European countries that expect clarity and follow rigid procedures easily fall prey to the dirty tricks of a regime that excels in hiding its tracks and creating confusion. “They are very good at using the West against the West,” he said.",0
9933,Mets Manager Terry Collins Hospitalized Before Sunday’s Game - The New York Times,"MILWAUKEE  —   Mets Manager Terry Collins felt ill about an hour before Sunday’s game in Milwaukee and was taken to a nearby hospital for tests, the Mets assistant general manager John Ricco said. The bench coach Dick Scott, who last managed with Class A South Bend in 1997, took over for Collins. Ricco offered no specifics about what was wrong with Collins but promised to update reporters later in the day. Collins, 66, seemed fine speaking to reporters in his office about two and a half hours before the game at Miller Park. He reviewed the limited options off his bench: Second baseman Neil Walker (stiff back) and outfielder Michael Conforto (sore wrist) weren’t available, and Collins hoped to give shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera his first complete day off this season. “Managing in the minor leagues, you’re used to it because it happens all the time,” he said. “In ‘84 I had to activate myself to give us enough players to play. If you’ve done it as long as I’ve been doing it, it’s just part of the game. ”",0
9934,‘Hamilton’ Producers and Actors Reach Deal on Sharing Profits - The New York Times,"The producers of “Hamilton,” a show that could well make hundreds of millions of dollars, on Friday bowed to pressure and said they would share some of the musical’s profits with original cast members. The deal, which was announced by a lawyer representing more than two dozen actors and dancers who were part of the show’s development and first productions, is a major victory for the cast and could have ripple effects in the theater industry, where the huge success of “Hamilton,” and the lack of   catalyzed a growing debate about actor compensation. The agreement means that actors will have a piece of “the profit stream from the play,” Ronald H. Shechtman, a leading labor lawyer in the theater industry who represented the “Hamilton” performers, said in a statement. Jeffrey Seller, the lead producer of “Hamilton,” a megahit now generating upward of $500, 000 in profit every week on Broadway, confirmed the agreement. Neither Mr. Seller nor Mr. Shechtman would discuss details, some of which remain to be hammered out, and Mr. Shechtman said that the performers were not ready to comment on the deal. Kate Shindle, the president of Actors’ Equity, the labor union representing theater performers, said that while the broader discussion about how actors are compensated for contributions to developing shows will continue, the “Hamilton” agreement was significant. “This should be a real moment of celebration for any actor who feels powerless,” she said. The agreement is unlikely to make any of the performers rich, but the money could make a significant difference in their lives the base salary for a Broadway performer is about $1, 900 a week (stars often make more) and many actors have significant periods of unemployment between jobs. Payments to actors in other shows with   have varied from a few hundred dollars a year to a few thousand dollars a month. The profits from “Hamilton,” which will only multiply as it spins off tours in other cities and around the world, has prompted an uncomfortable debate within the theater industry about money and credit for performers who help create hit shows. The debate has been taking place in two settings: within the “Hamilton” company and at Actors’ Equity, which has been flooded with expressions of concern from its members. The union has scheduled a special meeting on Monday to hear from actors who have helped develop a number of recent shows. Mary McColl, the executive director of Actors’ Equity, said, “There should be a place for the actors to participate in the success of a project. ” The issue is already having an effect elsewhere in the business. Equity said that some of its members were unhappy, in the wake of “Hamilton,” to see that Disney is developing its coming “Frozen” stage musical in a way that will preclude   by the actors initially involved, even though the process is the same one Disney has used for four previous musicals. And the Public Theater, the Off Broadway nonprofit where “Hamilton” was partly developed, said it had postponed a developmental chapter of a new musical because of an inability to reach an agreement with performers over potential future  . The issue has a long and tortured history in theater, since the days of “A Chorus Line,” when the dancers involved in that show’s creation famously sold the rights to their life stories for $1 each, but about a year later reached an agreement with the   that allowed them some share of the show’s financial success. In the decades since, some shows have granted performers involved in developing them small shares of future profits  —   often 1 percent, divided among the performers. The   example, often cited by actors in the current debate, is “The Book of Mormon. ” The actors involved in the initial workshops for that show, which opened on Broadway in 2011, still get regular checks, in some cases for several thousand dollars a month, to reflect their contributions to its success. Two shows   by Mr. Seller, “Rent” and “Avenue Q,” agreed to share a small part of their profits with performers involved in the development process. But more recently, producers have largely opted to pay actors who help develop shows more up front, in exchange for not granting them a share of profits if  —   as happens relatively rarely  —   the show becomes profitable. For years, many shows have been developed using an Equity workshop contract, under which actors are paid a flat rate of $631 for every   workweek. The actors also get benefits, are entitled to a right of first refusal to their role  —   and to split 1 percent of any future royalty pool for 18 years. But, in more recent years, producers have tended to favor an alternative Equity contract, the developmental lab, under which actors are paid $1, 000 a week but have no right of refusal and no promise of royalty participation. In the early stages of “Hamilton,” which was written by and stars   Miranda, Equity sought a workshop contract that would allow actors a share of future royalties, but parties could not reach an agreement. The actors instead signed modified lab contracts that gave them a right of first refusal to their roles, but not royalty participation. They began asking the producers to reconsider, and grant them a share of the profits, in August, as the show was opening on Broadway.",0
9935,It Is Happening Again! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton,"in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests (image credit: AP/Alex Brandon) Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. Most Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times … “I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . “I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. She said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.” So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. “Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News. And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning. And of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country . The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper … Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas … Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. I don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas … Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! And of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon … So is there a serious problem with the voting machines? According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots… Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. Let’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“… In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead “… Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. Americans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up … U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. Now that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious. During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. And let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. Submit your review",0
9936,Frederick Wiseman: The Filmmaker Who Shows Us Ourselves - The New York Times,"One of the most important and original filmmakers working today, Frederick Wiseman has been making documentaries for 50 years. His movies are about specific places  —   institutions, organizations, cities and communities: the New York neighborhood of Jackson Heights the coastal town of Belfast, Me. the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind American Ballet Theater the National Gallery in London. What interests Mr. Wiseman is how these institutions reflect the larger society and what they reveal about human behavior. His documentaries can be long. The   and   running times might seem forbidding, but there is rarely a dull moment, in spite of the absence of conventional narrative. Very quickly, you find yourself absorbed in patterns and details as meaning emerges   surfacing moment by moment, encounter by encounter, in bodies and faces alone and in groups. In “Basic Training,” men become soldiers order by order and step by step. In “Deaf,” students learn to speak through sounds and gestures, repeating words and sentences with their teachers until communication is achieved. There can be an abstract, mechanical quality to the way bodies function in these institutions, but even as people can look like moving parts in a large machine, the camera registers their individuality. Mr. Wiseman’s great subject is human beings, in all of their  —   of our  —   variety and uniqueness. On Friday, April 14, the first half of a complete retrospective of his work begins at Film Forum. It’s a fitting tribute and arrives at a particularly productive moment for this prolific director, who in November received an honorary Academy Award. A ballet based on his 1967 film, “Titicut Follies,” opened last month in Minneapolis, and he has completed a new documentary, “Ex Libris,” about the New York Public Library, due later this year. “What’s kept me going,” Mr. Wiseman, who is 87, said upon receiving his Oscar, “is that it’s fun and an adventure. Constantly working also keeps me off the street, or at least on the streets that I like. ” What follows is a very partial introduction to some of the highlights and defining themes of his distinctive and capacious body of work. “The ideas of the movie came out of the absolute sense of shock about what Bridgewater was about,” Mr. Wiseman once said of his most notorious film, which takes place in the state prison for the criminally insane at Bridgewater, Mass. A principled and gravely disturbing look into the void, it remains an appalling inquiry into penal abuse. What Mr. Wiseman found was too much for Massachusetts, which sought to ban the film for, as a trial judge put it in 1967, an “unwarranted” intrusion into the “right to privacy of each inmate. ” The legal wrangling centered on the inmates’ rights versus the public’s right to know and opened a constellation of issues involving documentary ethics and thorny questions of informed consent. Unlike Mr. Wiseman, the film’s opponents were uncomfortably silent on the prison’s barbarism and basic human rights, and at times seemed more concerned with the reputation of Massachusetts than with the inmates’ welfare. In 1969, its Supreme Court suggested as much: “There is a collective, indecent intrusion into the most private aspects of the lives of these unfortunate persons in the Commonwealth’s custody. ” The ban on public screenings remained in place until 1991. Now, 50 years later, the film can be seen for what it was: a work of political art and moral outrage. (Manohla Dargis) Mr. Wiseman’s documentaries are about institutions  —   the bricks, mortar, endless meetings and all the moving parts  —   including all the moving, walking and talking people who go into making them. A consummate dialectician, he likes to toggle between the general and the specific, creating a kind of accordion effect as images of buildings give way to images of people inside those buildings and longer views oscillate with   of faces and body parts. In “Blind” (1986) fingers trace Braille dots in “Boxing Gym” (2010) the focus turns to fists and   feet. In his 1971 film “Basic Training,” Mr. Wiseman followed a company of drafted and enlisted men at Fort Knox, Ky. as it is put through its paces. He shot the movie in the summer of 1970, after the first Vietnam draft lottery was instituted, and it is populated with achingly young men as they become a marching, shooting, “Yes, sir”  unit. It’s a stark, dehumanizing process filled with bracingly human moments, as when a black soldier accused of not following orders tells a white soldier: “Let’s be frank with each other, now you know this is not my country. ” One of the film’s most haunting moments takes place during a combat exercise. By then, the soldiers are marching in sync  —   chanting “Mr. Nixon dropped the   I don’t want to go to ’Nam”  —   and seemingly ready for war. With their faces smeared in camouflage paint and leaves stuck on their helmets, they practice their moves, silently raising and lowering arms and legs to the sounds of buzzing insects. As one man lifts his arm, the camera follows the upward motion and then pauses on his delicate hand poised against the sky. It’s a   image: With fingers as thin as a Gothic Jesus, this hand was made to kill and belongs to a man who might die. (M. D.) Political activists in the ’60s used to joke that “freedom is an endless meeting. ” Mr. Wiseman, who began his career as a filmmaker in that decade, has a preoccupation with process that may be a generational characteristic. Or it may just be that he’s a sensitive chronicler of modern life, an enormous proportion of which consists of committee work. A meeting  —   formal or informal, routine or hastily gathered, tedious or contentious  —   amounts to a Wiseman signature, like a shootout in a Tarantino movie or a dirty joke in a Judd Apatow comedy. When a group of people gather in a room, the business of the world is being done (or postponed or discussed or avoided, which amounts to the same thing). More crucial, it is being witnessed, by the camera and the audience, so that essential information can be imparted about the workings of law and order, art and politics, knowledge and power. If you listen closely, you can glean useful insights into such matters. But you also gain a kind of ecstatic anthropological insight into rituals that are both banal and outlandish, and an initiation into the mysteries of human psychology. You notice posture and gesture, who talks too much and who stays silent, who is passive and who is aggressive. Meetings are the most quotidian moments in a Wiseman documentary, but also, often, the most intriguing. They are nuggets of real life and eruptions of pure theater. (A. O. Scott) Action leads to reaction, and sometimes a push earns a   shove. That’s true throughout Mr. Wiseman’s work, which is filled with people  —   teachers, guards, bureaucrats, choreographers  —   telling other people what to do and how to do it, as well as where, when and why. Some of this can seem benign, as when executives in “National Gallery” (2014) meet to discuss the London museum of the title. When that talk turns to branding, though, and voices start to sharpen, a meeting about prestige, publicity and populism evolves into a larger debate about survival  —   as well as one very civilized power struggle. In other Wiseman films, power is brutal and blunt. That’s particularly true in the earlier films, in which the    images are sometimes matched by a startling Manicheanism. The harrowing “Law and Order” (1969) follows a mostly white police force in Kansas City, Mo. as its members go on patrol, answer calls and, in one case, bring a lost, weeping toddler back to the station. It’s a moment of    gentleness amid more difficult, at times violent encounters between cops and civilians, as in a horrifying scene in which a white plainclothes detective puts a chokehold on a black prostitute, an action so harsh her tongue juts out of her mouth. It’s a dreadful, terrifying moment and, for this filmmaker, unusual in its viciousness. Generally, violence in Mr. Wiseman’s work remains implied and attenuated, and more a matter of ordinary domination. Few images will seem as familiar to viewers as the scene in “High School” (1968) when an official  —   the camera tagging behind  —   patrols one of the school’s   halls, demanding passes and ordering students to class. As he shoots out questions  —   “What are you doin’ here? ,” “Where you goin’? ,” “Pass?”  —   this disciplinarian isn’t just corralling kids, he is, of course, also preparing them for lives of 9 to 5 submission. Woe to the resisters! (M. D.) One of modern cinema’s great observers, Mr. Wiseman is also a prodigious listener, a visual artist who thinks like a musical composer. He harvests sounds along with images  —   in many of his films he operates the recording equipment as well as the camera  —   and shapes the material with an eye and ear for patterns and counterpoint, themes and variations. In most documentaries, human speech is explanatory and expository: Much information is conveyed by means of   narration and   interviews. Mr. Wiseman avoids these techniques entirely. When people talk in his movies, they aren’t explaining themselves to us they’re expressing themselves to one another. We eavesdrop not only to figure out what’s happening, but also to attend to idioms and rhythms, to the musical qualities of speech. We tune in to the ways language is used by deaf and blind children as well as by judges, politicians and teachers, and also to the different ways it sounds. But words aren’t all we hear. We hear the cadence of boxers’ dancers’ and soldiers’ feet the lapping of waves on the side of a boat the whooshing of skis on an Aspen slope the sighing of the wind in the trees of Central Park. (A. O. S.) The boundaries of New York neighborhoods are determined more by local custom and   industry hype than by law or charter. This makes “In Jackson Heights”  —   about a polyglot,    section of Queens  —   an anomaly in the Wiseman canon. Its setting is not a town or an institution, but something with a less definite shape and a more informal reason for being. Jackson Heights in an accident of demography, geography and zoning. Or maybe it’s a community, a place given coherence by the rough serendipity of strangers adjusting to one another’s presence. Who are they? How do they live together? How do they make it work? (“It” being that elusive thing we like to call democracy.) One answer, hardly surprising in a Wiseman film, is through meetings. We observe gatherings of senior citizens, gay and lesbian residents and recent immigrants. Their conversations are by turns personal, practical and philosophical, and they revolve around the fundamental issues of civic order, which are shown to be at once mundane and grand. How do we keep our streets safe? How do we balance rights and obligations? How do we pursue prosperity without trampling our cherished traditions and common spaces? The wonder of “In Jackson Heights”  —   Mr. Wiseman’s most Whitmanesque film  —   is that it grounds a vision of America in the particulars of daily life. It discovers a hero in the person of Daniel Dromm, a New York City councilman who tackles the job of representing his neighborhood with shambling, inexhaustible good cheer. Some of the most moving scenes take place in Mr. Dromm’s office, where members of his staff answer phone calls from constituents who need to talk to someone in government. They don’t always have the right branch  —   their concerns include constitutional law and United States military policy  —   but the courtesy and patience with which they are treated provide a timely and permanent lesson in democratic values.

9937,"After Gun Battle in Kashmir, Protests Turn Violent - The New York Times","NEW DELHI  —   Indian security forces in Kashmir engaged in an intense,    gun battle with militants that ended late Sunday morning, leaving four militants, two soldiers and one civilian dead, the authorities said. An additional civilian died after a protest. The police had learned that the militants were in a village, and cordoned it off late Saturday. They were conducting searches when they were fired upon by militants security forces began firing back. The violence then led to clashes between Indian security forces and large crowds of local youths who gathered to mourn the dead militants. The police used tear gas on protesters, who were pelting stones at the Indian forces. They also fired bullets and birdshot at protesters, injuring at least 21 people, one of whom later died, according to Dr. Abdul Majid, the medical superintendent of the district government hospital at Anantnag. The four militants, all residents of Kashmir and all in their 20s, were members of the rebel group Hizbul Mujahedeen, said Sridhar Patil, the police chief of Kulgam district. He said they had criminal charges, including murder and stealing arms from security forces, outstanding against them. “First we tried to convince them to surrender with the help of locals and family members,” Mr. Patil said, but they shouted back that they would not surrender. Security forces recovered three assault rifles and two pistols from the site, Mr. Patil said. Throngs of youths fought with Indian forces last summer in Kulgam. The disturbances began in July, when Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, a top commander for Hizbul Mujahedeen. Sunday’s fight in Kulgam ended a lull of several months. Insurgents in Kashmir have been fighting for independence from India for nearly three decades, and the Indian authorities have long said that their movement is supported by Pakistan. Diplomatic ties between the two countries have frayed in recent years.",0

9940,Trump Shifting Authority Over Military Operations Back to Pentagon - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump is shifting more authority over military operations to the Pentagon, according to White House officials, reversing what his aides and some generals say was a tendency by the Obama White House to micromanage issues better left to military commanders. The change is at the heart of a   of the National Security Council’s role under its new leader, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and reflects Mr. Trump’s belief that the N. S. C. should focus less on military operations and tactics and more on strategic issues. A guiding precept for the president and his team is that the balance of power in the world has shifted against American interests, and that General McMaster should focus on developing foreign and economic policy options in concert with the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies to respond to that challenge. The new approach to managing military operations was evident this month when a Marine artillery battery and a team of Army Rangers  —   some 400 troops in all  —   arrived in northern Syria. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed off on the deployments and notified the White House. But General McMaster neither convened a meeting at the White House to discuss whether to send the forces nor presented the Pentagon with questions about where, precisely, the troops would operate or what risks they might confront. Though the streamlined   has been welcomed by many in the military, it could raise questions about whether Mr. Trump, who has drawn heavily from current and former generals to fill key jobs in his administration, is exercising sufficient oversight. “For President Trump, it is very early days, but he appears to be going back to a model of greater delegation of authority,” said Michèle A. Flournoy, who was the Pentagon’s top policy official under President Barack Obama and is the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, a   policy group. “The benefit is that it allows the military campaign to go forward without undue pauses, interruptions or delays,” Ms. Flournoy added. “That enables it to create more momentum and to be more responsive to changes on the battlefield. But there is a risk if there is inadequate oversight and the president stops paying close attention. It can be detrimental, even dangerous, if a commander in chief does not feel ownership of the campaign or loses touch with how things are evolving on the ground. ” Mr. Trump has already drawn criticism for being quick to approve the military’s plans to carry out a raid in Yemen in January that led to the death of one American commando and at least several civilians. The United States also conducted an airstrike last week in Syria that the American military said killed dozens of Qaeda fighters but that local activists said hurt civilians. At the same time, Mr. Trump has yet to announce a new strategy to defeat the Islamic State, something he repeatedly said during the presidential campaign that he would do. That suggests that Mr. Trump’s main contribution may be to ensure that the basic strategy he inherited is carried out more quickly. General McMaster  —   who replaced a retired general, Michael T. Flynn, whose tumultuous tenure as national security adviser lasted less than a month  —   has a reputation as a strategic thinker. So far, he has not undertaken any fundamental restructuring of the N. S. C. according to White House officials who did not want to be identified because they were discussing internal planning. But he has made some appointments to assist in the effort to forge a new strategy. Dina Powell, Mr. Trump’s senior counselor for economic initiatives, has been named the deputy national security adviser for strategy to spearhead the preparation of policy options and oversee their execution once Mr. Trump decides on them. Nadia Schadlow, a former Pentagon official and the author of a recent book that examined cases in which the United States Army intervened abroad, was hired to draft a security strategy. In the past, that document has often been little more than a rehash of the White House’s policies, but for a Trump administration struggling to translate its promise to “make America great again” into a coherent foreign and economic agenda, it might emerge as an important statement. How General McMaster will navigate rival centers of power within the White House that have their own   views on security policy remains to be seen. When Mr. Mattis hosted the Saudi defense minister at the Pentagon on Thursday, General McMaster was one of five White House officials who attended the meeting. The others were Stephen K. Bannon, who remains a full member of the National Security Council’s “principals” committee Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    Ms. Powell and Derek Harvey, the chief Middle East expert on the N. S. C. staff. “General McMaster’s problem is not how to deal with defense secretary and other principals it is how to deal with the many competing powers in the White House,” said Ivo Daalder, the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the   of a book on the National Security Council. “That was underscored when five senior White House officials traipsed over to the Pentagon for a meeting that normally might be attended by a single N. S. C. aide. ” An immediate focus for General McMaster, however, is making good on Mr. Trump’s vow during his speech to a joint session of Congress last month to “demolish and destroy” the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Mr. Trump, who claimed during the campaign to have a secret plan to defeat the militant group, instructed the Pentagon and other key agencies in late January to submit a preliminary plan within 30 days to do so. More than seven weeks later, no new strategy has been announced, and there has been some speculation that the White House will not decide one key question  —   whether to arm the Kurdish Y. P. G. militia in Syria  —   until after a Turkish referendum on April 16 on whether to expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. While American commanders generally believe that the militia would greatly help what is expected to be a   operation to take Raqqa, Syria, the   capital of the Islamic State, Turkey has denounced the group as a terrorist organization. The steps the Trump administration has taken so far, such as deploying Marine artillery in Syria, generally reflect the Obama administration’s approach of providing firepower and advisers so local forces can do the main fighting on the ground. But while it still expects the White House to be consulted, the Trump administration is prepared to give the Pentagon more leeway in deploying forces than the Obama administration did. The Obama White House’s scrutiny of military deployments reflected its fear of being drawn into a quagmire, as well as strains with the military that went back to 2009 deliberations over Afghanistan strategy. While the approach the Obama administration took ensured that the president was   on military details, it also meant that modest steps, such as resupplying arms to Syrian fighters battling the Islamic State or sending military teams to scout out a potential base in Iraq, often could not be taken without   deliberations. “In defense of the Obama administration, every single time we went to the president and asked for something more, we eventually got it, though we often had to jump through a lot of hoops,” said Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger who held a senior position at the Defense Department under Mr. Obama. “The episode that took the cake was toward the end of the administration, when we literally had cabinet secretaries debating the movement of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria. ” While it remains unclear whether the new administration will come up with a strategy significantly different from its predecessor’s, the Trump team may have an effect on how the one it inherited is carried out. “Potentially, by giving field commanders more leeway to exploit opportunities on the battlefield, the Trump administration can execute the Obama administration’s strategy more efficiently,” Mr. Exum said.",0
9941,GOP House Majority Whip Scalise on Forgoing August Recess: ’We Are Just Going to Stay in and Get It Done’ - Breitbart,"On Sunday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” host Maria Bartiromo confronted House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) about the approaching deadline for Congress to pass legislation on health care and tax reform.  Bartiromo asked Scalise about the possibility of Congress forgoing its August recess to get those bills through. Scalise at first said he believed deadlines would force people to come to the table, but added they would stay in and get it done when asked about “not taking a vacation. ” Watch: Partial transcript as follows: BARTIROMO: You got to admit, the American people are just outraged by the calendar in terms of Congress. I mean, you have got  —   what, 38 days left or less in terms of actually working. How is it possible that you guys have the entire month of August off? Is it possible that if you don’t get tax reform done that you will forgo your August recess and you’ll keep working until you get this done? SCALISE: Well, I have always been somebody that says you get your work done while you are there. There are deadlines for a reason. It forces people to come to the table. You know, we have no working on healthcare and tax cuts for months now. And ultimately you need those deadlines to force the folks that are still not there yet  —   BARTIROMO: So you’ll get it done? SCALISE:  —   to focus and get the job done. We have to get it done. We have to pass health care reform, and we’ve got to cut taxes and simplify the code. Imagine if you can actually do your tax returns on a postcard. BARTIROMO: Yeah. SCALISE: Over 90 percent of Americans will get that with our bill. And you cut tax rates for everybody and repeal  —   (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: And if you don’t will you not take vacation? SCALISE: We are just going to stay in and get it done, Maria. That is a thing. You know, we’re going to get the job done. We have to for the American people. And this economy is waiting. There is so much demand that is  . Let’s get it done.

9942,FBI Finds Previously Unseen Hillary Clinton Emails On Weiner’s Laptop,"FBI Finds Previously Unseen Hillary Clinton Emails On Weiner’s Laptop Sources earlier described to Fox News' Bret Baier as an ""avalanche of evidence...""   
Crushing the hope-filled “it’s just a backup of what they have already seen” narrative of a campaign clutching at straws to defend their candidate, and confirming Fox News Bret Baier’s earlier reporting , CBS News reports that the FBI has found new, non-duplicate emails related to Hilary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State on Anthony Weiner’s laptop . 
Sources earlier described to Fox News’ Bret Baier as an “avalanche of evidence…” 
And tonight we are getting further clarification, from US Officials, as to what that evidence consists of (via CBS News) These emails, CBS News’ Andres Triay reports, are not duplicates of emails found on Secretary Clinton’s private server. At this point, however, it remains to be seen whether these emails are significant to the FBI’s investigation into Clinton. It is also not known how many relevant emails there are. 
This is a major problem for the surrogates, lawyers, life-long friends, and defenders of the status quo as it destroys the narrative that has been painted suggesting these emails found on Weiner’s laptop are merely backups of what law enforcement officials have already seen (and found no intent in). But what is most intriguing is the question of whether the missing 33,000 ‘personal’ emails ‘deleted’ by Bryan Pagliano in the full knowledge of Hillary Clinton (according to Wikileaks emails), are also on the estranged husband of Clinton right-hand-lady Huma Abedin’s laptop. 
s Federal law enforcement officials concluded to CBS News tonight : “These emails have never been seen before” 
Fox’s Bret Baier summed up what happens next… “I pressed again and again on this very issue… The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment .”

9943,"Within The Walls Of This Suburban Polling Place, I Am God - The Onion - America's Finest News Source","Within The Walls Of This Suburban Polling Place, I Am God COMMENTARY November 8, 2016 Poll Worker 
Election Day is once again upon us. After another four years, the time has come for our nation to choose its leaders, and it is important that each of us is adequately prepared for the task. Here are a few helpful hints to keep in mind as you head out to cast your ballot: Know which voting district you’re registered in, know the hours your voting location will be open, and know that within the bounds of this suburban polling place, I am God. 
Kneel before my infinite might, voters of Ward 39, Precinct 142! 
From my seat of power behind this plastic folding table, I rule over all I survey, a domain that stretches from the double-door entrance of the Harker Middle School gymnasium to the pushed-in rows of bleachers at the back. Everything bathed by the harsh fluorescent lights gleaming from above is mine, for I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Keeper of the Voter Registry Printout and the Giver of “I Voted” Stickers. All who live between Maple Rose Avenue and Tenby Terrace and are eligible to vote must count themselves as my subjects. 
Do not dare question me! From the time you pass the Harker Wildcats logo on the baseline until you exit through the door by the boys’ locker room after submitting your ballot, my word is law. I am all-powerful, I am almighty, and I alone hold sway over everyone and everything in this kingdom. 
Unless your last name begins with a letter between L and Z. In that case, Carol will be assisting you. 
I am the Supreme Being, the Godhead, the one who procures provisional ballots and bestows them upon all who enter my dominion unprepared. I alone determine whether you may use a utility bill with your home address as a valid form of ID. You are under my divine rule, so bow before me, your lord and sovereign! Then please sign here in this three-ring binder so I can confirm your signature matches the one you provided on your voter registration form. 
Remain behind that blue piece of tape on the floor until a voting booth becomes vacant, or you shall feel my wrath! Do not forget that I will be your ruler when the blazing sun raises its head in the east, until I lock the front doors, help stack the chairs, and hand off your sealed ballots to the appropriate local officials. 
But fear not, my children! No, no! For I am a gentle master. A kind overlord who shall humbly provide each voter with a pen whose ink is suitable for reading by an optical scanner. A benevolent god who will distribute clipboards to those in need of a firm writing surface. I will even bequeath my boundless knowledge upon those lost souls who know not where to deposit a completed ballot. 
But do not cross me by bringing campaign materials into my realm or within 100 feet of its borders! 
Should you commit such an offense against my authority, then by the power vested in me by the election board of Contra Costa County, I shall banish you to the parking lot without hesitation or remorse. 
And unless you wish to feel the full force of my fury, please refrain from smoking until you have exited school premises, as this campus is a tobacco-free zone. Thank you. Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter

9944,"DONNELLY: Marlow, Lucas Discuss the Rise of Trumpism in California - Breitbart","What may come as a shock to some of the staunchest liberals in California  —   who wear their Trump “resistance” as a badge of honor  —   is that California was the birthplace of “Trumpism,” according to Politico writer Scott Lucas. [Lucas called into Breitbart News Daily Show, hosted by Alex Marlow, on Monday, and for about 14 minutes, one of the most conservative radio hosts and one of the most liberal political journalists had an extremely good conversation —  one that was both insightful and respectful.  (Something lacking in the current political climate.) Marlow and Lucas attended Berkeley together  —   where they battled on blogs and in the school paper  —   and still talk occasionally to this day.  Lucas recently penned a piece for Politico entitled, “How California Gave us Trumpism” —  and Marlow asked him how it was received. In response, Lucas quoted a conservative friend from high school, who was a contestant on The Apprentice and “knew Donald Trump a little: “Scott, I feel like this piece does a really, really good job of understanding sort of how I see the world, seeing things through my eyes. ” And that sort of sums up Trump’s appeal. He saw the world through the eyes of the tired, the forgotten, the everyman  —   who’d been left behind. In California, conservatives are the truest of true believers, whose isolation has made them all the more ardent about their beliefs. According to Lucas, it was that environment that gave birth to “Trumpism,” described by Lucas as the “marriage of ‘Constitutional Conservatism’ coming out of the Claremont Institute with a sort of ‘Entertainment Populism’ coming out of Breitbart. ” When asked who were some of the names who sparked what Lucas later in the interview calls “an important intellectual moment,” more than 80% of the names are likely familiar to Breitbart’s audience: One name that came up later would bring the entire discussion full circle  —   and that was none other than Andrew Breitbart himself, who Lucas noted embodied both schools of thought. Breitbart was on a Lincoln Fellowship at the Claremont Institute when he launched the website that would bear his name, and later help launch one of the most unlikely presidencies in modern times. What is ‘California Trumpism’? Lucas says, “’Trumpists’ are people who think California  —   and by extension the United States  —   are in decline  …    that there’s something wrong, something’s on the downslope, and they’re very willing to say that, point it out, try to figure out what to do about it. ” For Lucas, there are two seminal moments in the rise of “Trumpism. ”  First, the publication of Michael Anton’s “The Flight 93 Election”  —   in which Anton, under an alias, lays out the perfect case for why a   figure can only arise as a Phoenix from the ashes of a corrupt,   Republic  —   and the tragic murder of Kate Steinle, the beautiful 32   woman cut down in the prime of her life by an illegal alien set loose on the streets of San Francisco by liberals’ sanctuary policy. Lucas was very open about the way he and other liberals were taken by complete surprise by Trump’s election  —   something that many conservatives in California understood intuitively was a foregone conclusion once Trump made it clear he would stand and fight like Reagan did, instead of cutting and running  like the Mitt Romney wing of the party.  But unlike most liberals, Lucas admitted that he believes it is important to understand how we got here, instead of simply demonizing Trump and his supporters. “We’re all in this country together, we’re all in this state together  —   who are you people?” Lucas asks, rhetorically.  “What do you think?” He answers his own question early in the interview: It seems a very important intellectual moment in bringing together these sort of two strands of Conservatism that have emerged in Southern California. On the one hand, this idea from the Claremont Institute  —   that the United States was founded as sort of an expression of ancient political theory coming from Aristotle and people like that.  And that we’re in serious trouble with the rise of Progressive Liberal Government in the 20th Century. And on the other hand, sort of Andrew Breitbart’s idea that culture is ahead of politics  —   that you had to create a media vehicle that sort of spoke to people where they are  —   and bring them along politically after that. And it struck me that was very obviously the formula for Trump  …     Lucas decried the violence and death of free speech in Berkeley (the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement’):  “It’s very disheartening to see people [on the far left and the far right] who’d rather punch each other than talk to each other when they have political disagreements. ” When asked by Marlow if life is going to get better or worse for conservatives in California, Lucas had a warning. “California is always a decade or two ahead of the United States  —   and  …    as goes California, so, too, very often goes the United States  …    ”. He suggested that progressive leftism was likely going to take over the rest of the nation in that time. Not likely in places like Texas or the heartland of this country, at least not anytime soon. Maybe there’s another takeaway  …     Since “Trumpism” was truly born in California, perhaps there’s hope for the Golden State after all.

9945,Report: Secret Service Investigating Madonna White House Comment,"The U. S. Secret Service will reportedly open an investigation into Madonna after the singer told demonstrators at the Women’s March on Washington Saturday that she has often thought of “blowing up the White House. ”[During a   speech at the protest rally in Washington, D. C. Saturday, the    “Rebel Heart” singer said she had felt “angry” and “outraged” over Donald Trump becoming the country’s 45th president.  “I’m angry. Yes, I’m outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House,” Madonna said. “But I know that this won’t change anything. We cannot fall into despair. ” A spokesman for the Secret Service reportedly told The Gateway Pundit that the agency was “aware” of the singer’s comments and would open an investigation, though the final decision on whether to prosecute would be made by the U. S. Attorney’s office. Madonna performed two songs during her appearance at the Women’s March, “Express Yourself” and “Human Nature. ” During “Human Nature,” the singer changed the song’s lyrics to include “Donald Trump, suck a d***. ” Madonna’s comments aired uncensored on several cable TV networks, leading to apologies from some   anchors.  Madonna was one of several celebrities who participated in Saturday’s march. Other stars on hand included Alicia Keys, Amy Schumer, Ashley Judd, Scarlet Johansson, Cher, Julia Roberts and Katy Perry. Madonna was one of Trump’s biggest celebrity antagonists during the election. In October, the pop star offered to perform oral sex on anyone who voted for former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
9946,Re: America Has Become A Lawless Nation – Hillary Clinton Magically Cleared By The FBI,"America Has Become A Lawless Nation – Hillary Clinton Magically Cleared By The FBI By Michael Snyder, on July 5th, 2016 
It is hard to be proud to be an American today after watching FBI director James Comey magically clear Hillary Clinton of all wrongdoing. Sadly, Comey is likely to go down in history as the man that struck the final death blow to the rule of law in America. During his address to the media, Comey admitted that Clinton sent or received 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified material at the time they were sent. But of course there were probably many more. Comey told the press that it was “ likely that there are other work-related emails that they did not produce … that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices .” So basically Clinton turned over to the FBI whatever she felt like turning over, and then she destroyed the rest of the evidence. As a former lawyer, this infuriates me, but it doesn’t surprise me. 
In fact, it doesn’t surprise me at all that Hillary Clinton was allowed to skate. I expected this all along. If you search the thousands of articles that I have posted on The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream , you will find many articles where I say that Hillary Clinton should be in prison, but not a single one where I ever said that I thought she would be going to prison. 
This is how politics in America works today. People like Bill and Hillary Clinton could openly sacrifice children to Satan on the White House lawn and still probably not get into trouble. Despite scandal after scandal going all the way back to Arkansas in the 1980s, nothing ever sticks to them, and nothing probably ever will. 
In this case, FBI director James Comey essentially had to rewrite federal law in order to clear Clinton. This is something that Andrew McCarthy explained very well in his article entitled “FBI Rewrites Federal Law to Let Hillary Off the Hook” … 
There is no way of getting around this: According to Director James Comey (disclosure: a former colleague and longtime friend of mine), Hillary Clinton checked every box required for a felony violation of Section 793(f) of the federal penal code (Title 18): With lawful access to highly classified information she acted with gross negligence in removing and causing it to be removed it from its proper place of custody, and she transmitted it and caused it to be transmitted to others not authorized to have it, in patent violation of her trust. Director Comey even conceded that former Secretary Clinton was “extremely careless” and strongly suggested that her recklessness very likely led to communications (her own and those she corresponded with) being intercepted by foreign intelligence services. —– 
In essence, in order to give Mrs. Clinton a pass, the FBI rewrote the statute, inserting an intent element that Congress did not require. The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing. The lack of intent to harm our country is irrelevant. People never intend the bad things that happen due to gross negligence. 
The amazing thing is that the FBI handled a highly similar case very, very differently less than a year ago. Just check out what happened to Naval reservist Bryan Nishimura … 
U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman immediately sentenced Nishimura to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and forfeiture of personal media containing classified materials. Nishimura was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never again seek such a clearance. 
According to court documents, Nishimura was a Naval reservist deployed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. In his role as a Regional Engineer for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Nishimura had access to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on authorized government computers. Nishimura, however, caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on his personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media. He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off-base in Afghanistan and, ultimately, carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment. In the United States, Nishimura continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations, and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system . 
Nishimura’s actions came to light in early 2012, when he admitted to Naval personnel that he had handled classified materials inappropriately . Nishimura later admitted that, following his statement to Naval personnel, he destroyed a large quantity of classified materials he had maintained in his home . Despite that, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Nishimura’s home in May 2012, agents recovered numerous classified materials in digital and hard copy forms. The investigation did not reveal evidence that Nishimura intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel. 
So what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton? 
Neither of them ever intended to do anything wrong. 
So why were they treated so differently? 
Needless to say, social media is exploding with outrage over this decision to let Clinton go free. Many Americans are openly asking why they should continue to play by the rules if politicians like Hillary Clinton are not required to do so. 
Unfortunately, this is what America has become. Our politicians are a reflection of who we are as a society, and as I have stated before Hillary Clinton is going to be the overwhelming favorite if there is an election in November. At this moment, she has solid leads in all of the “swing states”, and she only really needs to win one of them … 
Perhaps you enjoy talk of battleground states. Well, there’s a scenario for you, too. First, pick the six “closest” swing states (VA, NH, IA, OH, FL, NC). Got it? Now understand that New Hampshire excepted, Clinton only has to win one of them in order to reach the requisite 270 electoral votes to win . (Optional third step for Republicans only: start shotgunning Pabst Blue Ribbon and don’t stop until November.) 
Lest any Trump supporters seek solace in poll numbers, recent polls have Trump sliding further behind in all the relevant swing states. According to a Ballotpedia battleground poll released last week, Trump trails by 14% in Florida, 4% in Iowa, 10% in North Carolina, 9% in Ohio, and 7% in Virginia. 
Hillary Clinton is a horrible, evil, miserable human being , and right now she is the odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States. 
But ultimately it is the American people that are to blame for blindly supporting corrupt politicians such as Clinton, and if they willingly pick her to be our next president then we will certainly deserve whatever consequences follow.

I struggle trying to get my head around this. It goes against all reasonable consideration of law and civilized society. What refocuses and grounds me is when I consider that this is another puzzle piece of end time prophecy being put into place. This brings me closer to an understanding of Gods will for me and my place in it all. The best part is that I am already saved and cleared for the afterlife.

We turned on the TV just to watch the announcement that Comey had to make about Clinton. Just as he made the announcement that indicated that their recommendations to the DOJ would be to not press charges, that very second a loud boom went off in my house sounding exactly like a cannon and my husband and both sons saw a purple bolt of lightning outside and a ball of fire and then my TV froze with the words coming out Aof Comey’s mouth. I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. We all felt that it had spiritual implications in regards to the announcement made. aldownunder

9/11 was God’s judgment against this nation. Please read the Isaiah 9:10 prophesy and then read what God will do to this nation as a result of our defiance from Isaiah 9:11-10:4. He will utterly destroy this nation. You say that God will never do such a thing. He will and know this that when you walk into church, any church and see if any pulpits says anything at all about this this coming Sunday. The answer will be no. God in the prophecy says the pulpit is wholly to blame. During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination? None. Why? Because God has blinded just like pharaoh of Egypt the pulpit. They have been consumed with the outward versus the inward. They are vipers among vipers. Steeve Girard 
911 was the warning of the Arab World… the Americans ignored it with “exceptionalism”. Time to cough-up. bahmi 
911 was meant to blame Muslims for everything connected, but the jews and neocons were behind 911, along with the Saudis. This was, however, a distraction so the real bad guys could install people like Obongo and let his destructive agenda destroy us, choke us in debt, focus on homosexuality, same sex butt banging, etc. While we were occupied with the distractions, the real bad guys did their thing and now have us on the precipice of total destruction and NWO marginalization. If you voted for Obama, YOU are part of the problem. GV

She is what the sheeple, illegals and liberal, progressives are calling for, and the Lord will oblige the desires of those who mock, blaspheme and spit in the face of the God of our heritage, “nature’s God” 
Nothing will change until the pulpits start preaching Truth and a nation repents JC Teecher 
All is going along with the prophetic word and the nations are aiding and abetting to the “fullness of the Gentiles”, (islamic peoples). JC Teecher 
The pulpits, for the most part, are bringing about the apostasy. sad 
No, the church wants to be liked and civil in this matter. Sin is a three letter bad word. Churches are more interested in”community” and not scaring people off with the truth. Unfortunately, that is the majority of churches today.They didn’t scare me. The only truth that scared me was Hell and I was scared into the kingdom by God’s love for me a sinner. That He died for me to save me. Don’t hear much about that these days. Politically incorrect. on the way to Hell. Jerry C 
Actually, I’d say sin is a five-letter word, death. lol watchmannonthewall 
I somewaht agree with you regarding God’s move against the US, but I tend more towards 9/11 being one of a couple of disciplines and warnings, the 2008 meltdown was the other, regarding coming judgment on the nation rather than it actually being a judgment. If Athaliah becomes president, she will be just like the real Athaliah; narcissistic and paranoid, and her rage will extend to “Christians”. She is power hungary and has a self destruct button that will take all with her. At that point, I think it quite likely the warnings of the destruction of America by about 2020-21 will probably occur. Joe Trevors 
I believe we are experiencing the End Times battle between the Body of Christ & the Body of Antichrist. Our war is not against flesh & blood but against the spiritual powers on high. Yes, Kent, you do see how our nation is being transformed by the installation of leaders in our society who are following the Antichrist. But also our nation is filled with millions of people who are following the Christ. One way I see this is to view Islam as the Trojan Horse to bring down Christianity. Yes, it is bringing down the Church but it cannot hurt the Head of the Church, Jesus, so it is making war on the Body of Christ, the members one of another. You can today how Islam is being used by our government to destroy the Church in Syria? Muslims are killing Christians & other Muslims in Syria. NowAlive 
Perhaps Mr Cahn is right. It’s an interesting premise, to be sure. What I will say is that the idea that “none”, meaning no pulpits spoke out against homosexual marriage, is simply wrong. Many spoke of judgment because of it. But you are certainly right about vipers filling the most pulpits. They are indeed blind. Alas that the Baby Boomers now run this country…off a cliff. GV

Only God knows who will be the next President. It is important for us to pray to the Lord & trust God as we say the Lord’s prayer in part, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven”.

Why would TPTB collapse the economy on one of their own? My gut says they want a white conservative Christian male at the helm to blame it on, so Trump is the man of the hour.

Remember: is this not the same FBI that stopped investigating Omar the Orlando Shooter? The FBI had no time to follow Omar? They did not want to infringe on Omar’s constitutional rights because Obama forbids us to discriminate against Muslims. Omar got a job at a security company so he could protect us. Omar’s Dad was preaching what Omar followed. Omar’s Dad works for the CIA. The FBI was forbidden to bother Omar no matter what he threatened. The FBI does not even know to investigate Omar’s dad. What about the MOSQUE where Omar worshipped? The FBI is super good – in covering up!! Randy 
GREAT post there, Joe! Except that Orlando was a completely contrived event, just like Sandy Hoax. WHERE were the ambulances to carry off the dead bodies? Where was all of the blood? Did everybody who was shot at either place just happen to leave all their blood at home that day? The temps in Connecticut on DECEMBER 14, 2012 were 30.6 for the low and 49.3 for the high, yet not one wisp of breath fog from ANYBODY there!! How is that possible?

Quite easily! Since the media is in bed with the corrupted legal system and political system, they just ignore the outrage, they don’t report on it, therefore very few ever hear about it! Someone forgot to check the records to see what the weather would possibly be like on December 14, 2012, and that’s how that very important clue got left out of the narrative when the hoax was launched!

Our greatest hope is to vote for Donald Trump. I believe God is using Donald. It is a sign by the overwhelming opposition against him by both Democrats & Republicans. Look at Republican Paul Ryan as House Majority leader: he has no trouble “understanding” Obama or Clinton. But he can’t “understand” Trump? Paul say I don’t know where Donald is coming from. Trump is exposing how we are already ruled by a ONE PARTY OLIGARCHY, that chooses who will be President. This time Trump is confounding their agenda. Trump is revealing how they are all lying to us & of course they all really support Hillary or a 3rd party candidate. Aren’t they the ones who say “Anyone but Trump”? JC Teecher 
Look at the bright side, even though it is just a dying ember of one, this brings the chosen one to the final phase of taking her pedestal of satanic hierarchy in ussag, and will eliminate the need for martial law in order to stave off the trump charge. 
I still believe we will see bank failures and an economic collapse whereby she will pull the exact same stunts as Odrama did, to filter off funds, but; I think it will stabilize after the “haircut” to the upper middle class wealth.

That announcement by the FBI did two things. The FBI were always the untouchables that could not be bribed or intimidated. Not until yesterday at least. I think the reaction of the American People will be to elect someone else. Now if the electorial college does not follow what the people elect, then we have a real problem this time around. I think if she had won a verdict in a trial that was public then she may have been elected. This way she is damned politically forever. She never got her day in court. So people will assume she was guilty and that Bill bribed the FBI. Assume is a big word. But that is what people will do. She has just been shot in the foot politically. That is why she will never become President of this country. Her reputation is shot. That Obama is running around supporting her effort to get elected President using government transport to do so is another problem she has. When both of them are being transported on Air Force One, that is on our dime as tax payers. Trump labeled her “crooked Hilliary” and this just gave her the reputation to go with it.

It will be all about them and theirs (bankers), who will call the shots. World War 3 is a real distinct possibility with this charlatan in the Oval Office.

RE: what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton? 
Nishimura confessed. It’s that simple. 
All Western systems of law, whether full adversarial, full discovery, or something in between, have always relied upon testament of self-confession or the force to exact it in the absence of confession. 
Nishimura self-recognized his actions, self-classified them, and confessed them. That he confessed them with the emotion of wrong-doing is his. In contrast, Hillary has not confessed, nor is she capable of self-recognition of her actions, let alone classifying them, or even classifying them as bad. To give testament of null-value is why we don’t give guns to children: they cannot self-pay the price of learning the lesson, so they don’t learn. Self-confession is inherently predicated on the sensing of cost and the ability to pay it. Children don’t confess; they can’t; even if they admit spoken guilt, they do not feel it, nor give it any recognition that those who pay do. 
Grant the unable credit as if they are able, and you’ll only end up backrupt, with decades of time lost, and not one shred of gratitude nor remorse from those who took credit they were unable to pay. Oz Steamer 
“o what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton?” Firstly, Nishimura was (is?) MALE, and Hillary is a woman. Secondly, anyone who thinks the Feminists want “equality” only has to look at this decision. If Hillary was a man, she’d be in prison, by now. The Feminists (especially the male ones) are trying so hard to get her to be President. The Feminists show they have never ever wanted genuine equality, only to bash men, and to get away with what can only be described as “obvious criminal behavior”. 
For any religious person, the choice is clear: go with Feminism, and Hillary or go with religion and oppose her and Feminism. Pick one. 
I fear the US election is already Hillary’s as the Republicans are clearly trying to destroy Donald Trump, and to win against your own Party elite and against Hillary and the media (who automatically side with Hillary) would be an impossible task. 
God Help America if Hillary wins. Mr. Cipher

Let’s all just admit to ourselves that the Clintons (and maybe others) must’ve threatened Mr. Comey into kowtowing to their will and not recommend these charges. No doubt a death threat against him or his family was made to convince him to accede to their will. Now, Ms. Lynch can easily just say that the FBI has recommended not to pursue an indictment, so she will just let the matter drop off the radar. How convenient. Dead bodies have been left in the wake of the Clintons since Arkansas. If you don’t believe me, just ask Larry Nichols. JC Teecher

Signs a nation is under judgment are many, two in particular come to mind. Sorceries, the primary definition is obvious but the secondary meaning derived from the Greek Pharmakeia (Pharmacy in English). A drug epidemic has struck this country exceeding the 1960’s killing thousands and women rulers. Hillary will no doubt win this election because the devil ordains it and America is under judgment. Obama is the stepping stone to the tribulation and the return of Bill and Hillary to the WH will destroy what is left of the United States during the tribulation. America is not mentioned anywhere in biblical prophecy and the reasons are obvious. For evil to prosper good men do nothing. Good men did nothing to stop the Warren Court, escalation of the Vietnam War and the drug saturated counter culture…the proverbial Pandora’s Box and the beginning of the end of the greatest nation on earth. Preacher62 
Truth right there except for the part about the greatest nation. This nation has always been about lawlessness and greed from the outset dropping off smallpox laced blankets killing millions of native americans to all the unjust wars especially the civil war declared to the millions murdered by abortion. If the blood of Abel cried out to God from the ground, how loud is the screaming he is hearing from this country. bobbi 
Hillary will president not by election but by corruption. black heart 
Rush likened the Comey cave-in to that of Chief Justice John Roberts on the Obamacare challenge, effectively rewriting the law so Obama would have his victory. Good comparison, but I believe the Comey-cave is more in tune with FBI AD James Kallstrom when, under pressure from Clinton, he covered up the TWA 800 shoot down. After Kallstrom retired, he reportedly suffered sever mental anguish. 
By a twist of fate, Comey was at a pivot point in history. It fell to him the the task of saving western civilization. He failed, he sold out and this will haunt him. 
Hillary will be elected. Any Democrat starts with some 200-210 electoral votes. In her first term, after she grants citizenship to millions of invaders and invites millions more, we have been effectively PRI-ed as in Mexico’s forever ruling national party, except for a minor break of 12 years. The Republicans will never again control the Oval office or the senate or the house. Thank you Comey, you hack, you political flack. 
Until now the idea of session was a mere discussion point. Texas will get serious after Hillary’s inauguration. Will Texas get out? Probably not. JB 
Sad day indeed, Michael. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: the only thing that will change things is if the church in this country is on its knees in constant prayer, praying for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and spiritual revival. That’s why none of this makes any sense – it’s a spiritual battle (“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” Ephesians 6:12). The wicked prosper while the righteous suffer, but Christ didn’t promise Christians a life free of persecution (“no servant is above his master” Matthew 10:24). Hillary gets away while Christians are fined and imprisoned for refusing to bake a cake – or take a photograph. Wrong has become right and right has become wrong (Isaiah 5:20). It’s becoming like the days of Lot or Noah, marked by violence, immorality – and lawlessness. Yet God holds the hearts of all rulers in His hands (Proverbs 21:1) – just as He hardened Pharoah’s heart. He’s still in charge and in control – as a believer, if you want things to change, you have free access to the control room of the universe. 
Dark times indeed – and like Habakkuk, we can be dismayed – but the righteous shall live by faith! (Habakkuk 2:4, Hebrews 10:38) sistersoldier 
Amen JB. Scorners seem to believe that the earth needs to be in a complete catastrophic upheaval before the Lord’s return. Also, there are those who identify with the household of faith that believe God is merciful and that they will not see or experience His wrath. True, God did not appoint us (His elect) to wrath but when He is ready to chastise a NATION one method He will use is to give our enemies power over us. He did it with Israel and the U.S. is no more blessed than the apple of His eye. 
Life will seemingly be normal upon Christ’s second coming. Natural disasters will precede Him stepping down on the Mt. of Olives but life will continue to thrive until those who are alive and remain see Him face to face. “As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark.…” JC Teecher 
Good to see you sister. 
The days of the entrance of Antichrist/Satan has been dramatized by the ignorant to the point that some people will be expecting an ugly man with horns and wearing red flannel underwear, while sporting a pitch fork and serpent’s tail. 
To the contrary, he will be an awesome looking man in his early thirties, with similarities as we have been shown as to what Christ may have looked like, before he was imprisoned and beaten. He will be speaking scriptures, and seem so Holy, with signs of power around him. In fact, the biggest sign was revealed to me and I’m gonna share with you real soon, maybe today. 
What people don’t understand is the fact that he will be impersonating Christ and come in “peacefully and prosperously”, but will go out in a sort of blaze of demonic glory, after killing the two witnesses. That brings about the end of this age. sistersoldier 
Welcome back JC! I hope you had the opportunity to relax and catch plenty of fish. It’s good to see you posting again as well! Yes, I believe that it will be as you said or as the Bible says which agrees with your statement. 
The Antichrist will indeed be “fiercely attractive” with a an irresistible charismatic personality. He will represent all that the world worships. Especially those who don’t know the One True God. 
Isaiah 53 describes Jesus as just the opposite of the way pictures and movies portray Him. The deception began centuries ago with a false image of the true Savior’s likeness. 
The prophet said that our Lord had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. Preacher62 
Food for thought and simply my opinion, not being argumentative. The ant-christ is not a person but a spirit just as the kingdom of God is within those who belong to him,(Luke 17) the spirit of anti-christ is within those who belong to Satan. I believe the teaching of a literal and physical anti-christ to be a distraction from the truth. We are told time and again in the scripture to examine ourselves to see if Christ is in us and if he is not then we have failed the test of Christianity. 
Teaching that there is a literal anti-christ keeps many looking “out there” for the enemy when we should be looking within for the enemy. The war that we are fighting is not against flesh and blood and it is not “out there”; the war we are fighting is within ourselves. Satan is prowling around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. This refers to Christians because all who are not Christians have already been devoured. Finally 1 John 2 tells us that MANY anti-christs had already come and that was 2000 yrs ago, there have been many since and there are many still to come I am sure. 
The only real option we have is to do as the Lord commanded and Go and make disciples. This is all that will prevent them from being devoured. If we get too caught up with looking for something or someone that does not exist then we might become distracted from doing that which is necessary. 
John 6:66 tells us the “mark of man” From that moment they left him and followed him no more. The “mark of God’s children” on the other hand is that they hold out faithful till the end by the grace of God. 
Love and blessings JC Teecher 
I see what you are saying, however; it makes me wonder if you believe that Satan is not a real entity and being held, right now, by Michael the Archangel? Preacher62 
No, Satan is VERY real and the prince of this world. JC Teecher 
Ok, thanks. 
Many follow man’s teachings that Antichrist is a flesh man walking the earth right now, while God teaches us exactly who he is, how, and when he comes, in the book of Revelation. 
I have even heard the pre-tribber Hagee say he will arise from Europe and then get shot in the head and miraculously recover and come back to life after three days. What a hoot and hogwash. Bill G Wilminton NC 
Many many Christians believe in The Pre-Trib Rapture including myself. 
Hagee makes many good points so does Perry Stone and others……… 
Hagee does believe that He(Anti-Christ) will be shot and miraculously recover……as He(Anti-Christ) Mimicks Christ. 
I study both pre-trib and post-trib Rapture and I find many fallacies in the post-trib beliefs and it seems at times that the post-tribbers focus on being included in the pain and misery of the Tribulation….like they dont want to be “Left Out”. or feel that they should be LEFT OUT. 
I believe that those that love The Lord are “The Bride of Christ” and one does not have their Bride get beat to a pulp and then sweep her away for the honeymoon.

I agree with your personification of the anti-Christ – many mistake “anti” to mean someone who is gruesome and abhorrent, but in the Greek (which is more precise) translates into “in place of Christ” – in other words, Satan creates his counterfeit (as he always has – he tries to imitate what God does with his own version) and we’ll have a man arrive on the scene who the entire world embraces and some will mistake for the Messiah. Like Satan, he will want to be worshipped. JC Teecher 
The thing is, Satan is, or shall i say, will be, the Antichrist. All others that have come in the “spirit” of antichrist, have been men…flesh men. 
Satan will come looking as a man, even a flesh man, but will be spirit bodied. JB 
True, God has and does judge corporately (and some day individuals). Many examples of that in His Word. Our country has been given a lot of truth – as what was once a Christian nation – and to “whom much is given, much will be expected.” Nationally, we’ve also been blessed because of a promise He made to Abraham (“those who bless you, I will bless”). What’s unique about that is we were blessed – not because of anything we did (because we’re certainly no longer living righteously) – but because of a promise He made. But as we continue to turn our backs on Israel, that goes away and there’s really nothing left to stay His judgment – except the prayers of believers. 
But yes, that was also something that astounded Habakkuk – he wanted God to pour some wrath on Israel and when God showed him that he was going to bring the Chaldeans on them (for they were incredibly barbaric), Habakkuk didn’t like that much, but the Lord responded that He is free to use whoever He chooses as His “war club.” 
I think generally things will tend to get worse, though. Man says he is evolving and getting better, but if you read Paul’s letters to Timothy, he describes terrible times in the last days and a very wicked generation. df NJ 
It would be nice if corporations would go to Hell. sistersoldier 
Yes and Amen. The Bible submits the question, “Will the Son of Man (Jesus) find faith on the earth when He returns?” A testimony as to how wicked mankind will have become in the latter days. 
If I may tag team on your comment about the blessing of Abraham. Abraham is considered to be the father of faith. He believed God and it was counted unto him as righteousness. We know this because Abraham obeyed the voice of God.The first seed which carried the promise to bless all nations was the seed of faith. Faith (in God) is the seed that God can bless and still be true to His word as we know that not all of Abraham’s descendants were righteous but his faith was pure. America has rejected the God of the Word and the promise and thereby have chosen to forfeit the blessings. 
What a mighty and a Righteous God we serve. df NJ 
So we are all Jews first. Got it. Preacher62 
Actually only those who belong to God are Jews. Repent and believe the Gospel and you can be a Jew as well. (Romans 2:28–29) “28 For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision. 29 No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by God’s Spirit. And a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people.” sistersoldier 
NO! I don’t!. God’s Word affirms that the Jews are God’s chosen people: “You are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession” (Deuteronomy 7:6). From eternity past God knew that He would need to be born into the human race in order to save us from the spiritually dead condition that we were in (Ephesians 1—2; Genesis 3). God had planned from the beginning to be born into a very small nation or race of people called the Jews. JC Teecher

9948,How to Take Better Lecture Notes - The New York Times,"When it comes to taking lecture notes, Laura Gayle, a sophomore at Florida State University, has her methods. A smiley face connotes an important person. If the professor says, “Make sure you know this,” she uses an asterisk. A triangular button signals a video clip played in class. Later, she will organize the notes, write a video summary and check uncertainties against the textbook or with the professor. For “Introduction to Classical Mythology,” she’ll even alphabetize a list of Greek gods and goddesses. Then, a few days before the exam, she puts it all up for sale. Since last fall, when she uploaded her macroeconomics notes onto Flashnotes. com to pay for a birthday gift for her mother, Ms. Gayle has sold more than 500 copies of the study guides that she’s put together for her courses, made over $3, 285 and tapped into a growing, if controversial, online marketplace. In describing her approach, Ms. Gayle, a human resources major with a 3. 8   average, sounds aggressive in the best way. “I sit in the front row center for every single class, whether I am selling notes or not,” she says. “For me it is a matter of paying attention, being   and,” if something is unclear, “taking the initiative to go out and find the answer. ” Her study guides are rated five stars by users. While borrowing, bartering and selling class notes is nothing new, the online market is just getting organized.   sites matching note sellers and buyers have come and gone in recent years as students who started them graduate. NerdyNotes at Stony Brook University is surviving the graduation of a founder, but bigger players are arriving. Flashnotes started up last fall on five campuses  —   Kent State, Ohio State, Florida State, Rutgers and University of Maryland  —   with 30, 000 registered users. There are now about 100, 000 at 100 campuses, and the company just bought   a Florida State  . The sites let student sellers set prices for notes (average is $9) but take a cut. Flashnotes gets 30 percent NerdyNotes takes 50. The marketplace has annoyed some professors, who bar their students from buying or selling notes. In 2010, California State University banned students on its 23 campuses from using NoteUtopia. com (since bought by Flashnotes) citing a   state education code prohibiting the selling of class notes for commercial purposes. Some argue that lectures are professors’ intellectual property, including notes recording their ideas others warn that notes are a student’s interpretation of a class. Some say that selling them promotes laziness by enticing students to skip lectures. Still others encourage it. “I want them to use any resource they can to do well on my tests,” says Lora Holcombe, an economics professor at Florida State. “It’s not like with the notes you sleep on them and they’ll go into your head. You have to do some heavy studying. ” Michael Matousek, who graduated from Kent State in 2010, dreamed up Flashnotes during a statistics class in his senior year. He had switched majors twice so was taking a required class that covered topics he had previously studied. Students found the professor confusing, but Mr. Matousek “knew how they were confused. ” After classmates repeatedly sought his help, he compiled and sold his notes to a friend. Soon others wanted copies, so Mr. Matousek collected $10 for each emailed copy, netting more than $1, 000 for the semester. The experience showed him the power of peer education  —   and not necessarily led by brainiacs. “The 4. 0 kids, they can’t explain,” he says. “The 3. 5, the 3. 6 kids understand what it takes to learn something. ” Mr. Matousek graduated with a 3. 67 G. P. A. and now heads a staff of 22 at Flashnotes headquarters in Faneuil Hall in Boston. The demand is not surprising. “Students are notoriously poor ” says Kenneth Kiewra, professor of educational psychology at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. They tend to record only a third of the important lecture points. What makes notes great? “Completeness,” Dr. Kiewra says. Research shows that having detailed, comprehensive notes raises test performance. In his   1985 study, published in Human Learning, Dr. Kiewra randomly assigned 100 students to one of seven groups.   hours after a lecture, the groups had 25 minutes to review before a test. Each group was assigned a learning method: Take your own notes and review (1) your notes, (2) your notes as well as instructor notes, (3) without any notes. Don’t take notes but review (1) instructor notes, (2) without any notes. Skip the lecture but review (1) instructor notes, (2) without any notes. Groups that reviewed instructor notes performed best. “It didn’t matter so much what you did during the lecture,” Dr. Kiewra explains. “It mattered what notes you had. ” Even those who didn’t attend the lecture but reviewed instructor notes did better than those who attended and “reviewed their own crummy notes. ” He concludes: “The real value of   is not so much in the taking as in the having. ” Getting down details along with main points is easier said than done. Average lecture speed is 100 to 125 words a minute, but college students listening to a lecture write 22 words a minute by hand they type just 33 words a minute. In his latest research Dr. Kiewra has found that when the professor pauses three times to let students catch up and fill in missing information, they have more “original, additional and total notes” than those who waited to revise immediately after a lecture. If a student fails to note a particular point, Dr. Kiewra says, there is only a 5 percent chance of recalling it later. Videotaped lectures help. When students viewed a video twice, they recorded 53 percent of the details, up from 38 percent, Dr. Kiewra says. Watching three times raised it to 60 percent. Memory is a weak tool, but thinking about the information  —   paraphrasing rather than writing everything verbatim  —   improves retention, according to a series of studies at Princeton, published last April in Psychological Science. Students who took notes by hand rather than laptop wrote less but performed better. Laptop users tended to merely transcribe a lecture “rather than processing and reframing it in their own words” they scored strikingly lower on conceptual tests. Alexandra E. Hadley, a Boston College junior who has posted 29 different offerings on Flashnotes in the last year, uses paper for small discussion classes and a laptop for lectures. An English and communications major, she says she thinks hard about points the professor stresses. “I try to be very present in all of my classes,” she says. “That is key  —   focusing on what I am doing. ” That means considering points as you take notes and connecting new ideas with information from earlier lectures. “I was taking notes in my research methods class and we were talking about pop culture,” she says. “We touched on two theories, but it reminded me of another one, so I threw that in my notes. ” Umar Zaidi, a Stony Brook senior from Queens   in political science and sociology, prefers to grab a seat near a power outlet and tap away. “When you are typing you can look at your professor,” he says. He reads over the syllabus before class, “so when the professor mentions something that rings a bell, I type it up. ” While typing he organizes material into sections with main ideas, bullet points and asterisks. Mr. Zaidi uploaded a semester’s worth of lecture notes for “Urban Politics,” an   course, when NerdyNotes started up last spring. Sales, at $10 a packet, were slow at first. (Biology notes are the most in demand on campus.) Classmates didn’t take notes, he says, because they thought political science was a breeze  —   until the midterm. After, he netted $150. “If they’re too lazy to make notes,” he says, “then I’ll make notes and take advantage. ” But Mr. Zaidi won’t sell the study guides he makes for himself. One doesn’t want to make it too easy for classmates. Indeed, some campuses are not good   territory because students don’t want to help competitors. In other words, at Flashnotes, Mr. Matousek says, “we’re not putting a huge emphasis on Harvard. ”",0

9951,What The Trump Skeptics Got Wrong,"Home This Month Popular What The Trump Skeptics Got Wrong What The Trump Skeptics Got Wrong FitzRoy Sommerset 
FitzRoy is a British and American Nationalist who refuses to apologize for the British Empire. As a young man, he ""took a President's shilling"" and served in the U.S. Army. In his free time, he enjoys studying history and destroying the SJW revisionist narrative. November 12, 2016 Politics 
There have been few true upsets in our history: Caesar crossing the Rubicon, Wellington’s victories at Assaye and Waterloo, and Washington’s victory at Yorktown over the most professional army in the world. It is often said that when General Charles O’Hara (who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte) surrendered Cornwallis’s sword, the band played “The World Turned Upside Down.” 
Today, the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as Cornwallis or O’Hara did at Yorktown. And I fully admit: In spite of my vote for Trump, I fully expected him to lose. The polls, his 60% negative approval rating, and the sheer forces of the media, the FBI and even some Republicans were arrayed against him. My skepticism of Trump was not his ideas, but his chances of winning the election. Myself, and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him, were wrong. 
I am one of the intellectuals who expected a Trump defeat. I’ve been studying politics, history and economics for years, reading countless books on the matter from The Prince to Freakonomics to The Wealth of Nations. 
And I was wrong. It was a Canadian housewife and an Iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for Trump. Trump beat the odds, he beat the intellectuals, and made the establishment “babies in the hands of a giant” as was said after Napoleon’s resounding victory at Austerlitz in 1806. 
The left is currently in panic-mode in an attempt to explain how they lost. They are calling Trump supporters racist, sexists, homophobic and even sex offenders! But in the end, it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating Donald Trump. Trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons. Trump won because of the following 
1. The left seemed far more interested in calling Trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance. 
2. Outlets such as the New York Times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the NRA for the Orlando Shootings, and even tried to call them terrorists. In this, they beat even Trump in outrageousness: they thought the American people were stupid, so they just lied to them and said “fuck it, those peasants will believe anything we write.” 
3. All Trump had to do was call them on their bullshit, and call them liars. And he was 100% right: the MSM has lied to the American people this entire election cycle. Subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a Muslim, the MSM continued to push the narrative that “home grown right-wing terrorism is the real problem.” Trump called them on their lies, and the American people, who are tired of being lied to by the MSM, cheered him on, even if he had a few issues with the truth himself. 
4. The Democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible. Hillary Clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled Trump’s own. And she was bland. And she couldn’t decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive. And she is corrupt, and lied about it, stupidly thinking the American people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do. 
5. Trump knew how to communicate with people. He knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right (like myself). I freely admit I am guilty of this: when you study two thousand years of philosophy, economics and rhetoric (Cicero was particularly effective), it is sometimes frustrating when people don’t approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs. The working class that built America go by what they feel in their gut, and often times, they are right. 
All in all, the left failed because they failed to understand America. They bought into the idea that “Americans are stupid…haha!” Americans are not stupid: they may not be smart, but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the NRA is basically the Taliban in an obviously biased hit piece. Hillary took working class Americans for granted, and she lost. This should stand as a parallel for black Americans whom the Democrats also take for granted. 
I am pleased that Donald Trump is now President-Elect. He wasn’t just a candidate, he was the anti-candidate. He did everything a politician should not do. He used vulgar language. He talked freely about his ideas. He made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying America. He turned weaknesses (such as his spotty track record) into strengths that would have ended any other candidate’s campaign. He was the un-candidate America needed. 
I have high hopes for Trump’s presidency. In spite of my tepid support, I see Trump as a President who can do a lot of good, and has the potential to do more good than any President of recent memory. 
First, Trump spat in the face of PC culture and won. Just as Scott Walker took on the Unions in Wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election, Trump defeated the SJW’s. If Trump can keep this up, we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness, and get back to a concept called “actually being correct.” 
Secondly, Trump is an unapologetic nationalist. He loves America, and doesn’t give a damn if you think Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States is a great book. The Department of Cultural Guilt that has infected schools in America teaches children to hate their own country. I look forward to seeing Trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the Founding Fathers were evil racists, the British Empire did nothing good for the world, and that America is the greatest evil the world has ever seen. 
Lastly, Trump is the antithesis of everything the Social Justice Warriors stand for: a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected. I hope to see a rise in masculinity in America: studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the American male population. This should rise under Trump, as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault. 
I was a Trump skeptic. I underestimated him. I didn’t disagree with him on much (perhaps maybe 20% of his platform), but I had little faith he could pull it off. And I was vocal about my concerns regarding his elect-ability. But like the liberals, I was wrong. And a Canadian housewife and a former pickup-artist-turned-conservative-philosopher were 100% right. 
I recall something I told a fellow soldier while on a long, boring convoy operation in Iraq: “When a genius says something, others say ‘wow, that is way above my head.’ But when a true genius says something, others say ‘wow, why didn’t I think of that before?!” Trump is a true genius: he stated the obvious to the American people and made them believe he wanted to Make America Great Again (and I think he genuinely does). He didn’t use fancy graphs or focus groups: he spoke the truth, without political correctness. 
And now he is President-Elect.",0
9952,Beware: You could be poisoning yourself by reheating these five foods,"Beware: You could be poisoning yourself by reheating these five foods 
Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Isabelle Z. Tags: reheating , toxic food , foodborne illness (NaturalNews) Nothing beats a home-cooked meal. Not only does food taste better when you prepare it yourself, but it's also a lot healthier. Unfortunately, this can also be very time-consuming depending on the dish in question, and today's hectic lifestyle means that a lot of us can't cook something special from scratch every day. If you don't want your family to have to resort to toxic fast food on your busy days, what can you do?Making enough home-cooked food to last a few days sounds like a great idea on the surface because you can quickly microwave it, but the truth is that reheating certain foods can actually make you and your family quite ill . Here is a look at some of the foods that you need to be really careful about reheating. Rice According to the NHS, eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning. They explain that the reheating itself is not the culprit; it actually has to do with how the rice was stored prior to reheating. Rice can sometimes contain spores of bacteria known as Bacillus cereus , which can cause food poisoning, and these spores can survive cooking. If rice is then left to sit at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria, which will multiply and could produce toxins that can cause vomiting and diarrhea.The NHS says that the likelihood of this happening increases with the amount of time the rice sat outside at room temperature. They advise serving rice right away after it has been cooked or else cooling it as quickly as possible – within no more than an hour. They also suggest reheating rice to the point where it is steaming, and avoiding storing it in the refrigerator for longer than one day. Potatoes Potatoes that have sat out at room temperature for several hours can not only lose their nutritional value, but they could also create the perfect conditions for botulism to grow. Uneaten potatoes should go directly to the fridge after cooking to help reduce the chances of this occurring. Chicken When you reheat cold chicken, the structure of its proteins is changed, which can cause digestive upset. If you have leftovers you can't bear to toss, reheat them slowly at a lower temperature on the stove or in the oven to help keep the chicken's proteins intact. It must be steaming all the way through before you can serve it, so be sure to stir it every once in a while. Spinach Spinach is best eaten raw, but it's okay to cook it if you plan to eat all of it immediately afterward. However, when cooked spinach is reheated, the nitrates in it break down into nitrites, turning one of the healthiest foods into something that is potentially toxic and can negatively impact the uptake of oxygen in the blood. Eggs It is not a good idea to repeatedly expose eggs to heat. Reheating them after they've been fried or boiled using high temperatures can cause them to become toxic and upset your digestive tract. Moreover, their protein is destroyed when they are repeatedly exposed to heat. According to the FDA , cooked egg dishes should never be left outside of the fridge for more than two hours; this drops to just one hour if the temperature is higher than 90 degrees F. Warm temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees provide the perfect environment for bacteria to grow.While most of us have reheated these foods and have not noticed any adverse effects, it is important to exercise caution if you plan to continue doing so in order to avoid poisoning yourself and your family or causing digestive issues. Tina Hanes of the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline suggests making sure your leftovers reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit when you reheat them, and you should use a food thermometer to verify this. Covering the food helps it retain moisture and boosts its chances of heating all the way through, which is vital for avoiding cooler pockets where bacteria can thrive. Finally, keep in mind that microwaves are particularly risky because they do not heat food evenly. Sources include:",0
9953,"Hirakhand Express Train Derails in Southern India, Killing Dozens - The New York Times","NEW DELHI  —   At least 36 passengers were killed in a train derailment in southern India on Saturday night, the latest disaster on India’s old and overburdened railway system. Government and medical authorities said that at least 40 additional passengers were injured, several critically, and admitted to hospitals. Rescue workers struggled into the early morning to pull the injured passengers and dead bodies from the engine and nine coaches, the authorities said. The accident took place in the Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh state in southern India, when the engine and coaches of the Hirakhand Express from Jagdalpur to Bhubaneshwar derailed at 11:15 p. m. according to a statement issued by Indian Railways, the   firm that runs India’s trains. The authorities said the cause was not clear, and Indian Railways announced an investigation. India’s railways, which transport 23 million people a day over more than 70, 000 miles of track, have been neglected for years. In 2014, there were more than 27, 000   deaths in India. In 2012, a committee appointed to review the safety of the rail network cited “a grim picture of inadequate performance largely due to poor infrastructure and resources. ” It recommended many urgent measures, including upgrading tracks, repairing bridges, eliminating level crossings and replacing old coaches with safer ones that would better protect passengers in case of an accident. These remedies came with a hefty price tag: The committee said it would cost some $14 billion over five years to put the railways on safer footing. Still, it advised that the work should proceed “in a   manner with required resources mobilized. ” This was never done. Enku Swamy, the district fire officer for Vizianagaram, said in a telephone interview that rescue agencies took about 40 minutes to reach the accident site, in a remote area close to the border of Odisha state. “Some people died because of a stampede inside the derailed coaches,” Mr. Swamy said. Madan Mohal Nial, 21, a passenger, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he was making the journey to take an exam for a government job when the derailment happened. “We heard a loud noise suddenly, and the train coaches turned upside down,” he said. “Many passengers fell down on me. My left hand got trapped in the window rods and got injured. ” Despite the injury to his arm, he searched the coach twice for his luggage because it contained his educational certificates, he said. He said he was not able to find his luggage and finally had to leave to be hospitalized.   injured passengers were admitted to the nearby Government Area Hospital in Parvatipuram. “Most of the injured suffered abdominal and chest crush injuries, and multiple bone fractures on upper and lower limbs,” Dr. G. Nagabhusana Rao, medical superintendent of the hospital, said in a telephone interview. Indian Railways announced compensation of 200, 000 rupees, about $2, 937, to the families of the dead, and 50, 000 rupees, or about $734, to injured passengers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his grief on Twitter, calling the accident a tragedy. Passenger safety, or the lack of it, has come under scrutiny in India in recent months. In November, more than 140 passengers died in the derailment of passenger coaches near the city of Kanpur. In the weeks after that accident, two more people died in another derailment of passenger coaches in the same stretch of track.",0

Voltaire Network | Damaskus (Syria) | 26 octobre 2016 français Español русский Deutsch English Türkçe Português ελληνικά italiano Konflikten der Russland og Kina er i opposisjon til De Forente Stater utvikler seg på to fronter. På den ene siden leter Washington etter en mulig syndebukk som skal bære ansvaret for krigen mot Syria. Og på den andre siden har vi Moskva som allerede er knyttet til situasjonen i Syria og Jemen. De prøver nå å knytte dem til spørsmålet om Ukraina.
Washington vil ha en syndebukk For å frigjøre seg fra sitt engasjement uten å miste ansikt, har USA måttet skylde på en av sine allierte for sine forbrytelser. De har tre muligheter - det er å skylde på Tyrkia, Saudi-Arabia, eller begge. Tyrkia er til stede i Syria og i Ukraina, men ikke i Jemen, mens Saudi-Arabia er til stede i Syria og Jemen, men ikke i Ukraina.
Tyrkia
Vi skal nå komme med den verifiserte informasjonen om hva som virkelig hendte i Tyrkia den 15. juli. Disse opplysningene tvinger oss til å revidere vårt første inntrykk.
Først av alt, det begynte da Tyrkia skulle ta seg av jihadist-hordene etter angrepet som såret den saudiske prins Bandar bin Sultan, det var ikke uten problemer. Mens Bandar var en lydig mellommann, fulgte Erdogan sin egen strategi om å gjenskape det 17. tyrkisk-mongolske imperium. Det fikk han til ved å bruke jihadistene til sitt oppdrag.
I tillegg til dette kunne USA ikke unngå å kreve sanksjoner mot president Erdogan for å blande sitt land økonomisk sammen med Russland mens han fremdeles var et militært medlem av NATO.
Til slutt, med krisen i strukturen om verdensmaktene, ble Erdogan den ideelle syndebukken for USA for å frikjenne seg selv i Syria-krisen.
Fra USAs synspunkt er ikke problemet Tyrkia, som er en uunnværlig regional alliert, heller ikke Hakan Fidans MIT (de hemmelige tjenestene) som organiserer verdens jihadist-bevegelser, men Recep Tayyip Erdogan selv.
Som en konsekvens prøvde National Endowment for Democracy (NED) først av alt å få til en fargerevolusjon i august 2013. De organiserte demonstrasjoner i Cezi-parken i Istanbul. Enten mislyktes planen, eller USA forandret mening.
Det ble tatt en beslutning ved avstemming om å styrte islamistenes Justice and Development Party (AKP) (Erdogans parti overs.). CIA hadde organisert People’s Democratic Party (HDP) til et minoritetsparti, og forberedte også en allianse mellom dem og sosialistene i Republican People’s Party (CHP). HDP vedtok et vidt program til forsvar for etniske minoriteter (kurderne) og sosiale minoriteter (feminister og homoseksuelle) og inkluderte et økologisk kapitel. CHP ble reorganisert av to grunner - å dekke over overrepresentasjonen av Alevis (en mystisk gren av islam overs,) i partiet, og med en tanke om å fremme kandidaturet til eks-presidenten i høyesterett. AKP tapte valget i juli 2015, men det viste seg umulig å få til en allianse mellom CHP og HDP. Som et resultat ble det holdt en ny runde med valg i november 2015, men det ble brutalt manipulert av Recep Tayiip Erdogan.
Washington bestemte seg derfor å fjerne hr. Erdogan. Tre drapsforsøk ble gjort mellom november 2015 og juli 2016. I motsetning til det som er blitt rapportert, var ikke operasjonen den 15. juli 2016 et forsøk på statskupp, men et forsøk på å fjerne Erdogan alene. CIA brukte tyrkisk-USA industrielle og militære forbindelser for å rekruttere et lite team innenfor luftforsvaret for å henrette presidenten mens han var på ferie. Men dette teamet ble forrådt av islamist-offiserer (som representerte nesten en fjerdedel av hærens personell). Og presidenten ble advart en time før kommandogruppen ankom. Han ble derfor overført under beskyttelse av en lojal militæreskorte.
De var klar over de overskuelige konsekvensene av sine feil, allikevel gjennomførte konspiratørene sitt statskupp uten noen forberedelser og mens gatene i Istanbul fremdeles var fulle av folk. Åpenbart nok mislyktes de. Den undertrykkelsen som fulgte var ikke bare bare å arrestere de som hadde stått bak mordforsøket, ikke bare soldatene som hadde samlet seg for å improvisere statskuppet, men alle USA-vennlige aktivister. Først av alle de sekulære Kemalistene, så islamistene i Fethulla-Gulen-bevegelsen. Totalt ble mer enn 70 000 mennesker anklaget, og de vanlige fangene måtte slippes ut for å få plass til å fengsle de USA-vennlige fangene.
President Erdogans stormannsgalskap, hans sinnssyke hvite palass, hans manipulering av valgene og hans totale undertrykkelse gjør han til den ideelle syndebukken for feilene som har blitt gjort i Syria. Men hans motstand mot en fargerevolusjon og de fire mordforsøkene antyder at det ikke vil være mulig å bli kvitt han så fort.
Saudi-Arabia
Saudi-Arabia er like uunnværlig for De Forente Stater som Tyrkia av tre grunner. Først på grunn av oljereservene som har en eksepsjonell kvalitet og eksepsjonell kvantitet (selv om Washington ikke lenger trenger å bruke dem, men bare for å kontrollere salget). Deretter for sine finansielle reserver (selv om disse reservene har falt med 70 %) som gjør dem i stand til å finansiere hemmelige operasjoner som i all stillhet er kontrollert av Kongressen. Og til slutt deres grep om kildene til jihadisme. Faktisk har Riyadh finansiert Muslim World League siden 1962, og de var også med på å grunnlegge denne. Og finansieringen har blitt gjort på vegne av CIA, Det Muslimske Brorskap Naqshbandis, de to organisasjonene som forsyner absolutt alle jihadist-offiserer i hele verden.
Men den anakronistiske karakteren i denne staten er at den er den private eiendommen til den kongelige familien, som er fremmede for det allment aksepterte prinsippet om ytringsfrihet og religionsfrihet. Her kreves det radikale forandringer.
CIA organiserte derfor etterfølgeren etter kong Abdullah i januar 2015. Den natten statsoverhodet døde ble flertallet av de ineffektive offentlig ansatte løst fra sine funksjoner, og landet ble omorganisert etter en på forhånd etablert plan Fra nå av skulle makten deles mellom de tre hovedklanene, Kong Salmane ( og hans elskede sønn prins Mohammed), sønnen til prins Nayef (den andre prins Mohammed), og til slutt sønnen til den avdøde kongen, prins Mutaib, (kommandør for nasjonalgarden).
I praksis lar kong Salmane (81 år gammel) sønnen, den flotte prins Mohammed ( 31 år gammel) styre i hans sted. Mohammed økte det saudiske engasjementet i Syria, deretter gikk han til krig mot Jemen. I tillegg kom han med et enormt program med økonomiske og sosiale reformer som han kalte «Vision for 2030».
Dessverre ble ikke resultatene så strålende som ventet. Kongedømmet var nå engasjert både i Syria og i Jemen. Denne siste krigen er blitt slått tilbake med angrep fra Houtiene på saudiske områder og med tap for hæren hans. Fra et økonomisk synspunkt er de sikre oljereservene gått ned, og tapene i Jemen hindrer han i å utnytte «The Empty Quarter». Det er ørkenregionen som grenser til begge land. Fallet i oljeprisene har ganske sikkert fjernet et antall konkurrenter, men har også tørket inn det saudiske finansdepartementet, som nå ser seg nødt til å låne på det internasjonale markedet.
Saudi-Arabia har aldri vært så mektig som nå, og samtidig så sårbart. Den politiske undertrykkelsen nådde sitt høydepunkt med halshoggingen av lederen for opposisjonen, sjeik Al-Nimr. I shia-minoritetene forberedes nå opprør, men også i sunni-provinsene vest i landet. På internasjonalt nivå ser den arabiske koalisjonen imponerende nok ut. Men den har falt fra hverandre etter at Egypt trakk seg ut. Den offentlige tilnærmingen til Israel mot Iran har reist et ramaskrik i den arabiske og muslimske verden. Heller enn gå inn for en ny allianse, illustrerer dette panikken som har grepet den kongelig familien, som nå er hatet overalt.
Sett fra Washington er øyeblikket kommet for å velge ut de elementene i Saudi-Arabia som er verdt å redde, og å bli kvitt de andre. Rent logisk ville det være å gå tilbake til den tidligere måten, å dele makten mellom Sudariene (men uten prins Mohammed bin Salman, som hadde vist seg ubrukbar) og Chamar (stammen til den avdøde kong Abdullah).
Den beste løsningen for både Washington og det saudiske folket ville være at kong Salmane døde. Sønnen hans, Mohammed ville bli isolert og vekk fra makten. Den ville bli betrodd den andre prins Mohammed (sønnen til Nayef). Prins Mutaib ville beholde sin posisjon. Denne arvefølgen ville bli lettere å styre for Washington hvis den fant sted før innsettelsen av den neste presidenten den 6. januar 2017. Kandidatene ville da kunne anklage den ubrukelige kongen som ansvarlig for alle feil, og så annonsere fred i Syria og Jemen. Dette er CIAs nåværende prosjekt.
I Arabia, som i Tyrkia og i andre nasjoner, søker CIA å opprettholde status quo. Til det formålet prøver de å organisere forsøk på å bytte ut ledere uten å røre strukturene selv. Den kosmetiske måten til disse justeringene gjøres på, gjør det lettere å garantere hvor usynlig arbeidet er.
Moskva prøver å lenke sammen Midt-Østen og Ukraina i forhandlingene Russland har prøvd å lenke sammen den syriske og jemenittiske slagmarken. Mens deres styrker offisielt har vært utplassert i Levanten i et år, har de uoffisielt vært til sted i Jemen i tre måneder, og tar nå aktivt del i kampene. Ved samtidig å forhandle om en våpenhvile i Aleppo og Jemen, har de tvunget USA til gå med på at det er en sammenheng mellom disse to krigsteatrene. I begge disse landene har hæren vist sin overlegenhet med konvensjonelt utstyr når de står ansikt til ansikt med USAs allierte, men har samtidig unngått en direkte konfrontasjon med Pentagon. Disse omgåelsene hindrer Moskva i å investere i Irak, til tross for deres historiske forløpere i dette tredje landet.
Men opprinnelsen til krangelen mellom de to store maktene er i utgangspunktet blokaden av de to Silkeveiene - en i Syria, og en i Ukraina. Logisk nok prøver derfor Moskva å lenke disse to sakene sammen i sine forhandlinger med Washington. Men det er enda mer logisk at CIA selv allerede har skapt en tilknytning mellom de to kamp-plassene via Tyrkia.
Da han dro til Berlin den 19. oktober håpet den russiske president, Vladimir Putin, og hans utenriksminister, Sergej Lavrov, å kunne overbevise Tyskland og Frankrike, om ikke De Forente Stater, om å forene disse sakene. De diskuterte utvidelse av våpenhvilen i Syria og slutt på den ukrainske blokaden av Minsk-avtalen. Disse forretningene må ha irritert Washington, som vil gjøre alt som står i deres makt for å sabotere det.
Naturligvis vil Berlin og Paris til slutt rette seg etter NATOs politikk. Men fra Moskvas synspunkt er en frossen konflikt bedre enn et tap (i Ukraina, som i Transnistria, for eksempel). Og alt som kan skade enheten i NATO er signaler på slutten av USAs overlegenhet.

9955,Trump Rewards Kellyanne Conway With a Top White House Staff Slot - The New York Times,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   Kellyanne Conway, the Republican pollster and strategist who helped guide Donald J. Trump to victory in November, on Thursday was appointed counselor to the president, becoming the   woman at the White House and one of his principal messengers to the public. Ms. Conway will be joined in the West Wing, steps from the Oval Office, by Sean Spicer, a veteran Washington political operative, who will be the face of Mr. Trump’s administration as its press secretary, the transition team announced. Along with several other White House communications specialists appointed on Thursday, the pair will wage daily battles with legislators on Mr. Trump’s behalf while seeking to preserve the president’s political power base among voters outside the capital. Ms. Conway and Mr. Spicer will also be responsible for a relationship with the press corps that has often turned antagonistic. The  ’s team has hinted that they may change the way reporters are treated, and possibly eliminate the daily press briefing, after a campaign during which Mr. Trump frequently derided reporters as dishonest. Ms. Conway, 49, who took over as Mr. Trump’s campaign manager in August, shortly after the Republican convention, guided him through a brutal and divisive campaign, often appearing on television to vouch for him during periods of scandal or controversy. She stood by Mr. Trump after a 2005 tape surfaced in which he boasted about groping women, proving her loyalty and helping secure her position as someone who will have the president’s ear on a wide variety of topics. In a statement, the   said Ms. Conway would continue her role as a “close adviser,” responsible for helping carry out his priorities and delivering his message from inside the White House. “She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message,” Mr. Trump said. “I am pleased that she will be part of my senior team in the West Wing. ” Jason Miller, a Republican operative who was an early spokesman for Mr. Trump during the campaign, will become the communications director at the White House, transition officials announced. Hope Hicks, who served as a campaign spokeswoman, will become the director of strategic communications, and Dan Scavino will be the director of social media. The new members of the staff will have the power to shape Mr. Trump’s presence in Washington as he makes the transition from businessman to president. The   is also under pressure from his supporters to deal aggressively with the national press corps. And his political advisers will help guide him through a potentially contentious relationship with some members of Congress, including ones from his own party. The West Wing sweepstakes has provoked a weekslong roiling debate within Mr. Trump’s circle over who should fill prime posts. It also reflected the  ’s apparent dissatisfaction with some of his options for who would appear at the White House podium as press secretary. Mr. Trump had hoped to have a woman at least share those briefing duties. But after Ms. Conway declined, Mr. Trump eventually dismissed alternatives that could have signaled a more hostile approach to the press, such as the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a Fox News host and commentator. Mr. Spicer, 45, is a fierce advocate for Mr. Trump and can be combative with reporters. But he is also a familiar face in Washington, having served for years as the chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee. His ascension to one of the most visible jobs in Washington represents a victory for Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and the incoming chief of staff, in internal jockeying with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    as well as with Stephen K. Bannon, who will be Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, and Vice   Mike Pence. Mr. Trump is deeply fond of Ms. Conway, whose job as counselor will give her frequent access to the president. Considered a “Trump whisperer” during the campaign, and someone who was particularly adept at explaining his appeal to voters, Ms. Conway will serve as one of the chief protectors of Mr. Trump’s political brand. She also has been a favorite strategist for other conservative candidates, such as Newt Gingrich during the 2012 presidential race, and she was an adviser to Mr. Pence during his run for governor of Indiana. She has reportedly clashed at times with Mr. Priebus and Mr. Kushner. Both men were frustrated when she gave a series of interviews in which she criticized Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, who was being considered for secretary of state despite having been a key figure of opposition to Mr. Trump during the campaign. With a   approach that has appealed to Mr. Trump, Ms. Conway was credited during the campaign  —   even by Democrats who opposed her  —   with smoothing out some of Mr. Trump’s most jagged edges during her appearances on television. In the coming days, Mr. Trump is also expected to name three deputy chiefs of staff to help Mr. Priebus manage the sprawling operations at the White House. Among those being considered for these posts are Katie Walsh, who was the chief of staff at the Republican National Committee Joe Hagin, who was the deputy chief of staff for operations through most of George W. Bush’s administration and Rick A. Dearborn, who was the chief of staff to Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has been selected by Mr. Trump to serve as attorney general. Tending to Mr. Trump’s relationships in Washington is likely to fall, in part, to Bill Stepien, who is in line to be the new political director. Mr. Stepien once played that role as the longtime political adviser to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, but was fired for his part in the scandal involving a plot to punish a Democratic mayor by closing traffic lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge. Mr. Stepien has been credited by Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon, who brought him on board in August, with helping them secure Mr. Trump’s victory in November. It is unclear how Mr. Trump intends to use David Bossie, who left the conservative nonprofit group Citizens United to be the deputy campaign manager, and was among Mr. Trump’s earliest informal advisers about a presidential run. Mr. Bossie frequently clashed with Mr. Priebus, and Mr. Trump was dissatisfied with him by the end of the campaign. He has sought to be a deputy chief of staff. One loyal aide who will not be joining the president’s White House staff is Corey Lewandowski, who was recruited to be Mr. Trump’s first campaign manager at the recommendation of Mr. Bossie. Mr. Lewandowski, who was fired from the campaign early last summer, waged the most visible fight for a role at the White House. In the end, though, he will remain outside the gates, announcing on Twitter on Wednesday that he has set up a Washington public relations and consulting business a block from the White House. “I will always be President Trump’s biggest supporter,” Mr. Lewandowski wrote in a news release announcing the new business, Avenue Strategies. The   of the firm is Barry Bennett, who managed the presidential campaign of Ben Carson Mr. Lewandowski brought him onto the Trump campaign after Mr. Carson dropped out.",0
9956,Scientists About To Pour $100 Million Into Looking For Aliens Around Weird Star,"Scientists About To Pour $100 Million Into Looking For Aliens Around Weird Star 10/26/2016 
THE DAILY CALLER 
Astronomers are about to pour $100 million into investigating a star that may be surrounded by a large structure built by an alien civilization. 
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley’s Breakthrough Listen project of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) are turning the program’s $100 million budget into investigating the star’s unique behavior. 
“Everyone, every SETI program telescope, I mean every astronomer that has any kind of telescope in any wavelength that can see Tabby’s star has looked at it,” Dr. Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center, said in a press statement . “It’s been looked at with Hubble, it’s been looked at with Keck, it’s been looked at in the infrared and radio and high energy, and every possible thing you can imagine, including a whole range of SETI experiments. Nothing has been found.” 
Researchers will repeatedly scan the star for eight hours per night over the next two months to examine its extremely unusually dimming behavior. The star randomly dims by as much as 22 percent of its output at extremely irregular intervals. This is consistent with large orbiting masses, much larger than planets, blocking out some of the star’s light when they pass in front of it. All the natural forms of large masses which could cause KIC 8462852’s dimming aren’t consistent with the star’s age . 
Scientists found the first possible evidence of this extraterrestrial civilization around KIC 8462852 last October , when astronomers with Yale University and other top schools published a study that used NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope. 
So far, astronomers haven’t found a single naturalistic explanation for the star’s exceedingly unusual dimming, which explains the extremely unusual behavior of the star. Astronomers have examined 500 other stars in the vicinity of KIC 8462852, and seen nothing else like it. 
The dense formations near KIC 8462852 are similar to “Dyson Spheres,” hypothetical, are energy-harvesting “megastuctures” theoretical aliens could hypothetically build by rearranging the solar system. Scientists have pondered the existence of Dyson Spheres since the 1960s, thinking they could be a potential solution to energy problems faced by an extremely old civilization. SETI scientists have long argued humans could detect distant alien civilizations by looking for technological artifacts like Dyson Spheres orbiting other stars. 
“We spent a long time trying to convince ourselves this wasn’t real. We just weren’t able to,” Ben Montet, a Caltech astronomer who co-authored research on the star, told Gizmodo . “None of the considered phenomena can alone explain the observations.” 
The best naturalistic explanation favored by astronomers, involves a huge mass of comets erratically orbiting the star and creating enough dust to dim the light, but a January analysis of the star’s history renders that hypothesis implausible, since the unprecedented dimming has continued for over a century. In order to dim for such a long time period, the star would need to have millions of times more dust and comets orbiting it than is the case. 
Astronomers estimate that the dimming would require roughly 648,000 giant comets of 200 kilometers in diameter, all aligned to pass in front of the star. The chances of such a formation render it essentially impossible, and there is currently no remotely plausible scientific explanation for what is going on with KIC 8462852. 
Astronomers have previously frequently misjudge abnormal stellar occurrences and, usually, the abnormalities are simply a new phenomenon. 
A graduate student in astronomy, found an usual pulsing radio signal so predictable it seemed to be a sign of intelligent life in 1967. The astronomers even nicknamed the signal LGM-1, for “little green men,” and believed they had detected a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization , but it turned out to be the first pulsar.",0
9957,Illegal in Massachusetts: Asking Your Salary in a Job Interview - The New York Times,"In a groundbreaking effort to close the wage gap between men and women, Massachusetts has become the first state to bar employers from asking about applicants’ salaries before offering them a job. The new law will require hiring managers to state a compensation figure upfront  —   based on what an applicant’s worth is to the company, rather than on what he or she made in a previous position. The bipartisan legislation, signed into law on Monday by Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, is being pushed as a model for other states, as the issue of men historically outearning women who do the same job has leapt onto the national political scene. Nationally, there have been repeated efforts to strengthen equal pay laws  —   which are already on the books but tend to lack teeth  —   but none have succeeded so far. Hillary Clinton has tried to make equal pay a signature issue of her campaign, while Donald J. Trump’s daughter Ivanka praised her father for his actions on this issue when she spoke at the Republican National Convention. By barring companies from asking prospective employees how much they earned at their last jobs, Massachusetts will ensure that the historically lower wages and salaries assigned to women and minorities do not follow them for their entire careers. Companies tend to set salaries for new hires using their previous pay as a base line. “I think very few businesses consciously discriminate, but they need to become aware of it,” said State Senator Pat Jehlen, a Democrat and one of the bill’s  . “These are things that don’t just affect one job it keeps women’s wages down over their entire lifetime. ” Federal law already prohibits   pay discrimination, but violations are hard to prove and wage gaps persist in nearly every industry. Nationally, women are paid 79 cents for every dollar that men earn, according to the United States Census Bureau. A number of factors affect that statistic, including the career fields women choose, but economists consistently find evidence of pay disparities not offset by other variables. The Massachusetts law, which will go into effect in July 2018, takes other steps as well to combat pay discrimination. Companies will not be allowed to prohibit workers from telling others how much they are paid, a move that proponents say can increase salary transparency and help employees discover disparities. And the law will require equal pay not just for workers whose jobs are alike, but also for those whose work is of “comparable character” or who work in “comparable operations. ” Workers with more seniority will still be permitted to earn higher pay, but the law effectively broadens the definition of what is equal work. Other states have also been stepping up their protections. In May, Maryland passed a law that requires equal pay for “comparable” work, and California last year enacted a law that is one of the nation’s strictest, requiring employers to be able to prove that they pay workers of both genders equally for “substantially similar” jobs. It, too, had the backing of important local trade groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce. And Massachusetts joins at least 12 other states that already require companies to let employees compare notes about how much they are paid. The distinguishing feature in the Massachusetts law is that job seekers will no longer be compelled to disclose their salary or wages at their current or previous jobs  —   which often leaves applicants with the nagging suspicion that they might have been offered more money if the earlier figure had been higher. People will still be allowed to volunteer their salary information. “This is a sea change, and we hope it will be used as a model in other states,” said Victoria A. Budson, executive director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and chairwoman of the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women. The law in her state, she said, “will help every single individual who applies for a job, not just women. ” Efforts to pass a national   law, the Paycheck Fairness Act, have been repeatedly blocked by congressional Republicans. Opponents, including the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful business lobbying group, say that such laws would increase litigation and unfairly restrict employers’ compensation decisions. But proponents of equal pay laws say that attitudes are shifting among businesses. In Massachusetts, for instance, the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce was an early and enthusiastic backer. “That really set the tone,” said State Representative Ellen Story, a Democrat and   of the bill. “Now it wasn’t just members of the women’s caucus, it was business leaders, too, asking for this. ” The Massachusetts attorney general will be in charge of enforcing the law, which also gives workers the right to sue companies directly for violations. In June, 28 businesses nationwide, including large employers like Gap, Pepsi and American Airlines, signed an Equal Pay Pledge promoted by the White House in which they committed to conducting annual audits of their pay by gender across all job categories. “Companies that want to do the right thing are seeing that these new laws really pose no threat,” said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women  Families, which tracks the fair pay bills introduced in state legislatures. “It’s absolutely started to pick up. These laws are not just passing in completely blue places,” she added,” they’re passing with bipartisan votes. ” Businesses are also beginning to talk more openly about the often uncomfortable things those audits find. PricewaterhouseCoopers published the results of a pay analysis it did of its British staff. It found a 15. 1 percent pay disparity between men and women, and changed its promotion practices to bring more women into senior leadership roles. Salesforce, a cloud software company, says it spent $3 million last year to raise the salaries of female employees to match their male counterparts. Academic research has illustrated the negative effect pay disparity has not just on individuals, but also on the broader economy. Closing the gender wage gap would lower the poverty rates in every state, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Just as important, according to advocates of equal pay, are the changing demographics in boardrooms and statehouses. Ms. Jehlen, one of the Massachusetts bill’s   recalled the first time she testified about equal pay issues before the legislature’s labor committee: All the members were men. She and others had taken up the cause on behalf of a group of female cafeteria workers who filed a lawsuit in 1991 seeking parity with male janitors, who did comparable work, the cafeteria workers said, but were paid significantly more. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled against the women, saying that the state’s equal pay law was not clear in its definition of comparable work. This week, one of those cafeteria workers attended the ceremony at which Governor Baker signed the new law. “For me,” Ms. Jehlen said, “that was the most emotionally powerful thing. ”",0
9959,"Soaring at 1,500 Feet With Michael Fabiano, Opera’s Risk-Taking Tenor - The New York Times","“He’s either going to be fantastic  —   or dead. ” That was the verdict of some of opera’s keenest vocal judges a decade ago when they awarded Michael Fabiano, an explosively talented tenor who was 22 at the time and pushing himself hard, a   win at the 2007 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. A decade later, he is one of the most exciting,   singers in the world  —   but the fatalistic warning was still ringing in my ears a few Sundays ago when Mr. Fabiano, who likes to pilot planes on his days off, took me for a flight. As we buckled into a small Piper Archer at Essex County Airport in New Jersey, near his childhood home, Mr. Fabiano rattled off a battery of safety instructions that went well beyond the usual flight attendant script: where to find the fire extinguisher, how to brace yourself over the instrument panel if necessary, how to unlatch the door in case of a crash landing. He cried “Clear prop!” then started the propeller, and up we went. I found myself wondering if I would have felt safer flown by a singer who was not quite as   for    —   or perhaps by a baritone, or anyone other than an impassioned tenor. “Safe never wins,” Mr. Fabiano, 32, said in an interview, explaining the philosophy that has guided everything from his choice of roles to his decision to act on a lifelong dream and get his pilot’s license, despite the dangers. “I’m very, very big on preparation. I take prepared gambles. ” These are heady days for Mr. Fabiano, whose voice abounds in the     pinging quality opera buffs sometimes call “squillo. ” He is currently singing in Verdi’s “La Traviata” at the Met opposite the soprano Sonya Yoncheva, a production that will be simulcast to cinemas around the world on March 11. This summer he will sing his first Don José in Bizet’s “Carmen” in a new staging at the    Festival in France. And, in a sign of his arrival as an international star, he will open the   season at the Royal Opera House in London, in a production to be announced next month. But at nearly every step, Mr. Fabiano has been dogged by questions like the ones that the National Council judges raised a decade ago  —   about whether he was biting off too much, too soon. It is a dilemma many young singers face: Push hard and risk damaging your voice, or err on the side of caution and chance missing your moment. I witnessed one of his more remarkable gambles two years ago. The Met phoned him one afternoon while he was home in Philadelphia and asked if he would step in for an ailing tenor in Donizetti’s “Lucia di Lammermoor” six and a half hours later, in a staging he had never seen, let alone rehearsed. I happened to be at the opera house that day reporting another article. Despite the pressure he was facing  —   he had zipped up on Amtrak  —   he let me tag along as he got hastily fitted for costumes and raced through a battery of   rehearsals. By 11:05 p. m. he was basking in a standing ovation, and nursing a head wound from a cut he got exiting the stage. His exploit made international news. Reminded of the old “fantastic or dead” paths suggested by the National Council judges (in a scene captured in “The Audition,” a documentary about the competition) Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said, “He seems to have gone towards the fantastic. ” Mr. Gelb’s plans include mounting a revival of Verdi’s “I Lombardi,” which Mr. Fabiano has sung to tumultuous acclaim, for him in the   season. “Everyone wants to be the next Domingo,” Mr. Gelb said. “The question for him is being careful and selective, and not blowing his voice out by taking on roles that are too much for him. ” As the plane floated above New Jersey, the Willowbrook Mall visible down below, Mr. Fabiano turned toward Lincoln Park, where he lived as a child. “Do you see that red roof?” he asked, gesturing down below. “That was my home. ” Opera was not always in the cards for Mr. Fabiano, whose family moved to Minnesota when he was 11, but whose accent is still more Jersey than Twin Cities. He comes from a musical family  —   an aunt was an opera singer  —   and he sang in high school, but as a teenager he was more interested in debate, mock trial and being a baseball umpire. (Mr. Fabiano, who cuts a trim, muscular figure now, took to umpiring rather than playing in part because he was overweight in his youth he shed 80 pounds the year he turned 20.) It was not until he got into the University of Michigan and began studying with George Shirley, a tenor who was one of the first   men to sing leading roles at the Met in the 1960s, that he became serious about singing. Mr. Shirley said that Mr. Fabiano was on a fast track from the start. “He sings with such passion  —   that’s one of the things that makes people concerned,” he said in a telephone interview. “Because whatever Michael does, it’s 3, 000 percent. There’s no backing off. That’s his personality. But so far, so good. He walks to the beat of his own drummer, and so far, the beat is solid. ” Some of Mr. Fabiano’s advisers warned him against taking on the taxing title role in Verdi’s “Don Carlo” last season at the San Francisco Opera, one of his main artistic homes in recent years. But he studied the role for three and a half years and nailed it. During the run last June, we got together at the Presidio, at a favorite spot of his overlooking the Pacific Ocean. “I always think that the great performances are the performances where you think a singer is going right to the edge,” said Mr. Fabiano, who will return to San Francisco next season to star in Massenet’s “Manon,” opposite Nadine Sierra. “When a singer has gone right to the edge, either they just make it or they break slightly and you think, that’s it. ” A dramatic fog rolled in off the ocean as we spoke. Then we headed back to the War Memorial Opera House in his black BMW Mr. Fabiano, who is on the road 11 months a year, had it shipped across country as a taste of home. As the traffic thickened, he began aggressively weaving in and out, explaining that he did not believe in defensive driving. “There are a lot of defensive singers,” he said, a dismissive edge in his voice, “who pursue their careers defensively. ” These are tricky times for an    opera star. Many companies are struggling financially singers’ fees have been cut in many places the recording industry is not what it was. Mr. Fabiano said that when he decided to make opera his career, he carefully mapped out the steps he needed to succeed. “I felt like a businessman, not like an artist,” he said. “I know so many people don’t want to hear that. I’m a businessman at the core. ” Some gambles paid off, some did not  —   looking back, he said, it was a mistake to sing at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan at 23, saying he was “too green” to make it a success. But he is constantly trying new things: Last fall, he and some friends started a foundation, ArtSmart, to give free voice lessons to teenagers who lack access. Its pilot program, at Newark East Side High School in New Jersey, reaches about a dozen students, and he plans to expand the program to Philadelphia and San Francisco. “We teach the kids any genre of music that they want to focus on,” he said, “but we do give them a base curriculum  —   stretching, breathing, vocal exercises, how to read music. ” We began our descent, the runway getting closer and closer. “Get down, honey,” he said, and a few seconds later the plane’s tires hit the tarmac.  “If I only listened to my elders and did exactly what they prescribed, I wouldn’t be who I am today,” he said, after the plane had taxied to a stop. “I might not be flying a plane, because most people told me it’s too dangerous to do, and you shouldn’t do it, and blah, blah, blah. Well, I love to fly. I will never take the careful route. ” “I don’t want to live a kind of cloistered life,” he added. “There are singers that can sing for 50 years, and there are singers that sing for 30. I’ll fall somewhere in between that. Maybe not at the high end, maybe not at the low. But somewhere. ”",0
9960,Silicon Valley’s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration. By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination. Mr. Trump’s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley’s cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its    approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration. In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades. Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump’s actions “are so   it pains us all” and that “it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. ” Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point. “We must stand with those who are affected,” he wrote on Twitter. Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the   man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He   obliged. “I’m here because I’m a refugee,” Mr. Brin said, according to a Twitter post by the Forbes writer Ryan Mac. The tech companies’ reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did. That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple   whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump’s order proclaimed that “the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States” and would be suspended indefinitely. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said that his   had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam. “Like many of you, I’’m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Friday. Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump’s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was “not the best way to address the country’s challenges. ” Mr. Musk was born in South Africa. Aaron Levie, chief executive of the data storage company Box, wrote on Twitter that “on every level  —   moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.  —   this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. ” Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, “there was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is. ” Beyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world. “Almost every company’s products  —   Google, Apple, Airbnb  —   has a global customer base,” Mr. Levie said. “These policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors. ” The Trump administration is little more than a week old, but its relationship with Silicon Valley is already complicated. The tech industry did not like Mr. Trump the presidential candidate, despite his embrace of Twitter, and he returned the sentiment with caustic posts on the platform. Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, said in 2015 that “  or   of the C. E. O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia,” an incorrect statement that many in Silicon Valley perceived as racist. Yet a   December meeting between the incoming administration and numerous tech chieftains was decidedly upbeat. “We’re going to be there for you,” Mr. Trump promised to a room that included the leaders of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. By early last week, the companies sensed trouble. Murtadha   24, an   software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out. “It may be my naïveté about how politics and industries interact, but I don’t interpret the tech community’s opposition to the president as a political stance,” Mr. Tameemi said. “It seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them. ” The larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was “concerned. ” Apple said, “It is not a policy we support. ” Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards” and said it would create “collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values. ” Microsoft was not the only company to become bolder in a few hours. Around 10 a. m. on Saturday, Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying “open doors bring all of US together. ” By 6 p. m. he was advocating open protest. Early Sunday morning, he wrote a memo to employees warning that Mr. Trump’s new policy was “a direct obstacle to our mission. ” It was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. “It feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,” said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One. Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists. Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media. At Twitter, a number of workers felt frustrated with the disconnect between their company’s product  —   a platform for free speech  —   and the extent to which Mr. Trump has used it to attack those who question him and proclaim outright falsehoods to the American public. On Saturday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, posted and reposted numerous messages denouncing the travel ban. At Facebook, employees felt a similar sense of discord. Some complained about how long it took Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, to speak out. Others were upset at the continued presence of Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg’s, as a director on Facebook’s board. Mr. Thiel was a donor to Mr. Trump’’s campaign and has since become an adviser, and he issued a statement on Saturday evening that reaffirmed his support for the president. Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory team. That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day. In an email to employees on Saturday titled “Standing up for what’s right,” Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday. As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers  —   largely immigrants  —   began a   work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order. Uber did not follow suit. Instead, it posted on Twitter that it was suspending surge pricing at Kennedy Airport. That prompted accusations that it was trying to break the strike, which the company awkwardly denied in another Twitter post. On Sunday morning, its competitor Lyft said it was donating $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years “to defend our Constitution. ” On Sunday afternoon, Uber sharpened its criticism of the ban, calling it “wrong and unjust. ” Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s most prominent   incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen. “After the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,” Mr. Altman said. “Now they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come. ” Mr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p. m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.",0
9961,Do all white people like camping? asks BBC,"Do all white people like camping? asks BBC 01-11-16 THE BBC has launched a thought-provoking investigation into whether all white people enjoy camping. Following a controversial BBC poll about whether black people like fried chicken, the corporation continued to explore the big questions around race by asking whether Caucasians love sleeping under canvas. Interviewee Tom Logan said: “As a white person I have to admit I love a bit of camping, even if it is a stereotype. “I thought it was because of the sense of being closer to nature, but maybe it’s because of my skin pigmentation. “Being asked these sorts of questions really makes you think.” However some white people have condemned the tone of the BBC report. Mary Fisher said: “Just because I like camping, Nigel Slater cookbooks and vintage French-peasant style workwear doesn’t mean I’m some white person caricature from popular culture like… “Actually I can’t think of a white person caricature from popular culture.”

9962,You Mean It’s Next Week? Why Some G.O.P. Senators Will Skip the Convention - The New York Times,"In a normal convention season, most politicians are working every lever to try to get a prime speaking slot and bathe themselves in the glow of the party’s nominee. Then there is this year. Far from straining to get close to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, more than a dozen senators suddenly have scheduling conflicts for an event that has been on the political calendar for more than a year. Instead of being in Cleveland, for instance, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona says he will be “mowing my lawn. ” The state’s senior senator, John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, has a conflict, too: He is planning to trek the Grand Canyon (Mr. McCain, who said he supports Mr. Trump, also has a      fight). Steve Daines of Montana will use the time to hone his “fly fishing. ” _____ Senators in tough races had an easy call when it came to buying a ticket to Cleveland: no mistake by the lake for them. Rather than get national exposure, along with being associated with Mr. Trump, many vulnerable incumbents like Mr. McCain are going it alone. Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Marco Rubio of Florida and Roy Blunt of Missouri all say they will be campaigning, for themselves. _____ Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Dean Heller of Nevada say they just want to reconnect with constituents. Michael D. Crapo will be conducting town   meetings in Idaho. Jerry Moran of Kansas will be on a “listening tour” in his state. Thad Cochran of Mississippi will not be going for personal and family reasons. _____ Winning the medal for putting the most distance between a senator and Mr. Trump: Lisa Murkowski will be almost 4, 000 miles away in Alaska flying around remote areas of her state on a bush plane. _____ Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, John Thune of South Dakota, Jim Risch of Idaho and David Vitter of Louisiana. _____ Distance is not an excuse for Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. Mr. Portman’s staff said he will stick around his home state and attend the convention. But the senator will be off campus at least twice when he does volunteer work for Habitat for Humanity and a Wounded Warriors kayaking event. _____ Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, John Barrasso of Wyoming, John Boozman of Arkansas, Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dan Coats of Indiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, John Cornyn of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Cory Gardner of Colorado,  Orrin G.

9964,Stephen Miller Is a ‘True Believer’ Behind Core Trump Policies - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Staff members on Capitol Hill recall Stephen Miller, the    White House adviser behind many of President Trump’s most contentious executive orders, as the guy from Jeff Sessions’s office who made their inboxes cry for mercy. As a top aide to Mr. Sessions, the conservative Alabama senator, Mr. Miller dispatched dozens and dozens of bombastic emails to congressional staff members and reporters in early 2013 when the Senate was considering a big bipartisan immigration overhaul. Mr. Miller slammed the evils of “foreign labor” and pushed around nasty news articles on proponents of compromise, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. One exhausted Senate staff member, forwarding a   to a reporter at the time, wrote: “His latest. And it’s only 11:45 a. m. ” The ascent of Mr. Miller from   gadfly with little policy experience to the president’s senior policy adviser came as a shock to many of the staff members who knew him from his seven years in the Senate. A man whose emails were, until recently, considered spam by many of his Republican peers is now shaping the Trump administration’s core domestic policies with his economic nationalism and   positions on immigration. But his unlikely rise is emblematic of a White House where unconventional résumés rule  —   where the chief strategist is Stephen K. Bannon, until recently the head of the     website Breitbart News, and the president himself is a former reality television star who before winning the nation’s highest office had never shown much interest in the arcana of governing. Yet all three men are bound by a belief in an   economic policy that has suddenly moved from the fringes of American politics to the Oval Office. “Stephen was the kind of guy who would make a passionate ideological argument to a roomful of people who were there to make pragmatic decisions,” said Alex Conant, a former aide to Mr. Rubio who remembers squaring off against Mr. Miller at a routine Republican messaging meeting that turned into a   immigration debate. Mr. Miller has been at the epicenter of some of the administration’s most provocative moves, from pushing hard for the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico to threatening   trade deals at the heart of Republican economic orthodoxy, to rolling out Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven largely Muslim nations, whose bungled introduction he oversaw. Working in an administration that “didn’t come here to do small things,” as Mr. Bannon has put it, is a role that Mr. Miller  —   universally known as a tireless worker  —   has been preparing for much of his life. From his days at a public high school in Southern California, where he preached against “political correctness” and liberalism and called in to conservative radio shows, to his time at Duke University, where he was known for controversial writings in the student newspaper and a failed attempt at a run for dorm president, he has delighted in challenging prevailing orthodoxies. At a freshman mixer, recalled a college classmate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Miller announced, “My name is Stephen Miller, I am from Los Angeles, and I like guns. ” Mr. Miller, known for his skinny ties,   ’  pants and his recently abandoned   habit, enjoyed a relatively   ascent in Mr. Trump’s orbit until the travel ban. His eagerness to keep a tight lid on key details of executive orders to prevent leaks  —   as well as his inexperience  —   has at times hampered coordination between the West Wing and agencies that would have to carry them out, several White House officials said. In part to deal with the confusion that surrounded the travel ban, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, recently created a   protocol that requires all major executive actions to be cleared with the communications department and other senior White House staff members before implementation. But Mr. Miller’s peacock confidence has served him well with Mr. Trump, who first got to know him in 2015, when Mr. Miller helped bring Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general, into the Trump fold. After the Republican National Convention in July, Mr. Miller became Mr. Trump’s principal    speechwriter once the candidate had switched from handwritten notes to a teleprompter in the middle of the campaign. The message in those speeches was so reflective of Mr. Trump’s views that it earned Mr. Miller a spot as the   act for Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies. His words became Mr. Trump’s  —   “We’re going to build that wall, and we’re going to build it out of love,” Mr. Miller often said. “Steve is a true believer in every sense of the word, not just in this message of economic populism but in President Trump as a leader,” said Jason Miller, who worked with him in the Trump campaign and is not related. “Steve’s fiercely loyal and has a better understanding of the president’s vision than almost anyone. ” It is sometimes hard to tell Mr. Trump’s voice from that of Mr. Miller, who suppressed his own orotund speech to capture the president’s more visceral,    style. Not that he has had much choice: As one of three or four staff members to fly around with Mr. Trump during the last few months of the campaign, Mr. Miller was summoned to speechwriting tasks by a bark of “Ready!” from Mr. Trump, who insisted on dictating practically every word  —   and laced into staff members who changed a word or inserted an overly complex policy point. Mr. Miller’s flexibility as a speechwriter is offset by the consistent stridency of his political philosophy, which has remained much the same since he was the distinct minority at Santa Monica High School, a liberal outpost where he often railed against fellow students and the school administration. Mexican heritage celebrations and Iraq war protests were things of particular offense. He produced a 2003 essay, “How I Changed My Left Wing High School,” that capped a high school career steeped in political activism. At Duke, Mr. Miller, who is Jewish, cut a similarly confrontational swath, and was briefly friendly with Richard Spencer, who later became a prominent white supremacist, when both were members of the university’s Young Conservatives chapter. From there, it was straight to Capitol Hill, where Mr. Miller worked for Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and John Shadegg of Arizona before ending up with Mr. Sessions in 2009. Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller worked tirelessly against the   congressional effort at an immigration overhaul. The bill passed the Senate easily in spite of Mr. Sessions’s vociferous objections, but failed in the House. “We knew we were taking on the establishment, and Steve was an incredibly hard worker and had no second thoughts about it,” Mr. Sessions said in an interview. Mr. Miller wrote many of the incendiary speeches that Mr. Sessions gave about the bill, including one in which he suggested that a   aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been the author of a measure that he believed to be “amnesty” in disguise. Ultimately, it was Mr. Miller’s dour views on illegal immigration that endeared him to Mr. Bannon and a small team of   economic nationalists that included Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer. The group came together during the 2014 campaign of the   Republican candidate Dave Brat, whose upset win over the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in a suburban Richmond, Va. district augured Mr. Trump’s success. Even then, Mr. Miller had his eye on Mr. Trump, who had flirted with a run for president in 2012. Soon after Mr. Brat’s victory in the Republican primary in July 2014, Mr. Miller sent his friends a Breitbart interview in which Mr. Trump declared, “Everybody is vulnerable because what’s happening in the country is very sad, and the world is watching. ” Mr. Miller added a comment: “Trump gets it. I wish he’d run for president. ” Mr. Bannon, Mr. Miller and the   head of the Domestic Policy Council, Andrew Bremberg, spent the later part of the transition period mapping out a    protocol of executive orders, sending more than 200 to federal agencies for review. The trouble came when they sent some of them to   officials at federal agencies for review, leading to leaks that prompted Mr. Miller to restrict the circulation of the plans. Mr. Trump, initially pleased by the bold series of executive actions orchestrated by the team, was stung by the fallout from Mr. Miller’s execution of the immigration order, and expressed frustration about not being fully briefed on an order reorganizing the National Security Council to give Mr. Bannon additional power. Despite the internal   Mr. Miller remains close to the   Mr. Bannon, who described him in an email as “a loyal and faithful soldier in the Trump movement, a warrior for the working class. ” In recent days, Mr. Miller has been working on what is expected to be another contentious order: an    rewriting of the guest worker program that is likely to impose new restrictions on the cheap foreign labor that Mr. Miller deplored in many of his 2013 emails, according to two officials familiar with their planning. Mr. Miller, one of the officials said, is working closely with Department of Homeland Security aides to avoid a repeat of the travel ban fiasco.",0

9966,"John Bolton: If North Korea Gets Nuclear Missiles, ‘Iran Could Have That Capability the Next Day’","On Friday’s Breitbart News Daily, former U. N. ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow for a look at President Trump’s first hundred days from a foreign policy and national security perspective. [Bolton said Trump’s record has been “mixed, depending on what area of the world, what particular crisis you look at, and really what point during the hundred days that you take. ”  “I think in many respects the campaign rhetoric  —   which was very, very tough on things like the Iran nuclear deal and the North Korean nuclear threat, much of which continued into the first hundred days  —   is very much at risk of being subverted by the bureaucracy that the administration has not yet tamed,” he cautioned.  “There’s a significant risk that both because of some of the appointees that the president has named, and the appointees he hasn’t named  —   the people in the lower ranks who are the president’s eyes and ears and implementers out in the bureaucracy, particularly at the State Department, which is expert at capturing political appointees, especially from Republican administrations. If the president’s not careful, he will see his foreign policy  —   despite what I think his own views are  —   captured by the same bureaucracy that for eight years implemented the Obama foreign policy,” he elaborated.  “That’s the danger that I see. I don’t think the president has moved on some of these key national security issues as far as the press would like you to believe, or as far as the bureaucracy would like you to believe. It remains to be seen how many people in the administration can remember what they said during the campaign on some of these issues,  particularly terrorism and nuclear proliferation, as the bureaucracy nibbles away at them,” said Bolton. “I think the president needs to be more of a disciplinarian with his subordinates and their bureaucracy,” he advised.  “I think that may be contrary to his natural instincts. I think he is an open, optimistic kind of man, and I think in the Trump Organization it was small enough that that kind of approach worked. But in the sprawling federal government, where different departments and agencies have their own cultures and their own agendas, especially in national security where they’re not friendly to Republican administrations, he needs to be tougher out there. I’m worried about what we’re going to do on Iran. I’m worried about what we’re going to do on North Korea,” Bolton said. He warned there is “a whole range of issues where there is a real risk of creeping back to the Obama administration policy  —   as the poem goes, ‘not with a bang but with a whimper. ’” “Now, in other areas, I think he’s pretty much holding the line, which is why I say overall I think the performance in the first hundred days is mixed,” Bolton concluded. Focusing on the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton recalled the State Department’s letter to Congress last week which “certified that Iran was in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal. ” “That is simply not true, in terms of their refusal to let the International Atomic Energy Agency visit key military sites, their excessive production of heavy water, their excessive enrichment of uranium, their gross disregard of the Security Council resolution and the part of the agreement dealing with ballistic missiles,” he asserted. “And those are just some of the things we know publicly. These are plain violations of the agreement. And that doesn’t count the provisions of the agreement that are so ambiguous, so poorly drafted, so open to interpretations favorable to Iran that lawyers could end up debating them for decades into the future. ”  “What’s even worse is, if you read the congressional statute carefully, the reporting obligation does not require the president to make a binary decision  —   yes Iran is in compliance, or no Iran is not in compliance. By the statute’s own terms, it allows the president to say, ‘I am not able to certify that Iran is in compliance,’ which he would have been perfectly legitimate within his rights to do, especially given the newness of the administration,” he noted. “Now, where did that certification come from? It came from the State Department bureaucracy. It came from the same people who negotiated the deal that was finally agreed to in the summer of 2015, and who have been protecting it, nurturing it, sheltering it for a year and a half since then. This may sound like a small point, but I’ll tell you, the proponents of the deal have taken that certification in just one week and said, ‘See, even the Trump administration says that the good old ayatollahs in Iran are complying with the deal,’” Bolton said.  “The negative implication of that, as the Trump administration then goes on to say Iran’s behavior in most material respects, as the president himself said, violates the spirit of the deal. Well, it goes beyond that. It violates the letter of the deal as well,” he contended.  “I’ve heard different stories, frankly, about whether the White House cleared that document or not, or whether  —   as is often the case with the bureaucracy  —   they come running in and say, ‘This is due on Capitol Hill at 5 P. M.! We’ve got to send it! We’ve got to send it, or we’ll be in default, we’ll be delinquent, we’ll be subject to criticism!’ So people say well, all right, I guess we’ve got to send it, and they don’t have time to think through the implications,” he said. “This is to me a kind of textbook example, in the case of Iran, how a very strong and   foreign policy just gets whittled away. It may seem like water eroding rock. It doesn’t happen in dramatic moments. But I’m just telling you, this is the way bureaucracy works, and it works to undercut especially conservative and Republican presidents,” Bolton lamented. Breitbart News National Security Editor Frances Martel joined the conversation to ask Bolton about the deep relationship between the nuclear issues in Iran and North Korea, which are generally treated as entirely separate matters in media coverage. “The media don’t get the connection, and that in part is because the national security bureaucracy doesn’t get, or doesn’t want to talk about, the connection,” Bolton replied, portraying it as “a classic bureaucratic example of what they call silos. ” “You’ve got the people dealing with Iran there in one silo, you’ve got the people dealing with North Korea in another silo. They might as well be on different planets,” he explained.  “But the fact is, again, from publicly available information going back 30 years, we know that the North Koreans and the Iranians have been in close cooperation on the development of ballistic missiles for that entire period. North Korea sold Iran the first SCUD missiles that were the basis for the Iranian missile program. They’ve cooperated in multiple ways since then. It makes perfectly good sense for that to happen. They’re both using the same   SCUD missile technology for their missile programs, so they’ve got a common scientific and engineering base. Their objectives for the missile programs are exactly the same. It’s to deliver nuclear weapons, not launch communications or weather satellites. On that score, it’s just absolutely clear,” Bolton said.  “It is less clear in terms of publicly available evidence on the nuclear side, but I think there is substantial reason to believe there’s close cooperation there as well,” he continued. “The reactor that Israel destroyed in Syria in September of 2007 was being built by North Koreans. It was a clone of the North Korean Yongbyon reactor. Most people don’t think Syria had the financial wherewithal to pay for building that kind of reactor, and the North Koreans don’t do anything for free, so where did the money come from? I think it probably came from Iran. ”  “I think there are a lot of other connections that have been noted, the Iranian scientists in North Korea and vice versa. Forget the Iran nuclear deal for a minute  —   it’s entirely foreseeable that the day North Korea gets the capability to drop a nuclear warhead on the United States via ballistic missile, Iran could have that capability the next day by writing a check in the right amount of money, so this relationship is extremely important,” he warned.  “On North Korea itself, the administration started off again with a very tough line on this  —   and yet yesterday, in an interview with Fox News, Secretary Tillerson said he’d be willing to have bilateral discussions with North Korea. This is after saying that the Obama ‘strategic patience’ doctrine was being rejected, after saying correctly we’ve negotiated with North Korea for 25 years and it hasn’t produced anything. Now we’re back to negotiating with North Korea and pressuring China to pressure North Korea. This is like Year 26 of the same failed policy,” Bolton complained.  “Now, I don’t want to overstate that, the secretary might have misstated what he implied by that, and certainly China has done a few things in the past couple of weeks that look encouraging. But I’ve been around that track before. When the heat gets too great, the Chinese pat the North Koreans on the fanny and say, ‘bad boys!’ They take some steps that appear to put pressure on North Korea, and then they hope that Americans with our famously short attention spans turn away, and the heat goes off, and then they quietly go back to business as before the particular crisis,” he said. Bolton urged policymakers to remember that North Korea sees nuclear weapons as a tool for implementing a dangerous   policy agenda, which they would not abandon even if their nuclear aspirations were decisively thwarted. “I think the same is true for the ayatollahs in Iran,” he added. “So when you say to Kim   and his generals, ‘Give up your nuclear weapons,’ what they hear is ‘give up up your regime, and maybe give up your lives, while we’re on the subject.’ They’re not going to do it. ”  “We have tried diplomacy, persuasion. We have tried sanctions, coercion, in differing measures, different combinations, for 26 years. It just hasn’t worked,” he said.  “That’s why I think the only   solution is reunifying the two Koreas,” Bolton offered. “I think we could explain to China why that’s in their best interest. The Chinese say they don’t want North Korea to have a nuclear weapon because it would be destabilizing in East Asia. That’s code for saying they’re afraid Japan is going to get nuclear weapons. But they have not taken the steps necessary in the past to pressure North Korea to give up the weapons because they understand just how frail that regime really is, and they’re worried it will collapse in an uncontrolled fashion that will cause them all kinds of problems. ”  “I think there’s a deal here. I think it’s complicated and difficult to negotiate. I wish we had started 15 years ago. But we’re in a race now, because the factor that’s changed from the last 25 years to today is, North Korea this time is really very close to having the capability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon, put it under the nose cone of an ICBM, and launch the ICBM towards the United States. That’s what’s really driving people,” Bolton observed.  “Obama just watched it all happen for eight years. He’s dumped this problem on the Trump administration. But it’s also why we need a policy change. If you try in Year 26 to keep doing what you’ve done and failed to accomplish your objective, for the last 25 years  —   who has any reason to believe that in Year 26 you’re going to get a different result?” he asked. Marlow asked what South Koreans thought of his unification idea. “Many of them are not wild about it, because they look at the example of German reunification, they saw it was very costly to the West Germans,” Bolton conceded. “I think there are real differences between the two circumstances. I think in fact for South Korea this is a huge economic opportunity, to be perfectly crass about it. You’ve got a wage base in North Korea of roughly zero, so that by putting manufacturing and other facilities up there, eventually the wages in North Korea will be the same as the wages in South Korea, but not in the immediate future. ”  “It is something that’s going to come anyway,” he predicted. “The division of the Korean peninsula is unnatural, just as the division of Germany was. It was always intended to be temporary until the Cold War intervened. There will be reunification one day. The issue remains, will it be accomplished in a restrained and careful fashion that works out in our interests, and maybe in the interests of China as well, or will it occur catastrophically?”  “If the United States at some point has to strike preemptively against North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, there’s every prospect that that could ignite a broader conflict on the peninsula that would be devastating all around, and would almost certainly produce the collapse of the North Korean regime. I would say to China, ‘Look, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. Which would you rather do? ’” he advised.  “That’s why I think the larger objective of reunification has to be really the policy objective because we tried to stop the nuclear program in North Korea for 25 years and we have failed. We have failed because persuasion has failed. We have failed because coercion has failed. We have failed because the combination of coercion and persuasion has failed. So now we’re going to try it again? I just hope that’s not where the State Department is going,” said Bolton. Marlow suggested it might be difficult to reconcile the intense amount of diplomacy and economic involvement required to achieve Korean unification with President Trump’s campaign promise of an “America First” foreign policy. “The detonation of a nuclear weapon on a major American city can really concentrate your attention,” Bolton replied. “This is putting America first. We are a global power. That’s a reality. Therefore, our interests are worldwide. South Korea and Japan are two of our biggest trading partners, and they are threatened by this erratic, irrational regime in North Korea. We are on the verge of being threatened in the United States ourselves. We’ve got inadequate defense capabilities. ”  “Barack Obama gutted the national missile defense program that George Bush had started. We’d be in much better shape if we could defend ourselves against North Korean or Iranian missile launches, but we have a wholly inadequate capability at the moment. So there are a lot of challenges that the president has to face, even though  —   like most presidents, I suppose  —   he’d rather focus on domestic issues,” Bolton observed. John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and president of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

9968,End of the Line for Penn Station’s Departure Board - The New York Times,"The departure board at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan has departed this life, but unlike Elvis, it has not left the building. Amtrak disconnected the board on Monday, stretching tarpaulins over one side of the familiar,   sign that told commuters whether the 5:54 to Metuchen, N. J. would be a touch late  —   and, when the time finally came, which track they could find it on. The other side of the board was left uncovered, a big, black, blank rectangle. Amtrak had said the departure board’s demise would begin around 10 p. m. on Monday, after the evening rush. For once, Amtrak was early. By the time commuters arrived at 6 p. m. the board was off, compounding the aggravation of a bad night caused by heavy winds and rain. Some commuters wondered if the   board was related to the delays on New Jersey Transit, which shares Penn Station with Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road. An Amtrak spokeswoman, Kimberly Woods, said it was not. She said the board was turned off for testing and restarted before the final shutdown after 10. As early as 3:37 p. m. New Jersey Transit had warned on Twitter that there would be “major delays” because a storm had knocked down power lines in Linden, N. J. Trains from Trenton to Metropark, a major station, were suspended for about 30 minutes during the evening rush, but the delays continued even after service resumed. The old board was replaced by video monitors that have been functioning for several months. There are large monitors at both ends of the main waiting area on the west side of the station and smaller ones above the gates. Another large monitor is in the rotundalike space on the east side of the station, where there is also an arrivals monitor. Ms. Woods said Amtrak made the change in “our ongoing effort to improve and upgrade the passenger experience. ” “It’s like anything else  —   modern times, and everything’s digital,” said H. Edward Wilkin III, an accountant who was on the way to Secaucus, N. J. on Tuesday morning. But the trains were no more modern. Mr. Wilkin had a noon appointment. The new departure screen reported that his 11:06 train would be delayed. For how long, it did not say. Some commuters said the change made no difference, because the old board had little to do with the reality of when trains actually pulled away from the station, and they doubted the new screens would be any more accurate. Amtrak said the old board would be dismantled over the next few nights, when crowds in the station were thinnest. “I’ve been taking these trains since I was 18, going to college,” said Joe Castaldo, 63, who grew up in Oceanport, N. J. and now runs a   firm in Manhattan. “I’m sad the board is gone. It’s nostalgic, I know. ” He said the new screens were better, but the change was jarring for his mother, whom he had just put on a train. “She was like, ‘What am I going to do now? ’” Mr. Castaldo said. The old board was a centerpiece, the thing that brought a community together  —   a community of strangers about to be on a train. The board on the west side of the station was the heart of the waiting area  —   the town square, such as it was. A town square with linoleum underfoot, not grass, and fluorescent lighting above, not a Norman Rockwell sky. Like something from the days when newspapers hung bulletins outside their offices, the board told stories  —   and like Twitter, it told them in a minimum of characters, with few full sentences. Explanations were not always provided for “Delayed” or “Standby. ” The departure board that was disconnected on Monday was not the one many thought it was. It was not the one made by the Italian company Solari that whirred and clicked like the boards on television game shows in the 1960s. That sign was replaced about 15 years ago by the device that went dark on Monday, which had become too difficult to keep going, Amtrak said last summer. “That one can only do letters and numbers and columns,” said Kevin Farley, a digital experience strategist who was on his way to Philadelphia on Tuesday. “It was a classic design. ” Then, nodding toward one of the new electronic screens, he added: “This is still a little  . We’d like to know: Is the wind going to affect us? They could do little messages like that. ” At the other end of the waiting area, Ritu Narula, a lawyer heading to Washington, complained about legibility. “You can’t see the track number as easily” on the new screens, she said. “But we’ll get used to it. ” Did the new screens make the wait more pleasant or the lines shorter? Some remembered the architect Vincent J. Scully Jr. ’s famous line about the old Penn Station, demolished in the 1960s, as compared with the present one: “One entered the city like a god one scuttles in now like a rat. ” “I always feel like a rodent in there, getting from Point A to Point B,” Lorraine B. Diehl, the author of “The Late, Great Pennsylvania Station,” said from her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. As for the departure screens, she said, “I can’t pretend it’s something I care about. ” “To me, the bigger picture has to be addressed,” she said. “We need a new station. ”",0
9969,Ankara to benefit from Mosul operation if city avoids trap of sectarianism,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:01 UTC © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun Ankara will benefit from the Mosul operation in case the city is not divided into sectarian areas after liberation, Yasar Yakis, Turkey's former minister of foreign affairs, told Sputnik on the sidelines of the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. ""Benefits for Ankara from Mosul operation will depend on what will be done in Mosul after ISIS [Daesh] is cleared from there, whether it will be divided into six small pockets according to ethnic and confessional and sectarian divides. Because there are Turkmens there, but 60 percent of them are Shia, 40 percent of Turkmens are Sunni, then there are also Kurds, non-Muslims, and Arabs. So if six cantons are to be established there, then do we sow the seeds of the new conflict? Because it will not be a monolith composition... We should not create new problems,"" Yakis said. He said that getting rid of sectarianism in this issues would be best for Turkey. ""If Turkey can secure this and prevent Shia militants from entering the center of the city, which is inhabited by Sunnis, this would be the best gain for Turkey,"" Yakis said. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi announced the start of a military operation to recapture Mosul from Daesh, outlawed in Russia, with the help of airstrikes by the US-led international coalition. According to local media, about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are taking part in the operation. Turkey has repeatedly said it is willing to take part in the operation, though Iraq has raised objections.",0
9970,"Vera Rubin, 88, Dies Opened Doors in Astronomy, and for Women - The New York Times","Vera Rubin, who transformed modern physics and astronomy with her observations showing that galaxies and stars are immersed in the gravitational grip of vast clouds of dark matter, died on Sunday in Princeton, N. J. She was 88. Her death was announced by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, where she had been a longtime staff astronomer. Dr. Rubin, cheerful and   had a lifelong love of the stars, championed women in science and was blunt about the limits of humankind’s vaunted knowledge of nature. Her work helped usher in a   change in cosmic consciousness, namely the realization that what astronomers always saw and thought was the universe is just the visible tip of a lumbering iceberg of mystery. Scientists now know we are not the center of the universe, nor are we even made of the same stuff as most of creation. Cosmologists have now concluded that there is five or 10 times as much dark matter in the universe as there is ordinary atomic matter  —   the stuff of stars, planets and people. What it is, nobody knows, although theories abound, and attempts to identify it in laboratory and   experiments and in outer space have transfixed modern physics. “We know very little about the universe,” Dr. Rubin said in an interview for “Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos: The Story of the Scientific Quest for the Secret of the Universe. ” “I personally don’t believe it’s uniform and the same everywhere. That’s like saying the earth is flat. ” President Bill Clinton awarded Dr. Rubin the National Medal of Science in 1993, and she was frequently mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize. Sandra Faber, a staff astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that Dr. Rubin, along with Margaret Burbidge, who is retired from the University of California, San Diego, was a “guiding light” for a generation of female astronomers. In a statement written for Scientific American, Dr. Faber wrote, “Rubin’s happy family history raising four children, all of whom eventually earned their own Ph. D.’s, was particularly inspiring to young females. ” She was born Vera Florence Cooper on July 23, 1928, in Philadelphia, the younger daughter of Philip Cooper, an electrical engineer who worked at Bell Telephone, and Rose Cooper, who had also worked at the phone company but had to quit her job because of nepotism rules. The family moved to Washington when Vera was 10. She later said she had become entranced by astronomy from watching the stars wheel past her bedroom window. She was drawn to Vassar College as an undergraduate because Maria Mitchell, the first American to discover a comet, had taught there. In a sign of the challenges to come, her high school science teacher told her that she would be fine in a career as long as she stayed away from science. She graduated in 1948, the sole astronomer in the class. That year, she married Robert Rubin, who was then a graduate student in physical chemistry at Cornell. She had hoped to get a Ph. D. from Princeton, but the astrophysics graduate program did not admit women at the time and declined to send her a course catalog. So instead she went to Cornell to obtain a master’s degree and finished it in 1951. When her husband got a job at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, the family moved to Washington and she enrolled at Georgetown University. She earned her Ph. D. there studying the properties and motions of distant galaxies while raising her children. Robert Rubin died in 2008. A daughter, Judy Young, who was also an astronomer, died in 2014. Dr. Rubin is survived by her sister, Ruth Cooper Burg, a judge in Washington her sons, Allan, David and Karl five grandchildren and a  . Breaking into the field was never easy. One day in 1950 she drove with a   baby through a snowstorm to a meeting in Pennsylvania to deliver a paper with data, which she later decided was questionable, about the rotation of the universe, only to be chastised and humiliated by “senior astronomers,” she said. She fled the city and the issue of cosmology. Another time, she recalled, she was excited to be summoned to a meeting with the eminent astrophysicist George Gamow, only to learn that they would have to talk in the lobby because women were not allowed upstairs in the offices. Dr. Rubin never forgot. “Don’t let anyone keep you down for silly reasons such as who you are,” Rebecca Oppenheimer, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History, recalled being counseled by Dr. Rubin. “And don’t worry about prizes and fame. The real prize is finding something new out there. ” Dr. Rubin joined the Carnegie Institution, in its department of terrestrial magnetism, in 1965, after holding teaching posts at Montgomery College in Maryland and at Georgetown. Yet by Dr. Faber’s account, she still had to battle for access to a   telescope on Palomar Mountain in California jointly owned by Carnegie and Caltech. When she did get there, she found that there was no women’s restroom. As her friend and institute colleague Neta Bahcall later told Discover magazine, Dr. Rubin taped an outline of a woman’s skirt to the image of a man on a restroom door, making it a ladies’ room. By then, averse to controversy and the sharp elbows of “senior astronomers,” Dr. Rubin was looking for a field of research that would keep her out of trouble. “I wanted a problem that nobody would bother me about,” she said later. That was when she stumbled into the most daunting problem in modern astronomy: the discovery that most of the universe is invisible. Teaming up with a young Carnegie colleague, W. Kent Ford Jr. Dr. Rubin set out in the early 1970s to map the distribution of mass in spiral galaxies by measuring how fast they rotated. The faster the stars were going around, the more gravity, and thus mass, must be keeping them in their orbits. They expected to find that most of the mass was where most of the starlight was, at the centers of the galaxies. In that case, stars on the outer fringes of a galaxy should have been moving more slowly than those in the inner regions  —   the way Pluto, on the outskirts of the solar system, takes 248 years to go around the sun, while Mercury speeds around in 88 days. To their shock, however, they found that the stars on the outskirts of galaxies were not slowing down if anything, they were speeding up. By the laws of either Newton or Einstein, it meant that there was extra mass out there where there was relatively little light, mass that was speeding up the stars. “Great astronomers told us it didn’t mean anything,” Dr. Rubin said. Told to look at more galaxies, they did, and the effect persisted. In fact, the idea that there was more to the universe than could be seen had been lurking on the edges of scientific respectability since the 1930s, when the Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky deduced that some invisible “missing mass” was required to supply the gravitational glue that held clusters of galaxies together. Otherwise, with the galaxies moving so fast, a cluster would simply fly apart. “Nobody ever told us all matter radiated” light, Dr. Rubin said. “We just assumed it did. ” Another boost to this idea had come in 1973, when the Princeton theorists Jeremiah Ostriker and James Peebles suggested, based on computer simulations, that spiral galaxies would warp and fall apart  —   because of gravitational forces from stars  —   unless they were embedded in a halo of dark matter, like a hamburger patty surrounded by a bun. Dr. Rubin and Dr. Ford’s work brought these ideas to center stage. “Vera’s work, mostly in the early ’80s, clinched the case for dark matter for most astronomers,” Dr. Ostriker wrote in an email, noting that she had been working with familiar galaxies and the kinds of optical observations that astronomers understood. It helped that at the same time theoretical physics was exploding with new ideas, like supersymmetry and string theory, which implied the existence of new kinds of subatomic particles left over from the Big Bang and floating around the universe (and through our bodies) in clouds. As Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel laureate now at Boston University, once remarked, “We theorists can come up with a lot of garbage to fill the universe. ” It has gotten worse. A wide range of astrophysical and cosmological measurements have subsequently arrived at an intimidating composition of the cosmos: 5 percent atoms, 27 percent dark matter and 68 percent the even more mysterious dark energy that seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe  —   all of which subverts any illusion that astronomers might actually know what is going on. In an interview in 2000 posted on the Natural History Museum website, Dr. Rubin said: “In a spiral galaxy, the ratio of    matter is about a factor of 10. That’s probably a good number for the ratio of our ignorance to knowledge. We’re out of kindergarten, but only in about third grade. ” In three decades of searching, the experimentalists have not found any trace of Dr. Glashow’s garbage, notwithstanding occasional rumors that the dark matter particle, the secret ingredient of the universe, has been spotted in some underground tank or fleeing through the detectors at a place like CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva. If true, the rumors could have sent Dr. Rubin straight to Stockholm to pick up a Nobel Prize. Some theorists have suggested that Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, might have to be modified to explain the dark matter observations. During one of those flurries of excitement, in 2009, Dr. Rubin, who liked to stick to the facts, kept her cool. “I don’t know if we have dark matter or have to nudge Newton’s laws or what,” she said at the time. She added: “I’m sorry I know so little. I’m sorry we all know so little. But that’s kind of the fun, isn’t it?”",0
9971,A Camden Address With a Link to Martin Luther King Jr. - The New York Times,"Jeanette Lilly Hunt was 18 when her    rented a room in his Camden, N. J. home to two students who were studying across the Delaware River at the Crozer Theological Seminary. Mrs. Hunt, who is now 85, said she did not pay much attention to either student until her    Benjamin Hunt, and Ulysses Wiggins, the president of the Camden County branch of the N. A. A. C. P. helped the students file a police complaint. The complaint was against Ernest Nichols, a white tavern owner in Maple Shade, N. J. and said that he had refused to serve the black students and their dates in June 1950, and had threatened them by firing a gun in the air. The complaint was signed by the two students. One of the signatures, in a loopy, slanted cursive, reads “M. L. King Jr. ” M. L. King Jr. who was then 21, listed his address as 753 Walnut Street, Mr. Hunt’s home. The home, which has been empty for decades, is still owned by Mrs. Hunt, who said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was like a member of the family when he lived there from 1949 to 1951. In recent years, Mrs. Hunt has been helping activists who are trying to have the property placed on the National Register of Historic Places. While the house has been designated as a historic site by the City of Camden, the State of New Jersey must review the application before it can move to the federal level. Mrs. Hunt, whose husband, Jesthroe, died in 2005, has been paying between $500 and $1, 000 a year in property taxes to hang on to the dilapidated   home, which she said she has always dreamed would be restored in honor of Dr. King,  who was killed in 1968. Cooper’s Ferry Partnership, a nonprofit that develops properties around the city, added the Walnut Street home to its roster of restoration projects in the fall. Anthony J. Perno III, the chief executive of Cooper’s Ferry, said the organization was forming a committee to raise money to restore the home and was discussing how best to proceed. “The question is, What role could the property play in a larger community discussion?” Mr. Perno said. “It should be more than a museum, but what exactly, we don’t know yet. ”  Clayborne Carson, a professor and the director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University, said Dr. King’s first personal encounter with segregation, in a way that he saw his life endangered, could have occurred during his time in Camden. “Another element of this was that he had a pad,” Dr. Carson said of the Camden home. “A place outside the campus dormitory where if you wanted to take a trip into Philadelphia, you had a place to stay. ” Dr. Carson learned about Dr. King’s connection to the Walnut Street property from Patrick Duff, a New Jersey car salesman and amateur historian. His research caused Dr. Carson to rethink Dr. King’s years at the seminary, the first time he was out of the watchful eye of his father, a traditional Baptist pastor. “King led this life under the protective shadow of his father, but here we see that at Crozer, he probably becomes more aware of the harsher aspects of American racism,” Dr. Carson said. “That incident in Maple Shade, I think, is part of that awakening. You see that Crozer wasn’t this northern oasis protected from the reality of racism. ” Mr. Duff found the complaint in the Stanford archives while researching the episode at the Maple Shade tavern. “On January 15 of 2015  —   I’m not even kidding  —   it was Dr. King’s actual birthday, when I was searching an archive and I came across the actual police complaint,” Mr. Duff said. But the case was dropped when three white witnesses would not testify. Mr. Nichols’s lawyer issued a statement at the time saying that his client did not intend to threaten the students when he fired the gun. The tavern would have been the ideal place for a memorial, Dr. Carson said, but it was demolished in 2011, making the Camden property the next best choice. “Anything that survives from the past that allows us to illuminate some significant aspect of the past is valuable to have,” Dr. Carson said. “To me, not preserving something like this is like going into a museum and burning one of the documents. ” But the process for the Camden house to receive state or federal recognition is slow, and Kate Marcopul, the administrator of the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office, says her agency is still researching whether the home meets the criteria for the state and national registries. Paul Loether, the chief of the National Register of Historic Places for the National Park Service, which operates the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta, says his staff does not judge any property until it has gone through a state review. “Obviously, it seems to be a potential candidate for its association with Dr. King, but it really has to be evaluated according to the guidelines and criteria,” Mr. Loether said. The property’s potential has attracted the attention of State Senator Tom Kean Jr. a Republican, and United States Representatives Donald Norcross, Democrat of New Jersey, and John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. Mr. Lewis marched alongside Dr. King in Washington on Aug. 28, 1963, the day Dr. King gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. Mr. Lewis said Martin Luther King Jr. Day was especially poignant this year because America’s first black president, Barack Obama, will leave office on the same week as the national holiday. “More than any other time in our recent history, there’s so much talk, so much discussion, so much attention to the issue of race,” Mr. Lewis said in an interview. “This is a fitting and appropriate time that we look back and see the distance we’ve come, the progress we’ve made, to recognize some of these pieces of history and save and preserve them for generations yet unborn. ”",0
9972,How Little Sleep Can You Get Away With? - The New York Times,"Editor’s note: We’re resurfacing this 2011 magazine article on the science of sleep for Smarter Living.  We all know that we don’t get enough sleep. But how much sleep do we really need? Until about 15 years ago, one common theory was that if you slept at least four or five hours a night, your cognitive performance remained intact your body simply adapted to less sleep. But that idea was based on studies in which researchers sent sleepy subjects home during the day  —   where they may have sneaked in naps and downed coffee. Enter David Dinges, the head of the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the Hospital at University of Pennsylvania, who has the distinction of depriving more people of sleep than perhaps anyone in the world. In what was the longest   study of its kind, Dinges and his lead author, Hans Van Dongen, assigned dozens of subjects to three different groups for their 2003 study: some slept four hours, others six hours and others, for the lucky control group, eight hours  —   for two weeks in the lab. Every two hours during the day, the researchers tested the subjects’ ability to sustain attention with what’s known as the psychomotor vigilance task, or P. V. T. considered a gold standard of sleepiness measures. During the P. V. T. the men and women sat in front of computer screens for   periods, pressing the space bar as soon as they saw a flash of numbers at random intervals. Even a   response delay suggests a lapse into sleepiness, known as a microsleep. The P. V. T. is tedious but simple if you’ve been sleeping well. It measures the sustained attention that is vital for pilots, truck drivers, astronauts. Attention is also key for focusing during long meetings for reading a paragraph just once, instead of five times for driving a car. It takes the equivalent of only a   lapse for a driver to veer into oncoming traffic. Not surprisingly, those who had eight hours of sleep hardly had any attention lapses and no cognitive declines over the 14 days of the study. What was interesting was that those in the   and   groups had P. V. T. results that declined steadily with almost each passing day. Though the   subjects performed far worse, the   group also consistently fell  . By the sixth day, 25 percent of the   group was falling asleep at the computer. And at the end of the study, they were lapsing fives times as much as they did the first day. The   subjects fared no better  —   steadily declining over the two weeks  —   on a test of working memory in which they had to remember numbers and symbols and substitute one for the other. The same was true for an   task that measures speed and accuracy. All told, by the end of two weeks, the   sleepers were as impaired as those who, in another Dinges study, had been   for 24 hours straight  —   the cognitive equivalent of being legally drunk. So, for most of us, eight hours of sleep is excellent and six hours is no good, but what about if we split the difference? What is the threshold below which cognitive function begins to flag? While Dinges’s study was under way, his colleague Gregory Belenky, then director of the division of neuroscience at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Md. was running a similar study. He purposely restricted his subjects to odd numbers of sleep hours  —   three, five, seven and nine hours  —   so that together the studies would offer a fuller picture of  . Belenky’s   subjects performed much like Dinges’s   ones. But in the   group, their response time on the P. V. T. slowed and continued to do so for three days, before stabilizing at lower levels than when they started. Americans average 6. 9 hours on weeknights, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Which means that, whether we like it or not, we are not thinking as clearly as we could be. Of course our lives are more stimulating than a sleep lab: we have coffee, bright lights, the social buzz of the office, all of which work as “countermeasures” to sleepiness. They can do the job for only so long, however. As Belenky, who now heads up the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University, Spokane, where Van Dongen is also a professor, told me about cognitive deficits: “You don’t see it the first day. But you do in five to seven days. Unless you’re doing work that doesn’t require much thought, you are trading time awake at the expense of performance. ” And it’s not clear that we can rely on weekends to make up for sleep deprivation. Dinges is now running a   sleep restriction and recovery study to see how many nights we need to erase our sleep debt. But past studies suggest that, at least in many cases, one night alone won’t do it. Not every sleeper is the same, of course: Dinges has found that some people who need eight hours will immediately feel the wallop of one   night, while other   sleepers can handle several   nights before their performance deteriorates. (But deteriorate it will.) There is a small portion of the population  —   he estimates it at around 5 percent or even less  —   who, for what researchers think may be genetic reasons, can maintain their performance with five or fewer hours of sleep. (There is also a small percentage who require 9 or 10 hours.) Still, while it’s tempting to believe we can train ourselves to be among the   group  —   we can’t, Dinges says  —   or that we are naturally those   sleepers, consider a key finding from Van Dongen and Dinges’s study: after just a few days, the   and   group reported that, yes, they were slightly sleepy. But they insisted they had adjusted to their new state. Even 14 days into the study, they said sleepiness was not affecting them. In fact, their performance had tanked. In other words, the   among us are lousy judges of our own sleep needs. We are not nearly as sharp as we think we are.",0

9974,Are you taking your iodine?,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 08:04 UTC © periodictable.com Are you taking your iodine? Everyone should be supplementing with iodine but if you live on the west coast of the United States, Canada or Mexico you better be taking your iodine and your children should be taking their iodine because: Thanks to the environmental disaster that was Fukushima and the incredibly long half-life of iodine-129, the Pacific coast may never be the same again. It will take about 16 million years for the contamination from the tremendous nuclear accident to dissipate . While a vast array of radioactive isotopes were released into the environment during the Fukushima meltdown, iodine-129 is a particularly concerning material, due to its incredibly long half-life. This means that basically any food that comes from the North American western coast will likely be contaminated with radiation for innumerable generations to come. Radiation in the oceans will inevitably enter our water supply, and consequently our food supply as well. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), iodine from the ocean enters the air as sea spray or iodine gas. Once in the air, iodine can then combine with water particles and enter surface water and soil once the particles fall to ground. Iodine can remain in the soil for extremely long periods of time, because it can combine with organic material easily. Plants and vegetation that grow in this soil also have the potential to absorb the iodine. Iodine could potentially improve your health People who have low iodine levels are more likely to get thyroid cancer than those who do not. Low iodine levels also cause goiter (an enlarged thyroid) and this increases the chance of developing thyroid cancer. When faced with a radioactive cloud, as is everyone in the northern hemisphere thanks to Fukushima, it is absolutely imperative that we take iodine, whatever iodine you can get your hands on. If the only iodine available is topical iodine that is not suitable for oral use then you should paint your body and your children's bodies with it. Dr. Brownstein writes, ""If there is enough inorganic, non-radioactive iodine in our bodies, the radioactive fallout has nowhere to bind in our bodies. It will pass through us, leaving our bodies unharmed. It is important to ensure that we have adequate iodine levels before this fallout hits."" Dr. Michael B. Schachter says, ""The treatment dose when a person is iodine insufficient is generally between 12.5 mg and 50 mg daily. Preliminary research indicates that if a person is iodine insufficient, it takes about three months to become iodine sufficient while ingesting a dosage of 50 mg of iodine daily and a year to achieve that while ingesting a dosage of 12.5 mg of iodine daily. Women with a history of low iodine levels (hypothyroidism) face a significantly higher risk of developing liver cancer. Researchers led by Manal Hassan of Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas concluded that this finding suggested a clinical association between hypothyroidism and hepatitis C, which is contributing to the country's rising rate of liver cancer. ""At 6 grams daily (which is 6 million micrograms/day or 6,000 milligrams/day!), a much higher dose, iodine has been used to cure syphilis, skin lesions, and chronic lung disease ,"" says Dr. Gabriel Cousens . ""From a larger physiological perspective, it is important to realize that the thyroid is only one gland of many glands and tissues that needs iodine. Other glands/organs/systems with high iodine uptake are the breasts, ovaries, cervix, blood, lymph, bones, gastric mucosal, salivary, adrenal, prostate, colon, thymus, lungs, bladder, kidney, and skin. Iodine is found and used in every hormonal receptor in the body,"" he states. No one recommends that much iodine today but it is good to understand iodine so one is not afraid to take as much as one needs. Iodine prevents cancer especially in the breasts, ovaries and prostate gland. It is also extremely important in the age of antibiotic resistant infections for it kills viruses, bacteria and fungi. Breast tissue contains the body's third highest concentrations of this essential mineral, so shortfalls in iodine needs have a highly negative impact on breast tissue. Iodine shortfalls coupled with bromine and other toxic halogens cause fibrocystic breast disease and breast cancer . It is unbelievable that doctors nor the government recommends enough iodine to protect people from the harm that comes from not taking iodine. Makes me believe that most doctors have no idea how to practice medicine—not real medicine that helps more than it hurts. The iodine in salt is enough only to prevent goiter but nothing else.

9975,Economic Nationalism: Alternative To Globalism,"in: Corporate Takeover , Economy & Business , Globalism Ivory tower economists, corporate business analysts and financial experts routinely trash any discussion that America needs to institute a national economic policy that actually benefits our own country. The mantra of unchallenged doctrine that globalism is the only path for world commerce has been intensively pushed for well over the last half century. How well did the United States fare? An honest evaluation must acknowledge the diminishing middle class has paid the greatest penalty from the corporatist sedition that has destroyed internal independence and productive prosperity. Building viable enterprises that conduct useful economic activities produce needed and desirable goods and services. Good paying jobs grow when the velocity of money flows in the “real” domestic economy. International trade can and is often advantageous if it benefits all parties involved in prosperity from the transactions. However, in the un-free framework for maximizing the corporatism structure of above and beyond any particular country jurisdiction or trade policies, the globalists have set up the exact opposite from the much lauded “Free Trade” conduit. The next argument points out the inconsistency in Economic Nationalism in the Age of Globalism , and asks: “Is economic nationalism a reaction to global integration, which in essence means cooptation and domination of national markets by the strongest multinational corporations of the richest nations? Neoliberal insist on the forces of the free market operating without government interference to protect the national capitalist class and workers. Naturally, neoliberals advocating global integration have come out against the tide of economic nationalism in any form. However, the same advocates of neoliberalism have no problem supporting corporate welfare in their own countries, a system that is a form of economic nationalism. When governments use taxpayer money to bail banks and subsidize corporations that is a form of economic nationalism, just as when they lobby to have products and services of their industries marketed in countries competing with similar products and services.” Note the error in the assumption that multinational corporatists have a beneficial relationship to any country that flies their business flag. In a perverted business culture which is now based upon the ‘ Citizens United ’ court decision that confirms previous precedents that a corporation is a person, the United States has lost the leverage to reverse the international trade practices that has clearly been the vehicle for domestic economic decline. The alternative to the surrender of sovereignty and globalist blackmail can be found in paleo-conservative populism and the economic history that built America in the 19th century. Still relevant and sound as the day it was written, Pat Buchanan on Free Trade , provides the template for a rational and constructive national economic model. “Good for global business” isn’t necessarily good for US Global capitalists have become acolytes of global governance. They wish to see national sovereignty diminished and sanctions abolished. Where yesterday American businesses suffered damage to their good name for selling scrap iron to Japan before Pearl Harbor, today [war materiel is routinely exported] to potentially hostile nations. Once it was true that what was good the Fortune 500 was good for America. That is no longer true, and what is good for America must take precedence. (Source: “A Republic, Not an Empire,” p.349 , Oct 9, 1999) “Economic Nationalism”: trade only when it helps US Rather than making “global free trade” a golden calf which we all bow down to, and worship, all trade deals should be judged by whether: they maintain US sovereignty; they protect vital economic interests; and they ensure a rising standard of living for all our workers. We must stop sacrificing American jobs on the altars of transnational corporations whose sole loyalty is to the bottom line. “America First”: Tariffs; reciprocal trade; anti-dumping America’s workers are being sacrificed to the Global Economy, and our leaders seem deaf to their distress. Impose tariffs on cheap foreign imports Prioritize the American Economy before the Global Economy by withdrawing from international organizations that imperil our financial stability & economic independence Open foreign markets to American products by requiring reciprocal trade policies Protect vital industries by passing tough anti-dumping legislation. A policy of Rational Tariffs Lower Irrational Trade Deficits is a course for a rebirth in economic vigor. Tariffs Can Restore America’s Greatness sounds like the next topic for the Donald Trump campaign to take directly to the people. Economic Nationalism is a bipartisan issue that offers hope and practical employment for the displaced and discouraged. American companies have been punished for decades under the power elite and globalist betrayers. The Wall Street crowd despises the small investor and by inference the average hard working American. The plutocrats have built much of their ill-gotten gain on the outsourcing of an independent domestic economy. Globalism is on the precipice of a world-wide implosion. The danger is not just a planetary economic depression, but an intentional political crisis that will demand even more control and loss of access to meaningful commerce. The cries that international trade will stall to a halt will be used to economically enslave the populist further. Combat this devious strategy to stamp out the diminished vestiges of national ventures with a total rejection of the internationalist “Free Trade” prototype. Demand for real jobs exists now. In order to achieve the opportunity for earning a living with dignity can be accomplished under a transition to economic nationalism. The discontent of the electorate is distinctly observable at the Trump or Sanders rallies. The frustration is real and the outcry is becoming louder. Nevertheless, the road to a solution cannot rely upon a government nanny state mentality. The globalist juggernaut is formidable, as much as it is destructive. In order to implement the conversion into a merchant economy, the bulwark blockage of crony finance and fatal usury need to be broken. The start to this process begins with an awakening that globalism is the foremost enemy to America. The elites and the entire establishment are hell bent on maintaining a corrupt system.

9977,FBI Given Go-Ahead to Begin Review of Latest Batch of Emails in Clinton Case as Political Feuds Roil,"$23 FBI Given Go-Ahead to Begin Review of Latest Batch of Emails in Clinton Case as Political Feuds Roil Posted on Oct 30, 2016 Out of line? FBI Director James Comey restarted the public controversy over Hillary Clinton’s emails and is now under fire from Democrats and other detractors. (FBI) 
Here’s the least surprising news of the day: FBI Director James Comey’s decision to announce his agency’s renewed investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails has sparked a highly politicized battle in various sectors of the U.S. government, with just over a week to go before the Nov. 8 presidential election. 
As of Sunday, the intelligence agency obtained a warrant to begin sifting through some 650,000 emails stored on a computer shared by embattled former Congressman Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to determine whether any of them were sent to or from Clinton’s private server or contained classified material. According to The Wall Street Journal, the FBI, which had first learned of the newly discovered emails in early October, had already been dealing with internal tensions before this latest development occurred: 
The new investigative effort, disclosed by FBI Director James Comey on Friday, shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign. Even as the probe of Mrs. Clinton’s email use wound down in July, internal disagreements within the bureau and the Justice Department surrounding the Clintons’ family philanthropy heated up, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Comey’s move was framed instantly by mainstream outlets as a “bombshell” after the story broke on Friday, and predictably, Clinton’s camp questioned the timing and the hype it caused while calling for more details, and GOP nominee Donald Trump swiftly seized upon it as further evidence of his rival’s corruption. 
On Sunday, outgoing Nevada Sen. Harry Reid echoed a former Bush White House ethics lawyer, Richard W. Painter, who in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday suggested Comey may have violated the Hatch Act and stated that he had filed a formal complaint through government channels: 
The F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. 
Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. 
That is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I spent much of my career working on government and lawyers’ ethics, including as the chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush. I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. 
(For the sake of full disclosure, in this election I have supported Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton for president, in that order.) 
Painter added that considerations of intent are immaterial when it comes to Hatch Act violations; rather, emphasis is on the outcome, on whether it is clear that the official in question could sway the election. 
Sen. Reid had this to say about Comey and the Hatch Act: 
“Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another,” the letter says. “I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act.” 
The act bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections. 
Reid also accused Comey of shielding Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump from scrutiny over his connections to Russia, saying “it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination” between Trump and his advisers and the Russian government. 
Although FBI investigators have eight full days to scrutinize the contents of Weiner and Abedin’s laptop, it is likely to take weeks before they conclude their review.",0

9981,"De Blasio’s $325 Million Ferry Push: Rides to 5 Boroughs, at Subway Price - The New York Times","With New York City’s subway trains jammed to capacity and more people than ever pouring into neighborhoods outside Manhattan, Mayor Bill de Blasio is embarking on an ambitious and expensive plan to create a fleet of   ferryboats that would crisscross the surrounding waterways and connect all five boroughs. At a cost of more than $325 million, Mr. de Blasio’s expansion of ferry service would be one of the biggest bets any city in the world has made on boats as vehicles for mass transit. The mayor predicts that the ferries would carry 4. 5 million passengers a year, about twice as many riders as San Francisco’s ferry system handles. Mr. de Blasio has promised New Yorkers that ferries will start running on three new routes, serving South Brooklyn, and Astoria and the Rockaways in Queens, by the end of June 2017, four months before he would stand for  . Additional routes to the Lower East Side of Manhattan and to Soundview in the Bronx will be added in 2018. “Our aim is to make this thing as big as possible,” said Alicia Glen, the city’s deputy mayor for housing and economic development. “No guts, no glory. ” Simply put, city officials believe that if New York is to continue thriving, it must have a robust transportation network and that ferries can play a critical role, just as they do in many waterfront cities around the globe. “We’re still living with the footprint of an    transit map that didn’t contemplate the kind of job growth we’re seeing along the waterfront,” Ms. Glen said. The administration, she said, is trying to create a transportation network for “the new New York. ” The city has already spent $6 million on four commuter boats in 2016 and could own more than 30 in a few years. Mr. de Blasio also plans to spend at least $85 million to create 13 additional landings for the ferries and a home port for them at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But the mayor has raised the stakes in ways few other places have by pledging that a ferry ride would cost the same as subway fare, $2. 75. That is a departure from San Francisco Sydney, Australia and other cities where extensive   systems have long operated. They tend to charge more to ride ferries than buses or trains, and their ferry fares are based on the length of the trip. The   plan fits with the liberal agenda of Mr. de Blasio, who has championed “transit equity” for all New Yorkers. To fulfill the mayor’s promise, the city will have to contribute a substantial operating subsidy, a commitment that several of his predecessors were unwilling to make. Mr. de Blasio’s former rival for the mayor’s job, Christine C. Quinn, applauded his embrace of ferries as a form of mass transit. “There’s a little bit of a whimsical, historic notion of ferries they seem to be a lot more fun than other modes of transportation,” said Ms. Quinn, the former City Council speaker. “You don’t want ferries to just be the fun, fancy transport of people with money. ” Of course, New York’s waters were once clogged with ferries. In the early 1900s, when there were few bridges and no car tunnels, as many as 147 boats carried people across the Hudson and East Rivers. The only vestige of that era is the Staten Island Ferry, nine hulking boats that make regularly scheduled    crossings of New York Harbor. For routes from Brooklyn and Queens, city officials have largely relied on private companies operating their own ferries to deliver workers to Manhattan every weekday. City officials have been leaning on Hornblower Cruises and Events, the San   company they chose in March to operate the service, to order the boats it will need. Hornblower, which runs cruises to the Statue of Liberty, has settled on a design for   boats and is negotiating with a few boatyards around the country to build 18 of them, at a cost of nearly $4 million each. “One of the challenges is to stand up a new fleet,” said Terry MacRae, Hornblower’s chief executive. “But it’s better than bringing a bunch of widows and orphans together,” he said, alluding to the alternative of rounding up a group of used boats. Cameron Clark, who is overseeing the start of the ferry service for Hornblower, said the   boats were designed by Incat Crowther, an Australian company, to be   and spacious. The first of them are scheduled to be completed early next year, he said. “They will have all the   stuff,” Mr. Clark said, including   and power outlets for laptop computers. Maria   the president of the city’s Economic Development Corporation, said Hornblower was chosen primarily for its experience in starting ferry services around the country, as well as on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. The company, however, has limited experience with helping commuters get to and from work every day, though city officials said that did not weigh heavily against it. The city’s choice of Hornblower stirred some controversy, including warnings from another ferry operator, New York Water Taxi, that it would go out of business after losing its bid for the city’s contract. Billybey Ferry, a part of the New   New York Waterway, has been operating the subsidized East River Ferry service for the city since 2011. That service will be integrated into the citywide system after this year and will be operated by Hornblower at a reduced fare equal to a MetroCard swipe, city officials said. Paul Goodman, the chief executive of Billybey, said his company was “disappointed to lose the bid. ” But, he added, “We’re still big believers in the expansion of ferry service and we hope that it’s a success. ” Mr. de Blasio announced that the home port for the expanded service would be a pier in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But that pier is so dilapidated that it may not be rebuilt before 2018, Ms. Glen said. If the   service starts next summer, as scheduled, the home port is likely to be in New Jersey at first, Ms. Glen said. The city’s ferry system, however, will not serve New Jersey. “Homeporting is a terrific benefit of the system,” Ms. Glen said, adding that it would create jobs in Brooklyn and save on fuel costs. “If that takes another nine months, that’s not the priority. ” Hornblower will need nine boats to cover the three new routes, none of which it has now. Mike Anderson, former chief executive of Washington State Ferries, which runs a large fleet of ferries in the Seattle area, said that to have that many boats built would normally take a few years. But Hornblower hopes to cut that schedule to one year by using three or more shipyards, including two on the Gulf Coast, Mr. Clark said. “That’s a bit of a heavy lift,” said Mr. Anderson, an executive with KPFF Consulting Engineers who consulted with New York City on its plan. “Everything has to go right and they need to get started pretty soon. ” City officials have made provisions for delays in the production of new boats, allowing Hornblower to charter additional boats to get the service started. The city estimates that it will cost about $70 million to have 18 ferries built. Once they are done, the city plans to buy them from Hornblower, which will operate them for six years, with a possibility of renewing the contract for an additional five years. Ms. Glen said the city was employing “good, smart economics” in deciding to own the boats. “If, for some reason, Hornblower doesn’t perform,” she said, the city would either find another operator or run the system itself, as it does for the Staten Island Ferry. And, she added, “even if the service weren’t to be that successful, the city will have hard assets” that it could sell to recoup some of its investment. Before the service begins, Ms.   hopes to find one or more sponsors for it similar to the Citi Bike   program. But, she added, it would be premature to call the ferries Citi Boats.",0
9982,Re: Bundy Brothers & 5 Others Found Not Guilty on ALL CHARGES in Malheur Wildlife Occupation,"Print 
For all the mainstream media driven commenters and constitutionally illiterate people who have been badmouthing the Bundys and their stand at the Oregon Malheur Wildlife Reserve, both Bundy brothers, along with five others, have been found not guilty on all charges. 
The Associated Press reports : 
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - A federal jury has found Ammon Bundy and his six co-defendants not guilty on all charges for taking over a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon earlier this year. 
… 
Led by Bundy, the defendants were part of a group that occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge last winter. They were charged with conspiring to impede Interior Department employees from doing their jobs, through force, threat or intimidation. 
The defendants said they were engaging in a peaceful protest, pressing their case against federal control of Western lands and the imprisonment of two ranchers convicted of setting fires. 
The jury was also deciding whether four of them are guilty of possessing a firearm in a federal facility. Two defendants, Ryan Bundy and Kenneth Medenbach, were charged with theft of government property. 
One juror was dismissed during deliberations and an alternate was brought in. The jury was in its fourth day of deliberations when Judge Anna Brown asked them for a verdict. 
""A very quick verdict almost always means a verdict for the government,"" said Medenbach's attorney, Matthew Schindler. 
""The level of deliberation that's been undertaken in this case means we have jurors who are very interested in applying the burden of proof and making sure a complicated allegation of conspiracy has actually been proved in this case. It's not as simple as showing that people were at the refuge."" 
Marcus Mumford, Ammon Bundy's attorney was taken into custody by US Marshals following his repeated claim that his client was free to go. Several people claimed he was tased , while others alleged he was tackled. 
John Lamb released a video of emotional reaction to the verdict.

9983,BREAKING: Miami Woman BUSTED On Election Fraud — Guess Which Party It Benefited?,"BREAKING: Miami Woman BUSTED On Election Fraud — Guess Which Party It Benefited? By Karen Shiebler   
We have all heard Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump whining about voter fraud. He has been repeating the idea to his followers, encouraging them to go to the polls to watch out for the “rigged” election . 
Naturally, Trump and his minions are warning that the election is being stolen from him. His accusations imply that Democrats are stealing votes from Republicans. 
Election officials in all of the key states, many of whom are Republicans themselves, have assured the candidate that the election is not in fact rigged. 
Now, however, we have some actual proof of voter fraud. 
The Miami Herald reports that a 74 year old Florida woman has been arrested in Miami Dade county, after witnesses noted that she was marking ballots. The woman, Gladys Coego, was a temporary worker hired by the county elections office. She was supposed to be opening ballots that had been mailed in to the office. 
Her job was to simply check for any paper tears. Instead, in violation of the law, she looked for ballots that had not been marked for the mayoral vote. On those ballots, she marked the name of Republican candidate Raquel Regalado. 
At least one coworker saw her marking those ballots before turning them in, and reported her actions to supervisors. 
A supervisor then observed her using a pen that she’d snuck into the office to mark the ballots. Having been caught by the boss, Coego admitted what she had done. No reason was given, and there are no known ties between Coego and the Regalado campaign. 
Ms. Coego turned herself in to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. It is expected that she will be charged with two counts of felony for illegally marking other people’s ballots. 
There are only two counts because only two of the ballots were definitely changed by Ms. Coego. Authorities do think, though, that more ballots were affected, based on what her coworkers observed. 
So why did this older lady run the risk of changing the marks on official ballots? 
Why, because she really wanted the Republican candidate for mayor to win, that’s why. Although she herself is registered without a party affiliation, the votes that she changed were in favor of the Republican Regalado. 
So. It still looks like the Trump campaign is dead wrong when it claims there is “widespread” voter fraud going on. And it looks like they’re wrong about which side is cheating, too. 
I swear. You can’t make this stuff up.

Diabetes Kidney Stones “Similarly, patients with diagnoses of depression, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, tremor, Parkinsonism, arrhythmias, circulatory disturbances (stroke, cardiac infarction, arteriosclerosis), hypertension, migraine, cluster headache, cramps, neuro-vegetative disorders, abdominal pain, osteoporosis, asthma, stress dependent disorders, tinnitus, ataxia, confusion, preeclampsia, weakness, might also be consequences of the magnesium deficiency syndrome.” – Journal of the American College of Nutrition Amazingly, the article referenced above even mentions neuro-vegetative disorders as a possible result of magnesium deficiency. This would include comas. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences can immediately lead to complete depletion of magnesium stores; could this be a contributing factor to why we see comas after traumatic accidents/injuries? As I mentioned above, magnesium is an electrolyte responsible for brain signals and conductivity. Without magnesium, people in comas may not be able to come to and resume conductivity. Many people with diabetes also fall into diabetic comas. Diabetes is listed as another possible consequence of magnesium deficiency. Could this be a factor in diabetic comas as well? Something to think about and research further! Cravings Do you crave chocolate? Why, when people are stressed out, do they go for chocolate? Chocolate is one of the highest food sources of magnesium. Magnesium is associated with so many disorders that Dr. Carolyn Dean of the Nutritional Magnesium Association has devoted an entire book to discussing how she has treated thousands of patients for a wide array of diseases, with magnesium as the primary component. Her book, The Magnesium Miracle, is a must-read if you have any of the magnesium deficiency symptoms above, or any health problems in general – as there is likely a magnesium component to everything. Check out 50 Studies Suggest That Magnesium Deficiency Is Killing Us . Why Don’t Doctors Find Magnesium Deficiencies In Tests? Unfortunately, conventional medicine has not woken up to the amount of research that has been done on magnesium deficiency. One of the reasons Western Medicine is so off base with magnesium is how they test it: with blood tests. Blood tests do not yield ANY information about magnesium … why? Because the body controls the levels of blood magnesium very tightly. If the magnesium in the blood drops just a little bit, you’re going to have a heart attack. It’s that sample. So to prevent this, the body will rob all of its cells, tissues, and bones of magnesium in order to keep the blood levels constant. If you do a blood test for magnesium, the cells could be completely empty while your blood levels remain constant. What’s worse is that magnesium is not even in your blood. 99% of the magnesium in the body is stored in the cells that get robbed, while a mere 1% of your body’s total magnesium is in the blood. These tests are a complete waste of time, and they’re not educating doctors to this reality. Keep Evolving Your Consciousness Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. “A serum test for magnesium is actually worse than ineffective, because a test result that is within normal limits lends a false sense of security about the status of the mineral in the body. It also explains why doctors don’t recognize magnesium deficiency; they assume serum magnesium levels are an accurate measure of all the magnesium in the body.” – Dr. Carolyn Dean, The Magnesium Miracle. Why Are We So Deficient? Here’s the short(ish) version: Number one , we’re being poisoned by our food. Number two , we’re increasingly stressed out. We’re running our engines on high to keep up with life and it’s draining us. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences lead to depletion of magnesium stores. Number three , we’re eating more sugar than ever. For every molecule of sugar we consume, our bodies use 54 molecules of magnesium to process it. Fourth , low levels in the soil and modern farming techniques deplete stores of magnesium. And lastly, magnesium is depleted by many pharmaceutical drugs and estrogen compounds such as oral contraceptives, antibiotics, cortisone, prednisone, and blood pressure medications (“Drug-induced nutrient depletion handbook,” Pelton, 2001). Diuretics in coffee and tea (caffeine) also raise excretion levels. Oh and by the way – flouride competes for absorption with magnesium! Nowadays, nearly everyone is magnesium deficient – no test needed. Refined/processed foods are stripped of their mineral, vitamin, and fiber content. These are anti-nutrient foods because they actually steal magnesium in order to be metabolized. When consumed, they demand that we supplement with magnesium or we are destined to break down eventually due to severe deficiency. Like I said, sugar is the worst offender. Every single molecule of sugar you consume drags over 50 times the amount of magnesium out of your body. Well, what if you eat a healthy diet? Processed products are not the only foods that are devoid of magnesium. In general, magnesium has been depleted from topsoil, diminishing dietary intake across the board while our need for magnesium has increased, due to the high levels of toxic exposure we come across in our daily lives (air, water, plastics, chemicals, the list goes on!). The soil is depleted of magnesium because of the pesticides that are sprayed on all conventionally grown plants and worldwide pollution that affects even the cleanest fields. Pesticides also kill those beneficial bacteria/fungi that are necessary in order for plants to convert soil nutrients into plant nutrients usable by humans. Are You A Cannabis User? Cannabis has so many positive effects in terms of treating diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, and more (read 1 , 2 , 3 and cureyourowncancer.org ). Trust me, I’ll be the first to tell you I’m all for it – it’s a safe and effective herb with countless therapeutic benefits that the government has been hiding for years. The only way they want you using it is if they’ve patented one of its’ chemical compounds and can sell it to you for a profit. However, we should also look at what happens to our body on a cellular level if we use cannabis on a daily basis. Would you take parasite cleansing herbs every day for the rest of your life, or even every few days? Probably not. You’d take them when you’re sick or during a monthly cleanse, or else you’d develop some side effects from overuse. We need to remember that cannabis is a powerful herbal medicine and should be treated in such a way. It turns out that using marijuana tends to deplete the body’s stores of magnesium, with the result that the person feels more on-edge after coming down from the high. Of course, that doesn’t mean that it isn’t safe in moderation. It means that over time, if used consistently without proper balance via magnesium replenishment, it can and will cause magnesium deficiency. The Best Ways To Get Magnesium 
1. Eat magnesium rich foods grown on organic soil. 
2. Take ionic magnesium drops. This is my new favorite method, which I’ve learned from The Magnesium Miracle. 
3. Apply magnesium oil to your skin! This is the second best way to raise your levels. 
4. Soak in epsom salt baths . This will provide not only magnesium, but sulfur for your liver as well.

9985,Getting Away With Terrorism in Oregon,"Email 
The Obama regime’s gingerly kid gloves treatment of white Christian terrorists is a policy that foresaw the acquittal of the Bundy gang. 
The gang was able to conduct an armed occupation of the Oregon Wildlife Refuge in full view of the nation because they won their 2014 armed confrontation with the feds at the Bundy ranch in Nevada. Armed federal marshals retreated from the battlefield and no one was arrested until this year when Bundy pere, immune in Nevada, made an unwise visit to Portland. 
Charging the terrorists with the narrow and whimpy crime of conspiring to keep refuge workers away from their jobs was difficult to prove because their own boss ordered them to stay away and none tried to go to work. 
A federal government determined to fight terrorism could have escorted employees through the terrorist lines with as much firepower as deemed necessary if that was the crime they intended to prevent. But, as in Nevada, law enforcement did not even order the terrorists to drop their guns (Oregon offers an “open carry” invitation) or threaten them with arrest. 
Instead, Obama’s DOJ policy was to wait them out, perhaps because white lives really matter. That meant the prosecution could not present evidentiary proof of actual weapon threats and intimidation by the terrorists and dictated their weak charge. The armed terrorist at the off refuge roadblock had to charge an entire platoon of law enforcement officers after his vehicle tried to run them down before they shot and killed him. 
The acquittal of the armed occupiers is a consequence of our political culture. As transmitted by the media ( The Oregonian avoided calling it what it was and used neutral labels like “standoff”) that culture has decided that white Christians can’t be terrorists– a designation reserved for blacks and Muslims. So a jury that reflected a statewide and not a Portland constituency evidently kicked out its lone dissenter and then quickly acquitted can be assumed to have acquired this cultural norm. 
And we in Oregon suffer from a frightened governor Brown whose response to the verdict was, “The occupation of the Malheur Reserve did not reflect the Oregon way of respectfully working together to resolve differences” 
Isn’t that special?",0
9986,"""Надеюсь, инициаторы создания памятника Петлюре об этом пожалеют""","3 комментариев 16 поделились Фото: AP 
Напомним, Симон Петлюра с декабря 1918 по апрель 1919 года руководил в Киеве так называемой Директорией, а также был командующим войсками. Петлюру изгнала из города Красная армия, а в 1921 году он бежал за границу. Его правление было отмечено разгулом бандитизма и беззаконием. В 1926 году был убит в Париже Самуилом Шварцбурдом, отомстившим за родственников, погибших во время петлюровского погрома. Шварцбурд был оправдан французским судом присяжных. 
Своим впечатлением от решения украинских властей с Pravda.Ru поделился президент Российского еврейского конгресса Юрий Каннер. 
- Петлюра известен своей жестокостью, он причастен к еврейским погромам, в которых было убито, по разным оценкам, от 50 до 200 тысяч человек. Конечно, это не дело России, но на Украине тоже живут евреи, и им такое едва ли понравится. 
- По сути, Петлюра становится мифическим персонажем. Если посмотреть шире, то вновь созданным государствам это свойственно: они сами формируют свою историю. У нас в России тоже ставят спорные памятники, правда, некоторые из них потом убирают. Но вообще это стало очень популярным на постсоветском пространстве. 
Конечно, это попытка расколоть общество, и кому-то это очень нужно. Если вы спрашиваете у меня, то я вам отвечу: еврейскую общественность особенно волнует это вытаскивание ""старых скелетов"". 
Мой прадед Давид Каннер, который был раввином, убит при погроме в городе Чернобыле. Тогда много людей - мужчин, в основном раввинов, глав общин и городов, погрузил на баржу и утопили в Припяти. Правда, это не были не петлюровцы, это была вообще какая-то другая банда. Но это не меняет ситуации, потому что пройдет какое-то время, и этим бандитам тоже могут поставить памятник. 
- Может быть стоит выступить международным правозащитным организациям со своим мнением? 
- Я думаю, что выразить свое мнение по этому поводу нужно. В Москве 1-2 ноября мы проводим первую международную конференцию по противодействию антисемитизму . У нас будет очень много выступающих. Может быть, кто-то этот вопрос и затронет. К нам на конференцию прибудет президент Всемирного еврейского конгресса господин (Рональд) Лаудер, будет и много других известных людей, экспертов, из почти 20-ти государств, а также израильский министр безопасности. 
Так что это открытие памятника Петлюре может стать одной из тем обсуждения. Хотя в основном мы будем обсуждать российские проблемы, я думаю, найдутся люди, которые поднимут и смежные вопросы. 
Конечно, эта новость нельзя назвать приятной для евреев - выходцев с Украины. Я ведь тоже там родился во времена Советского Союза. Однако я надеюсь, что у инициаторов такого увековечивания памяти Петлюры будет потом время пожалеть о том, что они сейчас делают.

9987,The Rich and Us,"Who's really to blame for the corrupting influence of money in Washington, DC? November 3, 2016 Walter Williams 
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, having a net worth of $81.8 billion, and Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, having a net worth of $70.4 billion, are the nation's two richest men. They are at the top of the Forbes 400 list of America's superrich individuals, people who have net worths of billions of dollars. Many see the rich as a danger. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert wrote, ""It doesn't really matter what ordinary people want. The wealthy call the tune, and the politicians dance."" His colleague Paul Krugman wrote, ""On paper, we're a one-person-one-vote nation; in reality, we're more than a bit of an oligarchy, in which a handful of wealthy people dominate."" It's sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich. For without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention, we might be able to concentrate on what's best for the 99.9 percent of the rest of us. 
Let's look at the power of the rich. With all the money that Gates, Bezos and other superrich people have, what can they force you or me to do? Can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot? Can they force us to pay money into the government-run — and doomed — Obamacare program? Can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity? Can they force us to buy our sugar from a high-cost domestic producer rather than from a low-cost Caribbean producer? The answer to all of these questions is a big fat no. 
You say, ""Williams, I don't understand."" Let me be more explicit. Bill Gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity. He has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot. Unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off, rich people have little power to force us to do anything. A lowly municipal clerk earning $50,000 a year has far more life-and-death power over us. It is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house, ply a trade, open a restaurant and do myriad other activities. It's government people, not rich people, who have the power to coerce us and rip us off. They have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey. This coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption. 
Take just one of thousands of examples. The Fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers, and they co-own the world's largest refining company, American Sugar Refining, which markets its product under the brand names Domino, C&H, Redpath, Tate & Lyle and Florida Crystals. During the 2014 election cycle, Florida Crystals contributed more than $860,000 to candidates and political spending groups. It spent more than $1 million lobbying Congress, the U.S. departments of Agriculture and Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Here's my question to you: Do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution? Nonsense. The Fanjuls and other sugar producers want Congress to use tariffs to keep foreign-produced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge Americans two to three times the world price of sugar. 
So here's the ultimate question: If some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us, who's to blame? I think it's we, the people, who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town — and that's most of them. But that might be deceitful of us, for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others.",0
9988,"Swedish Library Bans Factual Book on Immigration, Says Contents are ’Contrary to Human Rights’ - Breitbart","A library in Sweden’s capital is refusing to stock Kurdish economist Tino Sanandaji’s “sincere and   analysis” of the country’s immigration policy because the book ‘supports racism’. [An examination into the results of mass migration to Sweden over recent decades, ‘Mass Challenge’ was topping Sweden’s book charts within days of its release earlier this month.  Sanandaji’s analysis of the nation’s   importation of people from the third world, the resulting social problems and the effects on Sweden’s economy, is based on facts sourced from Statistics Sweden, the National Crime Prevention Council, the National Board of Health and other mainstream and respected agencies. But local media reports that Swedes who are wanting to borrow a copy of the   book from their local library are running into difficulties, with librarians rejecting Mass Challenge for political reasons. Nina Sundberg at Stockholm’s Ekero library, which is refusing to stock Sanandaji’s new book, argues that libraries should only purchase books which are politically correct. “Library collections should be characterized by diversity and pluralism. The goal is to not buy books that support racism, persecution, gender stereotypes or anything else that’s contrary to human rights” wrote the librarian, explaining the facility’s motivation in rejecting Mass Challenge. Ekero library regular Maria Halkiewicz, who had wanted to borrow the book, condemned the decision. “It’s strikingly obvious that this is censorship” she told Nyheteridag. On Saturday, Malmö University lecturer Martin Kroon noted the apparent absence of Mass Challenge from Sweden’s libraries in an article which asks whether politically motivated ‘censorship’ of certain titles is a problem across the country. Sanandaji has sounded the alarm on the “quite disastrous” effects of mass migration in Sweden for a number of years. Warning that Swedes will become a minority in their own country without a serious cut to the number of migrants it accepts, he said in 2015: “This is an irreversible social experiment that no wealthy state has ever attempted. There are almost no ideas or visions over how this can be solved. “You can’t combine open borders with a welfare state. If you offer generous benefits, and anyone can come and use these benefits, a very large number of people will try to do that. It’s just mathematically impossible for a small country like Sweden to fund that. ”",0
9989,Czech Republic: We’d Rather Risk EU Penalties Than Be Forced to Take Migrants,"The Czech Republic is not prepared to accept any more than the 12 migrants it has already taken under the quota scheme set up by the European Union (EU) even if that means facing sanctions, the nation’s interior minister has said. [“Ongoing security checks show that the country can no longer accept anyone else” said Milan Chovanec, noting that the Czech Republic has so far received 12 of the 1, 600 migrants it has been ordered to take in under the terms of the EU quota deal.  Vetting   refugees is “complicated” the minister explained, adding that migrants “have not even been willing to remain in place [in Greek and Italian camps, while security checks take place”. “We check thoroughly and in detail during the process, which takes between several weeks and more than two months. “But these people [that the Czech Republic have been told to take in as refugees] were not prepared to remain in place while being vetted. Because of that, we haven’t given them security clearance. ” Confirming that the country “has no further plans to adopt more migrants” Mr Chovanec raised the issue of repeated threats from Brussels to punish states which are refusing to go along with the EU’s agenda to push migrants from the third world on unwilling countries. “The Czech Republic does not plan to adopt more migrants” he said, acknowledging that this stance is likely to result in Brussels imposing sanctions against the country, “perhaps in the range of several million Euros”. “It is then up to the government to assess if it’s worth paying the penalty or not. In my opinion  —   yes. You cannot let people here without running all the checks. ” The Czech minister’s position is likely to come as a blow to Brussels, as last week the EU told Hungary and Poland they face legal action if their populist governments continue to resist orders to take in migrants from the third world. Warsaw and Budapest have strongly opposed the scheme, which seeks to move 160, 000 people from Italy and Greece into other EU nations. Fewer than 20, 000 people have been resettled so far even though the programme is due to end in September this year. “If Member States do not increase their relocations soon, the Commission will not hesitate to make use of its powers   …     for those which have not complied,” the bloc’s executive arm said in a statement. Italy, along with Germany, Sweden, Austria, and France have been vocal in demanding the EU cut subsidies to Hungary and Poland for their refusal to welcome migrants. But Reuters reported that, worried about rising Euroskepticism, officials in Brussels are split on whether to open legal proceedings against Hungary and Poland.",0

9991,March Bathroom Madness: Hall of Fame Coach Mike Krzyzewski Says NC HB2 Law ‘Stupid’ - Breitbart,"Legendary Green Bay Packers football coach Vince Lombardi taught his players not only about football but lessons about life. “Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence,” he once instructed his team. [Legendary college basketball coaches Mike Krzyzewski of Duke and Roy Williams of North Carolina teach their players about basketball and offer life lessons too —  like on correct bathroom usage. The two voiced their disdain for the state of North Carolina’s  law that requires people use the bathroom that corresponds to their biological gender in government buildings and   universities.  The law reads, “Public agencies [and local boards of education] shall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be designated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex. ” As a result of the Tar Heel state’s legislation, the NCAA pulled the University of North Carolina as a venue for the popular March Madness tournament for 2017. Coach Williams explained to USA Today his contempt for the law and the state’s unwillingness to repeal it, saying, “I’m very sad, very disappointed about the whole thing, which apparently is something that’s really, really hard to change. ” Coach K preached his words of wisdom on March Bathroom Madness while criticizing his home state and complimenting NCAA replacement venue, Greenville, South Carolina. “They have the right to host it whether our state is smart enough to have it,” he said. “It shouldn’t be a contest of one against another. “It would be nice if our state got as smart and also would host not just basketball tournaments but concerts and other NCAA events. But maybe we’ll get there in the next century, I don’t know. We’ll see. “Look, it’s a stupid thing. That’s my political statement. If I was president or governor I’d get rid of it. And I’d back up my promises. As unusual as that might be. Anyway, I don’t want to get too political. ” South Carolina knows well the ramifications of the NCAA’s political agenda. For fourteen years the home state of Fort Sumpter, where soldiers fired the first shots of the Civil War, were denied hosting the premier NCAA basketball tournament for flying the Confederate flag on the capitol grounds.

9995,"Mike Pompeo, Sharp Critic of Hillary Clinton, Is Trump’s Pick to Lead C.I.A. - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Representative Mike Pompeo was once pointedly asked why his committee’s inquiry into the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, had dragged on longer than the Watergate investigation. He did not flinch. “This is worse, in some ways,” he said, during an appearance on “Meet the Press” in late 2015. A sharp, pugnacious Kansas congressman and former Army tank officer with degrees from West Point and Harvard, Mr. Pompeo was often an unyielding critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  —   accusing her of orchestrating a     of the Benghazi attacks. On Friday,   Donald J. Trump, who defeated Mrs. Clinton after a bitter campaign, selected Mr. Pompeo to run the Central Intelligence Agency. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pompeo would become one of the most overtly partisan figures to take over the C. I. A.  —   a spy agency that, at least publicly, is supposed to operate above politics and avoid a direct role in policy making. At the same time, the C. I. A. has been central to America’s secret wars waged in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, giving the agency a shadow role in the counterterrorism policy of the past two presidents. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Pompeo (pronounced   ) has used his platform to denounce efforts in recent years to rein in some of the most polarizing counterterrorism programs of the  . 11 era. He has advocated a return to the bulk collection of Americans’ domestic calling records  —   which Congress restricted though legislation last year  —   and he has denounced President Obama’s decision in 2009 to close C. I. A.   prisons and also to require government interrogators to strictly adhere to the rules of the Army Field Manual. After a visit to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2013, he told a congressional committee that a hunger strike by detainees was a “political stunt. ” On Friday, some lawmakers  —   even Democrats  —   complimented Mr. Pompeo’s work ethic and grasp of policy details. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Pompeo as “bright and  . ” “While we have had our share of strong differences  —   principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi  —   I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a C. I. A. director,” Mr. Schiff said. It appears that Mr. Pompeo’s role in the Benghazi inquiry was a significant factor in Mr. Trump’s decision to select him to lead the C. I. A. Some members of the  ’s transition team viewed a competing candidate for the position, former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, as “soft” on Benghazi because Mr. Rogers, as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, oversaw a report that they believed was not tough enough on Mrs. Clinton. By contrast, Mr. Pompeo’s relentless questioning of Mrs. Clinton during her October 2015 appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi raised his profile in Republican circles. When the committee concluded its work this year, Mr. Pompeo’s position on Mrs. Clinton’s role was an outlier even from most of his Republican colleagues. The select committee found no new evidence of wrongdoing by the Obama administration or Mrs. Clinton, but Mr. Pompeo and another Republican member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, said they were convinced that there had been a  . When the committee released its findings in June, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Jordan filed a   addendum that said the attacks showed the State Department was “seemingly more concerned with politics and Secretary Clinton’s legacy than with protecting its people in Benghazi. ” The chairman of the select committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, did not put his name on the addendum. After graduating first in his class at West Point, Mr. Pompeo served as an armored Cavalry officer and was deployed in Germany during the final years of the Cold War. After leaving the Army, he attended Harvard Law School and was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He arrived in Congress in 2011, after a sometimes bitter campaign against Raj Goyle, a Democratic state representative. During the campaign, one of Mr. Pompeo’s aides promoted an article on Twitter that referred to Mr. Goyle, an   as a “Turban Topper. ” In an interview Friday, Mr. Goyle said that Mr. Pompeo personally apologized to him for the incident, but that the campaign staff member was never fired. “As we are entering an era where relations with Muslim and minority communities in America are extremely sensitive, his record and his approach should be scrutinized during the confirmation hearing,” Mr. Goyle said. Mr. Pompeo has close ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservatives who are among the most significant activists in financing Republican candidates nationwide. Their company, Koch Industries, and its employees have contributed $357, 000 to Mr. Pompeo since 2009. He has common cause with many senior Republican lawmakers on a range of issues, including a distaste for the agreement the United States and five world powers struck with Iran in 2015 to significantly limit Tehran’s nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. In an   this summer on the Fox News website, Mr. Pompeo wrote that the United States should “walk away from this deal. ” Indeed, some members of the transition team pushed for Mr. Pompeo because they believe that picking an incumbent lawmaker would help foster better relations between Congress and the intelligence agencies. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Friday that Mr. Pompeo “will undoubtedly develop a close working relationship with Congress in his new post. ” But some Senate Democrats indicated that Mr. Pompeo could face a difficult confirmation hearing, citing some of his past comments, particularly his praise for the C. I. A. ’s former detention and interrogation program. That program “was ineffective, it was brutal and it stands in direct violation of American values,” Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in a statement. “We can never return to that dark time. ” Ms. Feinstein, a member of the Intelligence Committee, led an investigation into the C. I. A. ’s program that produced a voluminous report  —   most of which remains classified. In her statement, she said she planned “to speak with Congressman Pompeo about this issue during his confirmation process. ”",0
9996,Pokémon Go Brings Augmented Reality to a Mass Audience - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   There are video games that go viral overnight, causing people to coop themselves up in their homes for days to play. But the opposite has happened with Pokémon Go, a free smartphone game that has soared to the top of the download charts: It has sent people into streets and parks, onto beaches and even out to sea in a kayak in the week since it was released. The game  —   in which players try to capture exotic monsters from Pokémon, the Japanese cartoon franchise  —   uses a combination of ordinary technologies built into smartphones, including location tracking and cameras, to encourage people to visit public landmarks, seeking virtual loot and collectible characters that they try to nab. Boon Sheridan, a resident of Holyoke, Mass. has seen the activity firsthand. His home, a converted   church that once attracted worshipers, had without his knowledge been designated a Pokémon “gym,” a place where players who reach Level 5 in the game must go to train their Pokémon characters. In the last week, as the game became the most downloaded and top grossing app, he has been wondering how to explain to neighbors all the people who congregated on the sidewalk and pulled up at odd hours. “I want to make sure I tell them, ‘Hey, I’m not a drug dealer,’” Mr. Sheridan said. “I know there are people pulling up in front of the house all the time, but trust me I have no say in this. ” On Sunday, San Francisco’s parks and downtown were crawling with Pokémon Go players while in Washington, the White House and the Pentagon have been designated official Pokémon gyms. A bar in Harrisonburg, Va. was offering a 10 percent discount to Pokémon Go players on a specific team, while a tea shop in Japantown in San Francisco offered a “buy one tea, get one free” deal to Pokémon Go players. The number of daily active users on Android devices in the United States alone was closing in on the usage of Twitter, the data analytics firm SimilarWeb estimated. Pokémon Go represents one of those moments when a new technology  —   in this case, augmented reality or A. R. which fuses digital technology with the physical world  —   breaks through from a niche toy for early adopters to something much bigger. The idea behind the technology is to overlay digital imagery on a person’s view of the real world, using a smartphone screen or a headset. In the case of Pokémon Go, players traverse the physical world following a digital map, searching for cartoon creatures that surface at random. People look through their smartphone cameras to find Pokémon. When an animated creature appears, they toss Pokéballs at it until it is subdued. But Pokémon Go’s public nature is also causing unforeseen side effects, attracting crowds that disturb homeowners and creating opportunities for criminals to lure players to remote areas where they can be targeted for theft. In Australia, police have issued tips for how roving Pokémon Go players can safely play the game. Many technology companies thought A. R. might first take off through specialized business applications that, for example, allow architects to visualize finished building projects in situ. Instead, it took a game based on a beloved entertainment franchise from the   in Japan to help the technology go mainstream. Pokémon, a hybrid of the words “pocket” and “monsters,” belongs to the Pokémon Company, which is partly owned by Nintendo, the Japanese game pioneer, which has struggled to adapt to the era of gaming on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. In the cartoon, Pokémon trainers use characters to battle each other for sport. The uptake of Pokémon Go, which is so far available only in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, has been so furious that it sent Nintendo’s market capitalization soaring $9 billion in the last few days. Pokémon Go, though, is actually the work of a   Niantic Inc. which was created inside Google and spun out of the company last year. Niantic’s first game, a   conspiracy thriller called Ingress, was made possible by Google’s digital mapping service. About 15 million users have downloaded Ingress, and there are a little over one million active players a month, said John Hanke, Niantic’s chief executive. Niantic partnered with the Pokémon Company to make Pokémon Go. Mr. Hanke said he didn’t have exact numbers of Pokémon Go players, but that it was safe to say it will be “quite a bit beyond” the number of players Ingress has attracted. Downloads of Pokémon Go have been so frequent that Niantic’s servers had trouble handling the traffic and the company is struggling to add additional capacity. Mr. Hanke said Niantic was delaying the game’s introduction in additional countries for a few days so it could handle the demand. “We expected it to be popular, but we didn’t expect it to be like this,” he said. “We’re just getting our feet underneath us. ” Like the most successful mobile games, while Pokémon Go is free to play, it gives players opportunities to buy virtual items for a few dollars to speed up their progress. The game’s   nature also gives Niantic another intriguing moneymaking possibility, by charging   restaurants, coffee shops and other retail establishments to become sponsored locations where people are motivated to go to pick up virtual loot. Niantic has cut deals like that for Ingress, and Mr. Hanke said the company would announce sponsored locations for Pokémon Go in the future. Nintendo referred questions to a Pokémon Company representative, who declined to comment on Pokémon Go’s popularity. Jan Dawson, a technology analyst at Jackdaw Research, said Pokémon Go’s success was an important moment for augmented reality, mainly because it doesn’t require expensive extra equipment like a headset, which virtual reality games often need. “This clearly demonstrates that A. R. can cross over into the mainstream on the devices people already have in at least some cases,” he said. “But it doesn’t necessarily do anything for the kind of A. R. and V. R. experiences big companies are piling so much money into. ” For players, Pokémon Go has been a health booster and a social cementer. Kay Collins, a    health care worker in San Francisco, played the game for half a day straight on Sunday, including while waiting in line at a tattoo parlor. “My pedometer says I’ve taken way, way more steps throughout the day than I used to before I started playing this game,” she said, adding that it had helped her explore her neighborhood. Brad Ensworth, a San Francisco State University student who played the game over the weekend, said he had never been a fan of augmented reality gaming before Pokémon Go, but was drawn in by the game’s surprisingly social aspect. “You’ll just run into people and spark up conversations immediately,” he said while playing the game in Golden Gate Park. “We met this one guy who drove up from San Jose to collect Pokémon in the park, and he had more knowledge about this game than anyone else we’ve met so far. We called him the Guru. ” Pokémon Go mass gatherings are also on the horizon. Sara Witsch, a theater studies major at San Francisco State University, organized a Facebook group for a “Pokémon Go crawl” that is tentatively scheduled for July 20. As of Monday evening, more than 18, 000 people had indicated they were interested in attending, and more than 3, 700 confirmed that they would be there.",0
9997,The New Shapes of New York - The New York Times,"The soaring spires, the sloping shores, the straitjacket of the street grid  —   many things give form to the great metropolis. The skyline may be our most recognizable feature, despite how unrecognizable it can often be. Its transformation has been nothing less than astonishing over the past decade. Even when it seems as if there were nowhere left to go, the city, with its manifold appetites, could not be contained. Thanks to new concrete technologies, we have witnessed an eruption of very slender, very tall (some might say very crass) buildings. But for every heroic skyscraper, there are more than a few more humble,   ventures  —   a salt shed, a library, a residential hyperbolic paraboloid (see No. 10, above). Today, apart from the Empire State or Chrysler Building, there are few icons of the skyline. The buildings outlined above, however, may someday be worthy of appearing in a Times Square souvenir snow globe. These are the projects that have captured the imagination of more than a dozen shapers and observers of the city consulted by The New York Times for their perspective on the new standouts. You may not recognize these silhouettes, but in time, you will. 1. 432 PARK AVENUE Manhattan, 2016 Rafael Viñoly Architects Though it is the tallest apartment tower in New York City, at 1, 396 feet, the   building was originally laid out with only 125 apartments, ranging in price from $7. 2 million to $88 million. “This building is all about seeing forever. As for its design, it has this pure elegance, something that’s simple and won’t go out of style. It’s the sort of building  —   it’s not popular with everyone, but it represents what the real estate demand was at a moment in time. The demand right now is for high in the sky, for ‘see everywhere.’ Many people don’t like it because they see it as an eyesore, because you can see it from everywhere. On the other hand, that’s what people thought of the Eiffel Tower. ” Elizabeth F. Stribling, Founder, Stribling  Associates real estate brokerage 2. TIMES SQUARE PLAZAS Manhattan,   Snohetta Closing off a section of Broadway in 2009 has been a boon for the area: Travel times improved on Seventh Avenue by 4 percent even as pedestrian counts have grown as high as 480, 000 a day from 320, 000 a decade earlier. “Taking out the five Broadway blocks and pedestrianizing them flew in the face of all the thinking: Traffic would back up to Albany, and so on, which didn’t happen. And it immediately filled with pedestrians. So you can design streets where the space is shared. Times Square’s not exactly my favorite place in the world, but it spawned the city’s plaza program. That is where you can have a real impact on the social capital of a city. If you look at Astor Place, where all sorts of things are going on, creating plazas and widening sidewalks, it’s transformative. There’s so much potential all across the city, and it’s good for the local economies, too. ” David J. Burney, Former commissioner of design and construction Pratt architecture professor 3. THE SPRING STREET SALT SHED Manhattan, 2015 Dattner Architects and WXY Architecture  Urban Design Resembling a    salt crystal, the Spring Street shed houses 5, 000 tons of salt for use during snowstorms. It is part of the city’s Design and Construction Excellence program, which has seeded more than 100 projects since 2005. “The salt shed is a totally unexpected thing for a very municipal, prosaic,   function, like the infrastructure for salting the roads in winter. It is a   thing it draws attention to itself when you’re flying by in a taxicab. It’s got a good location on the West Side, it’s unusual and it makes you wonder, ‘What is that?’ It has a toughness to it architecturally that’s right. It’s interesting to have that level of care and value and investment into something municipal and often overlooked. It’s just salt storage. But why not?” James Corner, Landscape architect and founding partner, Field Operations 4. QUEENS LIBRARY AT HUNTERS POINT Queens, 2017 Steven Holl Architects The branch in Hunters Point follows six new or expanded libraries that have opened in the borough since 2000, part of a plan to create hubs for the diverse, digital needs of a   Queens. “At a moment when most additions to the skyline of New York City seemingly need to scream ‘bigger, better, best,’ there is one that is just quietly and powerfully beautiful. From the vantage point of the East River, the new public library designed by Steven Holl sits squatly amid a backdrop of tall residential towers on the Long Island City waterfront. But its strong geometry  —   a concrete cube with purposefully placed cutouts  —   establishes it as a dominant structure and the organizer of the buildings around it. Through its unusual openings, it expresses the quintessential experience of a library: the mysteries and reveals one encounters when searching the stacks for a book and finding not only it but an unexpected relative. ” Gina Pollara, President, Municipal Art Society 5. 1 WORLD TRADE CENTER Manhattan, 2014 Skidmore, Owings  Merrill Its profile is not the only big thing about 1 World Trade Center. The construction of the 2.    tower also had the largest budget of any modern building: $3. 8 billion. “One World Trade Center has had such an impact. The architecture is really wonderful, and then there’s the symbolism of the rebuilding. Downtown is back, the city is back and the country is back. It’s an icon again, and one that’s visible again, from so many parts of the city. Whenever you see it, it reminds us of our rebirth, and the recovery and revitalization of Lower Manhattan. This building has such a presence, with the plaza and its tapering sides. It has a majesty. It’s big without being massive. ” Bill Rudin, Chief executive, Rudin Management chairman, Association for a Better New York 6. CHELSEA MODERN Manhattan, 2009 Audrey Matlock Architect The rippling facade of the   apartment building is meant to evoke the artistic energy of the neighborhood  —   and helped win design honors from the New York State chapter of the American Institute of Architects. “Because of the rising consciousness of architecture as a cultural artifact, and a goad to sales, the quality of everyday architecture is getting better in New York. In particular, some small midblock apartment buildings that used to just be generic redbrick monstrosities are now getting designed with some character. Chelsea Modern is just a very solid piece of architecture that exceeds the ordinary. It’s an interesting facade that pushes and pulls you. It’s assertive without being aggressive, well controlled and disciplined  —   a standout background building, the kind we should see more of in New York, and are. And I think the parenthesis of this is that   practitioners like Audrey’s firm are finally making it. ” Michael Sorkin, Critic and designer 7. VIA VERDE The Bronx, 2012 Grimshaw, and Dattner Architects Via Verde has been praised for housing New Yorkers across a range of incomes, with 151 rentals available from $730 to $1, 090 a month when it opened in 2012, as well as 71     available for less than $200, 000. “In Europe, there’s a lot of good architects involved in public housing, and there isn’t so much of a disconnect between design and affordable housing that you see in New York and the U. S. Via Verde is a good example of design contributing to making housing more special. Design shouldn’t just be limited to the   brackets. I liked the diversity of housing types here, from the   sections at the neighborhood scale that steps up into this tower. With the facade, there was a lot of research, too, into durability, so you could maybe spend a little more knowing it would last. ” Amale Andraos, Dean, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture   WORKac 8. WYTHE HOTEL Brooklyn, 2012 Morris Adjmi Architects The   hotel has also become a cultural hub. It goes well beyond lobby art to promoting residency programs with new pieces for each room, as well as hosting openings and film screenings. “If you get off the subway at Bedford, it can almost feel like Stockholm or Paris because of the tourists. This hotel is an entry point for a lot of folks, even those coming from Manhattan. Reclaimed wood and exposed bricks may be played out, but the designers got it just right. As far as a beacon, you could do far worse. It’s not fake, either, but an exemplar of adaptive reuse. Most people who are visiting the Wythe, they have no use for an old barrel factory. You’re not displacing people, but you do have this very   waterfront area that is very recognizably Williamsburg. Here they maintained the old brick facade and the beautiful old wood beams, but by and large, the entire building is very new. It’s elevated to a place that doesn’t just feel like Brooklyn pastiche. When you’re working with beautiful, heavy, honest materials, I’d wager to say this building will stand the test of time. ” Kelsey Keith, Editor in chief, Curbed 9. BARCLAYS CENTER Brooklyn, 2012 SHoP Architects The home of the Nets and Islanders was built across the street from Robert Moses’ unrealized Dodgers stadium, though the arena was almost unrealized, too, after years of lawsuits over the use of eminent domain. “Barclays Center has become one of the most important new public spaces and landmarks in the city, part of a larger narrative of the transformation of Downtown Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Cultural District. Despite all the criticism about Atlantic Yards and the history of the development, the Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue crossroads is an important part of the city’s future and growth. Part of that is a network of   public spaces that connect people, transit and multiple uses. ” Justin Garrett Moore, Executive director, Public Design Commission 10. VIA 57 WEST Manhattan, 2016 Bjarke Ingels Group The   building may resemble an   pyramid, but the architects prefer to describe it as a hyperbolic paraboloid. The shape developed from taking a typical apartment block and stretching out the northwestern corner to increase views of the Hudson River. “Many of the new towers currently going up are those pencil shapes. The Bjarke Ingels project on the West Side is especially interesting because it is beginning to show that when there’s collaboration between architects, designers, developers and the city, you can start to do different things. This mashing of the conventional skyscraper and a typical courtyard building generated this rather unique shape that’s standing out in the skyline rather nicely. And it includes affordable units, as well, which is obviously important. The lesson would be to start experimenting on all levels. Our city is so interesting because of the diversity of its people and opinions, and you want to see that reflected in the built environment. ” David van der Leer, Executive director, Van Alen Institute 11. NEW YORK BY GEHRY Manhattan, 2011 Gehry Partners This   luxury tower may be an unusual symbol of Lower Manhattan’s rebirth, but with roughly $200 million in  . 11 bond financing, the   edifice is a reminder of the many ways the area has been reshaped since 2001. “I have no claims for aesthetic competence, but the Gehry building certainly looks nice enough to me as an economist who loves cities. The fact that it’s residential matters a lot. If anything, New York, and particularly downtown New York, has a mismatch between its residential needs and an abundance of commercial space. New York is at its healthiest when it is profoundly mixed use, when it is residential and commercial and recreational all at once. I like the fact that the apartments aren’t just apartments for billionaires. They’re not particularly cheap  —   it’s still New York  —   but it’s rental. They’re midsized, a lot are under 1, 000 square feet. The fact that it has a school on the bottom floors is nice as well. Edward Glaeser, Author of “Triumph of the City” Harvard  economics professor 12. THE NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART Manhattan, 2007 Sanaa Exquisite execution with simple materials is one of the chief attributes of Japanese design, which helps explain how Sanaa turned some offset boxes of aluminum mesh into a beloved museum. And all for a mere $50 million (the new Whitney Museum of American Art cost almost nine times that). “The jagged skyline of the building, surrounded mostly by brownstones and tenements, really creates a stunning contrast that so speaks to what it is. In that neighborhood, I think it creates a real beacon of what’s new. The first band of it does still line up with the building to the north, a totally brilliant way to be a part of that neighborhood and still be totally different. And the storefront is a direct continuation, too. Instead of a gentle weave into the city, it still connects, but in a very different way. It’s very simple and detailed and not at all gaudy. ” David Rockwell, Founder, Rockwell Group",0
9998,"Supreme Court Faces Volatile, Even if Not Blockbuster, Docket - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court, awaiting the outcome of a presidential election that will determine its future, returns to the bench this week to face a volatile docket studded with timely cases on race, religion and immigration. The justices have been shorthanded since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, and say they are determined to avoid deadlocks. That will require resolve and creativity. “This term promises to be the most unpredictable one in many, many years,” said Neal K. Katyal, a former acting United States solicitor general in the Obama administration now with Hogan Lovells. There is no case yet on the docket that rivals the blockbusters of recent terms addressing health care, abortion or   marriage. But such cases are rare, whether there are eight justices or nine. “This term’s cases are not snoozers,” said Elizabeth B. Wydra, the president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal group. “This term features important cases about racial bias in the criminal justice system, voting rights and redistricting, immigration and detention, and accountability for big banks that engaged in racially discriminatory mortgage lending practices. ” There are, moreover, major cases on the horizon, including ones on whether a transgender boy may use the boys’ restroom in a Virginia high school and on whether a Colorado baker may refuse to serve a   couple. “If either of these cases is taken, it will almost immediately become the highest profile case on the court’s docket,” said Steven Shapiro, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. There is also the possibility that a dispute over the outcome of the presidential election could end up at the Supreme Court, as it did in 2000 in Bush v. Gore. “That is the doomsday scenario in some respects of having an   court,” said Carter G. Phillips, a lawyer with Sidley Austin. A deadlocked Supreme Court would leave in place the lower court ruling and oust the justices from their role as the final arbiters of federal law. Race figures in many of the new term’s most important cases, including two to be heard in October, and that seems to be part of a new trend. “The court hasn’t had a lot of cases recently dealing with race in the criminal justice system,” said Jeffrey L. Fisher, a law professor at Stanford. In June, a dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor brought a new perspective to the issue. Citing James Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time” and   Coates’s “Between the World and Me,” she insisted that the brutal history and contemporary reality of racism in the United States must play a role in the court’s analysis. That dissent may prove influential, said Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago. “One item to keep an eye on this term,” he said, “is the extent to which the Black Lives Matters movement makes its presence felt on the court’s docket. ” On Wednesday, the court will hear arguments in Buck v. Davis, No.  . It arose from an extraordinary assertion by an expert witness in the death penalty trial of Duane Buck, who was convicted of the 1995 murders of a former girlfriend and one of her friends while her young children watched. The expert, presented by the defense, said that black men are more likely to present a risk of future danger. The justices will decide whether Mr. Buck, who is black, may challenge his death sentence based on the ineffectiveness of the trial lawyer who presented that testimony. “The Buck case raises questions that could not be more relevant to ongoing conversations sparked by police shootings about implicit bias and stereotyping of   men as violent and dangerous,” Ms. Wydra said. “The Roberts court, and particularly the chief justice himself, has often been reluctant to acknowledge the reality of systemic racism in this country, but the egregious facts of the Buck case make it impossible to avoid. ” On Oct. 11, the court will consider another biased statement, this one ascribed to a juror during deliberations in a sexual assault trial. “I think he did it because he’s Mexican, and Mexican men take whatever they want,” the juror said of the defendant, according to a sworn statement from a second juror. The question in the case,  Peña Rodriguez v. Colorado, No.   is how to balance the interest in keeping jury deliberations secret against the importance of ridding the criminal justice system of racial and ethnic bias. Race also figures in cases on redistricting, fair housing and malicious prosecution. On Thursday, the court agreed to decide another charged case, Lee v. Tam, No.   which asks whether the government may deny federal protection to a trademark said to disparage  . The case will probably effectively decide a separate one concerning the Washington Redskins football team. The court will also decide, in Moore v. Texas, No.   whether Texas may use an idiosyncratic standard in deciding who must be spared execution because of intellectual disability. The state relies in part on what one judge there called the “Lennie standard,” which exempts defendants who resemble Lennie Small, the dim, hulking farmhand in John Steinbeck’s “Of Mice and Men. ” At some point this term, the court will hear a significant religion case, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Pauley, No.  . It poses the question of whether states must provide aid to churches in at least some circumstances even if their state constitution forbids such assistance. The court agreed to hear the case on Jan. 15, about a month before Justice Scalia died. Other cases granted that day were argued and decided by the end of the last term in June. In the ordinary course, the religion case would have been scheduled for argument in the last term or in October, and certainly not later than November. But the case has yet to be scheduled. “The most logical inference,” said Paul D. Clement, a former solicitor general in the Bush administration now with Kirkland  Ellis, “is that this is a case where the court is going to take its time scheduling this in the hopes that they will have nine justices to decide the case in the end because this is a case that could be closely divided. ” The case started when officials in Missouri rejected an application from a Lutheran church for a grant to use recycled tires to resurface a playground. The Missouri Constitution bars spending public money “in aid of any church,” and the State Supreme Court has called for “a very high wall between church and state. ” The church argues that the State Constitution violates equal protection principles and the First Amendment’s guarantee of free exercise of religion. The court has three immigration cases on its docket, involving detentions, deportations and how children born abroad to an American parent may obtain citizenship. The court has already granted a stay in Gloucester County School Board v. G. G. No.   temporarily barring Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy, from using the boys’ bathroom in a Virginia high school. The justices are scheduled to decide whether to hear the case on Oct. 14, and the stay suggests that they may be ready to enter the national debate over transgender rights. Later this term, in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, No.   the justices will decide whether to take up a baker’s contention that he should not be compelled to create a cake for a   wedding. Mr. Clement, at a briefing at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group, said the justices will most likely be cautious in granting contentious cases until they are back at full strength. “The court seems to be reluctant,” he said, “to add cases to their docket that they think in advance may well divide them 4 to 4. ” But the court may feel it has to try to resolve a dispute arising from the presidential election. “Would they take the case?” Mr. Phillips mused at the same briefing, referring to one along the lines of Bush v. Gore. “My guess is they might. Whether they would ultimately decide anything, who knows?”",0
9999,Climate Engineering And Cryosphere Collapse,"geoengineeringwatch.org 
Global climate engineering programs are mathematically the single greatest assault against nature ever launched by the human race. Incredibly, the majority of global populations still remain oblivious to the ongoing blatant climate engineering atrocities occurring overhead day after day. This willful blindness of the masses is largely due to the total betrayal of the truth by the vast majority of the science community and all of mainstream media , both of whom are heavily invested in covering up the crimes of their paymasters. How badly damaged is our once thriving biosphere? We are past the point of no return in regard to the once thriving planet we have known. Below is a quote from a powerful and moving recent article by Dr. Glen Barry which accurately outlines the reality we collectively face. 
Miraculous nature is being murdered. Everywhere we look inequitable over-consumption is devastating the natural ecosystems that sustain a living Earth. Together we yield to ecological truth – personally embracing a global ecology ethic, and demanding others do so as well – or we all needlessly die at each others’ throats as the global ecological system collapses and being ends. 
A primary sign of biosphere collapse is clearly evident by the rapidly imploding cryosphere. Arctic sea ice continues to advance further into record low levels . Though official agencies like NASA will never admit to the ongoing climate engineering crimes, they are beginning to acknowledge that the excessive cloud cover over the Arctic in recent years (solar radiation management) is exacerbating the overall warming , not mitigating it. Other studies also confirm the overall planetary warming is being fueled by ""contrails"" (which are in reality solar radiation management sprayed particulate trails ). The 30 second video below fully illustrates the shocking loss of Arctic sea ice. 
Not only is the Arctic sea ice at a record low level, but now the ice on the opposite end of the Earth, Antarctica, is also rapidly retreating to record low levels as well. This is a fact that the US corporate media is not covering. The 2 minute video below elaborates on the rapidly accelerating loss of Antarctic sea ice. 
Antarctic sea ice extent has been the last vestige of denial for those who still desperately cling to the ""global warming is a hoax"" fossil fuel industry false narrative. To dogmatically cling to this false narrative is also to toe the line for the power structure, big oil, and the climate engineers . The poles are not the only part of the cryosphere that is imploding, the Himalayan glaciers are disappearing at blinding speed. The 8 minute video below is a recent update from the Himalayas. 
Our planet is already free-falling into a runaway warming scenario , global climate engineering is further fueling this scenario. The graph below illustrates the rapid increase of warmer days being recorded on our planet. 
Global climate engineering programs not only worsening the overall warming of the biosphere, but also destroying the ozone layer , derailing the hydrological cycle , and contaminating the entire planet due to the highly toxic heavy metal and chemical fallout . 
Where do we go from here? How can we stand against the power structure that currently controls the fate of the world in which we live? The single greatest leap we could collectively make in the right direction is by fully exposing the climate engineering issue to the masses. If we can expose the geoengineering assault, populations around the globe would unite in a common cause. If we can expose it, we can stop it. Those, that are still clinging to the insanely false ""global warming is a hoax"" narrative, are doing great harm to credibility of the overall anti-geoengineering community, and thus to the cause itself. The planet is accelerating into total meltdown. Climate engineering is making an already horrific anthropogenic warming scenario far worse overall. Those who truly claim to be committed to the fight to stop climate engineering have an obligation to objectively examine frontline facts and film footage . Sadly, even some major ""independent"" news sites are pushing the ""global warming is a hoax"" false narrative . Pushing this patently false narrative is exactly what climate engineering/industrial complex wants, and is extremely harmful to the cause of exposing and halting the ongoing weather warfare assault. Why? If we are to have any chance of stopping the climate engineering insanity, if we are to have any chance of convincing the climate science community to start telling the truth about the climate engineering assault, the anti-climate engineering community must stand on frontline facts and not on ridiculously false ideological dogma. Investigate, and make your voice heard , time is not on our side.

""Sadly, even some major 'independent' news sites are pushing the 'global warming is a hoax' false narrative."" Indeed, shame on Infowars, considering they should know better. But then, so much hyperbolic & elipitical rhetoric is geared to sell to what folks wish to believe, rather than what truthseekers pursue to be savvy and shrewd.",0
10000,Maggie Hassan Unseats Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire Senate Race - The New York Times,"CONCORD, N. H.  —   New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, has unseated Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, in one of the most competitive and closely watched races of this election cycle. The race was called Wednesday afternoon. The race cost about $120 million, an extraordinary sum for such a small state. The main challenge for both was to keep their bases happy while appealing to the state’s large number of independents. This forced both candidates to emphasize bipartisanship and to try to keep politics out of major issues, like the state’s crushing opioid epidemic. Ms. Ayotte, 48, a former prosecutor, has been a rising star in Washington, where she allied herself with conservative causes, like defunding Planned Parenthood and opposing a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee. She sought to present a more moderate face at home. But her delicate dance around Donald J. Trump’s candidacy drew considerable negative attention. After saying she “absolutely” saw him as a role model, she said she would not vote for him. Ms. Hassan, 58, a former State Senate majority leader who helped pass   marriage, allied herself with the Democrats’ biggest stars, including President and Michelle Obama, as they flooded the state for Hillary Clinton. But Ms. Hassan has broken with her party on other occasions, saying, for example, that the federal government needed better screening of Syrian refugees before she would allow them in New Hampshire.",0
10001,She’s the Hollywood Power Behind Those Seeking a Voice - The New York Times,"Lupita Nyong’o calls her “badass. ” Ava DuVernay says, “She’s a big part of my creative process. ” The ballerina Misty Copeland has her to thank, in part, for the ads that made her a household name, not to mention her namesake Barbie doll. And Raoul Peck, the director of the bold documentary “I Am Not Your Negro,” says that he couldn’t have made his film, a current awards season contender, without her. Unknown to those outside Hollywood, the lawyer Nina L. Shaw is a secret weapon, a    power player adept at striking deals that cultivate freedom of voice, especially for black members of the creative class whose mission it is to be artist and  advocate. “When I started making films, she was the first person I called,” said Ms. DuVernay, the director. “Not just for legal advice  —   she’s really a bit of a consigliere in all things. ”   and   enough to navigate the industry, Ms. Shaw is also someone “who really has power behind her punch,” Ms. DuVernay said. Ms. DuVernay made waves by hiring only female directors for her television series, “Queen Sugar. ” Lately, Ms. Shaw, 62, has also been outspoken about the inequities in her own field, giving speeches that pointedly ask artists to demand more diversity among the teams that write their contracts. “You can’t just ask it of the people who hired you, you have to ask it of the people who represent you,” she said. “Why aren’t there more women here? What’s the plan for there to be more women here? I think that’s a fair question. ” Despite strides in broadening onscreen and production roles in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite and other movements, the business side of Hollywood  —   in particular the talent agencies  —   remains “overwhelmingly white and disproportionately male,” according to a study released in February by the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at U. C. L. A. A flip through many of the entertainment industry’s lists of power lawyers yields approximately the same results. Bert Fields, the longtime Hollywood lawyer, applauded an emphasis on diversity in hiring: “Sure as hell, there’s more to be done,” he said. But, he added: “When it comes to selecting who I want to be my lawyer, I want the best lawyer for the price. I don’t want to think about diversity in selecting who’s going to represent me at a trial, or negotiate my contract. ” Ms. Shaw saw an obligation to do things differently. In her over 35 years as an entertainment lawyer, she was often the only woman or person of color in a meeting like many of her contemporaries, she has stories of male colleagues who asked her to fetch coffee or hang coats. Early on, she said, “I actually felt things were going to change. I thought there would be lots of women in law firms and lots of women in agencies. And I’ve come to realize that that’s not the case, and if it’s going to happen, I’m going to have to be a big part of the change. ” Now, as one of the few women of color leading the legal side of show business, Ms. Shaw has become a beacon. A founding partner at the firm Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein  Lezcano  —   where about half the lawyers are women  —   her roster of clients includes Ms. Nyong’o, James Earl Jones, Laurence Fishburne, John Legend and the writer   Coates. Projects with a social justice mission, which don’t necessarily produce as many billable hours, stir her. “I want to have been part of the work in this industry that makes society better,” she said. “I want to have left some kind of legacy here. ” Even through the country’s current political upheaval, she said, representation in entertainment still matters, “because ultimately the audience matters, and the audience is an inclusive, diverse audience. ” Ms. Nyong’o shares that attitude. Suddenly in need of representation after her   debut in “12 Years a Slave,” she met with several lawyers before choosing Ms. Shaw. “Her being   and being at the top of her game and having that cultural perspective on top of the smarts that it takes was very important to me,” Ms. Nyong’o said. With a multicultural upbringing and perspective, she added, “I needed a team that appreciated that  —   did not just see it but deeply understood it. ” Those teams and projects aren’t always an easy sell. At a panel at the Albertine cultural festival this month, Ms. Shaw spoke about the studio and network programs meant to foster diversity in hiring, calling them out for their limitations  —   a taboo subject in Hollywood. The programs, which are expanding, “are heartfelt,” Ms. Shaw said in a separate interview, and worthwhile for grooming young talent. But, she added, they’re “meaningless in the sense of, if you really want to hire people of color, there are a multitude of experienced people of color who you can hire. ” Asked why she had decided to discuss issues that might cost her industry relationships, Ms. Shaw said she was too grown to worry about the repercussions. “You get older, and you just reach a point where you say, ‘I don’t care, I am who I am, what I have is what I have,’” she said, adding: “So many people don’t have control over their destiny in a way that I do, don’t own their own businesses, don’t have their own clients. I owe it to them to speak freely. ” Her steadfastness is practically  . In an interview in her Santa Monica, Calif. office, Ms. Shaw showed off a photo of her   Mary Catlett Hardy and George Evans Hardy, who studied at Oberlin College and became prominent citizens of Charlottesville, Va. where Ms. Shaw visited them often. They were assertive and   she said, and a big influence on her, particularly her   a descendant of slaves. (Ms. Shaw, who has the graciousness of a Southerner and the moxie of a New Yorker, started a scholarship at her undergraduate alma mater, Barnard College, in her  ’s name.) Ms. Shaw’s background also gave her a deep affinity for the arts: A child of Harlem and the Bronx, she grew up going to Broadway shows and spending hours at the Met Museum. It gave her, Ms. DuVernay said, an uncommon appreciation for the artistic side of Hollywood Ms. Shaw is part of a small group of people Ms. DuVernay invites to critique working cuts of her films. Ms. Nyong’o, too, has embraced her in her inner circle  —   last year, Ms. Shaw joined her on a trip across Kenya, visiting Ms. Nyong’o’s ancestral home. Mr. Peck, the director of “I Am Not Your Negro,” based on the writings of James Baldwin, found her to be supportive of even his most   ideas. “Particularly at that level of professionalism and experience,” he said, “people tend to be not reachable or cynical or not listening, because they have seen it all. And that is not Nina. ” It was she who helped secure Samuel L. Jackson as the narrator for his film, although Mr. Jackson has never been her client. (She knew his manager and agent, she said.) Sharp and elegant, Ms. Shaw also has a reputation as a tough negotiator, skilled in getting equitable deals for her female and minority clients, pressing the other side to explain why her clients won’t get fair pay. At the Albertine panel, she quoted Shirley Chisholm: “If they don’t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair. ”",0
10002,Brexit Lost: Scuppered By May and High Court,"Home | World | Brexit Lost: Scuppered By May and High Court Brexit Lost: Scuppered By May and High Court By Mr. Charrington 03/11/2016 11:48:44 
LONDON – England – The High Court decision today to deny the EU Referendum result is a sign that we are not living in a democracy or a sovereign country. 

Today is a very sad day for democracy within the UK, and Theresa May a Remain supporter is instrumental in denying the will of the British people to leave the EU. 
Dithering and Delaying Tactics 
Through numerous delaying tactics , and the installation of key government posts of Remain campaign MPs, the Brexit referendum was thwarted. 
If the government had repealed the 1972 European Communities Act immediately the EU referendum result would be well on the way to materialising. 
The total nonchalance and denial of the EU referendum result is firmly on Theresa May’s head and her appointment of Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer was a further sign that May was not serious about the EU referendum result. 
Injustice 
The High Court ruling today which is intrusive and false, as well as being undemocratic is a further signal that we are currently not living in a sovereign nation and it is totally controlled by Brussels. 
During the EU Referendum, MPs had their say , MPs campaigned, and when it came to vote in the referendum, they voted. Therefore, parliament has already had a say in the EU referendum, and by going to the High Court, these traitors have sought to annul a democratic vote which was held on June 23 2016. 
This ruling is a shameful reminder that Britain has lost all sovereign status to the EU entity, it is a sad day for democracy, for the will of the people and ultimately for the country. 
17.5 Million People Will Vote on Election Day 
In these circumstances, we must as a people show our displeasure at being circumvented by not voting during the next election for any MP or party who is EU centric. 
This is not over.",0
10003,A Tear in the Fabric of America’s Political Theater,"[Graphic: Clinton vs Trump by DonkeyHotey .] Paul Jay interviews Henry A. Giroux Editor's Note The idea here that there politics is theater is not new; however, “political theater” has never taken on the connotations that embrace what this campaign has revealed. It is clear that there has been an agreement about what “story” is being played out, but that has gotten repeatedly derailed by two (now 3) sources of counter-story. One source, as noted in the following interview, are the wikileak materials. Another source has been Trump himself. While he may not understand politics, he is very adept with theater and controlling the media, and he has played them like a piano. Throughout this endless campaign I kept remembering “there is no such thing as bad press.” Trump has certainly proved the truth of that adage repeatedly. The third source is James Comey. His repeated breaching of judicial-political norms will likely reverberate well after November 8th.
Mentioned within this interview is the phenomenon of Americans seeming inability to maintain a long term memory. I believe this is a rich area to examine though this is not the focus of this discussion. Most people in the U.S. seem to live in the cultural equivalent of anteretrograde amnesia and lack the ability to make long term memories that extend beyond themselves. They remember their own histories, but their social memory is constantly being rewritten and little if anything seems to stick. Transcript PAUL JAY, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. Im Paul Jay in Baltimore. Im known for a documentary I made called Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows. It was about professional wrestling and a battle between Bret Hart and Vince McMann and we got a lot of behind the scenes coverage in that and I got to know the wrestling world some. It occurred to me that theres a certain kind of press that covers wrestling much the way a lot of press covers American politics. Now everyone that has any sense about them at all knows that professional wrestling is theater. In fact, the film I made helped kind of make that clear for everyone. But it is theater and everyone acknowledges its theater but there is still some press out there that plays along and covers the wrestling theater as if its real. Well I think much the same thing goes on in American politics. Much of the election campaigns are positioning, rhetoric, language, supposedly support this, oppose that, which is really all part of the theater. But because it does affect the horse race of the outcome of the elections, most of the corporate media covers all of this theater as if its real. Well somethings happening in this election which because of partly the bluster and in some ways weird honesty of Donald Trump, some of that theater is breaking down. The WikiLeaks about Hillary Clinton and behind the scenes machinations of the Clinton campaign, theres been somewhat of a tear in the fabric of this theater. Now joining us to talk about this is Henry Giroux. Henry joins us from Hamilton, Ontario. Hes a professor of scholarship in the public interest at McMaster University and author of his most recent book, America at war with itself. Thanks for joining us Henry. HENRY GIROUX: Its a pleasure to be with you. JAY: So, what do you make of the idea that wrestling and American politics have a lot in common? GIROUX: I think its a fabulous analogy. I think that in many ways what we see happening is the cultural celebrity which has never really been taken too seriously, although it confers a great deal of authority, has all of a sudden outed itself. Its out of the closet. I mean people realize that what were getting is not only an exercise in performance and showmanship but were also getting what I would call, an elimination of the truth. The truth is one of the great causalities of this particular election cycle. Its never been more visible than it is now. In one hand, what you have basically a celebrity who has no trouble lying because he believes that nobody will really take him too seriously because he thinks he really is a celebrity. On the other hand, you have the alternative press, you have the alternative media exposing all the nonsense that of course Hillary Clinton believes in and making it clear that she has no lock on honesty either. It seems to me that as the truth begins to disappear, questions are being raised about what are the conditions that produced this. What are the contradictions at work here? What does it mean for instance when Hillary Clinton says she believes in families and she believes in children and she worked for the Childrens Defense Fund when in actuality as the first lady, she had no trouble calling black youth super predators, she basically supported her husbands welfare program which did horrible things for pro minorities? She supported an educational system in part that had nothing to do with the imagination and real learning. Had everything to do with accountability and standardization. So, it goes on and on. I think that as this fabric gets torn, as the veil gets sort of taken away and as the mystic of theater begins to dissolve, a kind of shocking reality emerges. One steeped in corruption, despair, inequality, poverty, systemic violence, racism, that becomes increasing difficult for the American political, financial, and corporate elite to basically legitimize. JAY: I think the Clinton campaigns particularly interesting. First of all, you have a 74 senator from Vermont. If hed had maybe another month or two, might have actually might have won in terms of especially in his weakness in the south and amongst African Americans. Another month or two and he might have sorted some of that out. Its quite remarkable that someone at least in terms of mainstream media, someone who came from obscurity, I think people that followed progressive politics, he was certainly well known. But for most of the country, they barely knew his name. To go from there to almost winning and theres some suggestion, some of the specific state races he certainly didnt lose fairly. Now you have the majority of the country simply says they dont believe Hillary Clinton is a truth teller. They think shes a liar. They dont trust her. Yet shes the only candidate these elites got. Trump lies exposed. Even the republicans, the fact that the system couldn’t come up with better candidates within the republican party to actually take on someone like Trump that shouldve been an easy duck to shoot of anybody of any caliber. The whole caliber of these political candidates has just banal. GIROUX: I think whats interesting here is that the republican party, they couldnt come up with a decent candidate because they had no sense of the degree to which they had violated any principles that sort of [attaches] them to any notion of civic justice or to the economic issues that have caused enormous anger throughout the country, that they were unwilling to address. I think theres another issue here. I think the issue is something you mentioned earlier about Bernie Sanders, who I find very hopeful, in that people dont realize that language matters and I think what Bernie did, taking off from the Occupied movement which gave us a new language about inequality. Bernie gave us a language for economic and social justice and political justice in a way that we havent heard before because it was endlessly being replayed over and over again. I think that what you have there is you have the power of what I call a reimagination machine that attacks a disimagination machine. He took the disimagination machine which covers everything over in lies and false metaphors and indecent stories and corruption and he exposed them and I think that one of the great beginnings, one of the great movements for any form of insurrection of democracy is to make power visible. I think he did that. I think the black lives matter movement does that. I think theyre all driving liberals absolutely crazy because its becoming increasingly difficult for the liberals to basically defend this thing that they call democracy. Its not a democracy at all. They know it. But they don’t have a language to basically come back at this. I know. I was listening to a radio this morning and I don’t know if you know this but the alt-right, they’re responding to this by intimidating people, by attempting to ruin the lives of now I think its like 500 reporters throughout the United States attacking their families, putting stuff on twitter, putting pictures of their children up in ways that are utterly disgusting and vile. I think you see two moments here. You see a moment of impending fascism which is utterly violent and criminogenic. Then you see another moment which is criminogenic but not as violent. But its grappling at the same time with some way to rescue itself by pointing only to Trump without at the same time pointing to its own liabilities. JAY: I think the sort of mediocrity banality of these candidates, its not just a happen chance, and many of the presidents in the past and I would put both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama – theyre smart guys. I disagree with probably 98 or 99% of their policies and both of them were involved in what I think could be categorized as war crimes, including Bill Clinton and sanctions on Iraq and the drone policy and others and the development of the war on Syria with Obama and such and Libya of course. But that being said, these are smart guys. They speak in full paragraphs. They are articulate. They can crack jokes. Theyre knowledgeable. But it was under their watch that we had a great leap in this transfer of wealth to the top 1 or so percentile. A great leap in the parasitism of capital. Casino capitalism. Massive derivatives and speculative markets and this very parasitical, very degenerate you could say type of capital created this orgy of profits for this top tier at a level theyd never seen before and when you live in the bubble of those massive profits, perhaps they have no idea whats going on amongst the American people. So, all of a sudden they get this shock in the republican party and almost a major shock in the democratic party and I dont know if they really come back from this because I dont know if they can really get out of this bubble disconnect with whats going on in terms of daily life. GIROUX: They meaning the financial elite. Is that what youre saying? JAY: Well the financial and political elites, yea. GIROUX: Exactly. Well I dont want to underestimate the power of the cultural apparatuses that they control to basically normalize what appears to be unimaginable. I mean Im always shocked by that I think the real issue here is that we live in a country in which memory is very short. We live in a culture of the immediate. Im often shocked about what gets forgotten 5 days after the news cycle. So, the real question is, how do you keep the count of memories. These images. How do you keep this language up? This critical language that consistently reminds people of the contradictions and the crimes. The United States is a war culture. I mean there’s no other way to talk about it. Its primarily organized for the production of violence at almost every level. Of course, the punishing state is getting worse and the acceleration of police violence is getting worse. I think as long as the alternative media can focus on and sustain these images and these stories and these counter narratives, I think theyre fine. But its a hard fight because as you well know Paul the mainstream media controls most of the media and so the real question here is how do we take the question of culture and power and education and link it to everyday life in ways that allow it to travel across a variety of public spheres so that these memories and injustice and corruption can be sustained? JAY: Thanks very much for joining us Henry. GIROUX: My pleasure. JAY: And thank you for joining us on the Real News Network.

10004,Rep. Louie Gohmert: State Dept. Budget Cuts May Not Be Enough - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump released his 2018 budget proposal on Thursday revealing that the U. S. Department of State funding could be cut by 31 percent, sparking outrage among mostly Democrats, who say the cuts could put the country at risk. [Wendy Sherman, under secretary of state for political affairs in the Obama administration, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday that Trump’s proposal to cut the State Department’s budget by a third would have “implications” for  fighting terrorism and epidemics like Ebola. ”  But Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) said on Thursday at the Conversations with Conservatives Press Conference on Capitol Hill that, given the agency’s priorities during the Obama administration, the cuts might fall short. Gohmert said the cuts  —   first reported as 28 percent but later clarified by the State Department as totaling 31 percent   —   “might not be enough. ” Gohmert cited the Obama administration’s priority at State of promoting homosexual rights around the world, including encouraging nation states to change their laws regarding homosexuality and   marriage. On Jan. 11, the   rights publication the Washington Blade published a story entitled, “10 ways Obama promoted LGBT rights abroad. ” Those moves by the Obama administration’s State Department included: Mark Toner, acting spokesman at State, clarified on Thursday the proposed percentage of cuts at State. “There’s a little bit of confusion about that, so let me try to clarify it,” Toner said. “The FY 2018 budget requests 25. 6 billion in base funding for the Department of State and USAID, and that’s a 10. 1 billion or 28 percent reduction from the FY 2017 continuing resolution level. ” “So that’s a 28 percent reduction without the overseas contingency operations funding,” Toner said. “So the budget also requests, obviously, 12 billion as overseas contingency operations funding for a total request of 37. 6 billion, which represents an overall reduction of 17. 3 billion. ” “That’s 31 percent from the annualized  —   or from the CR level, which is base and OCO funds,” Toner said. “So just to simplify it, the two variations there  —   the 28 percent is the amount of reduction without OCO, which is the overseas contingency operations funding. ” “The 31 percent number or figure is with that overseas contingency operations funding,” Toner said. The Los Angeles Times suggested in its reporting on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was not concerned with the budget cuts, rather than characterizing his remarks as compatible with President Trump’s assessment that the Department has been overfunded in the past. “But the head of the department, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, seemed unconcerned Thursday,” the Times reported. “The level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking in the past  —   and particularly in this past year  —   is simply not sustainable,” Tillerson said at a brief news conference in Tokyo, the first stop on a     tour of Asia. “Tillerson, for most of his career a top executive at Exxon Mobil, said he expected more aid from other countries would help to cover the shortfall as the U. S. recedes, and he said he was ‘confident’ the State Department would continue to fulfill its mission,” the Times reported. “We are going to be undertaking a very comprehensive examination of how programs are executed, a very comprehensive examination of how we are structured, and I’m confident that with the input of the men and women of the State Department, we are going to construct a way forward that allows us to be much more effective, much more efficient and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars,” Tillerson said. “We understand the challenge,” Tillerson said. “I take the challenge that the president has given us on willingly and with great expectation that with everyone in the State Department’s assistance, we’re going to deliver a much better result for the American people in the future. ”",0
10005,How Bad Is Your Air-Conditioner for the Planet? - The New York Times,"We may be in the clear when it comes to heat domes, but it’s still really hot. More than half of the country has had temperatures in the 90s in the last week, prompting many people to find relief in the cool, crisp breeze of an  . But in the next few years, the way   work could change. Last month, representatives from nearly 200 countries worked on a new environment agreement to regulate the use of HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons. These chemical compounds are responsible for keeping you cool on hot summer days, in   and refrigerators. And even though you might not have heard of them, environmentalists, government officials and scientists say an agreement to limit HFCs represents a significant step in the fight to stave off the worst effects of global warming. That’s because like other greenhouse gases, HFCs contribute to global warming. But mostly, they’re not coming from your   though   poses other environmental problems. So we’re here to answer some questions you might have about HFCs,   and this new treaty. It’s complicated. HFCs represent a small portion of total greenhouse gas emissions, but they trap thousands of times as much heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Good news: If your   is working properly, it won’t release HFCs into the atmosphere. Some HFCs are released during the manufacturing process, if your   or refrigerator has a leak, or when you throw a unit away, possibly causing some molecules to escape, especially if it’s disposed of improperly (Here’s some guidance on proper disposal). The United States has also put regulations in place to phase out the use of HFCs in other areas like aerosols and building foam. Not quite.   presents other problems: As of 2009, nearly 90 percent of American homes have   which account for about 6 percent of all  the country’s residential energy use. All that   releases about 100 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. According to historians and others, the widespread availability of   has allowed for more development in the hotter parts of the country  —   the South and the Southwest  —   where   use is the highest in the country. And once developers could rely on heating and cooling technologies, they often built less   homes, which means that you have to use more   or heating to get to the temperature you want. Representatives from the same countries who negotiated the Paris agreement met in Vienna to discuss a plan for phasing out HFCs. Any deal reached in these talks would be an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) only a few years after scientists published results showing the harm those chemicals were doing to the ozone layer. The United States, which already has some regulations in place to limit HFCs, wants to begin phasing out production and use in 2019 in developed countries, and in 2021 in developing countries, though some developing countries, like India, would prefer a longer    —   beginning in 15 years. These restrictions, they say, would place an unfair economic burden on their citizens, especially as   use is expected to skyrocket there in the next few decades. However, the Environmental Protection Agency said that because another chemical compound, HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) are still commonly used in the developing world, it would be better if they skipped ahead to the more   replacements, rather than setting up a whole economy based on HFCs and then making the switch. HCFCs are not currently widely used in the United States and production and import here were largely halted last year. No, although some experts say that there may be a time in the future when the climate in some places will be so hot that   won’t be able to maintain comfortable temperatures. And several companies are already working on cooling replacements for HFCs. For instance, Honeywell, which makes your dehumidifier but also plane engines, has already invested close to a billion dollars in developing and patenting an HFC substitute, which is already used by some manufacturers. According to Ken Gayer, a vice president at Honeywell, these new molecules, known as HFOs (hydrofluoroolefins) break down in a matter of days, so there’s less time for them to trap heat in the atmosphere. HFOs are as good at cooling your home and are more energy efficient, Mr. Gayer said, but they are more expensive and complicated to produce. Honeywell started working on the HFOs in the 1990s, after scientists knew that HFCs were contributing to global warming, he said, adding that HFCs were always meant to be a transitional chemical, and not meant for   use.",0
10006,Iran Deal Tests Trump’s Independence,"Iran Deal Tests Trump’s Independence November 18, 2016 
An early test of whether President Trump will bow to Israel’s political clout may come over the Iran nuclear agreement which Prime Minister Netanyahu wants killed, as ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar describes.

Among the foreign policy issues on which Donald Trump took a simple anti-Obama, or anti-Clinton, stance during the campaign but about which he had not seemed to have devoted much thought, one of the most prominent and important is the agreement that restricts Iran’s nuclear program, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA. 
When the new president does get a chance to give the subject more attention, he will see that opposition to the agreement is primarily a matter of old political baggage. If he does not want to be burdened with such baggage and desires instead to set his own course, he will build on the agreement rather than succumb to the pressures of those who would like to kill it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations in 2012, drawing his own “red line” on how far he will let Iran go in refining nuclear fuel. 
The baggage has had two parts. One has been the effort by President Obama’s political opposition to deny him any major achievements — applicable to the JCPOA in that it has been one of the President’s most significant foreign policy achievements. Even viewed through a crass partisan political lens, this motivation will get more out of date with each day that goes by after Mr. Obama leaves office. 
The other part has been opposition of the Netanyahu government in Israel, with all the usual implications of how that government’s postures affect U.S. politics and how the Iran issue has thus been treated as if it were an Israel issue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition has been motivated by the objectives of keeping a regional rival to Israel isolated forever, portraying Iran as the root of all problems in the Middle East, distracting attention from problems that involve Israel and its policies, and keeping U.S. diplomacy and cooperative measures in the Middle East confined to Israel or channels approved by Israel. 
This opposition was maintained even though the agreement that has precluded an Iranian nuclear weapon is very much in the interests of Israel’s security, as testified to by the large majority of senior Israeli security officials and former officials who have been free to discuss the topic. 
A Success 
The JCPOA is a success. It has been fully working for well over a year. It has blocked all possible avenues to an Iranian nuclear weapon. Iran has been complying with its extensive obligations under the agreement, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Those opponents who have stretched to accuse Iran of violations have been doing exactly that: stretching. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani celebrates the completion of an interim deal on Iran’s nuclear program on Nov. 24, 2013, by kissing the head of the daughter of an assassinated Iranian nuclear engineer.

Regarding recent accusations regarding Iranian production of heavy water, for example, the agreement does not prohibit Iran from ever exceeding a specified limit of 130 metric tons. Instead, the JCPOA requires Iran to make any excess available for export — which is exactly what Iran has done. 
For the new U.S. administration to withdraw from the JCPOA — either explicitly by declaring so, or through sanctions policies that would violate the agreement — would clearly be a big mistake. To begin with, any such unilateral move by the United States would run up against the fact that this agreement involves not only Iran and the United States but also five other parties, including major Western allies as well as Russia and China. 
The European allies have made quite clear that they are committed to the agreement. U.S. abrogation would not only involve problems with them but also would upset any early efforts by President Trump to develop more cooperative relations with Russia. 
A U.S. withdrawal could lead Iran to react in either of two ways, each of which would be disadvantageous to U.S. interests. If the Iranians judged the U.S. part of the economic and sanctions provisions of the JCPOA to be too large to overlook, they would declare — as they would be entitled to — that the entire agreement was null and void. This would mean Iran would be freed from all the nuclear limitations in the agreement. 
The Iranians could spin as many centrifuges, stockpile as much highly enriched uranium, and build as many plutonium-producing reactors as they want. (And forget the notion of negotiating a “better deal” — that was never a possibility with an agreement that was laboriously negotiated and that was barely politically acceptable in Iran.) 
A Boon for U.S. Rivals 
Alternatively, the Iranians might say that it considered the agreement still to be in force with all the parties other than the United States. This would mean the Europeans getting business deals such as large sales of commercial airliners rather than American companies like Boeing getting the business, and it would mean Russia and China getting both commercial deals and diplomatic influence that the United States would not be getting. This would be a situation that Donald Trump himself said during the campaign was unacceptable.

Withdrawal from the JCPOA would have additional, farther-reaching negative implications for President Trump. It would re-open an old issue that had been resolved through diplomacy, create a new crisis, and consume much high-level time and attention that otherwise could be devoted to countless other foreign policy problems, including ones centered in the Middle East. 
Withdrawal also would weaken the credibility of anything else the new U.S. president wants to do that involves, like the JCPOA, executive action rather than a treaty. Much of what Mr. Trump has talked about regarding trade and other matters falls into this category. 
Not least important, backing away from the JCPOA would kill opportunities to build on the agreement by doing diplomatic business with Iran on many important issues where Iran is unavoidably a major player. An excellent guide to those opportunities is a just-released report titled Maximizing the Opening with Iran: How President Trump Can Secure American Interests in the Middle East , prepared by the National Iranian American Council (NIAC) and signed by 76 national security experts and scholars (including myself). The report states, “If diplomacy could be successful in resolving the most volatile and complex point of tension between the U.S. and Iran – the nuclear dispute – President Trump should also employ diplomacy to peacefully resolve or manage the remaining differences between Washington and Tehran.” 
It’s not just bilateral issues and remaining differences in the U.S.-Iranian relationship that are at stake. It is the ability of the United States to address effectively many other problems important to it. In the words of the NIAC report, “Iran has substantial latent power – population size and potential for wealth generation – and thus it is bound to be a leading power in the greater Middle East. Washington cannot change this. Nor can Washington stabilize the Middle East without Iran’s involvement. Iran will be part of the regional solution – or there won’t be a solution.” 
The report includes many specific recommendations regarding problems ranging from warfare in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan to energy and security in the Persian Gulf. 
The JCPOA is important not just because of the technical details of what goes on inside Iranian nuclear facilities, although the nuclear nonproliferation objectives that the accord has advanced are indeed very important. It is important also as a step away from the self-hamstringing American habit of not fully using available diplomatic tools to pursue U.S. interests, because of a distaste for dealing with regimes we don’t happen to like. Making America great on the world stage requires getting rid of that habit.

10007,"On Deck With China’s Last Junk Builders, Masters of an Ebbing Craft - The New York Times","PEARL RIVER DELTA, China  —   As Wong   stands on the deck of the traditional Chinese wooden junk he is building in Shenwan, a cluster of fish ponds and factories in the Pearl River Delta of southern China, he shouts to be heard over the shriek of metalwork from steel ships that are being worked on nearby. “It’s like a piece of art,” said Mr. Wong, a bronzed    with stony hands and a quick grin, describing what he loves about the   boats with the batwing sails that he so rarely gets to build. A native of the delta region, Mr. Wong in 1982 swam for two hours from nearby Zhuhai, on China’s mainland, to what was then the Portuguese colony of Macau to escape China’s strict Communist government. Once there he set up an early incarnation of Yi Hap Shipyard, a builder of wooden junks, which symbolize the delta and the maritime culture that drove China’s early growth. “Not many people are   wooden junks anymore,” Mr. Wong said. “I wish more people would. ” Within the next few months, the junk, the Dai Cheung Po  —   also known as the Aqua Luna II  —   will unfurl its   sails above its high stern and low bow and join its smaller sister, the Cheung Po Tsai, or the Aqua Luna I, already in Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong, to offer parties and dinners. It is one of a few of these traditional ships with sails being made by one of the last remaining junk builders in China. “The building tradition is more or less moribund,” said Stephen Davies, a former director of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum. Yet the style remains traditional, “insofar as they are still doing what Grandpa did, and before him,” he said. The new junk is made of Southeast Asian ironwood and teak and cost about $1. 3 million to build. It was commissioned by a restaurant group in Hong Kong, which lies about 50 miles east of Shenwan on the edge of the delta where the river’s silty water turns ocean blue. Also in Hong Kong is the Dukling, a classic,   junk that dates from 1955. It sank once and was recently refurbished. Since June, its owners have offered tours of Hong Kong’s waters, reflecting how junks today are used mostly for tourism and private parties. They are three of only a handful of junks that remain in the delta, replaced long ago by stouter wooden fishing vessels without sails, speedboats and huge container ships. The   pirate Cheung Po Tsai, or Cheung Po “the Kid,” who crisscrossed the delta pillaging and later joined the Qing dynasty imperial navy, sailed a ship that looked similar to his namesakes, though its sails may have been a yellow woven bamboo, not red. The red color is largely a flourish, Mr. Davies said. The life of the delta is partly interlaced because of junks, which were once numerous with their fanlike silhouettes, trading down into Southeast Asia and up the coast of China. The junk  —   the word’s origins are murky, with Chinese, Malay and Portuguese cited as influences  —   may have assumed its iconic, curved hull and sails about 1, 000 years ago, during the Song dynasty, though written records are scarce. Captivated by the junk’s beauty, David Yeo, the founder and owner of Aqua Restaurant Group, commissioned a Hong Kong master boat builder, Au Wai, to conceptualize and direct the construction of the Aqua Lunas and to work with Mr. Wong in Shenwan. The first was launched in 2006, and unlike junks of the past, both are   and their sails are decorative. “He has made more commercial junk boats than anyone else in Hong Kong. He is a master of a true art form,” Mr. Yeo said in an email. “An art form that is sadly dying out in Hong Kong today. ” Mr. Au’s life reflects the sweep of delta geography. He is unsure where he was born but knows his father was from Guangdong Province in China, through which the Pearl River runs. Known as Ah Sin  —   the honorific and name translate as Dear Magician, for his talent  —   Mr. Au, 85, grew up poor in Hong Kong. In his boatyard on Hong Kong Island, in the eastern district of Shau Kei Wan, he points to photographs of wooden ships of all kinds that he has built since being apprenticed to an uncle at the age of 13: simple “ ” motorboats and corporate junks that carry some design elements of the traditional junk but without sails. Beyond the wood shavings, the harbor glitters in the sun. Fishing boats draw up outside to deliver their catch to the   Shau Kei Wan wholesale fish market. “I was very naughty as a boy, and no one could control me,” Mr. Au said in Cantonese, the local language. Barely a teenager, he sold fish on the streets. “I did what I wanted. So my family said, ‘You should look for a special skill,’” he said. “An uncle was the owner of a shipyard and also a member of the ship association. ” His son, Au Sai Kit, works with him, but because his son has no children, the family tradition will probably end there. Hardly anyone in Hong Kong is willing to do manual labor, the elder Mr. Au said, so he has to look to places like Shenwan, where he and his son travel regularly to confer with Mr. Wong and his team of workers. Building a luxury junk is a labor of love, Mr. Au said. “We take the wood piece by piece, fit them together in a curve, measure each piece and cut it,” he said. Copper nails are used to hammer the hull together. No other metal or artificial materials are used. It takes about a year to build a traditional junk, Mr. Wong said. Once junks were made from camphor wood and pine from   Fujian Province, said Mr. Davies, the former museum director. “They were simple to build. That was the genius of the hull design,” he said. But they had flaws. “The hull is only joined together by nails, so you can’t have one high sail. You need   rigging,” he said. “They had to keep adding sails to make the junk sail in a straight line. ” The idea of a Chinese junk has been romanticized, Mr. Davies said. “Junks were brutally hard work. The grunt work  —   it took 14 members of crew to work the sails. It was pure sweat,” he said. But Mr. Davies concedes that the traditional Chinese junk remains iconic. “That sweep down to the bow, the fan in profile, with the masts that create this beautiful arc along the top. The fully battened, standing rigging. There is just a beautiful harmony in looking at it,” he said.",0

10009,Is the US Headed Towards War in Syria?,"by Yves Smith 
Yves here. This Real News Network interview with Lawrence Wilkerson , not surprisingly, is pretty sobering. The rush transcript didn’t have apostrophes, so I added them as best I could, but there are sure to be some spots I missed. 
SHARMINI PERIES, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I’m Sharmini Peries coming to you from Baltimore. 
The Obama administration is currently considering a proposal to send more arms to CIA backed anti Assad forces in Syria. According to the Washington Post, Obama has not made a decision yet and could leave it up to whoever wins the election in November. This of course raises questions of what would a President Hillary Clinton or President Donald Trump do in Syria? This has also been the topic at the presidential debates, recently. 
Joining us to discuss the Clinton’s and Trump’s approach as to foreign policy is Larry Wilkerson. Larry is a retired United States army soldier and former Chief of Staff to the United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. He’s also just published an article in National Interest, written together with Gordon Adams about this topic. Larry thank you so much for joining us today. 
LARRY WILKERSON: Thanks for having me Sharmini. 
PERIES: So Larry in your recent piece titled No Hillary Clinton’s Foreign Policy Judgment Isn’t As Good As Everyone Says, you argued that a case for Clinton as a better foreign policy president on the basis on knowledge and experience. Now factoring all of this in, what’s going on in Washington in terms of how they should behave or what foreign policy actions or military actions need to be taking place in Syria. How do you think Hillary Clinton would act? 
WILKERSON: I’m very concerned about it. I can tell you that right up front. Her posture with regard to Syria in general when she was secretary of state and some of the remarks shes made during the campaign, lead me to believe that she’ll be very bellicose with regard to Syria. I hope I’m wrong. I hope a better judgement prevails. But as I said in the National Interest article, I,’m not all that convinced of it. That’s based primarily on her track record with regard to Libya which is now a disaster, and it’s my understanding that she was one of the if not the principle advocates of action in Libya when President Obama somewhat reluctantly decided to do it, following NATO into that country. And she was also an advocate of the war in Iraq and regime change there. So in those two instances, her judgement was flawed, seriously flawed you could argue, and based on her rhetoric with regards towards Syria, I certainly don’t want to see that kind of judgement continued in that regard. 
PERIES: And in the recent debate, she was advocating a no fly zone over Syria. What does that mean and what implications will it have in terms of geopolitical allegiances at this time? 
WILKERSON: We’re not dealing with a Libyan air force or an Iraqi air force or indeed a Syrian air force. What we’re dealing with here is Russian air forces perhaps even as you and I were discussing eventually Chinese air forces, so they’re not there now I don’t think, and the Syrian air forces. So if we go in to establish a no fly zone and were serious about it, the first airplane that penetrates that zone is all important because youve just about got to shoot it down. If it’s a Russian airplane, youre in trouble because youve now performed an act of war against Russia and Syria. What that means, well just have to wait and see but I don’t think itll mean anything good for either side, or ultimately for Syria. 
So we’re talking about if we lay down something like a no fly zone and say this is it as of midnight on such and such a time, no aircraft can fly through here. And suddenly 5 minutes later even, a Russian aircraft flies though, we have two choices. We shoot it down and risk war with Russia and that has all kinds of ramifications that are outside Syria as well as in Syria. Or we back off our claim and look like ineffectual boobs. I don’t think either of those outcomes is conducive to US national security interests so I don’t think we should go there in the first place. 
PERIES: Larry recently I did an interview with former CIA analyst, Ray McGovern and he said that President Putin in Russia, sees the next few months before potential Clinton presidency as a window of opportunity for consolidating Russia’s position in the Ukraine and in Syria. Now many world leaders are predicting that a Clinton, as you have just done, will likely to escalate the situation particularly in Syria that this is an area that President Obama has been restrained with. Do you think that Ray is correct, that Putin consolidating his power and will Hillary Clinton in her assessment, go ahead on with Putin? 
WILKERSON: I’m concerned about it, as I said before because of her previous actions and because of some of the people she has advising her that look a lot like the people who were advising George W. Bush in his first administration from 2001-2005 of which I was a rather intimate member. So I am concerned about it. I hope that once she is in the Oval Office and if she indeed shes elected and she gets all the briefings and is brought up to speed and so forth. And she gets the council of her military leaders, she will be more circumspect and be more rational let us say than she is sometimes compelled to be on the political circuit and on the campaign trail. That’s my hope. But as I said, based on her track record, I have some concern. Perhaps not as much as Ray but I still have some concern. 
PERIES: Now there’s been a number of other defense analyst in recent years who argue that the president has relatively little room to maneuver because the intelligence community, the Defense Department and the State Department are the ones that really policy strategy. To what extent is that correct, science youve been at the center of all of this? 
WILKERSON: Defense Department does have an enormous amount of influence on the national security decision making process. There’s no question about that. As do other nefarious influences like Lockheed-Martin, Halliburton and all the usual suspects weve heard about who influence congressional decision making and ultimately influence where the money goes and so forth. I think probably in this particular instance though with regard to Syria, what I’m hearing is the military and particularly the joint chiefs of staff are reluctant to enter this trade with potential for starting a shooting war with Russia. 
So I hope that what I’m hearing is correct and that they will act as a break on anything precipitant military action that secretary, then President Clinton or President Trump for that matter, would be willing or want to order. 
Let me just say that Trump has been all over the sheet of music if you will on this. But the remarks I have heard that resonate with me are those that would keep us out of these small wars on the periphery of empire if you will. They cost a fortune in blood and treasure and don’t really promise to and rarely do solve anything. They certainly don’t bring peace to instable regions and regions in conflict that Syria is today. They just make things worse. 
PERIES: Then finally Larry, when Hillary Clinton became the Secretary of State and then there was this very public pronouncement of resetting relations with Russia, what went wrong? Why are we where we are now where shes accusing the Russians of hacking into emails and as you know there’s controversy over what she actually said in the debate in terms of the Russian involvement in all of this. Why is she escalating this and what went wrong with resetting the relations with Russia? 
WILKERSON: What went wrong with resetting the relationship was us. The US of A. We have wasted no opportunity to make Mr. Putin more powerful politically in his own country. As soon as he figured out that sticking his fingers in Washingtons eyes was a winning political formula, you could guarantee you were going to get more fingers in our eyes. More so than that, geopolitically and geostrategically, that is to say in the heart of Russia’s near abroad we have been making moves from Ukraine to Georgia. And we have been making moves that anyone including myself, being the ruler of a country first erstwhile great power and seeing it happen would be responding to and responding to with the elements of national power which I have that can compensate for weakness that I have too. 
By that I mean Id be responding with everything from cyber warfare to little green men, to whatever I had that was competent and powerful in my arsenal that I felt like I could win with against the United States and ultimately against NATO. That’s precisely what Putin has been doing. You could almost sit down and map it. Every time we make a mistake they capitalize on that mistake. I don’t just mean mistakes as in execution or mistakes in being in somewhere where we shouldnt be at in a particular time. I mean policy mistakes. The policy mistake most glaringly pushing ourselves into Russia’s near abroad and NATO along with us with ballistic missile defense, with exercises and so forth. 
If I were Putin I wouldve responded the same way. I think that Id have been just as smart as he has and Id capitalize on my streets against weaknesses and I wouldve gained the political capital that hes gained in the course of this time. It’s not all totally our fault but a whole lot of it is. 
PERIES: So if we are collecting our thoughts here, Larry Russian, Chinese now, possibly Iranian collaboration over Syria are serious times. 
WILKERSON: And Russia exercising for the first time since the death of Anwar Sadat with the Egyptians. Russia selling major armaments to the Egyptians for the first time since I think about that same time period. The world is changing. Power is shifting and the United States needs not to be fearful of such changes but it needs to be a lot smarter of how it plays those changes to its own benefits. 
One of the things it needs to be most hard about is fear of deployments of its own military forces to get engaged in things like weve been engaged in for the past 20 years. Things like Afghanistan, things like Iraq, things like Syria and so forth. We really have no capability to influence these conflicts, these basically civil wars and so forth. Trying to do so from the opening as we did in Afghanistan with Mujahideen for example by having the CIA essentially arm everybody that we can find that looks like he might be a freedom fighter, only to discover months or maybe half a year or so later that they’re anything but freedom fighters. 
Indeed, they’re using some of the weapons that we sold them on our troops or on our own formations is just not the answer. It simply doesn’t work clandestinely or openly to the support elements in these conflicts that we know basically don’t have a hares breath chance of winning. The mistake in Syria has been as I said all along. That is our attempt to get rid of Bashar al-Assad. We need to face up to that mistake. We need to be more receptive to his remaining in power and some guys. The best we can probably get at the negotiating table is that maybe hell be gone sometime in the unspecified future. 
But we need to understand that sometimes we have to give a little too, especially if we want to stop the bloodshed in Syria which is reaching proportions where everyone in the world ought to be appalled at. 
PERIES: Alright Larry. I look forward to your report next week as things really escalate and intensify over Syria. Thank you for joining us. 
WILKERSON: Well lets hope that no one else decides to throw in their lot with the forces in Syria. China and Russia are quite enough, thank you very much. 
PERIES: Indeed. I thank you again and thank you for joining us on the Real News Network. 0 0 0 0 0 0",0

THE wisdom and insight that comes with a hangover is to be taught as part of philosophy courses. 
‘Hangoverism’ will be approached as an over-arching discipline, taking in elements from existentialism’s view that life is meaningless, all the way back to Socrates’ allegory of not being able to face leaving a cave and going outside. 
Philosophy professor Nikki Hollis said: “Many students will be able to relate to the teachings of Jeffrey Barnard and his theory that reality is just a construct that needs ignoring on a Saturday morning. 
“Now leave me the fuck alone. I went mental on Chardonnay last night. My head feels like it’s in a tumble dryer.” 
Meanwhile, academic journals have begun printing hangoverism essays, including The Morality of Bacon Sandwiches and Vomiting and Nothingness .

10011,MSNBC’s Scarborough Zings: The Media Is ‘Aggressively Taken Sides and They’ve Admitted’ to it!,"Newsbusters October 27, 2016 
On Wednesday’s Morning Joe , co-host Joe Scarborough once again was forced to actually tell the truth about the liberal bias in media coverage throughout this entire election. 
Scarborough, a former Florida Republican congressman, began the discussion stating that: 
“[A]s a Republican there’s a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned. The media has taken sides. They’ve aggressively taken sides and they’ve admitted that we’re aggressively taking sides and I think you get some Republicans that see that every four years. It’s so funny. They do that every four years. Every four years it’s like the end of the world if a Republican gets elected president because they’re all racist. It’s the boy that cried wolf.” 
In a sense, what was articulated is that the mass media’s historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one, their usual partisan attacks against Trump’s controversial personality are not as effective. Also, Scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals. 
Furthermore, in conversation with frequent panelist Mike Barnicle, Scarborough added: “Also, it’s such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what it’s about, Mike Barnicle said all along that it’s about Hillary Clinton. People say ‘I’m going to vote for Hillary Clinton as a protest against…’ and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go ‘eh…maybe not.’” 
In a way, they were all trying to explain how Trump is still almost tied to Clinton in a number of battleground state polls, despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage. Later on in response to co-host Willie Geist’s remarks about the race being almost over, Scarborough proved his earlier point about the media’s disconnect: 
“I got to say, Willie. Everybody that is saying it’s over and you’re a fool if you’re suggesting that the American people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in August, September, October, November, December, January, February that there was no way in a million years that Donald Trump would ever win the Republican nomination. Stating it just as emphatically as they’re stating now that we need to avert our eyes, this race is over. “

Even before the winds and rain toppled nearly everything standing, cholera was already here. It came down from the mountains, washing into the lives of the thousands who once lived above the river. Now the only sign of life is in a makeshift clinic dealing with hundreds of suspected cholera cases, a small concrete building where just a few nurses contend with the swarms of patients arriving every hour. There is only one public official left. The mayor was struck by cholera and left on foot to seek treatment hours away. One deputy died of the disease last week. Another fled, like so many others, to escape the ruin visited on the town of Rendel by Hurricane Matthew and its aftermath. “Ninety percent of our village is gone,” said Eric Valcourt, a priest in the Roman Catholic parish that runs the clinic and a school that now serves as a shelter for those too sick or poor to leave. “Many left by foot to escape the disease and devastation. The rest died from cholera or the hurricane. ” A week has passed since the hurricane tore through this remote stretch of Haiti’s southern peninsula, leaving an apocalyptic landscape of treeless countryside, disarticulated homes and a land robbed of its natural riches. But for many, the torment has only started. Cholera, the disease at the heart of Haiti’s last disaster, is being spread again by this one. About 10, 000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been sickened since cholera first appeared in late 2010. Scientists say it was brought to Haiti by United Nations peacekeepers stationed at a base that leaked waste into a river. After years of deflecting blame, the United Nations this summer acknowledged “its own involvement” in the suffering Haiti has experienced from the disease. Now, cholera is stalking the areas gutted by the hurricane, a long peninsula of coastal towns and mountain villages where clean water was already hard to find, long before the storm. Here in the remote town of Rendel, a grueling   trek to the nearest paved road, the disease has spread to every crevice of this valley and the hills above. “We are all at risk,” said the last official in Rendel, Pierre Cenel, the magistrate. A father raced down the hill to the clinic with his young daughter draped over his back, clutching her legs, his face fixed in fear. “She must have cholera,” the magistrate said. “He is running to save her life. ” Cholera was creeping through the mountains even before the hurricane, claiming the lives of untold numbers as its pushed toward town. First came the sick, who trudged down to Rendel, desperate for medical care. Then, when the floods came, cholera was carried down by the water itself, which swept up fecal matter dumped on the hillsides, contaminating the river and other drinking supplies. Inexperience did the rest. Water unboiled or unchlorinated and poor hygiene meant the infections spread rapidly. The town of Rendel and its surroundings, which once sheltered 25, 000 people, are the epicenter of a potential disaster. Thousands have left on foot, forging a   river that bends so often that it requires nine crossings along the way. The things they carry are all they have left: split bags of clothes and small livestock. They carry disease, too, destined for towns connected to the rest of the country by road. One family braced for a river crossing, the youngest daughter in a purple dress with a pink sweater, clutching a live chicken in her arms. “I don’t know what we will do, but we can’t live here,” said her father, Donald Augustin, 37, balancing a black suitcase on top of his head. “The people are dying of cholera. ” Those who remain bear witness to the slow release of misery. Heroic nurses care for patients splayed on the floor like rag dolls, some resting atop the improvised stretchers they arrived on. Patients vomit and defecate on the floor or into small yellow buckets, too sick to leave their stifling confines. The waste is emptied into an hole on the hill just behind the clinic, awaiting the next rainfall to overflow once again. The smell of bile and excrement stings the nostrils. Patients come and go to escape the stench and the oppressive heat, while relatives risk disease to tend to their loved ones. Many refuse to come to the clinic at all, fearful of being blamed for the outbreak. Sick people midway through their recoveries are shown the door to make way for new patients. A single lantern is the only light for the nurses to work by during grueling   shifts. A lowing child is rocked on her mother’s lap as an IV drip pumps fluids into her tiny arm. A young husband feeds his pregnant wife hot porridge, blowing over each spoonful as patients writhe beside and beneath them. A father kisses the ear of his    son to soften the taste of saline solution. “I spent the night here with her but the bed is too small for both of us so I slept outside and checked on her every hour,” said Jean Romit Cadet, 22, the young husband, handing the spoon to his wife and urging her to eat. “If I get sick, I get sick. I’m responsible for her. ” One morning this week, a rush of patients poured into the clinic, some carried on stretchers. A nurse tried to register each patient but lost track in the chaos, unable to take down everyone’s details. A young girl entered the clinic and told the head nurse she was suffering from diarrhea. “For how many days?” the nurse asked. “Three,” the girl replied. “Why are you only coming now?” the nurse demanded. “We need to hook you up to an IV. ” The girl refused. “I’m not vomiting,” she yelled over her shoulder as she left the clinic. The nurse turned to the crowd in the entrance of the clinic, a porch robbed of its roof by the storm. In its place hung a sagging blue tarp. “This is the problem,” she told the crowd of patients, parents holding sick children and others laid out on the floor, their eyes lolling back into their heads. “She doesn’t want to use the IV because she isn’t vomiting. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have cholera. ” Another nurse approached and whispered that they were running out of needles for the IVs, which dangled like translucent vines from the rafters of the clinic. The nurse disappeared into a back room. A patient seated on a bench near the entrance erupted from his seat and vomited over the edge of the porch, onto ground where people walk to and from the back of the building. A mother and father tried to   their    son rehydration salts, sending the boy into fits. The child tried to bite the hand of an aide holding his arms. A nurse approached and asked the family if they had symptoms. The mother, Osila Cominan, said it was her third day with diarrhea, but quickly added that she was not vomiting and did not need treatment. “You should be on an IV, too,” the nurse said, before rushing to another patient vomiting on the floor. In the town, citizens had set up a roadside cleaning station, a simple affair with a tank of chlorinated water that was sprayed onto the shoes and hands of those fleeing. With all the departures, the fear of carrying cholera to bigger cities was a real one. The town itself was hollowed out. Those still here stood on what remained of front porches, mired in a state of shock, hoping the people would return. The stasis was interrupted every so often by another patient heading to the clinic, staggering down the rocky paths or carried aloft by family. A few concrete homes provide the only reminder of the town that was. Lesser houses have been stacked into piles along with the trees and branches scattered by the storm. “When you look around you, it’s like the end of the world,” said Joseph Kenso, 33. “Look around you. The disaster speaks for itself. ” One of the only buildings left is the clinic, a   structure that formerly served as a center for prenatal care. The original cholera care center was destroyed in the hurricane. It had opened only a week before the storm, to treat people streaming in from the outbreak in the mountains above. In the center of town, wearing just one   Mr. Cenel, the magistrate, smiled ruefully at the town’s misfortune and his own, estimating that hundreds have died between the hurricane and the disease. But his math is like that of many: a reflection of the emotional toll, not an exact one. “After a hurricane, if you don’t see someone for a few days, they are usually dead,” he said. Sixty percent of the town has now fled, he said. “No! I disagree,” said a man standing in the magistrate’s front yard. “It’s at least 85 percent of the population gone. ” Another man standing nearby said the people would return once they could rid the area of cholera. He was sure of it. “They might,” said the magistrate, whose mother and father are among those who left. “They might. ” But how do you combat cholera in a place where people get their water from the river or surrounding springs, where disinfectant is a luxury? One woman leaving the clinic with soiled sheets was stopped by a nurse, who asked her to drop them in a pile of clothing to be burned that night. The woman hesitated, throwing her hand over her eyes as she addressed the nurse. “I can’t,” she said. “This is all I have left. ” The toll from cholera is unknowable. Most of the departed never make it to the clinic and get buried without any record. “We don’t know how many have died in the surrounding community,” said another nurse, Marie Marguerite Bernadin, 42. “But we know most of the deaths occur outside of here. ” If the cases are caught early enough, the nurses explained, treatment is as simple as rehydration. “They don’t come on time because for some of them it’s an embarrassment and they tried to hide the sick,” explained Alicia Hyppolite, 32, a nurse in the clinic. “And people don’t listen when you tell them things. ” About an hour and a half north is the village of Delibarain, a hamlet near the mountain river that feeds the springs of Rendel. Before the hurricane, residents and officials said there were several deaths from cholera, or what they believed to be cholera, since there were no labs on hand to confirm the disease. The first ones that residents and local leaders can remember were the members of the Vital family, five of whom died from the disease. The dead were buried in graves without wrapping them in plastic, wearing gloves or taking the precautionary measures applied to   bodies. Soon, even more people were infected. The rainy season spread the disease farther. “They just placed them in the earth,” said Thomas Cyril, 47, who lives in the village and knew the family. Prostrate on the floor were his brother, Faniel Cyril, and his cousin, Alicia Delcy, both of whom were showing symptoms of cholera. Faniel, barely conscious, reached out to grab the hand of Mrs. Delcy from time to time. Frightened of what was happening in their village, the pair had come down the mountain on Sunday to seek treatment. It was bad in Rendel, he granted, but up the mountain it was worse. “Now the people are really dying,” Mr. Cyril said.",0

10015,Old Fuck Of A Neighbour Buys Nuts For Trick Or Treaters,"0 Add Comment 
AN ELDERLY member of a local Waterford community rose bright and early this morning to ensure he was able to bulk purchase nuts ahead of this evening’s trick or treating deluge. 
71-year-old Maurice O’Boyle had been concerned that his local Super Valu may run out of nuts as other people, similarly evil, would seek to buy all the supplies of the non-sweets in a bid to frustrate and annoy young children. 
“That’s what the fuckers get for ringing the doorbell, I love seeing all the hope and joy draining out of their faces, you can’t beat it,” a chirpy O’Boyle explained. 
The pensioner first started the practice of being an old fuck who kids learn to hate as far back as 1985, but is not alone in his desire to ruin the evening for excitable youngsters. 
“In some cases nuts and apples actually outsell sweets and chocolate,” explained local Super Valu manager Dave Tierney, “we tend to up the price of nuts by 400% during this period, but the older and more curmudgeonly the person is, the less they care about how much it costs them to really piss off trick or treaters,” Tierney shared. 
O’Boyle has been placed on a local ‘annoying old fucker’ watchlist by local children, but as records have yet to be digitised and circulated online many children will still call to his door expecting a chomp bar or something, only to be disappointed. 
Gardaí have warned local old fucks not to ask children for a ‘trick’ instead of a treat as this resulted in children stabbing and murdering as many as 40 adults last year.",0

A Martian invasion of Planet Earth was delayed this morning when alien demands to be taken to the leader of the free world were just met with shifty looks and embarrassed silence. 
“It was really weird,” admitted Martian invasion fleet captain Zy-Mon Williams. 
“Normally when we invade a planet, the usual procedure is to park the saucers over the largest and most prosperous-looking nation, beam down, point the blaster at some local and say ‘Take me to your leader’. 
“But this time, for some reason, it’s not working. 
“All the humans we’ve collared so far just seem to look shifty or embarrassed, saying things like ‘my word, is that the time,’ and then run away. 
“Also none of them will look us directly in the eye, they just stare at their feet, whereas normally people always stare at us on account of us being green and stuff.” 
But Williams was optimistic. “Pretty soon we’ll find whoever runs this place,” he declared, “and then Earth is doomed! Bwa ha ha ha ha ha!”

10017,Inside The Mind Of An FBI Informant; Terri Linnell Admits Role As Gov’t Snitch,"Inside The Mind Of An FBI Informant; Terri Linnell Admits Role As Gov’t Snitch by IWB · October 27, 2016 Tweet 
FBI informant Terri “Momma Bear” Linnell tells why she became an informant, and what she told the FBI during the Bundy occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns Oregon earlier this year, in her first-ever interview. The occupation of the refuge ended with the death of rancher Robert “LaVoy” Finicum and the arrests of dozens of other protestors. 
Only much of what she said was a lie and interviewer Bobby Powell, Publisher of The Truth Is Viral news program, knew it. Eye-witness testimony from three separate individuals dispute Linnell’s account of events during the raid of a campground in Maryland during Operation American Spring by more than 40 agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, Maryland State Police, and the Secret Service. 
The witnesses all say Linnell was escorted away from the campground by the Secret Service while her friends and fellow campers were on their knees with automatic assault rifles pointed at their heads for hours. 
There is also evidence to indicate, including a slip of Linnell’s own tongue, that she has been an informant for the FBI, and possibly even a paid agent, since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2010.",0
10018,We Are Aliens Because Our Souls Are Extra-Terrestrial,". We Are Aliens Because Our Souls Are Extra-Terrestrial We are in this physical world, but we are not from this world. It is important to understand that ... http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/we-are-aliens-because-our-souls-are.html We are in this physical world, but we are not from this world. It is important to understand that there is an evolution of Souls going on through the earthly experience, but also a development for every individual Soul. This is how the passage into higher and higher dimensions can be explained in simple terms. There are many immature Souls on planet Earth, and also many misguided Souls. Other Souls do not possess the best intentions, or are simply controlled by beings without a body , whose intentions and evolutionary process are not commendable. Many dope addicts and alcoholics have this unfavorable trait as do many selfish and greedy people.Few humans, because of their inclinations or because of their immaturity allow unknowingly those beings to manipulate them from time to time. The beings I am referring to, are not yet developed as Souls, nor do they possess a Higher Self or higher conscious awareness — only the mortal and limited intellect. This is by no way a reproach towards them, since most Souls are going through a similar process of evolution on Earth, where beings are not born consciously aware, unlike on some other planets. Humans on Earth, because of heredity, do need conscious spiritual work on themselves in order to set themselves free from their genetic compromised DNA (and intelligence), and clear their karma in order to ascend to Higher Dimensions and levels of existence. In other words, perhaps it would help to compare a developing Soul on Earth to that of one of Earth’s children. When the child grows, he develops certain physical attributes, but also awareness, his feelings and understanding, his brain and endocrine system are in formation. Souls undergoes a similar development; they need various experiences to mature, and develop consciousness. The Universe is in perpetual growth — creation never stops. Life comes under various forms, obeys various rules, and there are as many possibilities as universes. Your planet has a heavy history of genetic manipulation and experimentation. Your kind, the pure physical human kind, was developed around a Soul, in order to experience a 3D dimension level of density, so Souls had in effect to descend down the octave of creation in order to experience duality. This occurred because of the Atlantean Fall of your civilization: The Anunnaki, Mankind's Enslavement and the Afterlife Deception However, many of you have previously lived in much higher densities, but because of the fall, you had to learn to adapt to this 3D dimensional density, which was never meant to be your natural home. Other Souls have also volunteered to experience life in lower densities, or were sent here from higher densities in order to further their understanding of your world or of their own world or simply in order to help our Prime Creator on your world. These beings come from a higher plane of existence, which is their natural habitat. None of you, who are reading these messages or have a deep spiritual need, have been created in the 3D dimension, and you long to return home, where you have been created, to a higher dimension. The physical born beings will, in time, mature and become conscious enough to evolve into higher dimensions. These are the ones who are not aware of their Higher Self, but are given the experience here in order to make them aware of their potential. This is a natural process for all Souls, as all Souls will eventually make their journey back home towards our Prime Creator. It is important for you to comprehend also that although all humans look alike, their inner abilities vary greatly . Have you also considered the fact that some civilizations are so old and advanced that they can create soulless beings? Such beings are called ‘clones’ or ‘things’ on your world. This technology is already available to your scientists, and they can create or copy a human body, such as one would grow a plant. However, these beings do not possess a Soul , because they were not created by our Common Creator, but are the results of mechanical genetic engineering. This is another reason why some humans would not have a Higher Self. While their external appearance is in no way different to that of ordinary humans, the Spark of divine Life force and Consciousness is not inside of them. Those beings have mixed their mechanical genetic material with humans having a Soul, which has led to much DNA damage. There are many animals which are in human form, but not all animals are beasts, nor are all beasts animals. The Earth’s population is comprised of many Souls, with many different contracts, coming from various densities of consciousness. What man mistakes for thinking is but an intellectual awareness of things sensed and recorded within the cells of his brain for repetitive usage through what is termed ""memories."" Memories have no more relation to knowledge of Universal Mind which is in man, than a computer records are related to the source of their recordings. What he thinks of as his living body is but an obedient and motivated mechanical construct which simulates life through motion extended to it from its Soul, which alone lives and wills the body to move. Your physical (Clay) body is terrestrial, but that is not you. Your Soul, that Consciousness which you are, is that which has a temporary physical experience for its own development. The mechanical clay body you use has a Conscious experience. But you are that Consciousness. The physical world and anything in it cannot and never has created Conscious awareness. Intelligence, as found in snakes or spiders, yes, but not Conscious awareness. Some people think that the human body — which is flesh evolved at conscious awareness — is Soul, by some totally unexplained and totally unproven method. Think of that for a minute, Pilgrim. Common sense tells us that it is not reasonable that the human sex act can create a Soul in the Prime Creator’s image, since if it was so, we would not be creations of the Prime Creator, but of our physical parents’ mortal mechanical primate bodies. The human body, which your physical parents gave you, is the vehicle you use. But You are the Soul , created in the Prime Creator’s image, using the human flesh body your parents made ready for you to use. And if a Soul is pre-existent, which it is, and can enter into a body at some time in the baby’s development stage and leave the body when it dies, then logic and reason tells us that the Soul can also enter many more times. All the physical effects in your life are only the effects of the thoughts of your Conscious mind. The so-called sins and evil are not in the action of what your mechanical body does, but in the thoughts that come from what you think. Your Soul is accountable and will reap its own harvest. All the actions and words of your body are the effects of your thoughts. Countless religious and cultural teachings, as well as many different Philosophies, commands us to do good, but sadly, goodness is still veiled like in a thick mist. Many Souls have been stumbling in darkness, scraping their knees; but worry not, for eventually they all learn to walk! Soon after this dark period we live in, there will be so much light that you will have to wear shades. New information and better comprehension periodically transforms mankind into more conscious beings and a new awareness cycle — which will last for many thousands of years to come — is now commencing. The Prime Creators’ omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence are centered in the consciousness of each and every man; but there are only few who know of the Oneness of their Soul with the Creator. Man requires millennia to become aware of that. Each cycle brings him nearer to the awareness of his Oneness with the Source. Mankind lives in a bewildering complex world of Effects and doesn’t know the original Cause . Because of its seemingly infinite multiplicity and complexity, mankind fails to see or visualize the simple underlying principle of all things. He complicates truths and half-truths until its many angles, sides and facets have lost balance with each other and with him. All knowledge exists and is available. All knowledge will come to mankind in its own season, as needed. Enlightened Souls and messengers, periodically come and give such Universal knowledge, but only when man is able to comprehend it and only that he can bear at the moment, for man is just beginning to comprehend the wholeness. When we will master Enlightenment, we will know no limitations — but man must know the Light within oneself, the ever present Universal Consciousness . And man must want to know and to experience it oneself and then no one can tell otherwise, for Light knows Light intuitively. Mankind is aware of some of these illusions, but we are not aware of the fact that all effects are not what they seem to be. Thus we are misled into forming conclusions which have no relation to Nature and reality whatsoever. An intelligent person has mostly knowledge of the effect, but all real knowledge and understanding lies in the cause. New fundamental laws and principles must be based upon knowledge of the Cause . What little knowledge man has acquired during these last few thousand years, has been given to us by the very few geniuses, prophets, mystics and other messengers of the Light who have come to re-inspire mankind with their insight and knowledge. From these rare few, the beginnings of our culture have sprung. Without them there would be no understanding of beauty in this materialistic world. Without grasp of beauty man would still be living in caves. Through beauty alone will man gradually become consciously aware of his oneness with the Light? When man knows the Light he will know all things. Today, that Light is so dim in all men that no one, perhaps only a few, have fathomed the secret of Light, life, Love, growth, reincarnation and about the third wave of Souls entering now . The great unanswered questions of man have simple answers. The Silent Voice within every man is ceaselessly whispering it to his awakening consciousness. Every desire written upon the heart of man is carried to the Source of the original cause, and its answer will come, but only few ask from their heart and there are fewer still who listen. Many are the ages of preparation for worthiness, for man's consciousness is insulated from his Source by the sensations of his per-conditioned intellect and his selfish personal Self which he wrongly thinks of as being his Mind. What man calls his objective human mind/ intellect is mortal and the seat of both right and wrong information absorption and a multitude of vibrating sensations of his mortal body. What he calls his subjective mind is his sub-consciousness, his spiritual storehouse of memory of all-knowledge, all power, and all-presence. That consciousness is his individual Self, his ETERNAL Self through which his omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence are expressed as he slowly becomes aware of their presence within him. The electrically vibrating nerve-wires which operate his bodily mechanism act almost entirely through automatic reflexes and instinctive control, and to a very little extent through mental decisions. Each cell and organ of his body has an electrical awareness of its purpose and each fulfills that purpose without any mental action whatsoever upon the part of the Intelligence which occupies that body. The heartbeat, for example, is purely automatic. The white corpuscles of the blood rush to repair an injury to the body as automatically as a bell rings when a button is pushed. In this body and its electric recording brain, man thinks that he thinks and lives, loves and dies. He thinks himself conscious while awake and unconscious when sleeping — unaware that in all Nature there is no such condition as unconsciousness when sensation ceases in sleep. Man does not say that his tooth is unconscious when it is put to sleep by short-circuiting the electric current in the nerve-wire which gives sensed electrical awareness to his tooth. He knows that his tooth cannot be conscious, but he does not know that his mechanical body cannot be Conscious. Nor does he yet know that consciousness never sleeps, and never changes, for consciousness in man is his immortality. Man is still new. He is barely out of the dark of his jungle of ignorance. For the million or more years of his unfolding he has relied upon sensation for his actions and the evidence of his senses for his knowing. Few have been aware of the Spirit (Life force, Conscious awareness) in them. In this beginning of his new awareness he is confused, not knowing which is Mind in him, which is consciousness in him and which is sensation. He has not yet learned that bodies are but Self-created Mechanisms which manifest their centering Self, and that Self manifests the Prime Creator as One with it. Dolores Cannon: “ We Are Living in the Most Important Time in the History of the Universe ” Likewise, he has not yet learned that bodies neither live nor die, but repeat themselves continuously (“Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.”) and forever as all idea of Mind likewise repeats itself. Free will is a gift to everybody from our Creator, by following orthodox religions, scriptures, man-made systems, having blind faith, or admiring individual orators blindly without pondering and wondering if the information you get is real, truthful, or not, many have abdicated their own God given free will to the will of others by being followers and joiners. They became the effects of other people instead of making their own cause by being creative, just like the Prime Creator. (Like being loving co-creators). Think, make up your own mind about what is real and good and what is not! There is so much good in all of us, so use it lavishly and unselfishly toward everybody, but don’t be naïve or gullible. If something doesn’t make sense, it is non-sense. If you don’t search, you won’t find. Light will not come from others, it comes from within your own consciousness — it is already there waiting to escape. There is no dead, ever. The body was never alive; it is a created machine that gets the life force and instructions from the Soul consciousness that uses it — but only temporarily. Yes, we are Aliens — Extra-terrestrials.

10019,Al Franken Pushes for Kushner Security Clearance Review - Breitbart,"Democrat Sen. Al Franken said, “We should look at that” when asked during a Tuesday CBS This Morning interview if Senior Adviser to the President Jared Kushner’s security clearance should be revoked. [“This is a pretty bad breach,” added Franken. “These guys, this, the Administration, they’re not acting like people who have nothing to hide,” he claimed in the interview. He said they have a special prosecutor and House and Senate intelligence committees looking into the matter. “We have to see where the facts lead us, of course,” said Franken, who agreed when the host said, “But we don’t know yet?”  Franken said that Kushner didn’t disclose some of his contacts with Russians during the initial process of obtaining White House security clearance. The senator claimed that this is “against the law. ” Last Friday the Washington Post reported the claim of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that Kushner sought a secret communications channel between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin. The Post report stated that U. S. officials reviewed intercepted communications from December 1 or 2 at Trump Tower and that those communications included an offer from Kushner to Kislyak to set up a secret communications channel between the transition team and the Kremlin. The report also cited unnamed officials that said the U. S. was not surveilling the meeting or those involved. The report added that Russia sometimes feeds false information “as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U. S. analysts. ” In a Tuesday morning interview with Fox News, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway cited weekend comments from Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and National Security Advisor Gen. H. R. McMaster in which each expressed a lack of concern about the issue and, Conway stated, “backchannels like this are the regular course of business. ” Recently the Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

10020,Appeals Court Favors Transgender Student in Virginia Restroom Case - The New York Times,"Weeks after a new North Carolina law put transgender bathroom access at the heart of the nation’s culture wars, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. ruled on Tuesday in favor of a transgender student who was born female and wishes to use the boys’ restroom at his rural Virginia high school. Advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people note that the ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit applies to North Carolina, where the controversial law approved last month limits transgender people to bathrooms in government buildings, including public schools, that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates. As a result of the ruling, those advocates say, that portion of the North Carolina law that applies to public schools now clearly violates Title IX  —   the federal law that prohibits gender discrimination in schools. “Our expectation is that the North Carolina schools reverse course immediately, as in tomorrow,” Sarah Warbelow, the legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, an L. G. B. T. rights group, said Tuesday night. The ruling in favor of Gavin Grimm, a junior at Gloucester High School in southeastern Virginia, does not immediately grant him the right to use the boys’ restrooms rather, it directs a lower court that had ruled against him to   Mr. Grimm’s request for a preliminary injunction to be able to use those restrooms. But it is the first time that a federal appellate court has ruled that Title IX protects the rights of such students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. The ruling also comes as some school districts and state governments around the country are grappling with the question of whether transgender people should be allowed to go to the public facilities that correspond with their gender identity, or whether, as many conservatives believe, such access would infringe on the privacy rights of others. Boycotts and protests have followed the passage of the North Carolina law, but Gov. Pat McCrory has essentially stood by it. On Tuesday, Joshua Block, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case on Mr. Grimm’s behalf, argued that such state and local legislation violated federal law. “With this decision, we hope that schools and legislators will finally get the message that excluding transgender kids from the restrooms is unlawful sex discrimination,” he said in a statement. The North Carolina law has prompted the Obama administration to consider whether the state would be ineligible for billions of dollars in federal funding for schools, housing and highways. Mr. McCrory, a Republican who is seeking   in November, and other supporters of the law have played down suggestions that the Obama administration would rescind those billions. Mr. McCrory’s Democratic opponent, Roy Cooper, the state’s attorney general, has said in the past that the law may put the federal funding at risk and has refused to defend the state in a lawsuit challenging it. In a statement Tuesday, Mr. McCrory said he strongly disagreed with President Obama and Mr. Cooper’s objective “to force our high schools to allow boys in girls’ restrooms, locker rooms or shower facilities,” but would evaluate the effect of Tuesday’s ruling on North Carolina law and policy.

U. brought the case on behalf of Mr. Grimm, who was born female but identifies as a male, in June, seeking a preliminary injunction so that Mr. Grimm could use the boys’ restrooms at his school. The school administration initially allowed him to do so, but the local school board later approved a policy that barred him from the boys’ restrooms according to court documents, the policy also “required students with ‘gender identity issues’ to use an alternative private facility” to go to the bathroom. Judge Robert G. Doumar of Federal District Court ruled against Mr. Grimm in September, dismissing his claim that the school board had violated Title IX, although the judge did allow his case to go forward under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The ruling by a   panel on Tuesday reversed the lower court’s dismissal of the Title IX claim, stating that the District Court “did not accord appropriate deference” to regulations issued by the Department of Education. The department’s current guidelines dictate that schools “generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity. ” Roger Gannam, a lawyer with the conservative Liberty Counsel, which filed an amicus brief in the case on behalf of the defendant, the Gloucester County School Board, said Tuesday that the court had engaged in “blatant judicial legislation. ” “It’s very disappointing, and it’s frightening, in a sense,” he said. Mr. Block of the A. C. L. U. in a phone interview, said he was confident that the District Court would rule in Mr. Grimm’s favor and allow him to use the restroom. And he noted that the five states covered by the Fourth Circuit  —   Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, West Virginia and South Carolina  —   must now follow the federal Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX on this issue. The Obama administration has been aggressive in its efforts to ensure that transgender students can use the bathrooms in public schools that correspond with their gender identities. Some federal agencies have threatened to rescind funding to pressure some municipal governments in California and Illinois to change their policies and allow transgender students to do so. In June, the Justice Department filed a “statement of interest” in Mr. Grimm’s case. “We are pleased with the Fourth Circuit’s decision, which agreed with the position that the United States advocated in its brief,” the Justice Department said in a statement Tuesday night. In an email, a clerk for the Gloucester school system said the superintendent, Walter Clemons, “has no comment at this time. ” In a statement released through the A. C. L. U. Mr. Grimm said: “I feel so relieved and vindicated by the court’s ruling. Today’s decision gives me hope that my fight will help other kids avoid discriminatory treatment at school. ”",0

10022,"On a Somber Sunday, ‘One Nation Under God Examines Its Soul’ - The New York Times","DALLAS  —   Fearful that the nation is locked in a spiral of violence and discord, many Americans took what refuge they could in church on Sunday. In tiny storefronts and suburban megachurches, worshipers mourned the deaths of five Dallas police officers at the hands of an   sniper who was aiming to kill white officers at a demonstration against police violence. They also grieved for two   men killed in shootings by the police in Baton Rouge, La. and Minnesota. Some prayed for the souls of the men who pulled the triggers. Some thanked God for the sacrifices the police made daily to protect their cities. Some thanked God for the technology that allowed the world to see controversial acts of police violence toward  . At St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan spoke of a country “worried, frustrated and fatigued over senseless violence. ” “From Minnesota to Louisiana and Texas, one nation under God examines its soul,” he said. “Sadness and heaviness is especially present in our   and law enforcement communities. ” The turbulence felt close, sometimes distressingly so, for many churchgoers. Protests had roiled the streets of San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, among other cities, hours before sunrise. In Dallas, drivers had to maneuver on Sunday morning around a   crime scene that remained closed off in the heart of downtown, where Micah Johnson, a    former Army reservist, used a semiautomatic weapon last week to kill the five officers and wound seven others, as well as two civilians, before the police killed him with a   explosive device. A few blocks from the scene, Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas gave an interview on Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” posing questions about his city that many Americans, Christian and   alike, had begun asking about the nation as a whole. “Can we, in a moment of crisis, when officers are fallen, forgive?” Mr. Rawlings said. “Can we disagree without demonizing? Can we see a better narrative, as opposed to just absurdity, that there’s redemption as we build this great city?” Mr. Rawlings, who is white, also attended a service at the Potter’s House Church, the huge Dallas congregation led by the   televangelist T . D. Jakes. The service was more of a town hall event promising “tools on reconciling and moving forward. ” The city’s police chief, David O. Brown, and other officers were in attendance. Among the panelists and   participants were relatives of Alton Sterling, the black man killed in Louisiana, and the girlfriend of Philando Castile, the black motorist shot to death in Minnesota. Nine miles away, on the outskirts of South Dallas, Pastor Frederick Douglass Haynes III addressed a congregation of hundreds, most of them black, at   Baptist Church. He told them he was not interested in preaching a message of reconciliation if that did not come with change, or of healing if that simply meant patching over the injustice that had led to last week’s violence. “We can’t have normal church today,” he said, explaining that he was tired of delivering services after such tragedies, naming Tamir Rice, Walter Scott and Eric Garner. Calling the nation a racial powder keg, Pastor Haynes said, “You won’t have unity as long as you have structured injustice. ” “The Bible says injustice is a sin,” he added. “The Bible says oppression is a sin. ” Pastor Haynes’s daughter was at the Dallas protest on Thursday night and was   with him from her phone when the shooting began. Pastor Haynes, who said he had watched his daughter’s proud smile transform into screams, struck out at those trying to blame the advocacy group Black Lives Matter for the attack, calling it “racist gall. ” “That was a peaceful march,” he said. “Police and protesters were taking selfies. ” At Watermark Community Church in Dallas, those who dropped off their children for Sunday school walked by the place where Sgt. Michael J. Smith had stood for years, sometimes on Sundays, sometimes during the week, by the glass doors leading to the preschool classrooms. He had been there the previous Sunday, but he was not there for this one. Sergeant Smith, who provided security at the church while off duty and was also a member, was one of the sniper’s victims on Thursday night. That evening, Watermark’s senior pastor, Todd Wagner, posted a letter online to Dallas residents. The city, he said, was “a war zone. ” “As part of that war, darkness has been growing in our country because for some time leaders and citizens alike have mocked” the light of God, he wrote. Onstage Sunday, Pastor Wagner reiterated that theme but also called for a greater sense of understanding among the races. “They very first time I heard ‘Black lives matter,’ I was like: ‘What? Why would you make such a racist statement? ’” Pastor Wagner, who is white, said during an impassioned sermon. Later, he said, he realized that he needed to listen to those making the declaration, try to understand the source of their hurt, love them and preach the Gospel. Others, he said, would be wise to do the same  —   to respond to “Black lives matter” with “Let me understand your pain,” and to show “that white men do care. ” In Baton Rouge, about 20 worshipers, nearly all of them black, gathered at the Ark of Safety, a storefront church sometimes attended by relatives of Mr. Sterling, who was selling CDs in a parking lot before he was killed by the police on Tuesday. The Rev. Tommie Gordon told congregants that if they trusted in the world, they would be lost  —   that if they demanded justice from the world, they would be lost. “When things are going wrong, people always want to shout about it,” he said. “Nobody’s going to listen. This is the time to get on your knees and pray. ” There is nothing wrong with lawful protest, he said. But he added, more than once, “I’ve never seen Jesus at a protest. ” Brandon Lee, 22, who knew Mr. Sterling and whose father bought CDs from him, expressed a belief that did not exactly echo the message of the service. “I just really feel like it starts with man,” he said, speaking of the need for justice. “If you fix man, you fix the world. ” Elsewhere, easy answers seemed equally difficult to come by. At Nativity Lutheran Church in St. Anthony, Minn. not far from where Officer Jeronimo Yanez shot and killed Mr. Castile, the Rev. Glenn Seefeldt called for prayers for both men. “We want to be able to be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem,” he said. “But where do we start?” Pastor Seefeldt, whose congregation is mostly white, mentioned “white privilege” and urged members to think deeply about their actions and hidden biases. “I have a real and tremendous guilt response,” he said. “What have I done to contribute to racism as a white male?” This peculiar and tangled American moment seemed even more vexing for Rose Tolbert, 58, a member of the   church in Dallas. Ms. Tolbert works for the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department and has two sons in law enforcement. Ms. Tolbert is also   and she had wanted to attend Thursday’s protest in a stand against police killings of black men but had to work that night. When she got news of the shootings, she called to make sure her family was O. K. Then she fell asleep crying over the tragedy that had befallen her fellow law enforcement officers. At the same time, she remained devastated by the deaths of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile. On Sunday morning, her preacher invited her to the altar for a special prayer for law enforcement officers and their families, for protesters, and for children who he said were being traumatized by violence. Ms. Tolbert went to the altar, then returned with tears streaming down her face. “I needed consolation  —   I needed the word from God,” she said, her voice breaking. She paused and then collapsed against a pole in the church lobby, sobbing. “I came here to get refilled,” she said. “We need to pray and get active. We need to stand up. ”",0
10023,Band Calls Out Austin’s SXSW Festival over Immigration Rules,"A New York band member called out Austin’s   South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival over its contract that demands foreign musicians follow U. S. immigration law. The festival is scheduled to run from March   in Austin. [Felix Walworth, a drummer from Brooklyn, New   Told Slant, dragged the SXSW festival into the middle of the national immigration debate when he tweeted to his approximately 6, 000 followers he is canceling the band’s appearance at the upcoming festival. The band’s Facebook page describes itself as a “bedroom punk band from New York, the music of Felix Walworth. ”  Walworth’s complaint revolves around a provision in the festival’s participation contract that states the organization will contact U. S. immigration authorities if international artists violate the conditions of their immigration visas that prohibit working in the U. S. After looking through this contract sent to me by sxsw I have decided to cancel Told Slant’s performance at the festival pic. twitter.   —   Told Slant (@Felixixix666) March 2, 2017,  According to Walworth, the agreement states, “International Artists entering the country through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP,) B visa, or any   visa may not perform at any public, or   SXSW Music Festival DAY OR NIGHT shows  …    ” The photo of the alleged contract wording cuts off at this point. He claims the contract states that artists violating this provision of the agreement will be removed from their “official showcase,” and possibly replaced. It further claims SXSW will cancel the artist’s hotels booked through their housing service and cancel their credentials. Most notably, the agreement allegedly states SXSW “will notify the appropriate U. S. immigration authorities of the above actions. ” Shortly after his initial tweet, Walworth added, “Can our first step toward coalition as artists with radical politics be to cancel all our official showcases at sxsw? I’m serious just do it. ” Can our first step toward coalition as artists with radical politics be to cancel all our official showcases at sxsw? I’m serious just do it,  —   Told Slant (@Felixixix666) March 2, 2017,  SXSW officials responded in a statement published by Austin360. com that the wording in the contract has been in place for many years and is not a response to the current status of immigration issues that followed the election of President Donald Trump. “In the   era, it looks different than how it was intended, and how it was received in the past,” SXSW managing director Roland Swenson told the local music news outlet. “But we’ve come out strongly against the travel ban, and we’ve really been going the extra mile to make sure these bands don’t get screwed over when they enter the country. ” “Most South by Southwest acts are able to perform here on the condition that they’re not getting paid and they’re not doing any other shows than ours, “Swenson explained. “That keeps them from having to go through getting a work visa and all that, which is time consuming and expensive. ” He said the wording in the agreement is an attempt to warn international performers what could possibly happen to them if they violate the rules surrounding their visas. “We have never reported international showcasing artists to immigration authorities,” SXSW officials stated in the press release. The statement continues: We were sorry to learn that one of our invited performers chose to cancel his performance at this year’s SXSW Music Festival due to a misunderstanding of our policies regarding international artists. We understand that given the current political climate surrounding immigration, the language that was published seems strong. Violating U. S. immigration law has always carried potentially severe consequences, and we would be remiss not to warn our participating acts of the likely repercussions. Language governing SXSW’s ability to protect a showcase has been in the artist Performance Agreement for many years. It is, and always was intended to be, a safeguard to provide SXSW with a means to respond to an act that does something truly egregious, such as disobeying our rules about pyrotechnics on stage, starting a brawl in a club, or causing serious safety issues. The organization provided Austin360. com with the text of the contract sections in question. The SXSW Performance Agreement states: If SXSW determines, in its sole discretion, that Artist or its representatives have acted in ways that adversely affect the viability of Artist’s official SXSW showcase, the following actions are available to SXSW: Artist will be removed from their official SXSW showcase and, at SXSW’s sole option, replaced. Any hotels booked via SXSW Housing will be canceled. Artist’s credentials will be canceled. SXSW will notify the appropriate U. S. immigration authorities of the above actions. Officials continued, saying, “We hope never to be put in the position to act on this. Indeed, we spend a great deal of time communicating with international artists concerning numerous issues, including how to avoid issues at U. S. ports of entry. ” In what officials described as an informational addition to the agreement made many years ago, SXSW added the following language to the agreement: 1. 4. Foreign Artists entering the country through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) B visa or any   visa may not perform at any public or unofficial shows, DAY OR NIGHT, in Austin from March   2017. Accepting and performing at unofficial events (including unofficial events aside from SXSW Music dates during their visit to the United States) may result in immediate deportation, revoked passport and denied entry by US Customs Border Patrol at US ports of entry.

10024,FBI Cops Out on Pressing Charges Against Hillary,"FBI Cops Out on Pressing Charges Against Hillary November 07, 2016 FBI Cops Out on Pressing Charges Against Hillary 
Democrat Hillary Clinton heads into the final day of a tight White House race against Republican Donald Trump on Monday with new momentum after the FBI said no criminal charges were forthcoming in an investigation of her email practices. Both Clinton and Trump will spend the day racing across a handful of battleground states that could swing Tuesday's election, which polls show is close but tilting toward Clinton. FBI Director James Comey again sent shockwaves through the race by telling Congress on Sunday that investigators had worked around the clock to complete a review of newly discovered emails and found no reason to change their July finding that Clinton was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing in her use of a private email server while secretary of state. It was uncertain whether the announcement came in time to change voters' minds or undo any damage from days of Republican attacks on Clinton as corrupt. Tens of millions of Americans had cast early votes in the 10 days since Comey first told Congress of the newly discovered emails. 
""Nothing's going to change between today and tomorrow to help [Clinton] win back"" undecided voters,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" 
Trump, who has not said whether he will respect the results of Tuesday's election, questioned the thoroughness of the FBI review and said the issue would not go away. 
Clinton did not mention the FBI finding during her last two campaign events on Sunday. 
""That's behind us now,"" campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN on Monday. 
On Monday, Trump will hit five battleground states - Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan - and close with a late-night rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

10025,"Hollywood’s Summer of Extremes: Megahits, Superflops and Little Else - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   Sequel fatigue does not fully explain it. Nor does an overload of   event movies. A spate of terrible films? Yes, but that’s not entirely the explanation, either. In a summer when studios suffered more misfires than ever, many of them supersized, Hollywood is scratching for answers, and some longtime movie executives are pointing toward a nuanced shift in consumer behavior. For the first time since moviegoing became a staple of American life, an underappreciated revenue engine  —   ticket buyers who still trek to theaters more for the experience than for the movie itself  —   may finally be conking out. “We’re in a situation where, if people don’t get excited about a specific movie and plan in advance to go to it, you may end up with literally no one,” said Adam Fogelson, the former chairman of Universal Pictures who now runs STX Entertainment’s film unit. When movies do not seem worth the hassle, and there seem to be many more of those, there is less of a cushion for studios. Is it because the number of people just wandering in is dwindling? Theater owners and some analysts dismiss that idea, saying studios are refusing to look inward for explanations for a cavalcade of summer disappointments, including “The BFG,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,” “The Nice Guys,” “Ghostbusters,” “The Legend of Tarzan,” “Independence Day: Resurgence,” “Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,” “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” “Warcraft,” “Ice Age: Collision Course,” “Hands of Stone,” “Star Trek: Beyond” and “Now You See Me 2. ” “ ” cost    and Paramount Pictures at least $150 million to make and market, but was savaged by critics and took in only $11. 2 million during its first weekend in theaters. That’s the Hollywood equivalent of “literally no one. ” (An art house example: Despite starring Matthew McConaughey and Naomi Watts, “The Sea of Trees” last month collected a total of $2, 894 over its first two weeks in two theaters.) Sequelitis and an overload of event movies have been blamed for much of the carnage. But sequels have sputtered before. The collapse of “Happy Feet Two” and the “Chronicles of Narnia” series led to similar anxiety a few years ago. “We think the issue is less that audiences are tired of sequels, and more that there are now so many sequels that they are cannibalizing each other,” Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a report on Thursday. Nor is it just that the summer offerings were particularly awful. “The data suggests differently,” Mr. Cruetz wrote, noting that the summer’s 29 widely released movies had an average score of 57. 7 percent positive on the   site Rotten Tomatoes, the highest in 16 years. The lack of clear answers has led to    —   “Could This Be the Year Movies Stopped Mattering?” asked a Wired headline last month  —   and studio theorizing about    factors, like a decline in patrons who decide what film to see while standing in line. Most people would never consider arriving at a theater without a specific movie in mind. Astoundingly, though, more than a quarter of all ticket buyers still decide what film to see only after showing up, according to PostTrak, an audience polling service owned by comScore. Theaters offer supporting anecdotal evidence. “Our members say the most common questions their ticket sellers get are ‘What’s good?’ and ‘What’s playing next? ’” said Patrick Corcoran, vice president of the National Association of Theater Owners. Still, while data is scarce, PostTrak does show an erosion. In summer 2014, about 32 percent of people made their decision while in line at a theater. In 2015, the number was about 28 percent. PostTrak discontinued research on this audience segment in March, leaving studios to guess at what happened over the 2016 summer season, which started on May 6 and ends on Monday. If the    crowd is dwindling, the reasons include the comparative ease of other forms of entertainment (HBO Go, Netflix) the increasing cost of moviegoing (now $17. 25 per adult at the ArcLight chain’s Hollywood location, before   upcharges) and the movie business itself, which has aggressively pushed one kind of event movie (lumbering,    sequels) at the expense of variety. The increasing popularity of online ticketing and reserved seating may also be playing a role. At Fandango, “there has been a shift from   purchase to advanced purchase,” according to Harry Medved, a company spokesman. Last week, AMC Entertainment, the No. 1 theater chain in North America, said that all nine of its locations in New York City would soon offer reserved seating. “In the olden, olden days, people went to see whatever was playing, but people today, flooded with niche entertainment programming, don’t want to spend money on a movie they are only   in seeing,” said the film historian Jeanine Basinger, whose books include “The Star Machine. ” When hauling the family to the theater seems worth it, the upside can still be enormous, Ms. Basinger noted. “Finding Dory” and “Captain America: Civil War,” both from Disney, were the top draws of the summer, collecting a combined $891 million at North American theaters, according to comScore. Third place went to Universal’s “Secret Life of Pets,” which took in $360 million a sequel is already in the works. On a smaller scale, STX Entertainment hit the jackpot with its modestly budgeted “Bad Moms,” which passed $100 million over the weekend, and Sony similarly succeeded with “Sausage Party,” which has taken in about $90 million. Warner Bros. powered “Lights Out,” a horror movie made for $5 million, to $66 million in ticket sales. Over all, the handful of blockbuster hits made up for the misses  —   at least for theater owners, who will collect roughly $4. 49 billion at the summer box office, on par with 2015, according to comScore. (Last summer was one week longer.) Attendance is expected to total 513 million, a 3. 5 percent decline. For the year, theaters have generated about $8. 11 billion in ticket revenue, a 5 percent increase attendance is up about 1. 2 percent. But the misfires have added up for studios, most of which have been spending more on individual films as they search for global hits. Warner Bros. Sony, Universal, 20th Century Fox and Paramount all had diminished or nonexistent profits in the most recent quarter. Disney was the exception, with a huge $766 million in profit, a 62 percent increase from the same quarter a year earlier. But even Disney has struggled recently. Its last three   releases have been duds: “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” “The BFG” and “Pete’s Dragon. ” And, over the Labor Day weekend, a fourth, “The Light Between Oceans” is expected to sell a disappointing $6. 3 million. “We didn’t see a lot of middle ground this season,” Dave Hollis, Disney’s executive vice president for theatrical distribution, said on Sunday. “There are probably multiple reasons why, starting with the fact that people are making their selections much more carefully. ”",0
10026,"CNN’s Chalian: Trump Is Going ’Mainstream,’ ’Establishment’ - Breitbart","Friday on CNN’s “Situation Room,” CNN political director David Chalian said President Donald Trump’s recent foreign policy maneuvers mean he is “going mainstream” and Washington “establishment. ”  Chalian said, “I don’t know if we’re seeing a Trump doctrine take shape. Certainly, Donald Trump is not portraying it as such. It’s a little bit more of these disparate and discrete incidents that have happened, whether the Syria attack or this bomb. In fact, you just said it was a tactical move that the theater commander was able to make, not necessarily the large —  part of a strategic framework here, and I think —  the only thing that I could sort of ascertain in observing what Donald Trump is doing right now is that he’s going mainstream —  a little establishment, which is totally against the brand that he ran on. ” “But he —  I think it shows the power —  and when I say establishment, I don’t mean just Republican establishment —  Democrat —  the Washington establishment —  and it shows the power and the stranglehold that the establishment has,” he continued. “I know he tried to bust it up during the campaign and saying that he was going to be the irritant and destroy it, but when you don’t have ideological moorings —  you’re not moored, that’s guided, then I think you’re susceptible to the power of the establishment and I think that’s what we see playing out right now with Donald Trump. ” CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash added, “He said the world has changed, and it hasn’t. I mean, things change every day in the world, but the —  but the overall sort of zeitgeist of where these hot spots are is where they were when he took office, so it wasn’t that. It was him, and it is him, and —  and to your point, David, it’s that he’s not a dogmatic guy. He never was. If he was a dogmatic guy, then he would have run for the Democratic nomination because he would still be   and for   health care system but he’s not. He switched, you know, did a complete 180 on those issues and so it’s not surprising that he is willing to —  to use his words, be flexible when it comes to a whole host of issues, as he’s learning a really, really hard, really new job that people who are even ideological and get the job tend to realize, you know, I need to switch a little bit. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
10027,"One Star Over, a Planet That Might Be Another Earth - The New York Times","Another Earth could be circling the star right next door to us. Astronomers announced on Wednesday that they had detected a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest neighbor to our solar system. Intriguingly, the planet is in the star’s “Goldilocks zone,” where it may be neither too hot nor too cold. That means liquid water could exist at the surface, raising the possibility for life. Although observations in recent years, particularly by NASA’s Kepler   mission, have uncovered a bounty of   worlds throughout the galaxy, this one holds particular promise because it might someday, decades from now, be possible to reach. It’s 4. 2   or 25 trillion miles, away from Earth, which is extremely close in cosmic terms. One astronomer likened it to a flashing neon sign. “I’m the nearest star, and I have a potentially habitable planet!” said R. Paul Butler, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science and a member of the team that made the discovery. Guillem   an astronomer at Queen Mary University of London and the leader of the team that made the discovery reported in the journal Nature, said, “We know there are terrestrial planets around many stars, and we kind of expected the nearby stars would contain terrestrial planets. This is not exciting because of this. The excitement is because it is the nearest one. ” Beyond the planet’s size and distance from its parent star, much about it is still mysterious. Scientists are working off computer models that offer mere hints of what’s possible: Conditions could be Earthlike, but they could also be hellish like Venus, or cold and dry like Mars. There is no picture of the planet, which has been designated Proxima b. Instead, Dr.   and his colleagues detected it indirectly, studying via telescope the light of the parent star. They zeroed in on clocklike wobbles in the starlight, as the colors shifted slightly to the reddish end of the spectrum, then slightly bluish. The oscillations, caused by the bobbing    motion of the star as it is pulled around by the gravity of the planet, are similar to how the pitch of a police siren rises or falls depending on whether the patrol car is traveling toward or away from the listener. From the size of the wobbles, the astronomers determined that Proxima b is at least 1. 3 times the mass of Earth, although it could be several times larger. A year on Proxima b  —   the time to complete one orbit around the star  —   lasts just 11. 2 days. Although the planet, lost in the glare of the star, cannot be viewed by current telescopes, astronomers hope to see it when the next generation is built a decade from now. And the planet’s proximity to Earth gives hope that robotic probes could someday be zooming past the planet for a   look. A privately funded team of scientists and technology titans, led by the Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner and the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, have announced Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, a project to develop and launch a fleet of   spacecraft within two to three decades. Their proposed destination is the Alpha Centauri star system, which includes two larger, sunlike stars in addition to Proxima Centauri. “We will definitely aim at Proxima,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer who is the chairman of an advisory committee for Breakthrough Starshot. “This is like finding prime real estate in our neighborhood. ” This newly discovered planet is much closer to its parent star, about five million miles apart, than Earth is to the sun, 93 million miles. Even Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is 36 million miles from the sun. While Proxima b might be similar to Earth, its parent star, Proxima Centauri, is very different from the sun. It is tiny, belonging to a class of stars known as red dwarfs, with only about 12 percent of the mass of the sun and about   the luminosity  —   so dim that it cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Thus Proxima b, despite its closeness to the star, receives less warmth than Earth, but enough that water could flow on the surface. Whether the planet has liquid water or an atmosphere is “pure speculation at this point,” Dr.   said in a news conference. If the planet formed close to the star, it could be dry and airless, but it might also have formed farther out and migrated inward to its current orbit. It is also possible that the planet formed dry and was later bombarded by comets or   asteroids. “There are viable models and stories that lead to a viable Earthlike planet today,” Dr.   said. Even if it is habitable, scientists studying the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe spiritedly debate whether planets around these red dwarfs are a promising place to look. Small stars are more erratic, especially during their youth, and eruptions off the star’s surface could strip away the atmosphere from such planets. Levels of   and other   radiation bombarding the planet would be 100 times that on Earth, the scientists said. The close orbit suggests that the rotation of the planet would probably be gravitationally locked by the star’s pull. Just as the same side of the moon always faces Earth, one side of Proxima b is probably eternally bright, always facing the star, while the other is ever dark. Additional visible light observations further convinced the scientists that they were not being fooled by variations in the star itself erroneously mimicking the presence of a planet. The discovery was more than a decade and a half in the making. Michael Endl, an astronomer at the University of Texas and one of the authors of the Nature paper, peered at Proxima Centauri for eight years beginning in 2000, looking for hints of a planet. “At that time, I didn’t see anything highly, highly significant,” Dr. Endl said in an interview. “Then we published our data and moved on. ” Later, Dr.   analyzing data from a different instrument on a different telescope, found inconclusive hints of a planet. He reached out to Dr. Endl to reanalyze the earlier data, and he also spearheaded the Pale Red Dot project, which tried to observe Proxima Centauri daily for two months earlier this year. The new observations clearly revealed the 11.  period of the planet, and the signal matched what Dr.   had suspected earlier. It also matched a signal that was hidden in the noise of Dr. Endl’s data, which was lower in precision and observed Proxima Centauri once a week or so, not every day. There are hints of perhaps another planet, perhaps more, but those hints are still ambiguous, the scientists said. The discovery could provide impetus for   telescopes. Ruslan Belikov of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. has proposed a small space telescope costing less than $175 million dedicated to the search for planets in Alpha Centauri. While it would not be powerful enough to spot Proxima b, its existence would give more confidence that terrestrial planets also orbit the two sunlike stars there. “It just raises the public awareness there’s a new world just next door,” Dr. Belikov said. “It’s a paradigm shift in people’s minds. ”",0
10028,Pittsburgh City Council ponders shutting down speech of its own members,"Print 
Pittsburgh City Council rewrote a proposed rule change that included a $500 penalty for members who talk publicly about closed-door meetings, but the new stipulation still could violate free-speech rights, an open meetings law expert said. 
Council President Bruce Kraus on Tuesday introduced legislation that revises rules governing council’s operation that were last amended in 2011. Kraus of the South Side sponsored the bill with three other members. 
Council last week was prepared to introduce a version of the rules that contained a gag order and fine for members found to be in violation of attorney-client privilege by speaking publicly about private meetings known as executive sessions. Kraus said council tweaked the legislation to censure members found to be in violation of attorney-client privilege for talking publicly about private meetings with city attorneys. The rule does not define attorney-client privilege but keeps the $500 penalty. 
The previous version empowered the council president with doling out punishment to members. Kraus said that was changed to require a unanimous vote of council.",0

10030,Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground. Then a Sniper Opened Fire. - The New York Times,"It felt like a watershed moment for a scattered and   civil rights movement. Inside Black Lives Matter, the national revulsion over videos of police officers shooting to death black men in Minnesota and Louisiana was undeniable proof that the group’s message of outrage and demands for justice had finally broken through. Even the white governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, in a pained public concession, embraced the movement’s central argument. “Would this have happened if those passengers  —   the driver and the passengers  —   were white?” he asked. “I don’t think it would’ve. ” Then, in an instant, everything changed. Black Lives Matter now faces perhaps the biggest crisis in its short history: It is both scrambling to distance itself from an   sniper in Dallas who set out to murder white police officers and trying to rebut a chorus of detractors who blame the movement for inspiring his deadly attack. “What I saw in Dallas was devastating to our work,” said Jedidiah Brown, a Chicago pastor who has emerged as an outspoken Black Lives Matter activist over the past year. The moment he learned of the attack on the police, he said, he immediately sensed that any emerging national consensus would “tear down the middle. ” “The thing I vividly remember thinking was, this is going to show exactly how divided this conversation is,” he said. For those who have harbored doubts or animosity toward Black Lives Matter  —   among them police unions and conservative leaders  —   the Dallas attacks are a cudgel that, fairly or not, they are eager to swing. In Texas, several state officials, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, lashed out at the group, directly linking its tone and tactics to the killings. Mr. Patrick acknowledged that the demonstration in Dallas on Thursday night had been peaceful until the gunman struck, but he accused the movement of creating the conditions for what happened. “I do blame former Black Lives Matter protests,” he said. “This has to stop,” Mr. Patrick said, adding of the police officers, “These are real people. ” State Representative Bill Zedler, a Republican, was equally blunt in his assessment of the group’s influence on the    gunman, Micah Johnson. “Clearly the rhetoric of Black Lives Matters encouraged the sniper that shot Dallas police officers,” he wrote on Twitter. But a bigger problem for Black Lives Matter, supported by many liberals, is that Mr. Johnson’s actions could jeopardize the movement’s appeal to a broader group of Americans who have gradually become more sympathetic to its cause after years of highly publicized police shootings. In the days before the Dallas massacre, Aesha Rasheed, 39, an activist in New Orleans, felt that at long last, white and black America were watching the same images with the same horror: two Louisiana police officers tackling and then shooting Alton Sterling, 37, at   range the slumped,   body of Philando Castile, 32, after a Minnesota police officer shot him through a car window, with his girlfriend and her daughter sitting inches away. “It seemed like a national consciousness was sinking in,” Ms. Rasheed said. After the massacre in Dallas, she said, “it turned on a dime. ” She now worries that the episodes involving black men may be overshadowed and overlooked. “Does this get ignored?” she asked. “Do five officers take center stage?” Black Lives Matter usually spurns central planning and management. But in a sign of alarm over the volatile situation, leaders of several organizations associated with the movement put out formal statements that repeatedly described the Dallas attacker as a lone gunman, unconnected to the group’s cause. “There are some who would use these events to stifle a movement for change and quicken the demise of a vibrant discourse on the human rights of Black Americans,” read a statement from the Black Lives Matter Network. “We should reject all of this. ” The police have said Mr. Johnson  —   a military veteran who told the authorities that he had hunted down white police officers as retribution for their abuses  —   had no direct links to any protest group. But in recounting Mr. Johnson’s final hours, Chief David O. Brown of the Dallas Police Department mentioned the movement by name. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” he said. The wider world may now expect or even demand a period of reflection and restraint from the members of Black Lives Matter. But public, nonviolent confrontation, rather than private conciliation, is central to the group’s mission: shouting at police officers, for example, or staging elaborate “ ” that evoke death at the hands of law enforcement. This    style has at times rankled even the movement’s allies: A Black Lives Matter protester interrupted Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during a Seattle campaign rally in August and seized control of his microphone, inflaming his aides and some of his supporters. “Excuse me!” Mr. Sanders cried. That combative approach is deliberate. The group is premised, activists said, on a rejection of what they see as a dominant mainstream culture that has marginalized the value of   lives for decades. Black Lives Matter was born, as a phrase and a rallying cry, after the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Florida shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed     . By the time demonstrators took to the streets of Ferguson, Mo. a year later to protest the killing of Michael Brown, another unarmed   it was the motto and name of a decentralized collection of activists. Today, at least 37 groups operate under the movement’s name, and tens of thousands of supporters identify with its cause. In interviews on Friday, activists scoffed at calls to recalibrate their message or their strategy, or to temporarily pause protests out of respect for the dead police officers in Texas. By Friday night, protesters had returned to the streets in multiple cities, swarming the Williamsburg Bridge in New York shutting down a major highway in Atlanta and marching through downtown Phoenix, where officers used pepper spray and beanbag guns to keep the demonstrators from taking over Interstate 10. In each city, the protesters were trailed by the police, as they were in Dallas. But it was clear that the national conversation had changed. On social media, Black Lives Matter activists watched with dismay on Thursday night as a squall of outrage and mourning over the shootings of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile was suddenly overwhelmed by a furious outcry over the shooting of Dallas police officers and messages of rage directed at activists and protesters. The hashtag #blacklivesmatter was joined by #bluelivesmatter, a rival reference to police officers. “This   rhetoric has to stop. It’s sickening,” wrote one Twitter user using the hashtag. “We will not forget or forgive,” wrote another. Sitting in his bed after midnight with an iPhone, DeRay Mckesson, 30, a Black Lives Matter activist, watched the rapid change in tone. “It suddenly became about blame,” he said. “People wanted to link it to the protesters no matter what. ” Undeterred, several activists rebuffed the view of the carnage in Dallas as a potential setback to their cause. Ja’Mal Green, another activist, said the killings were, in their own grisly way, a powerful   call. “It’s not a setback at all,” Mr. Green said. “That’s showing the people of this country that black people are getting to a boiling point. We are tired of watching police kill our brothers and sisters. We are tired of being tired. ” He insisted that he was not encouraging violence. But he said there “comes a time when black people will snap. ” He added: “It only takes a couple to get past that boiling point. You saw that in Dallas. ” As conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh assailed Black Lives Matter as “a terrorist group committing hate crimes,” activists like Wendi  ’Neal saw echoes of repeated attempts throughout American history, including efforts by the federal government, to discredit civil rights groups and leaders. “It’s just made up,” she said of those who held Black Lives Matter responsible in any way for the Dallas attack. “It’s not true. ” “I can’t think of any of the justice or liberation organizations that I know,” Ms.  ’Neal said, “that have an investment in shooting cops. ”",0

10032,"Meet the New Monopoly Tokens: A Rubber Ducky, a T-rex and a Penguin - The New York Times","Say goodbye to the thimble, the boot and the wheelbarrow, Monopoly fans. There are new tokens in town. Hasbro, the maker of the    board game, on Friday announced the results  of a poll that asked fans in more than 100 countries to choose which tokens will circle the board in the next Monopoly game coming out in the fall. The Scottie dog, top hat, roadster car, cat, and battleship tokens will return. But the boot got the boot, and so did the wheelbarrow and the thimble. The three tokens will be replaced with a Tyrannosaurus rex, a rubber ducky and a penguin, the company said. The announcement came just before World Monopoly Day on Sunday. In a statement, Jonathan Berkowitz, a senior vice president at Hasbro Gaming, said that the “global Monopoly community has spoken. ” “The next generation of tokens clearly represents the interests of our fans around the world, and we’re proud to have our iconic game impacted by the people that feel most passionate about playing it,” he said. Hasbro had asked fans in January to choose the next generation of tokens from a list of 64 options, which included the current lineup. More than 4. 3 million votes were counted. The most popular token in the voting was the Scottie dog, the stout little pup that has clattered its way past Go countless times on Monopoly boards worldwide since it was introduced in the 1950s. The   was the second most popular option among the voters, followed by the top hat and the racing car, which have both been in circulation since the 1930s, when the game first made its appearance on American living room tables. The rubber ducky and penguin were the final inductees, joining the cat and the battleship. Some fans of the game seemed to feel strongly about which of the tokens should stay and which should go. The competition was fueled by online campaigning from outside forces, Hasbro said. Zipcar, the   company, advocated for the survival of the car token by asking fans to #SaveTheCar. The New England Aquarium got in the spirit by tweeting photographs of their penguins to #VotePenguin, and hosting a Facebook live event to Monopoly’s nearly 11 million Facebook fans. The company has opened up its revamping of the token lineup in previous polls. In 2013, fans voted to drop the iron.",0
10033,Paintings 'almost no one else seemed to be doing',"Print 
When Judith Gait met “Father X,” it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. He had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. Gait is a married mother of five, and long-term American resident in Britain. Her support of the pro-life movement is driven by “thankfulness and praise” for life and her Christian faith. 
Witnessing abortion’s heavy toll on the living and dead, Gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. Subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. Rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas”painting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
When a friend first visited Gait’s studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. Confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote: “I realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture.” 
Gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. It happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. Father X remembers every detail. 
Their conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book, “ Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas: Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma .” Father X wanted to remain anonymous, as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. He wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of Gait’s 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. 
Time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, Gait claims. Rather, “the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated.” You can see that in the words of Father X, which run the gamut of human emotions. “On Abortion: Shoe, Pot and Crosses”from “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas” 
“Jonah of Nineveh” features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. Flowers are “already in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born.” Torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. Spirals represent a child’s DNA helix and the “veil of the Temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation.” Father X makes an analogy between Jonah fleeing “parental responsibility” and eventual redemption – then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness: “It was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. She was full of fear. …” 
In some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. They are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. Father X interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. In “Hammer of Decision,” it belongs to Thor, the war god “infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction.” Wagner, the Olympics, “sperm races,” Thomas Moore and Valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. Either the Carpenter’s “hammer of wisdom” or Thor’s “tool of chaos” will be chosen by expectant parents. “Hammer, Suspended” 
“ Troubadours ” runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. Striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. This includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, “interstellar wind-jammers” and a “baby steamer sailing on children’s seas,” among other delightful prospects. Lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their Limbos. 
Father X occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the Bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. Running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. 
In Gait’s “Pink Rose” and “Stardust,” we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. Father X takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. He places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles, which is reflected in the painting. Children are disfigured, or missing eyes or arms and singing in “low mournful tones” so as not to disturb their parents. Music is “intense, equivalent to the sound created by Hildegard von Bingen (a 12th-century nun and composer). “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas”painting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
References to Mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. “All babies jump for Jesus” in the womb (or in “its sack of nibbling yoke”) writes Father X. Elizabeth’s child John “leapt for joy, just as his ancestor David did before the ark of the covenant,” he continues. 
Gait addresses the human embryo, finding Biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. Her “Abbey Target Beginning” has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually: “The first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread – the bread on fire with the Holy Spirit the same stage of development as the child in Mary’s womb when she arrived at her cousin Elizabeth’s house.” 
Post-abort guilt isn’t rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. Father X describes bats as whirling about “in circles at the pitiful sound the [aborted] children make” because they are tuned to such distressing signals. This contrasts with many parents who are “still stone deaf” to such mournful sounds. At another point, Father-X imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas”painting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
Father X elaborates on what Gait hints in her paintings: the injustice and evil of abortion. He cites a world built on slavery before Christ’s advent, and the works of such men as William Wilberforce and John Brown in furthering Christ’s gospel of justice and peace. All this is contrasted to abortion throughout. 
Ruminating on Gait’s “Palms of our Lord,” Father X claims “the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. “Palms” is murky, with a single, red hand print. “To look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the Tarot of Ruins,” he continues. 
“Suicide” advances this dark theme, where Gait and Father X criticize the death industry and it’s euphemistically named “clinics.” He takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings: “… a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart.” 
But all isn’t baleful and sad here. In “Cloud Children,” Father X muses on paper dolls in Gait’s paintings with this lovely thought: “Where children go … is a mystery. … Some say they take their daytime rest in Christ’s tomb in Jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled Star Ships.” 
“ Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas ” is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. Father X may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. Gait and Father X describe their efforts as a “silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those Phantoms of Sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion.” They hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. 
Judith Gait is a graduate of California College of Arts and Crafts and received a Masters at Oxford’s Ruskin School of Fine Drawing. Her work is in public and private collections in America and abroad. She is an American citizen, residing in Britain. Father X is an addictions counselor and writer in Great Britain, who prefers to remain anonymous.

10034,Ralph Lauren Stops Traffic - The New York Times,"On the penultimate day (and the final night) of New York Fashion Week, Ralph Lauren shut down a stretch of Madison Avenue and cast his lot decisively with the            crusaders, whose cause  —   immediate gratification to reflect digital reality  —   has upended the traditional women’s wear season. Three blocks away from the East 72nd Street limestone mansion commonly known as the Ralph Lauren store, a traffic sign warned motorists of “delays. ” At the corner of East 71st Street, pedestrians trapped behind barriers vented their ire at waiting police officers or whipped out their cellphones to snap photographs of the structure just beyond: a transparent atrium constructed from 75 glass panels on the concrete just in front of the shop. How high up in the city hierarchy did Mr. Lauren have to go to get the avenue closed? (Or at least half of it one lane was still open for traffic.) “To God,” he said. What followed was a declaration of faith: In populism for the 1 Percent (they deserve it, too, apparently) and the need for evolution. Select clients from around the world were invited to join the industry crowd, the Lauren family and assorted celebrities to perch on crisp cotton cushions atop   bleachers. The sidewalk was the runway, and the store the set. “You are changing the way you live and the way you want to shop, and we are changing with you and for you,” read a note placed on every seat. And there was some change on the runway. Though not too much. Eschewing his usual tripartite themes, Mr. Lauren built a    collection  —   nominally Fall, Part 2, but effectively seasonless (can we all just forget the pointless meteorological nomenclature now?)  —   on the inspiration from an old Navajo blanket he had in his house, soignée city evening wear in fruity shades and Savile Row suiting. Stylized suede flowers, the kind normally seen on rodeo shirts, were embroidered up the sides of pinstripe trousers a   shirt was paired with a midi skirt dripping asymmetric tiers of silken fringe and a hot pink Kashmir goat chubby tossed atop a slithery matching halter and trousers. Some of the Western touches were a little   (Stetsons and silk charmeuse? ). But a sleeveless black column dress, the shoulders bordered in studded saddle leather that formed a harness at the back, and sporty tank sheaths covered in thousands  —   or, in the case of one gown, millions  —   of   dégradé   had the efficiency of true elegance. It waited for no   belt. Still, what happened   was even more striking. Mr. Lauren stepped out in a faded denim shirt and faded jeans to take his bow, and then swept his hand toward the store’s big picture windows. The gray curtains parted and a video of a rearing wild horse played, framing mannequins wearing some of the clothes that had just appeared on the runway. Then the store doors opened, and the guests were ushered inside. “What do we do now?” the actress Julianne Moore asked, looking at the waiters with trays of Champagne glasses standing in front of the handbag vitrines. The answer: You shop, of course. Still, not every designer thinks that’s the right answer. (Not the shopping part  —   every designer wants you to shop. The shopping immediately part.) At Boss Women, for example, the creative director Jason Wu is slowly inching his way toward the experiment, this season offering his runway bag  —   a slouchy, soft leather number  —   for immediate purchase. Not, however, the very good   rainbow of streamlined separates in primary colors it came with not the transparent slipdresses with pleated skirts and tanks slashed by broken geometries and hung on the hip, skinny trouser suits with luggage straps shirring the sleeves, or organza tuxedo shells embroidered with overlapping petals to form the shape of the continents as seen from outer space. But at the opposite extreme, Derek Lam is digging in and scaling back. “In this moment when everyone is talking about ‘what are the shows,’ I thought I would do something small,” he said at the first of a series of presentations in the Greenwich Hotel penthouse suite, in front of only about 20 people at a time. “That this would be my answer. ” His answer, to be fair, was actually found in the crisp white   midi skirts with big patch pockets paired with curving eyelet peasant blouses the   pleated trousers and perforated, papery picnic dresses and a   white tunic poured over black trousers. He said they were sparked by the life and favorite looks of Georgia O’Keeffe (we’re in a painterly moment, apparently) who returned to the same subjects again and again. It is true that Mr. Lam does the same  —   he loves a bit of simple American arcana  —   which can read as uninspired on a runway but has a whispery allure up close. He may be fighting a losing battle. But it’s also true that if you really want something, you should be willing to wait for it. Desire is the engine of fashion: If a dress is unforgettable, it should worm its way into your imagination until it becomes the solution to how you present yourself to the world. Waiting six months shouldn’t make a difference. Anticipation, as both Carly Simon and Heinz once told us, is a powerful thing. Almost as powerful as the ability to shut down a city street. But maybe not quite.",0
10035,Comment on 6 Steps to Becoming the Best Leader Possible by 6 Steps to Becoming the Best Leader Possible – Motivate3.com,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter What does it mean to be a leader? This is a question I have been asking myself repeatedly over the past few weeks. The 2016 presidential election is but a few weeks away and I am left feeling confused, disgusted, and outright angry at what has been demonstrated as leadership. If I am honest, I feel embarrassed to be a citizen of a country that is most certainly causing many eyes to roll and jokes to be made.   We are better than this. As I continue to grow, fall down, pick myself back up, and evolve as a leader, I am constantly exploring what the word means to me and how I can embody that meaning from a grounded and heart-centered place. I come back time and time again to the same process — a process that is not weighted or influenced by that which is outside of me, but rather by that which lives deep inside of me. It’s about self-inquiry, self-reflection, self-accountability, and self-responsibility. It’s a process that asks me to drop to my knees, to stretch, to get uncomfortable, to ask more of myself. It’s a process that in times like these, we uncompromisingly appoint ourselves to undergo because we have no choice but to stand firmly in our own leadership. Whether you are a butcher, baker, or a candlestick maker — you are a leader. And the world needs as many honest, honourable, and integrity-filled leaders as it can get right now. Here are my six strategies for stepping firmly into your own embodied leadership. I invite you to get comfy with a notebook, pen, and cup of warm tea and walk yourself through this process step-by-step. 1. Identify Your Value System What matters most to you? Where do you feel unwilling to compromise? Your integrity? Loyalty? Ambition? Transparency? Your values are the foundational parts of yourself that guide your behaviours, choices, and actions. When these are in alignment and you are living your values, you feel at peace inside of yourself. You are operating not from your head or your gut, but from your heart. You are discerning in your decisions and steadfast in your commitments. Not only does it feel good inside of yourself, it is overwhelmingly obvious to the outside world that you’ve got something groovy going on.   2. Acknowledge and Understand What Makes You, You I hope this step doesn’t scare you, because this one takes a little bit of work, as it is an ongoing unfolding process. Although many of us know parts of ourselves, we also have blind spots. Part of stepping into your leadership is to see and understand all of yourself: the good, the bad, and the ugly. For me, the most helpful resource I have found is the Enneagram . This highly evolved personality typing system helps you to better understand your strengths, your stressors, your fears, your areas for growth, and your opportunities to develop. Using this system, you can become clearer on who you are, while learning how other people operate in the world. This information can be unbelievably helpful when learning how to be mindful and aware as a leader. As an Enneagram Type 2, the Healer, I am well-versed in knowing that my superpower is my ability to be compassionate, empathetic, and helpful, but I also lose my power and can become insecure when I do not feel needed. This does not make me weak or invaluable as a leader, but rather pushes me to rise up and push my edges whenever I experience this feeling so that I can meet my own boundless potential. 3. Cultivate a Network of Mentors Want to know something crazy? You don’t know everything and you can’t do it all on your own. I know how disappointing this may sound, but let me tell you something: It’s a damn godsend! Not needing to know it all or have all of the answers gives you space to be vulnerable, approachable, real, and ever-changing. A network of mentors helps you to not feel alone when you are up against the wall and aren’t quite sure how to navigate your next steps. Over the past few years I have worked hard to create my network of mentors. Currently, my network consists of one spiritual mentor and two professional mentors. Oh, and I also have a therapist. That’s right, I have four older, wiser, more evolved humans in my life that I can regularly call upon when in need. And they aren’t my friends. I don’t call them to gab, or simply catch up. I call them when I need to get in deep and unpack some serious personal, professional, or spiritual shit. This wolf pack is a group of individuals who have been around the sun once or twice and take their role as a mentor seriously. If you are feeling lost or misguided in your leadership, I greatly encourage you to reach out to people who inspire you and are living and leading lives that you admire. Don’t be shy. Don’t hold back. Be willing to pay a bit of money for it. Be willing to be rejected. But most of all, be willing to ask. 4. Act from Authenticity A few months back I wrote an article about my 5 Tips on Being Genuine . It almost makes me laugh to think that we need to be reminded to be authentic in our actions. However, the truth is that we have become used to cropping our lives into a series of photographs, 140 characters, or neat blog entries and Facebook posts. We have become buttoned up, edited, and the image of perfection. So, let me show you my leadership by revealing some of my imperfections. I often have no idea what I’m doing. I felt sad for almost all of last week and I couldn’t totally put my finger on why or what to do other than get lots of sleep, exercise, and eat well. I have lots of little blonde hairs on my upper lip that I pluck when I remember. Sometimes I watch TV on my computer in bed. Other times I eat peanut butter toast and scrambled eggs for dinner when I feel too wiped out to cook. I’ve been called bossy. My boyfriend and I fight. I can get anxious when work is slow. Your Inbox Will Never Be The Same Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. Writing these words, I can feel my own power grow. I’m not hiding anything. I’m not putting on a face or trying to be put together; I’m just being human. And whenever I read or watch someone else show me their messiness, I feel their power and their leadership. Being human is sexy. Show the world what you’re working with. 5. Constantly Work on Your Communication Skills Let me repeat this one: CONSTANTLY WORK ON YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS. Communication is a basic life skill and your ability to communicate largely determines your happiness. When you communicate effectively, you make and keep friends. You are valued at work. Your family respects and trusts you. Your needs get met. When you communicate effectively, people listen and hear you, and you learn how to listen to and hear other people. This is when magic happens. Strong, compassionate communication is something that is learned; you’re not born with it. If you are looking for resources on how to better communicate, I highly recommend the books Messages: The Communication Skills Book by Matthew McKay, Martha Davis, and Patrick Fanning and Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life by Marshall B. Rosenberg. Additionally, be open to uncovering the underlying reasons of why you react or feel triggered (another blog post coming soon on that) by certain types of communication as well as receiving feedback from others on ways that you communicate well and areas for growth. 6. Commit Yourself to Lifelong Learning Whether you are a CEO at a company, a full-time parent, a caretaker, just starting out your career, or saving the world, you are a leader. And any truly great leader is always learning. Leaders are strengthening their strengths, finding opportunity in their obstacles, and discovering new ways to be the best versions of themselves. Whether it is a book, workshop, therapy session, class, or travel experience, commit yourself to a lifelong learning process and you will forever feel empowered in your leadership. We are currently witnessing a national crisis, where the proposed future leaders of our country are being caught in webs of lies, immoral behaviours, cruel words, disrespectful communication, and dishonourable action. I know it’s easy to sit here, pointing fingers and placing blame. Instead, I am asking you to rise up and embrace your own, unique, and powerful leadership so that we can all come together, one by one, and stand up for what we believe in. Truth. Peace. Integrity. Compassion. Equality. Loyalty. Honesty. And Love. If you are doing it right, you will feel like you are revealing too much.

10037,Deadly Berlin Christmas Market Episode Is Latest in Europe - The New York Times,"A truck driver barreled into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring scores more. The police believed it to be an attack, but the identity of any attackers and their motives were not immediately clear. It was the most recent deadly episode to shake Europe in the last two years. Many recent attacks have been linked to jihadists, and some to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. (The majority of terror attacks have been outside of Europe, primarily in Iraq and Syria.) While there have been several attacks in Germany, none have been  . France and Belgium have each seen violence on city streets and in nightclubs and busy transit hubs. In Britain, the most recent act of deadly political violence was by an   extremist. Here are some of the deadly attacks in Europe since 2015. The Attack on Charlie Hebdo Masked gunmen linked to Al Qaeda attacked the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo at the beginning of January 2015, killing 12 people, including the top editor, prominent cartoonists and police officers. The attackers, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, were killed by the police two days later northeast of Paris. Hostages at a Kosher Market in Paris Two days after the attack on Charlie Hebdo, an   attacker and his companion took hostages at a Kosher supermarket in Paris. They killed four people before the police stormed the building. The attacker, Amedy Coulibaly, was killed, and the second fled and has not been found. Mr. Coulibaly told French news media he “synchronized” the attack with the one on Charlie Hebdo. Terror and Mayhem Unleashed in Paris A team of Islamic State attackers rampaged through Paris in November 2015, killing at least 130 people and injuring hundreds more in a coordinated wave of explosions and gun violence that targeted busy sidewalks, bustling cafes and a packed concert hall. It was the worst terror attack in Europe in 11 years. Explosions in Brussels Bombs tore through an airport terminal and a subway station in Brussels in March 2016, killing at least 31 people and injuring scores more. The attackers were believed to be linked to the organizers of the Paris attacks, and the blasts in Brussels came a day after one of the people who organized the Paris attacks, Salah Abdeslam, was arrested there. British Lawmaker Opposed to ‘Brexit’ Is Gunned Down Jo Cox, a member of the British Parliament who advocated for Syrian refugees and campaigned against a British exit from the European Union, was assassinated in June 2016, days before the ‘Brexit’ referendum. Thomas Mair, a   extremist with a history of Nazi and white supremacist sympathies, was convicted of the killing last month. A Truck Kills Dozens in Nice A truck driver plowed into a crowd of spectators celebrating Bastille Day in the French city of Nice in July 2016, crashing into people for over a mile before police officers killed the driver. The attack killed 84 people and maimed and injured dozens more. The Islamic State claimed responsibility and the attacker was identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a Tunisian who immigrated to France in 2005. An Ax Attack on a Train Just days after the attack in Nice, a    Afghan refugee attacked passengers on a German train with an ax and a knife in the name of the Islamic State. He fled the train after injuring four people and attacked a fifth person outside the train before he was later killed by the police. A Suicide Bombing in Bavaria Days later, a    Syrian asylum seeker blew himself up outside a wine bar in southern Germany, wounding 15 people. The blast happened near a music festival attended by about 2, 000 people. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. Islamic State Attackers Kill a Priest in Church Two young men linked to the Islamic State burst into a church in Normandy during a Mass in July, slit the throat of an    priest, killing him, and took the assembled parishioners, including at least one nun, hostage. Police stormed the church and killed both attackers.",0
10038,Markets Do Not Want Trump,"Home | World | Markets Do Not Want Trump Markets Do Not Want Trump By Nostro 02/11/2016 10:57:45 
NEW YORK – USA – If you vote for Trump you vote for a future of serious financial upheaval, poverty, and destitution. 
We can see this in the market reaction to the recent Trump revival after Clinton’s FBI charade. 
In all certain terms markets across the globe will continue dropping and if you have any equity in your pension plans, you can kiss that goodbye too. 
Trump will bring heavy inflation to America, and the globe, where prices of consumer goods will sky rocket. With heavy inflation and low salary growth, there will be less money to pay your mortgage, and many will default on their payments. 
Feeding your family will be a hard task, as the supermarkets raise their prices to never before seen levels. How about paying $14 for a loaf of bread or $23 for some rice. 
With the equity markets tanking, the dollar (DXY) will fall to 23 in a matter of days rendering it useless to pay off even a portion of America’s vast deficit. China is already dumping their dollar reserves. 
Trump will be forced to cut welfare payments to all dependants citing no cash, but having the welfare bill cut will cause mass rioting amongst those who depend on EBT for food. 
Medical insurance, which is already skyrocketing in price will increase by over 400% when Trump tries to rearrange the insurance industry. This will mean only the very rich, like Trump, will be able to afford health care and the rest of the populace will be left in the dirt. 
Donald Trump is only doing this for his ego, he does not care for the poor. According to Trump the poor should all be mowed down by bulldozers and erased from America. He will only cater for the very rich, not the average American. 
Martial Law 
With extreme poverty, there will be civil unrest leading to civil war as some states will seek to secede from the union. Trump will engage the military to quash any civil unrest, however this will be a catalyst for even more unrest. 
It is for the sake of you and your family that you do not vote for Trump, he will destroy America from the inside out. He will send your sons and daughters to fight in the Middle East when he brings in the military draft. 
There is no going back, once you vote that is it. You will deal yourself and your family a death upon death, a misery so great that you will wish you had not been tricked by his lies, and he is a liar, a business man with many tricks to fool others so he can win through trickery. 
The Daily Squib has accurately predicted many future events and we stand by our word. This is our seal of approval, as we have already proven many accurate prophesies that have come to light many years before the actual event. 
If you want to die, if you want your children dead, if you want your grandchildren dead, then vote for Donald Trump. Share on :",0
10039,Lifting of Travel Ban Sets Off Rush to Reach U.S. - The New York Times,"At a sweltering refugee camp on the   border, dozens of Somalis who had cleared all the final security and medical checks to enter the United States were told to prepare themselves for a flight to a new life. In Pittsburgh, a medical student from Iran finally got back to school after a chaotic journey that left him sleeping on a chair for four days. Inside Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport in New York, a    boy sprinted across the arrivals hall to embrace a family friend who had finally made it back to the United States after being marooned for a week in his home country, Sudan. With the door open again for travelers and refugees who had been excluded by President Trump’s order on immigration, the race to reach the United States accelerated on Sunday among waves of people fearing the opportunity might be fleeting. The rush inundated some domestic and international airports, reunited loved ones and friends, and prompted another round of criticism from Mr. Trump that national security was being endangered by court orders that blocked his tight border policy from taking effect. Mr. Trump and his aides have suggested that terrorists and others who wish to do harm to the United States could arrive through normal immigration channels and that the administration needs time to tighten its vetting procedures. Those travelers now being admitted to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations singled out for a temporary ban by Mr. Trump had already been granted visas after screening. Refugees from those countries and elsewhere who were rushing to reach the United States had likewise already been vetted, even more extensively, in a process that involves dozens of checks and can take more than two years. But it was unclear whether a court order blocking Mr. Trump’s policy from taking effect, issued by a federal judge in Seattle, would remain in place for long, creating a sense of urgency among those trying to reach the United States. The back and forth had sown confusion, anxiety, fear and disbelief, but the court order created “a temporary window that we wish to take advantage of,” said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental agency that facilitates refugee resettlement. “Our staff are being told to move like crazy. ” Families and immigration advocacy groups were buoyed twice over the weekend  —   first when the Seattle judge temporarily blocked the executive order, and again when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco denied the government’s attempt to gain an emergency stay. But a mood of uncertainty persisted after a week in which thousands of travelers bound for the United States were halted in transit and turned away at airports, and courts across the country issued conflicting rulings over whether and how the executive order should be carried out. Mr. Trump reacted angrily on Sunday. In a Twitter post, he seemed to give immigration lawyers and advocates reason to fear that the country may not remain open for long to refugees, or to visa holders from the seven nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!” he wrote. Mr. Doyle said that between Monday and Feb. 17, about 2, 000 refugees would be rebooked on flights to the United States. Those who were expected to leave first had moved out of their apartments or refugee camps, sold their belongings and turned in their food ration cards. In Kenya, dozens of Somalis who had cleared all the final security and medical checks to enter the United States were waiting on Sunday in the refugee camp, where they were told that they might be able to travel in the next few days. But they were no longer sure who  —   or what  —   to believe. “I feel completely ruined,” said Ahmed Hassan, a Somali refugee heading for Rhode Island. In the past few weeks, Mr. Hassan was bused out of the camp sent to a transit center in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, several hundred miles away given travel documents told he was about to fly to America told he was not about to fly to America bused back to the camp and then told he might actually fly to America after all. He boarded a bus in Nairobi to return to the camp just hours before the federal judge lifted the travel ban. Mr. Hassan had sold his home and feared that he could be targeted as an American sympathizer by the Islamist and   militants known to move in and out of the camps. He had arrived back at the refugee camp on Saturday afternoon, retreated from the crowds shouting questions at him and hid inside a room. On the floor of Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport, Wael Izzeldin, 6, clutched a green marker as he wrote a welcome sign for his father’s best friend, Dr. Kamal Fadlalla. Dr. Fadlalla is a   resident at Interfaith Medical Center in   Brooklyn, and had been on vacation visiting his mother in Sudan, his first time home in three years. When Dr. Fadlalla appeared, the boy went running across the arrivals hall, leapt and wrapped himself around the doctor, crushing the tiny sign. Dr. Fadlalla was ebullient but fatigued. Though he holds a visa for people in specialty professions, he had been turned away at the airport, and spent a week marooned in Sudan. Around him, members of his union, Committee of Interns and Residents, wearing white lab coats, cheered. “I’m glad justice won,” he said, adding that he was happy to return to his family and patients. “I need to get back to my work. ” Across the country on Sunday, the nongovernmental agencies that place refugees into homes and help them find jobs were gearing up to resettle as many as possible, while recovering from the whiplash of last week. Before Friday, their work had begun to trickle off, as they could resettle only refugees who were already in transit when the president’s order was signed. They had been preparing for their activities to come to a halt for four months in accordance with the order. Leslie Aizenman, of Jewish Family and Children’s Services, a resettlement agency in Pittsburgh, had already put back on the market an apartment prepared for a family from Homs, Syria, who had been scheduled to arrive in the United States on Tuesday. The State Department canceled their trip last week, and Ms. Aizenman was unsure when it would be rescheduled. Her staff had already returned the backpacks filled with school supplies and stuffed animals they had prepared for the family’s    son and    daughter. They had also told another Syrian family in Pittsburgh, who had volunteered to make a warm meal to welcome their new neighbors, not to bother. Because of the   change, Ms. Aizenman said that refugee family may have to live briefly in temporary housing, and settle for a restaurant meal rather than something homemade. “We had stopped the process, but no matter what, we’ll accommodate them when they get here,” she said. An interim ruling on whether the executive order may be enforced is likely to come quickly from the appeals court. But the ultimate decision on whether the order is lawful will take much longer, and is likely to come from the Supreme Court. That means people seeking to travel or settle here may be in limbo until the case is finally resolved. Over the weekend, lawyers were telling clients to take advantage of the precarious window. “We are encouraging people to come in as soon as possible,” said Mary McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center, a   organization that provides legal services and advocacy to immigrants. “If you need to be back in this country, you should do it now. ” Ms. McCarthy said her organization had been in regular contact throughout the weekend with a network of roughly 1, 500 lawyers who had volunteered to help travelers pro bono. They were just some of the lawyers stationed in shifts at airports across the country, observing customs officials to ensure that the Seattle judge’s ruling was being carried out. “We are being very vigilant,” she said.",0
10040,"Attorney Makes No Bones About Popeyes Chicken Lawsuit Gulfport, MS","Friday, 4 November 2016 There Are Bones Beneath That Meat 
A Gulfport Mississippi attorney who said he choked on the bones in Popeyes' fried chicken last year believes a warning label placed on the bones beneath the meat could have prevented all his anxiety, pain and suffering. Now he's suing to get warning labels affixed to all Popeye's chicken bones and monetary compensation for himself. 
Attorney Pawl Newton, said he got the idea for the lawsuit when he drove through the drive-thru in Gulfport in November 2015. 
According to the lawsuit filed this week, Newton bought one chicken breast. He was given salt and pepper. Newton then drove to his nearby lair and started eating. 
""Because Newton's order did not include warning labels on the bones beneath the layers of meat, plaintiff Newton held a chicken breast in his hands and tore off pieces of meat thereof with his canines, eating them until reaching the bones which he then also ate since there were no labels on the bones warning him not to eat them as well,"" the lawsuit states. 
That's when Newton then started to choke on a piece of the chicken bone. The lawsuit said he had to undergo emergency surgery at Memorial Hospital to remove it and some gall from his throat. 
Newton is suing Popeyes and the parking lot paving company which facilitated his vehicle entry to the drive-through to pay for all his medical expenses, compensate him for his pain and suffering, and award punitive damages. He also wants all future Popeyes' chicken bones to be labeled 'Not For Human Consumption' so customers will be able to safely eat their chicken again."" 
""If you choke on your chicken and you have to get the chicken removed from your throat, it's not because Popeyes didn't apply a warning label to the bones,"" former employee Cory Tokes said. ""Maybe you should have sense enough to stop eating when you get to the bones. Nobody eats chicken bones. What a dumbshyster."" 
Jacque Tokes is equally perplexed about the suit. 
""Commonsense tells us about how much to bite and not to put bones in our mouths to keep us from choking on our chicken or we would all be dead already,"" added Stokes. 
A Popeye's press release says that its legal team has initiated legal actions against the Missippi Bar Association for giving Newton a law/liquor license and against Newton's mother's birth control provider. Make Winston Smith's  ",0
10041,U.S. Must Dig Deep to Stop Argentina’s Lionel Messi - The New York Times,"HOUSTON  —   Venezuela had a plan. It was a tactical approach, designed specifically to take Lionel Messi and the other dangerous Argentine attackers out of the game by applying forward pressure and forcing Argentina to make long, hopeful passes. And it worked for about seven minutes. But in the eighth minute, Messi conjured the kind of technical genius that compels most observers to call him the best soccer player in the world, artfully lifting a perfect pass about 15 yards in to Gonzalo Higuaín. With one striking touch, Higuaín converted it into a goal, the first in Argentina’s   victory on Saturday in a Copa América Centenario quarterfinal. In that decisive moment, like so many others experienced by opponents hoping to stop Messi, all of Venezuela’s carefully conceived defensive tactics were laid to waste. “They have that stroke of genius that changes all your schemes,” Venezuela Coach Rafael Dudamel said. “They had an incredible pass from Messi, and they scored. ” Messi has frequently had brilliant strokes like that one, and now it is the United States’ turn to try to find a way to suppress them. The United States earned a spot in Tuesday’s Copa América semifinal here at NRG Stadium by beating Ecuador, but the dubious prize awaiting them is Messi, Argentina’s mesmerizing,    dribbling, passing and shooting virtuoso. “This is special,” United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. “Absolutely, it’s special to play against these type of players. When you get the opportunity to play against one of the biggest players in the world, you want to raise your game you want to enjoy it. ” The United States has had few chances to play a meaningful game against a star of Messi’s caliber who also played on such a quality team. (FIFA has Argentina ranked No. 1 in the world.) Tuesday’s match will be the rough equivalent of taking on Pelé’s Brazil in 1970 or Ferenc Puskas’s Hungary in 1954 or the team led by that other Argentine soccer genius, Diego Maradona, in 1986. As Klinsmann noted, the United States was seconds from beating Portugal at the 2014 World Cup until Cristiano Ronaldo  —   who has at times been considered Messi’s equal  —   provided a gorgeous cross that enabled Portugal to tie the game. Over the years, the United States has faced the likes of England’s Wayne Rooney at the 2010 World Cup, Brazil’s Ronaldinho at the 1999 Confederations Cup and Italy’s Paolo Maldini, one of the best left backs in history, at the 1990 World Cup, as well as Brazil’s duo of Bebeto and Romário and Romania’s Gheorghe Hagi, some of the top players of their era, at the 1994 World Cup. At the 1934 World Cup, the United States lost by   to Italy, and one of the goals was scored by Giuseppe Meazza, whom some historians consider the best player Italy has produced. At the 1998 World Cup, Klinsmann scored against the United States toward the end of his prolific career as one of the most dangerous attackers for the world champions West Germany and Germany. But in recent memory, there is nothing that quite resembles Tuesday’s challenge. Two years ago Ronaldo did not enjoy the kind of team support from Portugal that Messi does now with Javier Mascherano, Ángel Di María (when healthy) Sergio Agüero and particularly Higuaín, Argentina’s penetrating No. 9, who scored twice against Venezuela. Spend too much time focusing on either Messi or Higuaín, and the other could act decisively. “We have two strikers who are really exceptional,” Gerardo Martino, Argentina’s coach, said after Saturday’s match. “I cannot repeat it enough I really feel this. People in Argentina have a hard time accepting the quality of soccer players that we have. We have two No. 9s, and we proceed with what we feel is best. ” Martino watched Venezuela hack down Messi several times in the quarterfinal game and said the United States would certainly use every possible means to stop him. “I just hope that every possible way is a legal way,” he said at a news conference Monday. As superb as Messi is, some believe that he will not have achieved his true potential until he wins a major trophy for Argentina, just as he has numerous times for the club team Barcelona. But after tying Gabriel Batistuta’s record of 54 international goals for Argentina on Saturday, Messi said he felt no pressure. “I’m always going to be in there,” Messi said. “I’m very calm. ” In Maradona’s time, Argentina also had strong supporting players like Claudio Caniggia, Jorge Valdano, Jorge Burruchaga and later Batistuta. But like Messi, Maradona was the team’s clear supremo. When the United States beat Argentina,   at the 1995 Copa América, Maradona was no longer playing for his country. But Klinsmann had the chance to play against Maradona several times. In the 1990 World Cup, West Germany beat Maradona’s Argentina,   in a dismal final in Rome. “You are talking about two wonderful players, the best in the world in their time,” Klinsmann said, referring to Maradona and Messi. “It’s now Messi’s time, and when I had the opportunity to play many games against Maradona, it was Maradona’s time. We all admire these players. But there are also ways to stop them. I am not the type of person who pulls out old stories and tells the players how we did it. That’s not me, but there are ways to play against these wonderful players. ” Klinsmann showed his team video scouting reports of Messi and Argentina and said his players needed to give 10 to 15 percent more in order to achieve an upset Tuesday. But the Argentines are not infallible, he added. They have not won a major tournament in over 20 years, and Messi’s team has come up short twice in the last two years. Germany beat La Albiceleste, as Argentina is known, in the final of the 2014 World Cup, and Chile won in the final of last year’s Copa América. Both times, it took champions to beat Messi and Argentina. “You guys are probably worrying more about Messi than we are,” the United States’ captain, Michael Bradley, told reporters. “Very good player. That’s also probably an understatement. It’s still a soccer game with 11 of their guys against 11 of our guys. ”",0
10042,ICE Raids Shrivel Supply of Day Laborers at Home Depot,"Many Home Depots once featured several dozen day laborers nearby, but the supply is shriveling as the U. S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) may seek to deport up to 3 million illegal aliens that have criminal records. [Following a presidential executive order, “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” issued on January 25, ICE raids across the United States detained 680 high priority individuals for deportation, with about 161 detained in California, according to the Washinton Examiner.  But that works out to just o. 07 percent of the 950, 062   aliens with deportation orders on the list as of May 21, 2016. According to updated testimony on May 19 to the Senate Judiciary Committee of testimony by Thomas D. Homan, acting ICE director, removals of illegal aliens dropped by 41 percent, from 409, 849 during the 2012 election year, to 240, 255 during the 2016 election year. Of the 99. 3 percent of interior removals, 92 percent were priority convicted criminals, and 7. 3 percent were threats to national security, public safety, and border security. Holman told Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) that although there are 3 million illegal immigrants with criminal records in addition to their illegal status, ICE only has detained 11, 006 individuals. When asked by Grassley why there were so few in custody, Homan’s answered: “Individuals on ICE’s   docket with final orders of removal are released under conditions designed to ensure their compliance with their immigration obligations. ” With virtually no general purpose interior removals in the last couple of years, the latest Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends survey found that were an estimated 11. 1 million illegal aliens in the U. S. in 2014, down from 12. 2 million in 2007. About 72 percent of illegal aliens are employed, equal to about 5 percent of the entire U. S. workforce. About 33 percent held service jobs such as janitor, child care worker or cook, twice the 17 percent share of U. S.  workers 15 percent hold construction jobs, triple the share of U. S.  workers who hold that type of employment and 13 percent are employed in manufacturing jobs, compared to 10 percent of U. S.  workers. Despite the impression that a high percentage work in agriculture, only 5 percent of illegal aliens are employed in agriculture, versus 2 percent of U. S.  workers.",0

10044,Let the Lessee Beware: Car Leases Can Be the Most Binding of Contracts - The New York Times,"WHEN Allie Mangel learned that she was losing some of her vision because of a rare condition called Susac’s Syndrome, the last thing on her mind was figuring out how to make her car lease payments. After her doctor notified the California Department of Motor Vehicles last November that she should not be allowed to drive, and her license was subsequently suspended, leasing a Ford Edge at $347 a month became an unnecessary expense. Or so she thought. Ms. Mangel, 24, a youth programming coordinator in San Diego, discovered that even though she was not legally allowed to drive, she was still legally obligated to make her lease payments. “Ford Credit and the dealer told me that the only way I could get out of the lease was to die or join the military,” Ms. Mangel said. She had learned the hard way what many people may not realize, even though leasing has become an increasingly common and seemingly affordable alternative to buying a car. A car lease agreement is like any other contract. And unless specific reasons are stated in the agreement allowing the lessee to end the lease, the signer must make the payments, whether one can drive or not. After her diagnosis, Ms. Mangel was in the hospital for three weeks and out of work for a total of five, and running short of money. “I was a mess,” Ms. Mangel recalled. “I was going through all these things and Ford would not budge. I was in tears and didn’t know what to do. ” Ms. Mangel had signed a lease agreement spelling out the terms of the contract, and ending the lease early without penalty was not covered. The rules are the rules, according to Margaret Mellott, a spokeswoman for Ford Motor Credit. “All Ford Credit lease agreements state very clearly the obligations when one turns in a car before the end of a lease agreement,” Ms. Mellott said. “I’m not aware of any exceptions being made. ” Ford Credit and most other vehicle leasing companies do give lessees options for breaking the contract. But the terms can be severe. Ms. Mangel could have returned the vehicle to the dealer, and then paid the difference between the amount owed on her payments and the value of the car if sold at auction. In her case, that would have been an unbearable burden: about $15, 000. Or she could have tried to sell her lease to a third party through a   company. But with membership and lease transfer fees, that would have also cost her more than she could afford. “A friend tried to do that,’’ she said, “and he received no interest after it being listed for weeks. ” Some lessors may demand payment of all the remaining payments, plus penalties. If the lessee decides simply to walk away from the lease and have the vehicle repossessed, the person’s credit rating will suffer. Leasing a vehicle, of course, is not the same as purchasing one. Rather, it’s more akin to renting an apartment as with any rental, one never actually owns the property. Under a vehicle lease, the lessee agrees to make payments for a fixed number of years. Those payments equal the difference between the   value of the car when first leased and its predicted residual wholesale value at the end of the lease, plus interest. Because the entire value of the car is not being financed, the payments are less on a monthly basis than they would be if the vehicle were purchased over the same period. That is a main reason that leasing is so popular: It lets consumers drive cars that are more expensive than those they might be able to afford to buy. When the vehicle is returned at the end of the lease, the only additional costs are those incurred if the vehicle was driven more than the maximum   mileage, any amount due for damage beyond normal wear and tear, and any   fees. The lessee may also decide to purchase the vehicle, for that contracted residual value. One reason car leases tend to be so inflexible is that the deal is a   contract: The dealer signs the lease with the customer, and then assigns the contract to a leasing company. Leases can be voided if the original agreement was made under untruthful conditions  —   if the lessee is a minor, for example, or does not possess a valid driver’s license. In those cases, the leasing company would not want to be part of a fraudulent contract. “This is not as rare as one would think  —   people do fraudulent deals all the time,” said Randall McCathren, managing director of the Association of Consumer Vehicle Lessors, a trade group. In addition, if the lease terms or the vehicle was misrepresented, the lessee can try to void the lease under each state’s laws on unfair and deceptive acts and practices, Mr. McCathren said. But in a legally struck deal, even death will not necessarily free one from a lease obligation. Typically, the dead person’s estate becomes liable for the obligation, although some car finance companies will make exceptions. Still, it never hurts to try to seek concessions. “It absolutely pays to contact the leaseholder and try to work out some consideration,” Mr. McCathren said. He noted that leasing companies will typically defer payments if a lessee is in the hospital for a limited period of time. Only one action will guarantee that someone is able to break any company’s vehicle lease. Under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a person who has enlisted in the armed services and is to be assigned to a location outside the continental United States for more than six months can terminate a vehicle lease without penalty. But for those who are not joining the military, the best bet for getting out of a vehicle lease is to try to sell it to a third party. Companies like Leasetrader. com and Swapalease. com act as brokers, and for a fee will try to match lease sellers and buyers. But the manufacturers of some vehicles, including Land Rovers leased through Land Rover Financial Group, and Volvos leased through Volvo Car Financial Services, do not allow transfer of leases. Swapalease maintains a list of vehicle manufacturers’ leasing policies  on its website. Some leasing companies, including Ford Motor Credit and   Financial Services, will allow a lease obligation to be forgiven upon the death of the lessee. Under Mercedes’s Customer Bereavement Program, when the company learns of the death of a lessee, it sends a condolence letter to the family, as well as a leather journal and pen to help it manage the estate’s obligations. If the Mercedes lease account is current, the family can choose to return the vehicle within 10 days and owe nothing further. If the family decides to keep leasing the vehicle and the new lessee meets credit criteria, no transfer fee is charged. Ford Motor Credit’s Peace of Mind program allows the family of a deceased lessee, with a death certificate, to return the vehicle within 60 days of the death, and the lease obligation will be excused. Notifying the company of the death also prevents any company collection activity over the next several weeks. Ms. Mangel, as things turned out, was more fortunate than she had expected. Her vision stabilized a few months after she lost her license, and she was able to drive again. In the interim, her father covered the lease payments. But the terms and conditions of her lease made her realize that while the payments may be lower, leasing a vehicle can be more onerous than buying one. “I don’t want to lease again, ever,” Ms. Mangel said.",0
10045,Wayne Allen Root “It’s Trump or it’s the End of America” | Follow Trump,"
By Wayne Allen Root – Review Journal 
The election is Tuesday. So it’s time to make my final case for Donald J. Trump. My case is pretty simple — it’s Trump or it’s the end of America. 
I was raised as a middle-class kid in the greatest country in world history. A country built around mobility, opportunity and economic freedom. A country that allowed this son of a butcher to become a successful business owner, media personality, best-selling author and TV star and producer. Only in America. 
I was taught by my wonderful, patriotic, true red, white and blue, salt-of-the-earth, American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are: 
Faith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, the Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. 
Well don’t look now. But everything from that list above … everything we believe in … everything that made America great … has been under full-scale assault for eight long years — from multiple directions. And Hillary is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama’s third term. 
The truth is we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love is gone. Forever. 
Because if Trump doesn’t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great. 
Foreigners come here not out of a love for America, but for a love of the cradle-to-grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote Democrat forever more to keep the welfare checks coming. That’s Hillary’s plan. 
Don’t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks and then train them to vote Democrat to keep the handouts coming. 
It worked! 
That was the experiment. Now Democrats are onto Plan B — to turn the rest of America into California. 
Hillary will open the borders and tie the hands of border agents in order to flood the country with millions of new illegals. Hillary will legalize the 12 million to 15 million or so already here — and give them the right to vote. 
Hillary will also enthusiastically import millions of Muslim refugees who have no love for America, capitalism, the Constitution, or certainly Judeo-Christian values. Some will become terrorists, almost all will require cradle-to-grave welfare. 
Then it’s over for America. 
So vote. Drag your friends to the polls. Make phone calls to your entire address book. Leave no stone unturned. 
Think of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Think of open borders. 
Think of your children’s and grandchildren’s future. 
Then vote for Trump like it’s … Trump, or the end of America. 
Because it is.

10046,How Clinton Campaign Gamed Super PAC Regulations,"Memos prepared by legal counsel for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign reveal how the campaign developed workarounds so it could coordinate with a network of pro-Clinton super political action committees or Super PACs. The memos were explicitly developed to ensure regulators at the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would not detect any signs of unethical practices.
While the workarounds may not necessarily be illegal as a result of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, they clearly undermine campaign finance law, and for those concerned about the influence of money in politics, the policies developed show how candidates can easily game the system.
The documents, produced by Marc Elias of Perkins Coie LLP, were attached to emails from the Clinton campaign, which were published by WikiLeaks. They were drafted on April 1, 2015, before Clinton officially launched her presidential campaign.
Perkins Coie recommended , “Secretary Clinton and her agents to make a hard solicitation for $5,000,” when discussing any Super PAC with prospective donors. Super PACs and their personnel would be free to “follow up with the donor—that day or at any other time of their choosing – to ask for additional funds, without any participation by Secretary Clinton or her agents.”
The campaign also asked for a procedure that would permit Clinton and anyone working for her to “discuss Super PACs with prospective donors without making a solicitation for money.” But the law firm the campaign hired advised against this approach and noted there was a “legally prescribed way for the Secretary and her agents to attend Super PAC fundraising events.”
In this “alternative approach,” Clinton and “her agents” could appear at fundraising events and openly discuss the “political objectives” of the Super PAC. Clinton and anyone representing the campaign would be “featured speakers” or “special guests.” They would not directly solicit contributions for the Super PAC. They would not publicize fundraising events.
“To avoid any risk that the statement made by the Secretary or her agents would be construed as a solicitation, a notice should be prominently displayed at the entrance to the event or a card placed on every table,” Elias advised.
The developed disclaimer read:
Solicitations by federal candidates and officeholders are limited by federal law. Any federal candidates or officeholders speaking tonight will not be soliciting donations, or will be soliciting only donations of up to $5000 from individuals and multi-candidate political committees. They will not be soliciting donations of any amount from corporations, labor organizations, foreign nationals, federal contractors, or national banks.
In a separate memo, “ Super PACs ,” Elias contended the mere fact that a disclaimer was displayed made it possible for Clinton to “make a general request for funds without reference to any dollar amount or source.”
“While the Secretary does not have to repeat this disclaimer in one-on-one conversations with event guests, the Secretary may not encourage them to disregard the notice nor may the Secretary ever ask for contributions in excess of the applicable limit or from prohibited sources.”
This way, if a donor who attended a fundraising event donated far more than $5,000, the act could not be directly connected to the remarks of Clinton, even though that fundraising event may have played a critical role in that donor’s decision to support Clinton substantially.
Despite the historical nature of meetings between potential donors and presidential candidates, Elias maintained the campaign could avoid scrutiny by insisting contributions were not expected as a “condition” or “appropriate response” to the “opportunity to meet with the Secretary or her agents for this political discussion.”
It would be made clear there was no “expectation whatsoever by the Secretary or her agents that the donor make a contribution of any amount to the PAC” or that the meeting was a “fundraising meeting organized to support the fundraising objectives of the PAC.”
Through this arrangement, influential and wealthy people, with or without ties to corporations, might engage in the same actions that they would if Clinton directly solicited contributions at these fundraisers or meetings. The culture of electoral politics would lead such individuals to recognize these interactions as a means to convince them to make contributions. They know the sensitivity around making certain a candidate they support does not draw attention from regulators. But because Clinton did not say words, which explicitly represent a request for funds, this is supposed to be considered acceptable.
In the “Super PACs” memo, Elias contended Clinton and “her agents” will inevitably “find themselves talking to prospective donors about Super PACs. The conversation might be initiated by the Secretary or her agents. Or, more likely, it might be initiated by the prospective donor.”
“Common questions include, ‘Secretary, the Super PAC has asked for my support. Should I contribute?” or ‘I want to give a million dollars to support your campaign—to which organization should I write my check?’” Elias outlines. “There will be hundreds of variants. In these types of interactions, it is not reasonable to expect the Secretary or her agents to make snap-determinations about whether their statements of political support for a Super PAC amount to a solicitation or direction of funds in the context of the particular conversation.”
“Accordingly, our strong recommendation is that the Secretary and her agents make a hard ask for $5,000 or less for the Super PAC in any conversation with a donor in which the Super PAC is discussed,” Elias adds.
The memo further indicated, “The Secretary and her agents should not tell donors that someone from the PAC will be following up with them and should not ask donors to take a call from PAC personnel. Nonetheless, it is permissible for the Secretary and her agents to provide donors with contact information of a PAC representative, so that the donors can execute the $5,000 contribution or learn more information about the PAC if they choose to do so.”
Or, if the donor contacted the PAC representative, the PAC would now be able to solicit much more than a $5,000 contribution, even though that donor may have never contacted the PAC if they had not been introduced to Clinton.
The law firm additionally advised, “The Secretary and her agents may suggest particular donors to Super PAC personnel. Specifically, the Secretary and her agents may provide the names, contact information, and donor history (if any) of potential donors.”
“A Super PAC soliciting funds outside of federal limits should not tell the donor that the Secretary or her agents provided the PAC with the donor’s name and contact information,” according to the memo.
“To reduce the risk of impermissible coordination, it would be prudent for the Super PAC to place a firewall between its fundraising personnel and its ‘creative’ personnel (e.g. those involved in the creation, production, or distribution of communications and in the strategic discussions informing such communications),” Elias recommended. “And, likewise, the campaign ought to designate a handful of fundraising staff and consultants to liaise with the Super PAC’s fundraising personnel.”
“Beyond this small handful of fundraising staff, there is no need for the Secretary or her agents to interact with Super PAC personnel except for when they are appearing as ‘special guests’ at a Super PAC event.”
It is all a rather elaborate scheme to ensure millions of dollars can be funneled into the coffers of a presidential campaign without having to be inhibited by campaign finance law supposedly in force to provide some regulation of the influence of money.
Perkins Coie explicitly set out to develop guidelines that would make it possible for individuals to wear “two hats,” as in raise money and also serve the campaign in some manner. However, Elias cautioned , “We may decide that some of our fundraising agents are too risky—either because we don’t trust them to follow these guidelines or because we do not think it is credible that they are raising in a capacity other than as a campaign agent—and tell Priorities that they cannot use them to raise.”
As previously reported by the Wall Street Journal, Elias sent a memo on interactions with the Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, on April 21, 2015. The memo was attached to an email published by WikiLeaks. It instructed the campaign to make sure the Clinton campaign never explicitly asked Priorities USA to raise “soft money,” which the Sunlight Foundation describes as “cash contributed to a party, candidate, or outside group without being subject to limits.”
The campaign could say, “Donor A works in financial services and has been a long-time contributor. I think she’d be willing to do six figures for Priorities,” but it could not say, “I want you to call Donor A and ask for $250,000.”
Priorities USA has raised over $175 million, according to the Sunlight Foundation, which is more than any Super PAC in history.
The Clinton campaign has faced criticism for its coordination with David Brock’s Correct the Record Super PAC. Brock believes the Super PAC can legally coordinate with the campaign because all the content it produces is posted for free online and exempt from the FEC’s ban on “coordinated communications.”
Sunlight Foundation points out, “Its whole apparently legal existence depends on it not making independent expenditures, because it openly coordinates with the Clinton campaign, which is otherwise forbidden for a super PAC.” Nonetheless, there has been no action by the FEC to shut down this coordination.
The FEC, according to the Washington Post, has yet to “open an investigation into alleged illegal super PAC coordination, closing 29 such complaints,” since 2010. Nevertheless, the campaign was concerned it may engage in activity that could spur an investigation if they were not careful and had Perkins Coie help them avoid any potential scandals.
The New York Times reported , “Democrats have built the largest and best-coordinated apparatus of outside groups operating in the 2016 presidential campaign,” and raised funds at a 2-to-1 rate when compared to Donald Trump.
“There’s no question that we need to make Washington work much better than it does today,” Clinton said in June. “And that means, in particular, getting unaccountable money out of our politics.” She added, “That’s why I’m so passionate about this issue, and I will fight hard to end the stranglehold that the wealthy and special interests have on so much of our government.”
Clinton has openly supported overturning the Citizens United decision. However, she has accepted countless amounts of “unaccountable money” in the 2016 presidential election, and her campaign has pioneered new methods for circumventing regulations against super PAC coordination in order to bring more money into her campaign.

10047,Can The Oligarchy Still Steal The Presidential Election?,"Leave a reply 
Paul Craig Roberts – The election was set up to be stolen from Trump. That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done. 
Clearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. 
With the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy’s own interests. 
Image as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. 
Moreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy’s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. 
In other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability. 
A Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. 
Moreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be “a target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we’ve got two years worth of material already lined up.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence. 
If you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? 
What happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs. 
Moreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: 
“Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” — even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. “Clinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.” 
Fox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for “solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on ‘Orgy Island,’ an estate on Epstein’s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.” http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html 
Some Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ 
This kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner’s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn’t look like a good decision. 
At this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America’s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States.

10048,Russia petrifies the New World Order and its agents—again,"By Jonas E. Alexis on October 31, 2016 Thomas Friedman of the New York Times: The plan for war in Iraq “was disseminated by a small group of 25 or 30 neoconservatives, almost all of them Jewish, almost all of them intellectuals..."" …by Jonas E. Alexis 

If you don’t think that the New World Order and its agents believe in conspiracy theory, or if you don’t think that they are actually scared of Russia and are looking for World War III, think again. Listen to Alex Lockie of Business Insider very carefully here: 
“Russia now challenges the West in virtually every arena possible, with cyberattacks, nuclear posturing, military invasions of Western-leaning countries, and the intimidation of US allies and neutral states.” [1] 
Throughout his article, Lockie didn’t even attempt to present rigorous evidence for this bold claim, and we know why. As we have seen over and over again, the New World Order and its agents do not believe in evidence at all. They do not believe in rigorous testing or logical argument, which is (or was) one of the main pillars of the West, going all the way back to Plato. 
The New World Order and its agents believe in manipulation, fabrications, hoaxes, and just plain lies. They have a history of doing just that: in World War I, in World War II, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Libya, and now in Syria. They still think that they can manipulate the masses at will. 
Lockie cites Jeffrey Lewis of Arms Control Wonk saying, 
“We’ve seen the failure of democratic institutions in Russia. It’s not the open and free society that we had hoped for at the end of the Cold War, and with that failure comes an insecurity on the part of Moscow’s leaders.” [2] 
We all know this is nonsense by now. If the West or at least America believes in democracy, we wouldn’t have the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because the vast majority of Americans didn’t want them. [3] But a small group of people known as the Neoconservatives decided to advance perpetual wars in the Middle East for Israel. [4] 
And if you think this is conspiracy stuff, take it from flaming Zionist Thomas Friedman of the New York Times . He told Haaretz way back in 2003 that that the plan for war in Iraq “was disseminated by a small group of 25 or 30 neoconservatives, almost all of them Jewish, almost all of them intellectuals (a partial list: Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, William Kristol, Elliott Abrams, Charles Krauthammer), people who are mutual friends and cultivate one another and are convinced that political ideas are a major driving force of history. “They believe that the right political idea entails a fusion of morality and force, human rights and grit. The philosophical underpinnings of the Washington neoconservatives are the writings of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Edmund Burke.” [ 5] 
Read those statements very carefully again. Just 25 or 30 Neoconservatives decided to send America, which had about 290 million people in 2003, to Iraq! And we all know what happened then. There are some people on the lunatic fringe who keep saying that the war was a success, but we can ignore those people because they do not know what they are talking about. YouTube - Veterans Today - 
Paul Wolfowitz was so aggressive about invading Iraq that one Republican lawmaker declared Wolfowitz “was like a parrot bringing [Iraq] up all the time. It was getting on the President’s nerves.” [6] After one such meeting in Washington, we are told that Colin Powell rolled his eyes, declaring, “Jeez, what a fixation about Iraq.” [7] 
Kenneth R. Weinstein of the Hudson Institute, a Neoconservative think tank, noted that in May of 2003, “we Neoconservatives were hailed as great visionaries.” But when the war turned out to be a disaster, “Now we are embattled, both within the conservative movement and in the battle over postwar planning.” [8] 
In any event, we know that Iraq was a disaster. But Alex Lockie does not want to talk about that because that would ruin his career or his ideological weltanschauung . If people know that it was only about 30 people who orchestrated the war in Iraq, then obviously they will realize that we are not living in a democracy at all—at least the kind of democracy that the regime itself is perpetuating. 
And if Lockie wants to talk about democracy, why are we still in Syria? Does he really think that the vast majority of Americans again support that war? What is his assessment on democracy? Does he really think that democracy can work without the moral law and political order? 
Lockie will never address these issues in a logical fashion. He writes, “Democracy provides countries like the US with a stable, established path for power changing hands.” [9] If you usually get your entertainment by reading nonsense and contradiction in the media, perhaps it is time for you to grab your munchies and read Locike’s statement again and chew on it a bit. 
Can Lockie really tell us that America has been really democratic even for the past seventy years or so? And why is Lockie silent about the so-called Syrian rebels killing civilians? [10] It has been reported that “Over 16,000 Syrians killed by US-backed rebels since February.” [11] Where is Lockie when you really need him? 
You see, Lockie hasn’t even made an attempt to answer those issues. Perhaps this is why he is a slave to his own political passion and appetite. Perhaps this is why he has implicitly or indirectly given allegiance to the New World Order.",0
10050,Planned Parenthood ‘Lamborghini’ Exec Haggles Over Price of Baby Parts,"A newly released video from Center for Medical Progress (CMP) shows the Planned Parenthood executive who became known for her comment, “I want a Lamborghini,” as payment for fetal tissue, haggling over the price of aborted baby body parts.[  The video depicts the first meeting between CMP journalists posing as biomedical company buyers of fetal tissue and Dr. Mary Gatter, the president of Planned Parenthood for America’s (PPFA) Medical Directors’ Council. Gatter is introduced to the buyers by Dr. Deborah Nucatola, PPFA’s Senior Director of Medical Services, who also appeared in a CMP undercover video eating lunch and drinking wine, as she allegedly discussed how to harvest fetal organs and body parts so as to maximize their transfer to biomedical researchers. In the current video, Gatter is introduced as the Medical Director of Planned Parenthood’s Pasadena, California, affiliate, and haggles with the undercover journalists over the price “per specimen” of fetal body parts. The undercover CMP journalist also discusses how the biomedical buyer will come into the Planned Parenthood clinic to handle the transfer of the fetal specimen. “We may have to make sure that your staff who are on site are credentialed, privileges, whatever, background checks and all that stuff,” Gatter says on the video, adding: “You know, you have to pay a little money for the use of the space. ” They then discuss the issue of “compensation,” with the undercover journalists suggesting “per specimen” payment and Gatter asking, “Per specimen? Like $75 a specimen?” When the journalist says, “What we’ve been quoting is $50 per specimen,” Gatter counters that “$50 is on the low end. $50 was like 12 years ago. ” The undercover journalist explains that they like to pay “per specimen” because “that way we’re not paying for material we can’t use. ” “But you would show up to do this?” Gatter asks. “You would send somebody?” The undercover journalist agrees, “Oh exactly, we would send a tech. Yeah, we would send a tech in. ” After mentioning a “lovely tech” named Heather from the biomedical firm Novogenix who worked at the Planned Parenthood Los Angeles clinic, Gatter eventually ends the conversation by saying, “Yeah, I’d be willing  —   give me a call. ” Earlier in the video, Gatter asks, “What kind of volume do you need, and what gestational ages?” The undercover journalist answers that “most of the requests are 16 weeks and above. ” Federal law permits reimbursement for specified costs in a fetal organ or tissue donation, but prohibits the purchase and sale of the organs and tissues themselves (42 U. S. C.  ). “The fact that [biomedical companies] Novogenix, StemExpress, and Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) stationed their own workers inside Planned Parenthood abortion clinics to perform the harvesting, packaging, and transport of aborted baby body parts demonstrates that Planned Parenthood had no reimbursable costs under the law,” says CMP project lead David Daleiden. “The   sums that Planned Parenthood charged these businesses for baby parts are criminal trafficking and profiteering in fetal body parts. ” Gatter was previously the medical director of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, before taking the same position at the chain’s Pasadena affiliate. Later, she was elected president of PPFA’s Medical Directors’ Council. While still at her post in the Los Angeles affiliate, Gatter oversaw its partnership with Novogenix Laboratories, LLC, a local   fetal organ and tissue harvesting company. “I did it in LA, I’m committed to it, I think it’s a great idea,” says Gatter to the undercover journalists posing as the buyers. The final report of the House Select Panel on Infant Lives addresses the pricing of fetal tissue: On April 20, 2016, the Panel held a hearing on The Pricing of Fetal Tissue. During the hearing, the Panel examined documents revealing that abortion clinics and Tissue Procurement Businesses (TPBs) may have violated federal law by the payments they collected from the sale of fetal tissue. At the core of the Panel’s investigation is a federal statute, 42 U. S. C. §   which prohibits the transfer of any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. The statute states that reasonable costs include transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage —  none of which it appears the abortion clinics did. Documents also show that payments made by the customer to the procurement business appear to exceed the costs incurred on the procurement business by a factor of 300 to 400 percent. As CMP notes, contracts and invoices show that biomedical companies Novogenix, StemExpress, and ABR “all made monthly payments to Planned Parenthood based on the number of resalable fetal specimens the wholesalers’ workers could harvest inside the abortion clinics. ” “Planned Parenthood told Congressional investigators it kept no contemporaneous records of actual costs for reimbursement under the law,” adds CMP, continuing: The Novogenix contract promises Planned Parenthood Los Angeles $45 “per donated specimen. ” Planned Parenthood Los Angeles does over 15, 000 abortions every year, but has never publicly admitted how much money they received total under their contract with Novogenix. In December 2016, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Select Investigative Panel both referred Planned Parenthood Los Angeles and Novogenix to the FBI and U. S. Department of Justice for further investigation and criminal prosecution. “The U. S. Department of Justice should take heed of the congressional investigations’ criminal referrals and prosecute Planned Parenthood to the full extent of the law,” urges Daleiden, “and taxpayers must stop being forced to subsidize Planned Parenthood’s criminal abortion empire. ”",0

If he once again gives Hillary Clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes, he then faces a mutiny inside the FBI which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media. FBI agents under Comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames Agents inside the FBI, in other words, refuse to allow James Comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the ""Clinton crime family."" Via the Daily Mail UK : James Comey's decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. This dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the Oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through James Comey's reputation, as he is the FBI official who reportedly ordered the execution of Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, whose suspected execution by FBI agents was caught on tape .Because the Oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury, it means FBI head James Comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man .Under Comey -- and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the FBI -- Comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent Americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free. For many FBI agents who have spent their entire careers serving the FBI as honest, dedicated federal agents, the thought of allowing James Comey to single-handedly commit political arson and burn down the FBI's hard-won reputation is just too much to bear.Resignations are beginning to pile up on Comey's desk as livid FBI agents head for the exits...Via the Daily Mail: ""The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn't recommend an indictment against Hillary,"" said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades... [Comey] told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. ""And while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans, in the short-term, we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence. As such, we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post,"" adds Zero Hedge . ""At a bare minimum, in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation, we fail to understand how an independent investigation into Hillary's email server isn't warranted."" James Comey is an arsonist, and he's going to burn the FBI to the ground unless his agents mutiny The upshot of all this is that James Comey is an arsonist. If his own agents don't force him to apply the law to the Clinton investigations, Comey will burn the agency to the ground, leaving its reputation in ashes. And that, sadly, will make the world a very dangerous place for all the FBI agents in the field, because everyday Americans would begin to see them all as corrupt, lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in Washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kind.The truth is that most FBI agents are hard working, professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists, financial fraudsters, kidnappers, murderers and other dangerous criminals. Yet if James Comey doesn't defend the FBI's reputation by indicting Hillary Clinton , he will likely be placing FBI field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in D.C.Comey, in other words, is more dangerous to the entire FBI than any other single person in Washington right now. If he doesn't find his moral compass and guide the FBI through this crisis with law and order intact, he's going to go down in history (and in flames) as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the FBI and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populace.No doubt, he'll get an extra bonus from Loretta Lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in America and announce that Hillary won't be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else. Remember: If Comey gives Hillary Clinton a free pass, he demonstrates to all Americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in Washington . And if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes, then practically speaking, why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all? James Comey: If you want to salvage the FBI's reputation, announce a recommendation for the indictment of both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch If there's one thing abundantly clear in all this, it's that both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch should be behind bars . Clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss. Lynch is a third-rate attorney who was tossed into the DOJ solely because of her gender and skin color, not her credentials. And neither one respects the laws of America, of course. Both are deeply corrupt.If the FBI hopes to have any reputation remaining after the Hillary Clinton campaign implodes either before or on November 8th, Comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows Hillary Clinton had CLEAR INTENT to violate national security laws , among other serious crimes.All Comey would have to say is something like, ""In the view of the FBI, Hillary Clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as Commander in Chief, and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security..."" and so on. With a single sentence, Comey could reinvigorate the FBI and position himself as an historic American hero.Right now, I'd imagine the Clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to James Comey's home address, along with notes that say something like, ""You're next."" Let's watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be intimidated.",0

Summary first: We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. 
I’m not sure most Americans have figured out what’s happening in Syria, because so much of what we hear is confusing to us, and really, we know so little of the context for it. Is it an insurgency against a brutal ruler? Is it a group of insurgencies struggling for power in a nearly failed state? Is it a proxy war expressing the territorial and ideological interests of the U.S., Russia, Turkey and Iran? 
Or something else? 
According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. it is something else — a war between competing national interests to build, or not build, a pipeline to the Mediterranean so natural gas can be exported to Europe. Inconveniently for Syria, that nation lies along an obvious pipeline route. 
Which makes it another war between interests for money — something not very hard to understand at all. 
Here’s Kennedy’s argument via EcoWatch. This is a long piece, well worth a full read, but I’ll try to present just the relevant sections here. 
The Historical Context: Decades of CIA-Sponsored Coups and Counter-Coups in Syria 
Kennedy’s introductory section contains an excellent examination of the history of U.S. involvement in Syria starting in the 1950s with the Cold War machinations of the Eisenhower-appointed Dulles brothers, John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State, and Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA. Together, they effectively ruled U.S. foreign policy. 
Kennedy writes (my emphasis): Syria: Another Pipeline War 
… America’s unsavory record of violent interventions in Syria—obscure to the American people yet well known to Syrians—sowed fertile ground for the violent Islamic Jihadism that now complicates any effective response by our government to address the challenge of ISIS. So long as the American public and policymakers are unaware of this past, further interventions are likely to only compound the crisis. Moreover, our enemies delight in our ignorance. 
… [W]e need to look at history from the Syrians’ perspective and particularly the seeds of the current conflict. Long before our 2003 occupation of Iraq triggered the Sunni uprising that has now morphed into the Islamic State, the CIA had nurtured violent Jihadism as a Cold War weapon and freighted U.S./Syrian relationships with toxic baggage. 
During the 1950′s, President Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers rebuffed Soviet treaty proposals to leave the Middle East a cold war neutral zone and let Arabs rule Arabia. Instead, they mounted a clandestine war against Arab Nationalism—which CIA Director Allan [sic] Dulles equated with communism—particularly when Arab self-rule threatened oil concessions. They pumped secret American military aid to tyrants in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon favoring puppets with conservative Jihadist ideologies which they regarded as a reliable antidote to Soviet Marxism. At a White House meeting between the CIA’s Director of Plans, Frank Wisner, and Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, in September of 1957, Eisenhower advised the agency, “We should do everything possible to stress the ‘holy war’ aspect.” 
The CIA began its active meddling in Syria in 1949—barely a year after the agency’s creation. Syrian patriots had declared war on the Nazis, expelled their Vichy French colonial rulers and crafted a fragile secularist democracy based on the American model. But in March of 1949, Syria’s democratically elected president, Shukri-al-Kuwaiti, hesitated to approve the Trans Arabian Pipeline, an American project intended to connect the oil fields of Saudi Arabia to the ports of Lebanon via Syria. In his book, Legacy of Ashes, CIA historian Tim Weiner recounts that in retaliation, the CIA engineered a coup, replacing al-Kuwaiti with the CIA’s handpicked dictator, a convicted swindler named Husni al-Za’im. Al-Za’im barely had time to dissolve parliament and approve the American pipeline before his countrymen deposed him, 14 weeks into his regime. Kennedy then details the history of coups and counter-coups in and against Syria, and concludes this section with this: Thanks in large part to Allan Dulles and the CIA, whose foreign policy intrigues were often directly at odds with the stated policies of our nation, the idealistic path outlined in the Atlantic Charter was the road not taken. In 1957, my grandfather, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, sat on a secret committee charged with investigating CIA’s clandestine mischief in the Mid-East. The so called “Bruce Lovett Report,” to which he was a signatory, described CIA coup plots in Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, all common knowledge on the Arab street, but virtually unknown to the American people who believed, at face value, their government’s denials. 
The report blamed the CIA for the rampant anti-Americanism that was then mysteriously taking root “in the many countries in the world today.”… A parade of Iranian and Syrian dictators, including Bashar al-Assad and his father, have invoked the history of the CIA’s bloody coups as a pretext for their authoritarian rule, repressive tactics and their need for a strong Russian alliance. These stories are therefore well known to the people of Syria and Iran who naturally interpret talk of U.S. intervention in the context of that history. 
While the compliant American press parrots the narrative that our military support for the Syrian insurgency is purely humanitarian, many Syrians see the present crisis as just another proxy war over pipelines and geopolitics. Before rushing deeper into the conflagration, it would be wise for us to consider the abundant facts supporting that perspective. So much for our supposed interest in “humanitarian” intervention in Syria. From a Syrian point of view, it has never been thus. It has been about pipelines since 1949, and they understand that, even if we don’t. 
The Current Conflagration 
Kennedy then turns to the present, or the near-present. Refer to the map above as you read: A Pipeline War 
In [the Syrians'] view, our war against Bashar Assad did not begin with the peaceful civil protests of the Arab Spring in 2011. Instead it began in 2000 when Qatar proposed to construct a $10 billion, 1,500km pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. 
Qatar shares with Iran, the South Pars/North Dome gas field, the world’s richest natural gas repository. The international trade embargo, until recently, prohibited Iran from selling gas abroad and ensured that Qatar’s gas could only reach European markets if it is liquefied and shipped by sea, a route that restricts volume and dramatically raises costs. 
The EU, which gets 30 percent of its gas from Russia, was equally hungry for the pipeline which would have given its members cheap energy and relief from Vladimir Putin’s stifling economic and political leverage. Turkey, Russia’s second largest gas customer, was particularly anxious to end its reliance on its ancient rival and to position itself as the lucrative transect hub for Asian fuels to EU markets. The Qatari pipeline would have benefited Saudi Arabia’s conservative Sunni Monarchy by giving them a foothold in Shia dominated Syria. 
The Saudi’s geopolitical goal is to contain the economic and political power of the Kingdom’s principal rival, Iran, a Shiite state, and close ally of Bashar Assad. The Saudi monarchy viewed the U.S. sponsored Shia takeover in Iraq as a demotion to its regional power and was already engaged in a proxy war against Tehran in Yemen, highlighted by the Saudi genocide against the Iranian backed Houthi tribe. Which puts the Qatari pipeline squarely opposite to Russia’s national interest — natural gas (methane) sales to Europe. Of course, the Russians, who sell 70 percent of their gas exports to Europe, viewed the Qatar/Turkey pipeline as an existential threat. In Putin’s view, the Qatar pipeline is a NATO plot to change the status quo, deprive Russia of its only foothold in the Middle East, strangle the Russian economy and end Russian leverage in the European energy market. In 2009, Assad announced that he would refuse to sign the agreement to allow the pipeline to run through Syria “to protect the interests of our Russian ally.” That was likely the last straw vis-à-vis the U.S. Which brings us to another pipeline, the so-called “Islamic Pipeline” (see map above):“Assad further enraged the Gulf’s Sunni monarchs by endorsing a Russian approved “Islamic pipeline” running from Iran’s side of the gas field through Syria and to the ports of Lebanon. The Islamic pipeline would make Shia Iran instead of Sunni Qatar, the principal supplier to the European energy market and dramatically increase Tehran’s influence in the Mid-East and the world. Israel also was understandably determined to derail the Islamic pipeline which would enrich Iran and Syria and presumably strengthen their proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. Another, competing pipeline which would run through Syrian territory, but this time carrying Iranian gas instead of Qatari gas. Thus the demonizing of Assad as evil in the mold of Saddam Hussein, instead of just a run-of-the-mill Middle East autocrat, as bad as some but better than others. Kennedy includes a good section on the history of the al-Assad family’s rule of Syria, including this information from top reporters Sy Hersh and Robert Parry: According to Hersh, “He certainly wasn’t beheading people every Wednesday like the Saudis do in Mecca.” Another veteran journalist, Bob Parry, echoes that assessment. “No one in the region has clean hands but in the realms of torture, mass killings, civil liberties and supporting terrorism, Assad is much better than the Saudis.” In September 2013, the Sunni states involved in the Qatar-Turkey pipeline were so determined to remove Syrian opposition to the pipeline that they offered, via John Kerry, to carry the whole cost of an U.S. invasion to topple al-Assad. Kerry reiterated the offer to Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL27): “With respect to Arab countries offering to bear the costs of [an American invasion] to topple Assad, the answer is profoundly Yes, they have. The offer is on the table.” Obama’s response: Despite pressure from Republicans, Barrack Obama balked at hiring out young Americans to die as mercenaries for a pipeline conglomerate. Obama wisely ignored Republican clamoring to put ground troops in Syria or to funnel more funding to “moderate insurgents.” But by late 2011, Republican pressure and our Sunni allies had pushed the American government into the fray. The rest is a history of provocation and over-reaction — a great deal of both — and chaos and death in Syria. Kennedy provides much detail here, at one point adding: [Syria's] moderates are fleeing a war that is not their war. They simply want to escape being crushed between the anvil of Assad’s Russian backed tyranny and the vicious Jihadi Sunni hammer that we had a hand in wielding in a global battle over competing pipelines. You can’t blame the Syrian people for not widely embracing a blueprint for their nation minted in either Washington or Moscow. The super powers have left no options for an idealistic future that moderate Syrians might consider fighting for. And no one wants to die for a pipeline. I’ll leave it there, but again, do read the entire piece if you want to truly understand what’s going on in Syria, and what is about to go on. 
Bottom Line 
Bottom line, it’s as Kennedy said: “No one wants to die for a pipeline”… but many do and will. 
I’ll offer three thoughts. One, if we weren’t so determined to be deeply dependent on fossil fuels, this would be their war, not ours. Two, we are deeply dependent on fossil fuels because of the political machinations of the oil companies, their CEOs, and the banks and hedge funds who fund them, all of whom pay our government officials — via campaign contributions and the revolving door — to prolong that dependence. We’re here because the holders of big oil money want us here. 
And three, keep all this in mind during the term of the next president. It will help you make sense of the phony warrior-cum-humanitarian arguments we’re almost certain to be subjected to. 
We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. • Replies: Never underestimate the Israeli factor. , @Mr. Anon Economic determinst arguments are always trotted out to explain these geo-political events. While they are not irrelevant, they do not necessarily explain everything. Remember back in 2002-2003, when a lot of people were pushing the idea that the war in Afghanistan was over a proposed pipeline. Well, the war isn't over, and there is still no pipeline. A country riven by civil war and crazy head-chopping-off-jihadists sounds like a lousy place to build a pipeline that could easily be sabotaged. Why not just build it via a different route? Through Turkey? Through Jordan and Israel? Through Saudi Arabia? ""According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr "" And that is supposed to be an authoritative source? I haven't noticed that the third-generation Kennedys are very bright or adept at much of anything. , @RonaldB It's nuts to say our usage of fossil fuels is optional and due only to the foot-dragging sponsored by the oil companies. The fact is, fossil fuel, including natural gas, is the most efficient, and throwing billions of dollars of government subsidies at ""clean energy alternatives"" will not do anything except increase the national debt. Having said that, the US is easily independent of political ramifications of Middle Eastern oil. North America produces more oil than Saudia Arabia, natural gas and coal are plentiful, and approving the keystone pipeline would make domestically-produced fossil energy even more available. So, even the worst scenario, a Middle Eastern effective boycott, would not have strategic implications, but would at most increase the price of oil and gas moderately. If the report is true, that Obama resisted the pressure from Republicans to invade Syria, I have a new-found respect for Obama and continue to hope that Trump considers himself completely separate from the Republican establishment. Also, the US can be supportive of Israel vis a vis UN and EU boycotts and one-sided resolutions, but does not need to ally itself with Israel foreign policy. Israel has its own, legitimate interests, which may not coincide with the US. Israel should go its own way, without the collaboration of the CIA. Israel has direct security interests as a neighbor of a hostile Syria and Iran, but it is up to Israel, and not the US, to best protect Israel's vital security. ,",0

10055,GOOGLE head Eric Schmidt's secret strategic plan for election...,"Secondary verification by google.com DKIM key Fwd: 2016 thoughts From:cheryl.mills@gmail.com To: robbymook@gmail.com, john.podesta@gmail.com, daplouffe@icloud.com Date: 2014-04-15 17:16 Subject: Fwd: 2016 thoughts Forwarded message From: Eric Schmidt <eschmidt@google.com> Date: Tue, Apr 15, 2014 at 1:56 PM Subject: 2016 thoughts To: Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com> Cheryl, I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better. This is simply a draft but do let me know if this is a helpful process for you all. Thanks !! Eric Notes for a 2016 Democratic Campaign Eric Schmidt April 2014 DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT Here are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the 2012 campaign. If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position to execute well for 2016. 1. Size, Structure and Timing Lets assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceases operation four days after November 8, 2016. The structure includes a Chairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a President who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements, systems and building and managing the organization. Every day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaign right after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best. 2. Location The campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly young and hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very large hiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic, smart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhere guarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help. The key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for you. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all good examples of a large, blue state city to base in. Employees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find low cost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis. This worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere. The computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services (AWS). All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smart phones along with credit card readers. 3. The pieces of a Campaign a) The Field Its important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy and empowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up the systems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people. Initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states. There is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human systems. The field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get out the vote programs. For organizing tools, build a simple way to link people and activities as a workflow and let the field manage the system, all cloud based. Build a simple organizing tool with a functioning back-end. Avoid deep integration as the benefits are not worth it. Build on the cloud. Organizing is really about sharing and linking people, and this tool would measure and track all of it. There are many other crucial early investments needed in the field: determining the precise list of battleground states, doing early polling to confirm initial biases, and maintaining and extending voter protection programs at the state level. b) The Voter Key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easily speak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get the voter videos and other answers to areas they care about (""the benefits of ACA to you"" etc.) The scenario includes a volunteer on a walk list, encountering a potential voter, updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voter and the information we have to offer. c) Digital A large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods to connect to voters, to offer information, to use social networks to spread good news, and to raise money. Partners like Blue State Digital will do much of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partners to pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load. d) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling New tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earned and social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable in reach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and other surveys. Build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors, and model how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us about the origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme. Connect polling into this in some way. Find a way to do polling online and not on phones. e) Analytics and data science and modeling, polling and resource optimization tools For each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote. Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters. Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn out and why, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches work well. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the most important factors for turnout, and preference. It should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcoming databases from companies like Comcast and others for media measurement purposes. The analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set of vendors. f) Core engineering, voter database and contact with voters online The database of voters (NGP Van) is a fine starting point for voter records and is maintained by the vendor (and needs to be converted to the cloud). The code developed for 2012 (Narwahl etc.) is unlikely to be used, and replaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the Van database and intermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter. Quite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities with the actual voter file with high confidence. The key unit of the campaign is a ""voter"", and each and every record is viewable and updatable by volunteers in search of more accurate information. In the case where we can't identify the specific human, we can still have a partial digital voter id, for a person or ""probable-person"" with attributes that we can identify and use to target. As they respond we can eventually match to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key is eventually matched to a real person. The Rules Its important that all the player in the campaign work at cost and there be no special interests in the financing structure. This means that all vendors work at cost and there is a separate auditing function to ensure no one is profiting unfairly from the campaign. All investments and conflicts of interest would have to be publicly disclosed. The rules of the audit should include caps on individual salaries and no investor profits from the campaign function. (For example, this rule would apply to me.) The KEY things a) early build of an integrated development team and recognition that this is an entire system that has to be managed as such b) decisions to exclusively use cloud solutions for scalability, and choice of vendors and any software from 2012 that will be reused. c) the role of the smart phone in the hands of a volunteer. The smart phone manages the process, updates the database, informs the citizen, and allows fundraising and recruitment of volunteers (on android and iphone). d) early and continued focus of qualifying fundraising dollars to build the field, and build all the tools. Outside money will be plentiful and perfect for TV use. A smart media mix tool tells all we need to know about media placement, TV versus other media and digital media.

10057,Trump Posts Report Of Clinton’s Secret Income… Immediately Goes Viral,"WATCH: CNN Host Stuns Media, Says Clinton’s Team Thinks “She’s Nuts!” 
“And giving money to the charity wouldn’t be enough. Bill and Hillary would have to get rich. So they did,” he wrote. “And all it took was brokering with the former president and acting Secretary of State.” 
In other words, quid pro quo, i.e., the practice of making donations in exchange for favors. Band’s clients graciously parted with their money because they expected Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to fulfill their wishes — just like she had done with other donors countless times in the past . 
And all the while, both Bill and Hillary Clinton pretended the Clinton Foundation was about helping people. What they forgot to mention was that their primary goal was to help themselves.

10058,Why Palestinians Want To Sue Britain: 99 Years Since the Balfour Declaration,"Share This 
Last July, the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected, although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Balfour Declaration. That ""declaration"" was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland. 
It is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call , or if the PA would even follow through, especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action. 
However, it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Balfour Declaration, the 100 th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02, 2017. 
But who is Balfour, what is the Balfour Declaration and why does all of this matters today? 
Britain’s Foreign Secretary from late 1916, Arthur James Balfour, had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02, 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain, Walter Rothschild. 
At the time, Britain was not even in control of Palestine, which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way, Palestine was never Balfour’s to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read: 
""His Majesty’s government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."" 
He concluded, ""I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation."" 
Balfour was hardly acting on his own. True, the Declaration bears his name, yet, in reality, he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs, not only concerning Palestine alone, but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape. 
Only a year earlier, another sinister document was introduced, albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat, Mark Sykes and, on behalf of France, by François Georges-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement, as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake. 
The document indicated that, once the Ottomans were soundly defeated, their territories, including Palestine, would be split among the prospective victorious parties. 
The Sykes-Picot Agreement , also known as the ""Asia Minor Agreement"", was signed in secret one hundred years ago, two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them. 
The centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs, dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines. 
The improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors , along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms, without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of cooperation and conflict. 
The Sykes-Picot negotiations were completed in March 1916 and, although official, was secretly signed on May 19, 1916. 
WWI concluded on November 11, 1918, after which the division of the Ottoman Empire began in earnest. 
British and French mandates were extended over divided Arab entities, while Palestine was granted to the Zionist movement a year later, when Balfour conveyed the British government’s promise, sealing the fate of Palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil. 
Rarely was British-Western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of Palestine. Beginning with the first wave of Zionist Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882, European countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources, where the establishment of many colonies, large and small, was afoot. 
So when Balfour sent his letter to Rothschild, the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was very much plausible. 
Still, many supercilious promises were being made to the Arabs during the Great War years, as the Arab leadership sided with the British in their war against the Ottoman Empire. Arabs were promised instant independence, including that of the Palestinians. 
When the intentions of the British and their rapport with the Zionists became too apparent, Palestinians rebelled , marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later, and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years. 
Paltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail, especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine – which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920 – without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact, Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar, only to reappear as negligible rioters, troublemakers, and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions. 
Despite occasional assurances to the contrary, the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Balfour Declaration was not merely an aberration, but had, indeed, set the stage for the full-scale ethnic cleansing that followed, three decades later. 
In fact, that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it ""Israel""; the British continue to support them, although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps, in the Diaspora, militarily occupied, or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial. 
While Balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief, but infamous letter, the notion that his ""promise"" embodied – that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people – that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next, in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations. 
That injustice continues, thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British, the early Zionists, the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand, and continue to ignore at their own peril, is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist, as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago, remain in place.

10060,"Hillary Clinton’s Message: Yes, the Economy Is Messed Up. But I Can Fix It. - The New York Times","It has been a year dominated by populist rage, embodied in Bernie Sanders’s calls for a political revolution and Donald J. Trump’s angry assertions that the United States, and its workers, are losing badly in the global economy. In an economic policy speech on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton gave this message: I alone am the candidate who knows how to turn those underlying frustrations into actual policies that might make things better. She offered herself as someone who would not merely vent voters’ anger, but respond to that anger by pulling the levers of the federal bureaucracy and creating legislation that can be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and just maybe pass a Senate committee. “It’s not easy to change Washington, or how corporations behave,” Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said before exuberant supporters in Raleigh, N. C. a day after a speech blasting Mr. Trump’s business record, ethics and   policy positions. “It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan. It takes a plan, and it takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results. ” Unlike her primary opponent, Mr. Sanders, she did not promise to provide free college tuition or to break up major banks she instead said she would make sure students could graduate without a debt hangover, and clamp down on banks in ways that would probably lead them to shrink. Unlike her Republican opponent, Mr. Trump, she did not propose ripping up trade deals and risking trade wars with the likes of China and Mexico. But she did say her administration would use the tax code to punish companies that outsource jobs. Notably, she also did not proclaim the greatness of the   economy and pledge continuity. That was a contrast with two other   candidates who ran to succeed a   president from their party amid a strong economy, Al Gore in 2000 and George H. W. Bush in 1988. This carefully   speech suggests she seeks to run not by boasting of what has gone right in the economy under President Obama, but as a fixer who can more successfully deal with the things that are still broken. The Obama administration has stressed that   job growth has been strong for the last several years and that the unemployment rate is now down to 4. 7 percent. But in her speech, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the   divergence between worker productivity and wages, the tendency of companies to view employee compensation as a cost to be minimized. And she spoke of the struggles of the   unemployed, people who can find only   work, and those who are out of the labor force entirely. In effect, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the underlying economic discontent that has fueled the rise of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, while presenting herself as the person best qualified to address it. “The bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation,” she said. “They let Wall Street take big risks with unregulated financial activities, they skew our tax code toward the wealthy, they failed to enforce our trade rules, they undermined workers’ rights. ” Mrs. Clinton thus emphasized policies that have potential for deal making even in a polarized Congress, or that could be executed through administrative action. In the first category, she mentioned   investment in public infrastructure, funding   investments in the nation’s future with a mix of public and private resources. Business interests and many elected Republicans support ideas in this vein, at least in theory. She also mentioned immigration reform as a tool for economic improvement, another idea that businesspeople and many Republicans support. (Recall that an immigration bill created in part by Marco Rubio, who in a slightly different universe might be Mrs. Clinton’s   opponent, was one vote in the House of Representatives away from becoming law not long ago.) In the category of administrative action, Mrs. Clinton was vague but clear about her intention to use the machinery of government to nudge things in workers’ favor. She said she would “continue to crack down on wage theft” and abuse of overtime rules, suggesting that she would, if anything, seek to expand Obama administration rules to make more workers eligible for     pay and use government authority to fight employers that try to shortchange employees. The policy steps she described had mostly been put forward by her campaign already, so it is hard to describe the speech as a step toward the left, in hopes of corralling Sanders voters, or to the center, in hopes of broadening her appeal to the general electorate. Rather, the speech framed her place in the race as being the candidate who understands the populist discontent but will react to it with practicality. That carries risks, too. After all, President Obama has spent his entire second term following the same basic strategy of looking for lanes for bipartisan cooperation on things like infrastructure spending and immigration overhaul, while using the federal bureaucracy to try to tilt the playing field toward workers within the confines of current law. As the election advances, Mrs. Clinton will be vulnerable to the charge that she is promising to do the same things as Mr. Obama has, but with the hope of getting better results for American workers. Politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Mrs. Clinton’s message on Wednesday was that she will campaign and govern with a   plan, drawn up by   experts, incorporating the full range of potential legislative and administrative tools available to the next president.",0
10061,CNN’s Jim Acosta Accused of Spreading Fake News About Trump’s Hospital Visit With Congressman Scalise,"CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta tweeted a false report that said President Donald Trump did not visit with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) in the hospital after Wednesday’s shooting, fueling fake news allegations. [After reports confirmed the news that President Trump had visited Scalise at MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, Acosta tweeted the exact opposite per a White official, “WH official on hospital visit: “President Trump did not meet with Scalise and did not go into the room where Scalise is being treated. ”  Acosta quickly deleted his original Tweet but not before it was captured by several Twitter users many of them accusing the CNN reporter of spreading fake news.

10062,Integration Expert: Ban Headscarves for Public Employees,"An Austrian integration expert has advised the government that public employees should be banned from wearing Islamic headscarves in the workplace. [Integration expert and government consultant Heinz Fassmann made the proposal to the government this week. According to Fassmann, it is important for the government, which provides services to all, not to be shown to promote any religion and that the state should be “above all religions,” reports Die Presse.  If such a ban is not enforced, Fassmann claims, “you run the risk of importing certain religious conflicts into the civil service” and cited the religious conflicts within the Islamic world between Sunni and Shia practitioners. Fassmann added he does not believe headscarves should be banned in all public places saying, “there is freedom, everyone can dress as he likes,” but affirmed it was needed within the scope of public service. “When asked whether teachers in public schools should be allowed to wear a headscarf, I would clearly say: No,” he said. Fassmann, when questioned about the wearing of Christian crosses in classrooms, said he didn’t have a problem with them as Christian tradition had been “historically grown” in Austria so presents no issue. The Islamic religious community in Austria (IGGiÖ) has expressed shock and anger over the issue releasing a statement that said, “The state as an employer should stick to the   legislation. ” Carla Amina Baghajati, media spokesman for the IGGiÖ, said she was angered that “something so   comes from an integration expert. ” Austria has been in the process of trying to ban the   niqab and burka since the summer of 2016 when Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz attempted to push through integration legislation. The legislation was blocked by the Socialist party of Austria (SPÖ) and other   factions in the Austrian parliament. While many agree on the ban of the   veil, the hijab, which leaves the face uncovered, has not been the subject of debate until now. The only Islamic garment to be banned by certain Austrian and German towns has been the   swimming garment, known popularly as the burkini, on hygiene grounds. In France, by contrast, the wearing of any religious items by public servants is not allowed, whether it is a Christian cross or the Islamic headscarf, and the   covering is banned completely in public settings. Some 30 French coastal towns also attempted to ban the burkini from public beaches in the summer of 2016, leading to an uproar by some who called it a slight against freedom of expression through the French public overwhelmingly approve of the ban. The ban was later suspended by France’s highest administrative court.",0
10063,It Took Less Than 2 Hours For The New Email Investigation Story To Completely Collapse (VIDEO),"  
Hillary supporters can stop panicking. The “reopening of the FBI’s email investigation” story blasted out by every hungry reporter and desperate Republican has already completely fallen apart. It took less than two hours. 
The initial headlines were as grim as they were overblown. Shortly before an official announcement, NBC News leaked the news that the FBI would be looking into newly discovered emails related to the previous Clinton investigation. NBC News: FBI re-opening investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server 
— Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) October 28, 2016 
This was important because despite Republicans hanging every last one of their hopes on Hillary being indicted before the election, the FBI investigation found zero evidence of criminal wrongdoing. A new investigation made all those dashed hopes come rushing back. They. Freaked. Out. 
Especially Trump. 
— Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 28, 2016 
However, even as Trump took a meaningless victory lap, the story itself was falling apart. The bombshell turned out to be a dud. 
Over on MSNBC, veteran reporter Pete Williams did what almost no other reporter bothered to – he got to the bottom of it. NBC’s Pete Williams: Sr. officials say—During separate investigation “a device” led to add’l emails–not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx 
— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 
All the “big” things turned out to not exist. No, there is no evidence to suggest these new emails were covered up. No, they haven’t found anything incriminating. No, this isn’t a “reopening” of the case – it was never closed to the begin with and this is a small update not a gamechanger. And perhaps most importantly these emails did not even come from Hillary Clinton . 
Bigger than Watergate? Hardly. 
Like Wikileaks before it, this non-scandal will be used on the right to give the appearance that Hillary Clinton is “corrupt” without providing any concrete proof beyond it. There is no big story here, but the conservative movement will use it as a pretext to continue harassing Clinton and her campaign with baseless accusations. FBI Director James Comey may have scored a few political points with his Republican colleagues, but his investigation will likely yield zero fresh controversies. 
This is the maddening world we live in. A sham built on a sham built on a sham. It’s shams all the way down.

10064,Comment on Mob of 50-60 angry students surround student who didn’t want to participate in the BLM movement by Dan,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by DCG | 1 Comment 
On October 14th I told you about how the Seattle Schools were organizing a “Black Lives Matter” Day in an effort to close the achievement gap between black and white students. 
Apparently the students at Todd Beamer High School in Federal Way (south of Seattle) thought that would be a great idea as well. Turns out the event didn’t go as planned. You will follow the program… 
From MyNorthwest.com : As the Federal Way controversy over a high school Black Lives Matter event continues, one person is not around school to see how tensions are being addressed. 
“I feel very unsafe going back to that school,” said Ellie Mae Haine, further saying she feels like she is in danger at Todd Beamer High School. “As it stands right now I don’t feel safe going to that school,” she said. “There’s no possible way I could go back right now.” 
Ellie is a 14-years-old freshman at Todd Beamer High School. 
One week ago, a student was arrested after allegedly fighting, and then assaulting an on-campus police officer. A Black Lives Matter event was organized the following week — kids were encouraged to wear black . It was organized by students. But Haine did not want to participate. 
“We were all pressured into wearing black because it seemed that most of the teachers agreed with this movement ,” Ellie said. “And we couldn’t’ decide whether we should participate or not. And I just went for it and didn’t participate. 
“When it comes down to it, I don’t think it should have anything to do with race. I just thought it was someone who didn’t have enough discipline or respect for authority.” 
Tensions between students who supported the Black Lives Matter event and those who did not participate erupted in the days since the initial arrest. It led to a school board meeting, where Ellie spoke, saying: “I still don’t understand why we were told to wear black to show support for this girl who has assaulted police officers more than just last week.” Todd Beamer High School Principal Joni Hall 
The next day, Ellie returned to school. 
“The day after the school board meeting, I came to school,” she said. “Everything went well until lunch. We were standing in the hallway outside of the cafeteria – I was with about 15 friends.” 
“The girl who had been arrested and who assaulted the cop, she came up to me and started yelling profanities in my face and seemed really angry,” Ellie said. “ Before I had any time to explain myself, a mob of 50-60 angry students came yelling my name. Most of them I didn’t know. My friends pushed me behind them because they saw that this wasn’t good.” 
Teachers came and were pushing back the crowd of students. Ellie found a police officer in the lunch room nearby. He escorted her outside the building. Her mom came to pick her up and the officer advised that the freshman stay away from school for a couple of days until things calmed down . 
Ellie and her mom met with school officials and some of the high school’s Black Lives Matter students. She said that one of the Black Lives Matter students said he didn’t like how things had turned out. He offered to escort her from class to class and defend her if need be.

10065,Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Muse Over a Cookie-Cutter Supreme Court - The New York Times,"COLORADO SPRINGS  —   As the Supreme Court prepares to return to the bench next month, its two newest members have been reflecting on the absence of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, and on the striking lack of diversity among the remaining justices. They are all graduates of just three Ivy League law schools. None are Protestants. All but one come from a coastal state. In remarks last week in Arizona and Colorado, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, President Obama’s two appointees, steered clear of commenting directly on the stalled nomination of his third choice, Judge Merrick B. Garland. But they did talk about how a new colleague could reinforce or disrupt a court that is in some ways exceptionally homogeneous. “We’re not as diverse as some would like in many important characteristics  —   educational institutions, religion, places where we come from,” Justice Sotomayor said on Thursday at a judicial conference here. Justice Kagan, speaking on Wednesday at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said the court may suffer from what she called a “coastal perspective,” The Arizona Daily Star reported. (She is from New York City. As is Justice Sotomayor. As is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As was Justice Scalia. Between the four of them, they represented every borough but Staten Island.) Justice Scalia made a similar point in a dissent last year. “Eight of them grew up in East and West Coast states,” Justice Scalia wrote of the court’s membership at the time. “Only one hails from the vast expanse ” he added, referring to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who is from Indiana. On this score, Judge Garland would bring a dash of variety to the court, as he is from Chicago. But he has long worked in Washington, in the Justice Department and, for the past 19 years, on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In other ways, Judge Garland would not bring notable diversity to the Supreme Court. He attended Harvard Law School, as did five of the current justices. (The other three went to Yale. Justice Ginsburg started at Harvard and graduated from Columbia.) Judge Garland is Jewish, as are three of the current justices. (The other five are Roman Catholic.) In last year’s dissent, Justice Scalia, also Catholic, mused that his court included “not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about   of Americans) or even a Protestant of any denomination. ” Judge Garland would be the eighth former federal appeals court judge on the Supreme Court. (The exception is Justice Kagan.) Justices used to come from more varied professional backgrounds. They had often been governors, lawmakers, cabinet members, law professors, practicing lawyers or state court judges. As late as 1972, when Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the court, former federal judges were in the minority. At the judicial conference here on Friday, Justice Kagan suggested that prior judicial experience or other deep engagement with the law was desirable given the broad social issues the Supreme Court sometimes decides. In those cases, she said, “law has a kind of values feel to it. ” “Even in those cases, you have to understand that it’s still about law,” Justice Kagan said. “You don’t want a court of   philosophers. You want a court of people who really care about law and are good at doing it and are experienced at doing it and who bring that worldview even to cases that involve matters of broad principle. ” Both justices said that more diversity on the court would bolster public confidence in its work. “People look at an institution and they see people who are like them, who share their experiences, who they imagine share their set of values, and that’s a sort of natural thing and they feel more comfortable if that occurs,” Justice Kagan said in Tucson. But does diversity on the bench affect outcomes? “It’s obviously true,” Justice Kagan said, “that people bring their backgrounds and experiences to the job in some sense. ” But Justice Sotomayor said that shared experiences can lead to different perspectives, mentioning her ideological opposite, Justice Clarence Thomas. Both grew up poor, and both climbed to the pinnacle of the American legal profession. “You would think that Clarence Thomas and I would be more similar, wouldn’t you, if you looked just at our background and upbringing,” Justice Sotomayor said. Both justices said that vacancies are so infrequent and tenures are so long that change will come haltingly. “The Supreme Court is never going to be a melting pot reflective of the country,” Justice Sotomayor said. “In most of our lifetimes, the court is only going to turn over one full circle. ” Asked if there would ever be a female chief justice, she said, “We hope that Chief Justice Roberts will have a very long tenure, and if he does, the issue of whether a woman would or would not be appointed would be a product of the circumstances of that moment. ” For now, the   Supreme Court has a muted quality. It “sputters along on its new screensaver mode,” Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate. That is partly a consequence of the loss of an outsize personality, Justice Sotomayor said. “Nino Scalia was a big presence and he took up a lot of space in the room,” she said, using her former colleague’s nickname. “There’s no question that arguments have toned down a little bit. There are more silent pauses during argument. ” There is also the matter of simple math. The   court has been working hard to avoid deadlocks, Justice Sotomayor said, but sometimes at the expense of actually resolving anything. “There’s a few cases where you can see we ruled very, very, very narrowly,” she said, “and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out why. ”",0
10066,Hillary Clinton’s Team to Join Wisconsin Recount Pushed by Jill Stein - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Nearly three weeks after Election Day, Hillary Clinton’s campaign said on Saturday that it would participate in a recount process in Wisconsin incited by a   candidate and would join any potential recounts in two other closely contested states, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The Clinton campaign held out little hope of success in any of the three states, and said it had seen no “actionable evidence” of vote hacking that might taint the results or otherwise provide new grounds for challenging Donald J. Trump’s victory. But it suggested it was going along with the recount effort to assure supporters that it was doing everything possible to verify that hacking by Russia or other irregularities had not affected the results. In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team’s general counsel, said the campaign would take part in the Wisconsin recount being set off by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, and would also participate if Ms. Stein made good on her plans to seek recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Mrs. Clinton lost those three states by a total of little more than 100, 000 votes, sealing her Electoral College defeat  by Mr. Trump. The Clinton campaign had assailed Mr. Trump during the election for refusing to say he would abide by the results if he lost. On Saturday, Mr. Trump responded to the campaign’s decision to join the recount with a statement calling the effort “ridiculous” and “a scam by the Green Party. ” He suggested that most of the money raised would not be spent on the recount. “The results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,” Mr. Trump said. In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22, 177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10, 704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70, 638 votes. Mr. Elias suggested in his essay that the Clinton campaign was joining the recount effort with little expectation that it would change the result. But many of the campaign’s supporters, picking up on its frequent complaints of Russian interference in the election, have enthusiastically backed Ms. Stein’s efforts, putting pressure on the Clinton team to show that it is exploring all options. Mr. Elias used his essay to describe an intensive    effort by the campaign to look for signs of Russian hacking activity or other irregularities in the vote count. Ms. Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday afternoon, about an hour before the deadline. She has raised more than $5 million for the effort, which will now turn to Michigan and Pennsylvania, where there are deadlines in the coming week. In his post, Mr. Elias sounded less enthusiastic than the recount’s many supporters. “Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology,” he wrote, “we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves. ” He added, “Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. ” If Ms. Stein pursues additional recounts, “we will take the same approach in those states as well,” he wrote. But he noted that the “number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states  —   Michigan  —   well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. ” The Clinton campaign will not contribute financially to the effort, which has been funded by small contributions. But it will pay to have its own lawyers present at the recount, campaign officials said. The Obama administration issued a statement to The New York Times on Friday in response to questions about intelligence findings related to Russian interference in the election. In the statement, it said it had concluded that the election was free of interference. The administration issued a second statement on Saturday saying that “the federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day. ” Mrs. Clinton conceded the race to Mr. Trump early on Nov. 9, when it became clear that he would have a large margin of victory in the Electoral College. But as her lead in the popular vote has grown  —   it now exceeds two million votes  —   her base has increasingly pressured her to challenge the results. That has been fueled in part by how aggressively the Clinton campaign spread the word of Russian involvement in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and from the personal account of John D. Podesta, the campaign’s chairman. The campaign also charged that the Russians were behind fake news about Mrs. Clinton’s health, among other stories  —   a claim supported to some extent by recent studies. Some critics saw those accusations as an effort to shift the discussion from mistakes the Clinton campaign had made in taking on Mr. Trump. Mr. Elias’s post offered a revealing look at how much time and energy the campaign had spent in the past two weeks looking for evidence of Russian hacking or other irregularities, and how it had tried to keep those efforts secret.  “Since the day after the election, we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result,” Mr. Elias wrote. “Most of those discussions have remained private, while at least one has unfortunately been the subject of leaks,” he wrote, a reference to conversations between Mr. Podesta and a group of experts that included J. Alex Halderman, a computer scientist with deep experience in the vulnerabilities of voting systems. Mr. Halderman recently put his own post on Medium, describing his suspicions and the case for recounts. But even he doubted that the election result would change.",0
10067,Senate Democrats Block Zika Bill Over Planned Parenthood Provisions - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   As Congress returned from a   recess on Tuesday, Senate Democrats again stymied a $1. 1 billion plan to fight the Zika virus, demanding that Republicans drop an effort to block Planned Parenthood from receiving money to combat the   disease. Democrats, who had essentially blocked the same legislation  in late June, had enough votes Tuesday to prevent Congress from moving emergency funding public health experts say is desperately needed as they prepare for the possibility that Zika will spread to other states along the gulf coast. The vote was 52 to 46, and Republicans needed 60 votes to advance the bill. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, said that although efforts to fight the virus had produced encouraging results, the problem was far from over. “It’s hard to explain why, despite their own calls for funding, Democrats would block plans to keep women and babies safe from Zika,” Mr. McConnell said before the vote. Because of the standoff, lawmakers say they expect to address the funding issue by the end of the month as part of a   stopgap spending measure. That legislation would be intended to keep the government funded because it seems increasingly likely that Congress will not pass its annual spending bills by then. But that may not be soon enough, some health experts say. Calls for additional funding gained urgency last week when Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced that his agency has used almost all of the $222 million it was allocated to fight the virus. He warned that some plans, such as a mosquito control program in   Puerto Rico, would have to be axed without more money soon. Florida, in particular, has been burning through funds quickly, undertaking the costly work of spraying and otherwise controlling the mosquito population, and health experts worry that another cluster of cases elsewhere might cost more money than they have. The   package was supposed to resolve the differences between a bipartisan Senate plan and a less   House version. The bill would exclude Planned Parenthood from the list of providers that get new funding for contraception to combat spread of the virus, which can be sexually transmitted. Democrats regard any restriction on Planned Parenthood as setting a dangerous example, and they have shown they are willing to risk looking as if they are blocking funding for a public health crisis to prevent that precedent. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said Republicans had sabotaged efforts to address Zika by including the restrictions on Planned Parenthood. “Now with this Zika virus frightening women all over America, they want to cut it off?” Mr. Reid said before the vote. Such questions awaited lawmakers on both sides as they returned to their districts this summer, vexing those from Florida and other Southern states. NARAL   America, a prominent abortion rights group, released an ad Tuesday slamming Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is running for   over the Planned Parenthood provisions in the bill. As of late August, there were more than 16, 800 Zika cases in the United States, including Puerto Rico, which had the most. Health experts were tracking more than 1, 500 pregnant women who had been infected with Zika, and at least 17 babies have been born with severe birth defects. The potential remains for many more cases before peak mosquito season ends in November. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said in a briefing last week that the administration was still holding out hope that a bipartisan agreement could be struck, particularly given the growing number of cases in Florida and Puerto Rico. Florida announced seven new Zika cases Tuesday, bringing the total number of homegrown cases in Florida to 56, according to the state Department of Health. Six of the cases surfaced in an area in Miami Beach where the infection is circulating, the department said, and one elsewhere in   County. “We need a bipartisan agreement,” Ms. Burwell said. “I believe that is possible and I think that can be done. ” Ms. Burwell emphasized the urgency of the situation, saying that the administration had been focused on juggling funding rather than conducting the research necessary to better understand Zika and its effects, such as the number of children who would be left deaf by the virus. She pointed out that Congress had allocated funding for other health emergencies, such as the Ebola and the H1N1 flu viruses. “This is an emergency,” she said. “We did not know. It was not planned for. It is a national issue. For other kinds of emergencies we do it. ”",0
10068,2006 AUDIO EMERGES OF HILLARY CLINTON PROPOSING RIGGING PALESTINE ELECTION,"Home › POLITICS › 2006 AUDIO EMERGES OF HILLARY CLINTON PROPOSING RIGGING PALESTINE ELECTION 2006 AUDIO EMERGES OF HILLARY CLINTON PROPOSING RIGGING PALESTINE ELECTION 1 SHARES 
[10/28/16] On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton’s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is “rigged.” 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). 
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” said Sen. Clinton. “And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” Post navigation",0
10069,Walls Work: Migration Falls in EU Countries With Border Fences,"European Union (EU) countries which constructed border fences in response to the migrant crisis have seen a collapse in illegal migration, while unprotected states have seen it increase. [Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, reported drastic falls in illegal immigration for countries which have constructed border defences in its Risk Analysis for 2017.  Hungary, which led the charge on strong borders, was able to cut illegal crossings from Serbia to 25, 000  —   a massive drop from the 2015 high of 200, 000. Neighbouring Croatia condemned Hungary’s robust stance at the time, with then Prime Minister Zoran Milanović promising his country would not follow suit. “We are ready to accept and direct those people,” he said, adding that “barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it’s a threat”. Just days later, however, Milanović completely reversed his stance, the country having been inundated with thousands of migrants. “We cannot register and accommodate these people any longer,” he said. “They will get food, water and medical help, and then they can move on. The European Union must know that Croatia will not become a migrant ‘hotspot’. We have hearts, but we also have heads. ” Croatia quietly joined Hungary in constructing what Frontex describes as “a technical obstacle” along its Serbian border. As a consequence, illegal migration via this route plummetted from 500, 000 in 2015 to just 100, 000 in 2016. The clear pattern which emerges from the risk analysis is that, as one country institutes strong border controls, neighbouring countries which remain lax see a corresponding increase in illegal migration. For example, the report describes how “African illegal stayers who primarily entered the EU through the Central Mediterranean route significantly decreased in Austria” after the   country “upgraded the controls of its national border with Italy”. The statistics show illegal stayers growing in Switzerland, which is outside the EU but inside the bloc’s borderless Schengen zone, “at the same time”. Despite clear statistical evidence of the effectiveness of walls in tackling illegal migration, Europe’s leading politicians remain wedded to open borders. Federica Mogherini, the EU’s unelected High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, has insisted that “we have a history and a tradition and an identity based on the fact that we celebrate when walls are broken down and bridges are built”. Her statement was seen as a   swipe at U. S. President Donald J. Trump, and was reiterated by the bloc’s Trade Commissioner earlier on Wednesday. The German foreign minister, whose country has absorbed millions of unvetted illegal migrants at a cost of over 20 billion euros and suffered terror attacks as a result, has also told the president that “building walls is a bad idea”. Surveys suggest that a majority of European voters do in fact wish to severely curtail immigration, particularly from the Islamic world.",0

To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. I have a column in The Times Magazine today about a recipe for roasted potato hash that I’ve been messing around with for years now. It makes a superlative bed for eggs and an excellent side dish for steak. You could eat it with a mess of sautéed greens and be happy without the animal protein. You should make it entirely your own. Perhaps you could make it for lunch? And then for dinner tonight, you could try the recipe for braised chicken legs that I learned from the teachings of the California chef Cal Peternell, and sop up the sauce with Julia Moskin’s recipe for grilled garlic bread. On Monday night, you might go meatless and Balkan, mixing up David Tanis’s recipe for a Greek tomato salad and adding some crumbled feta if you like to make it really sing. Or you could go Brazilian in honor of the Olympic Games, with 10 recipes from that nation’s larder. For sure on Tuesday you could give Martha Rose Shulman’s recipe for   shrimp with spicy greens a try. Serve it with Kim Severson’s can’  rice and then settle in to see what the Olympics have to offer. (You’re not, like, in Rio, are you? If you are, or just want to imagine that you are, Florence Fabricant has a fine guide to the city’s best restaurant options.)

10073,CDC SPIDER is the biggest medical whistleblower event in history,"Alternative News Project CDC SPIDER is the biggest medical whistleblower event in history 
The CDC SPIDER bites! CDC Whistleblowers Team Up and Demand “House Cleaning” and Lend Credence to Increasingly Critical Views of Authority Structures 
While the mainstream media and medical/Big Pharma spokespeople were doing their best to ignore the raging conflagration that is the VAXXED phenomenon and pretend it isn’t happening, another major blow was just struck against the entrenched liars in politics claiming across-the-board “safety” and “zero risk” of vaccines ( see: Victorian Health Minister Jill Hennessy ). CDC whistleblower/confessor William Thompson – the primary subject of the VAXXED documentary – appears to have triggered somewhat of a whistleblower avalanche following his explosive confession that he and his superiors literally binned (yes, threw in the trash) hard evidence linking vaccines to autism, thus vindicating the work of numerous scientists around the world who have detected such causal connections. 
This most recent blow against such malfeasance and criminal conspiracy consists of a letter addressed to Chief of Staff Carmen Villa at the CDC and signed off on by a group of at least a dozen disenchanted/fed up CDC scientists identifying themselves as SPIDER (CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research). 
CDC SPIDER constitutes the biggest whistleblower event we’ve ever seen, bigger even than Thompson’s disturbing and compelling confession of conspiracy and coverup at the highest levels. The latest bombshell reveals (read: confirms once more) that the corruption and complicity are not anomalies, but entrenched systemic problems. 
SPIDER’s August 29, 2016 plaintive demand opens with this extremely revealing paragraph (emphasis added): 
We are a group of scientists at CDC that are very concerned about the current state of ethics at our agency. It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests. It seems that our mission and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception. Some senior management officials at CDC are clearly aware and even condone these behaviors. Others see it and turn the other way. Some staff are intimidated and pressed to do things they know are not right. We have representatives from across the agency that witness this unacceptable behavior. It occurs at all levels and in all of our respective units…We are asking that you do your part to help clean up this house! 
Let’s decode some key phrases: “Outside parties and rogue interests.” = Big Pharma and general corporate whores with connections to (or jobs in) these key agencies (CDC, AMA, etc.). It’s well known that there is a revolving door between massive pharmaceutical corporations and government agencies, such that “outside parties” tend to become “internal parties” and vice versa. The governmental arena has been thoroughly infiltrated by these “rogue interests,” to the extent that such interests control policy creation itself. “…becoming the norm and not the rare exception.” – Well, let’s be real: this problem became normative a long time ago. Their statement shows that ALL authoritative claims around health/medical issues/medical interventions made by authorities such as the CDC or AMA should be viewed with suspicion and investigated thoroughly instead of taken prima facie (at face value). In other words, CDC and other such government agencies lie… a lot. “Some senior management officials…even condone these behaviors.” – Because they are paid handsomely to sell humanity out to the highest bidder, whether Big Pharma, Coke, or what have you. Senior management condoning this activity creates a top-down systemic problem that poisons the entire barrel, so to speak. A strained climate of pressure to “go along to get along” ensues. The public’s suspicion of such agencies is thus well justified. “It occurs at all levels and in all of our respective units.” I.e., no part of the CDC apparatus remains untainted by this repugnant corruption ( See: William Thompson’s confession ). It is all-pervasive and, frankly, we have no reason at all to believe this problem is restricted – as if by magic – to just the CDC. Parallel government agencies with similar or related functions are just as compromised. Truth is a minor concern (or even just plain problematical) for these corrupt elements whose primary interest appears largely to be lining their pockets with a lot of cash. 
The SPIDER letter also outlines some other issues, including data manipulation by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the Wise Woman Program in order to present misleading results to Congress (“to make the results look better than they were.”) As they said, “definitions were changed and data ‘cooked’” – now where have we heard about definitions being changed before? Ah, yes, POLIO (but that’s another scandal for another day). 
SPIDER added: 
An “internal review” that involved staff across CDC occurred and its findings were essentially suppressed so media and/or Congressional staff would not become aware of the problems. 
SPIDER also singled out Drs. Barbara Bowman and Michael Pratt for their “irregular (if not questionable) relationships with Coca­Cola and ILSI representatives. Neither of these relationships were necessary (or appropriate) to uphold our mission. Neither organization added any value to the good work and science already underway at CDC…It appears to us that something very strange is going on with Dr. Pratt…His behavior and that of management surrounding this is very troubling.” 
Carey Gillam reported on the notorious Bowman and dubious Pratt (whose surname seems apt): 
Bowman, retired after revelations of what the complaint called an “irregular” relationship with Coca-Cola and the nonprofit corporate interest group set up by Coca-Cola called the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Email communications obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by USRTK revealed that in her CDC role, Bowman had been communicating regularly with – and offering guidance to – a leading Coca-Cola advocate seeking to influence world health authorities on sugar and beverage policy matters. 
Emails also suggested that Pratt has a history of promoting and helping lead research funded by Coca-Cola while being employed by the CDC. Pratt also has been working closely with ILSI, which advocates for the agenda of beverage and food industries, emails obtained through FOIA showed. Several research papers co-written by Pratt were at least partly funded by Coca-Cola, and Pratt has received industry funding to attend industry-sponsored events and conferences. 
It’s all merely the tip of a corrupt and fetid iceberg, folks. 
Finally, the CDC SPIDER letter closes with: 
Why has the CDC OD turned a blind eye to these things. The lack of respect for science and scientists that support CDC’s legacy is astonishing. Please do the right thing. Please be an agent of change. Respectfully, CDC Spider (CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research) 
Remember, fellow change agents: it is agencies such as the CDC, AMA, TGA, etc. that are orchestrating the war on natural/”complementary” medicine. It is these outlets that are enacting Big Pharma’s modern day Inquisition against natural healing and demonizing those modalities and their practitioners at every opportunity, employing the lap dog mainstream media to great effect. Simultaneously they engineer a cult-like mentality in the public at large, touting the unquestionable “benefits” of various mainstream interventions while aggressively discouraging any free thinking or critical analysis. Anyone who points out the well documented risks or harms resulting from said “wonderful” interventions is mocked and ostracised in the most juvenile form of groupthink imaginable. Welcome to 1984 , 2016 style. 
Beware the players with the deepest pockets – they have the motive and the means for distorting collective reality and convincing millions of us that black is white and 2 + 2 = 5. 
I’m pretty sure that 2 + 2 = 4, even when it’s not “PC,” and even when our government agencies and ministers insist the answer is “5.” 
Not to worry – there are legal means of dealing with their mendacity and complicity. 
The truth will out.

10074,BOOM! MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election » 100percentfedUp.com,"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump…it turns out Trump was right…he didn’t need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‘never Trumpers’ from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him… 
It’s easy to glance at Tuesday’s popular vote — which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 – and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama’s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states — Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin — Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What’s more, she far surpassed Obama’s 2012 vote total in Florida, the country’s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country’s most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation’s most critical battleground states. Let’s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren’t yet final because not all precincts have reported. 
FLORIDA — 29 EVs — 98 percent reporting

10075,Chris Paul’s Fast Hands and Gruesome Fingers - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Chris Paul examined his crooked knuckles and the surgical scars that form tiny road maps on his hands. He has torn various ligaments in his thumbs and has broken bones in his fingers. He has worn casts and splints. His hands, though, are the indispensable tools of his trade, no matter how gruesome they look. “I’ve got the worst fingers,” he said. Paul, the starting point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers, long ago established himself as one of the N. B. A. ’s premier defenders. He has collected more steals than any other active player in the league: 1, 892 and counting. A     he clutters passing lanes. He strips dribbles like paint thinner. Doc Rivers, his coach, has concluded that Paul has the best hands he has ever seen. “Gifted,” Rivers said during an interview in January. “His hands are so damn quick. ” Three days after Rivers offered this assessment, Paul paid the price for possessing such gifts. In a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he jammed his left thumb fighting through a screen, tearing his ulnar collateral ligament  —   not to be confused with his radial collateral ligament, the one he tore on his right thumb training for the Olympics in 2012. Few people on the planet have firsthand knowledge of the difference between R. C. L. and U. C. L. tears. Paul is one of them. (They both hurt, he said.) As for his most recent injury, Paul missed 14 games before he returned late last month. Even now, with the Clippers vying for playoff position, he is trying to regain his feel for the game. “I see plays all the time where I know I can reach for the ball and I know I can steal it,” he said. “But it’s like risk versus reward: Do I go for it?” Such is life for Paul, who cannot help putting his hands in harm’s way. He tore ligaments in his right middle finger in March 2010. He fractured his left index finger in October 2015. He broke his right hand last April, and he continues to play with 16 pins and a metal plate embedded in his palm. He shoots with that hand. In the process, he has become something of an expert on hands for colleagues. After J. R. Smith of the Cleveland Cavaliers fractured his right thumb in December, Paul called him to offer tips on his rehabilitation. Whenever Paul himself jams a thumb or sprains a finger, the first person he usually hears from is Matt Barnes, a former teammate who now plays for the Golden State Warriors. “Because he gets his fingers hit all the time,” said Paul, who is averaging 17. 6 points, 9. 2 assists and 1. 9 steals a game. “He understands. ” The challenge for Paul is that he relies on his hands. He is not, by his own admission, one of the league’s most awesome physical specimens. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds. He is not particularly fast and does not jump especially high. But he has exceptional reflexes and a knack for anticipating plays. “He could have been a boxer,” Rivers said. “I don’t know if he could have taken a punch, but he could have landed some for sure. ” Growing up in North Carolina, Paul worked to develop hand speed and coordination. He was almost never without a ball, he said. He also watched the game constantly, studying how other players dribbled and passed, and all the angles they used to create space. He determined that there were a finite number of possibilities. “Not being the most athletic player,” he said, “I’ve always had to understand where you’re going with the ball. ” He recorded his first N. B. A. steal before he scored his first N. B. A. points, intercepting an errant pass before racing away for a layup. His professional career was less than four minutes old. In 2008, he set an N. B. A. record by going 108 straight games with at least one steal. “I think that one’s going to be hard to break,” he said. Jamal Crawford, his teammate, said that Paul had an encyclopedic knowledge of his opponents thanks to his experience and his tireless analysis of game film. “He’s ahead of the play,” Crawford said. Metta World Peace, a veteran forward with the Los Angeles Lakers and a former defensive player of the year, cited Paul’s “hunger. ” Few players, for example, are more skilled at recovering the ball if it happens to get stolen away. “Oh, I’m getting it back,” Paul said. “I want it. I want it. ” But Paul said that no one had better hands than Brevin Knight, a point guard who retired in 2009 and now works as an analyst for the Memphis Grizzlies’ television broadcasts. As a kid, Knight knew that the only way he was going to earn his way onto the prime playground courts near his home in East Orange, N. J. was by playing great defense. “Being smaller, you have to figure out a way for people to want to pick you so you’re not just sitting there on the side watching,” he said in a telephone interview. “It stuck with me from there. ” Knight described himself as a “tendency person. ” He could study an opponent for two possessions, he said, and get a feel for what that player liked to do with the ball. Paul is the same way. “He has the ability to look as though the he is not engaged defensively, but he’s really there,” Knight said. “It’s his way of luring the offensive guy into thinking, ‘Oh, I’ve got an easy move here.’ ” In retirement, Knight has found that his good hands  —   along with excellent peripheral vision  —   are still useful when he broadcasts games. Occasionally, he said, a loose ball will rocket toward the courtside table where he and Pete Pranica, the Grizzlies’    voice, are calling the action. Knight tries to save Pranica first, he said, and the courtside monitor second. “Because these teams have enough money,” Knight said, “they can replace a monitor. ” Rivers knows about defense, too. During his   playing career, he came away with 1, 563 steals and the mangled instruments of his profession. “I mean, honestly, look at my fingers,” said Rivers, who stretched his hands before him and stared at them as if they had been assembled by Picasso. Rivers was constantly putting his hands in danger. He described himself as a “reacher. ” He reached for loose balls. He reached for deflections. And he reached into the midsections of opposing point guards, committing an average of one foul for every nine minutes of playing time. Paul, on the other hand, goes about 14 minutes between fouls. “I’m amazed how clean he gets steals in traffic,” Rivers said. Not that he is immune from workplace hazards. One of Paul’s more devastating injuries occurred last April, against the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs. As Portland’s Gerald Henderson drove for a layup, Paul used his left hand to strip the ball away from Henderson. The problem was that Paul entangled his right hand in the back of Henderson’s jersey. He led a fast break in the other direction, but the damage was done: He had broken the third metacarpal in his right palm. The Clippers lost the next two games and the series without him. “Right when he did it, you could see me react on the sideline,” said Rivers, who did not react well. “I knew what it was. Because I had done the exact same thing when I was playing. ” This season has been another exercise in perseverance for Paul, who sprained his left thumb at a preseason practice, which was bad enough. Then, in January, he tried to squeeze past that screen against Oklahoma City  —   a collision made worse by the Thunder’s Russell Westbrook, who tried to draw a foul by jumping into Paul. “I tried to shake it out because I’ve jammed my thumb a thousand times,” Paul said. “I thought it would calm down. But I could see how swollen it was. I said: ‘I tore it. I know I did.’ ” After spending several weeks squeezing a tiny rubber ball to rebuild the strength in his thumb, Paul has since returned to the court. He would like to stay there. “Just trying to keep my hands out of the way,” he said.",0
10077,Media Roll Out Welcome Mat for ‘Humanitarian’ War in Syria,"Media Roll Out Welcome Mat for ‘Humanitarian’ War in Syria Media Roll Out Welcome Mat for ‘Humanitarian’ War in Syria By 0 49 Hillary Clinton told Goldman Sachs that a no-fly zone is “going to kill a lot of Syrians.” (cc photo: Gage Skidmore) 
As she marches toward the US presidency, Hillary Clinton has stepped up her promotion of the idea that a no-fly zone in Syria could “save lives” and “hasten the end of the conflict” that has devastated that country since 2011. 
It has now been revealed, of course, that Clinton hasn’t always expressed the same optimism about the no-fly zone in private. The Intercept (10/10/16 ) reported on Clinton’s recently leaked remarks in a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013: 
To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk—you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians. 
Other relevant characters, such as US Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Joseph Dunford ( Daily Caller , 9/26/16 ), have warned that a no-fly zone in Syria would simply intensify the conflict—which presumably isn’t the best way to hasten its end. 
Luckily for those who prefer to rally around illogic, however, plenty of media have already rolled out the welcome mat for peddlers of the “humanitarian” vision of increased Western military interference in Syria. The New York Times ‘ Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ) argues against “Obama’s paralysis” and for “more robust strategies advocated by Hillary Clinton.” 
The New York Times ’ self-appointed savior of women , Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ), invoked the plight of a young Syrian girl in Aleppo to conclude that Obama’s alleged “paralysis” on Syria “has been linked to the loss of perhaps half a million lives” in the country, as well as to “the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State,” among other unpleasant outcomes. We have no “excuse,” we’re told, for “failing to respond to mass atrocities.” 
Never mind that the rise of ISIS has much to do with that mass atrocity known as the US invasion of Iraq, thanks to which many young Iraqi girls and other human beings have suffered rape, mutilation and death. It’s convenient for certain industries, at least, when US weapons are deemed the solution for problems US weapons helped to create in the first place. 
Furthermore, plenty of US weapons continue to flow to countries known for arming and funding ISIS and similar outfits—an arrangement unlikely to be rectified by a no-fly zone targeting the Syrian government and the Russians. 
USA Today ( 10/8/16 ), meanwhile, ran an opinion piece by an American doctor who worked briefly at a now-destroyed hospital in Aleppo, arguing that the US “should lead the way in establishing real no-fly zones, either under United Nations auspices or with the British and the French”—because “otherwise, our inaction will continue to be an embarrassment and stand as an example of our spineless irresponsibility.” 
But considering that there has already been plenty of US action in Syria—including the mistaken “pulverization” of whole families with children—it would seem we’ve already exhibited a fair amount of lethal irresponsibility. 
Beyond the opinion pages, media figures are pushing the “humanitarian” approach with varying degrees of subtlety. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd ( 10/16/16 ) recently pressed Vice President Joe Biden on the lack of a no-fly zone over Aleppo, suggesting that the Obama administration will “look back and wonder what if? What if? What if? What if?” 
Of course, no campaign for saving lives with bombs would be complete without everyone’s favorite examples of feel-good destruction from the former Yugoslavia. The Washington Post ( 9/9/16 ) hosted an opinion by Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first ambassador to the UN, Muhamed Sacirbey, straightforwardly headlined: “Western Military Intervention Saved Lives in Bosnia. It Can Work in Syria, Too.” 
Sacirbey warns that “Syria’s largest city is on the brink of starvation. Bombed from the skies and besieged on the ground, Aleppo’s 2 million residents may soon be exterminated.” Gone, apparently, are the days of factchecking, when someone at the Post might have alerted the author to the reality that the vast majority of Aleppo’s residents live in government-controlled areas and are thus not under attack by said government. 
Comparing Aleppo to besieged Sarajevo, Sacirbey determines that Sarajevans ultimately “escaped many of the horrors now awaiting Aleppo’s residents… because NATO opted (albeit belatedly and, too often, inadequately) to uphold its responsibility to protect Bosnian civilians.” 
After lauding Bosnia’s no-fly zone, Sacirbey pulls this prediction out of a hat: “Limited military intervention in Syria would save civilian lives, perhaps as many as 200 a week.” 
In their indispensable essay for Monthly Review ( 10/07 ), “The Dismantling of Yugoslavia: A Study in In humanitarian Intervention (and a Western Liberal-Left Intellectual and Moral Collapse),” Edward S. Herman and David Peterson make it unavoidably clear that the West’s business in Bosnia had nothing to do with saving lives—and much to do with the contrary. 
The Bill Clinton administration, they note, actively sabotaged agreements to end the war at an earlier date, while “helping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia.” America’s support in this case for jihadists—a secret alliance also discussed by scholar Tariq Ali ( Guardian , 9/9/06 )—further complicates the assumption that the US is somehow capable of fixing the current jihad problem. 
In predictable fashion, US media led the charge to the Bosnian intervention ( Extra! , 10-11/92 ), dutifully painting the Serbs as demonic aggressors, parroting inflated Bosnian casualty estimates and otherwise behaving as the official PR arm of the establishment. 
A similar performance was repeated shortly thereafter with Kosovo, where minimal regard was given to actual facts on the ground and the specter of Serbian-waged genocide was instead hysterically invoked. Noam Chomsky ( Monthly Review , 9/08 ) cited various reports, including from the British government, that the US-backed Kosovo Liberation Army was actually responsible for more killings than the Serbs in the run-up to NATO’s bombing campaign—a project that naturally also managed to kill several thousand people. 
While Yugoslavia has now been fully dismantled, the myth of Western humanitarian intervention there has emerged unscathed; in his recent dispatch on Syria, Kristof brought up Kosovo as an example of how “the military toolbox has saved lives.” 
To be sure, “saving lives” is a much nobler goal than, say, endowing NATO with a new lease on life or clearing the way for total neoliberal assault —two outcomes of the West’s Yugoslav ventures. Hence the utility, as Herman and Peterson write, of the “edifice of lies that serves and protects the Western interventions in the former Yugoslavia—and which laid the ideological foundations for the US role in Iraq and for future so-called humanitarian interventions.” 
In Syria’s brutal war, meanwhile, humanitarian motives will presumably be utilized as a veneer for pursuing more fundamental goals, like neutralizing resistance to US/Israeli regional designs and promoting that profitable sort of chaos that produces massive arms sales. 
And just as those in the West who failed to leap onto the bandwagon in Yugoslavia were denounced as “ apologists for genocide ” and the like, opponents of increased Western military action in Syria will be increasingly assailed as pro-Assad fanatics with Syrian blood on their hands. 
One strong candidate for fanatic-hood is Greg Shupak, who in a recent Jacobin magazine dispatch ( 10/20/16 ) dared to argue that a no-fly zone “would actually represent an escalation of war that is guaranteed to harm civilians in the name of protecting them.” Emphasizing that opposition to said zone is not meant in any way “to minimize or rationalize the torture, mass killings or severe sieges enacted by the Syrian state and its allies,” Shupak continues: “The imminent question, however, is not, ‘Is the Syrian government good?’; it’s ‘Should America drop more bombs on Syria?’” 
Because, at the end of the day, humanitarian war just isn’t humanly possible.",0
10078,WATCH: Delingpole Takes Apart National Trust For Politicising Britain’s Heritage,"Breitbart London’s James Delingpole has slammed the National Trust for jumping on the political correctness bandwagon by holding a festival highlighting some of its properties’ connections to historical LGBT figures. [The festival is part of a series of events marking fifty years since the passing of legislation partially decriminalising homosexuality in the UK, dubbed the ‘Prejudice and Pride’ season. But, in a segment for the BBC’s Daily Politics, Delingpole took aim the National Trust for stepping beyond its mandate in promoting such politicised events.     <! [CDATA[_informq. push([’embed’])   ]]&gt, The National Trust owns and preserves many of Britain’s notable historical properties and great houses a role which Delingpole lauded  —   he often took his children to visit their properties when they were young, he said. But, he continued, “I gave up on the National Trust when it gave up on its day job. “Instead of preserving our heritage it started dabbling in politics. It came out against fox hunting and started campaigning against global warming  —   it jumped on the political correctness bandwagon. “Britain, as we’re well aware, has a fine and glorious tradition of stately homos. The Trust’s greatest director James   was a delightfully bitchy queen. But so what?” Delingpole asked. “What exactly does sexuality have to do with heritage? Aren’t there already enough   charities out there, treating us like primary school children, telling us what to think about the politically correct matters of the moment?” The National Trust, Delingpole argued “is the guardian of our history, not some trendy social justice warrior”. He concluded: “Maybe if enough of us resign our memberships, it might take the hint. ” The BBC invited a National Trust spokesman to debate Delingpole on the program, but no spokesman was offered. However, fellow guest Nus Ghani, the Conservative MP for Wealden countered “It’s important that these properties show the history of who lived there, whether they’re lesbian, gay, or transgender. I think it’s also important that the National Trust shows the stories of people that lived there that were oppressed [sic] and also the heroes as well. Suggesting that Delingpole had a racist agenda, she added: “Also it’s important that people of all backgrounds visit these properties, and I worry that’s going to upset you, when we all turn up and we don’t all look like you. ” Delingpole shot back “that’s exactly what I would expect a   member of the modern Tory party to say. ”",0

10080,FBI Releases Files on Bill Clinton's Cash for Pardons Scandal,"FBI Releases Files on Bill Clinton's Cash for Pardons Scandal November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
The FBI has an early present for Hillary Clinton. It's the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash. That fugitive was a fellow by the name of Marc Rich. His prosecutor? James Comey. 
The FBI unexpectedly released 129 pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in 2005 into President Bill Clinton’s pardon of Marc Rich, who had been married to a wealthy Democratic donor. 
The unusual timing of the release was the result of a Freedom of Information Act request that had been completed and was posted under standard FBI practice, according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. But the Clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release. 
Well of course it did. It's never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you. 
The investigation stemmed from one of several pardons Clinton made on the last day of his presidency in 2001, that of financier and international fugitive Marc Rich, whose ex-wife Denise had given to the Democratic National Committee and the entity that would later become the Clinton Foundation. 
And there's a surprise guest. 
While the files may seem dated, they invoke figures beyond the Clintons who went on to play key roles in official Washington -- including Comey. 
He served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against Rich from 1987 to 1993. As the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2002, Comey took over a criminal investigation of Clinton’s pardons. “I was stunned” at the Rich pardon, Comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in 2008. 
Clinton's people are fuming, but it was a standard FIOA request and there's nothing big here. It's just one of those things the Clintons should have gone to jail for. But didn't. Another of those.",0

An Indian Muslim, who has been residing in the United States for the past one year, has finally decided to return home after the results of the US presidential election were announced. 
Javed Ayub, a 30-year-old software developer, who had left for the US last year after getting a job offer during the dark days of intolerance in India ahead of Bihar election, had come to the realization yesterday that normalcy had finally been restored in India and hence there was no reason for him to live in a foreign land anymore. He immediately mailed his resignation letter to his boss and uploaded his resume on Naukri.com. 
Speaking to our correspondent, Mr. Ayub said, “I realized yesterday that my country needed me, but I was unsure as to whether the election results triggered the thought or I was really missing my homeland. Later when I was watching a movie…” 
“Swades?” we inquired. 
“Hmm, so while watching the movie, I could hear my heart pleading to me, “Ye jo des hai tera, swades hai tera, tujhe hai pukaaraaaa…” 
“Is it actually possible?” 
“Don’t know about yours but my heart definitely can sing.” 
“But why did you leave India in the first place?” 
“Well, let’s be honest, things were not that great last year.” 
“But nothing has changed since then. People still fight over issues they are not remotely concerned about in reality.” 
“That happens only on the internet. Do the same people fight in real world? No.” 
“But can you really live peacefully amid sanghis and bhakts?” 
“Arrey, no no, we never classified anyone. When there are 1.25 billion people living together, there will be difference of opinions, but we need to resolve our differences amicably, because at the end of the day, we are one big family.” 
“Anyway, that was a good decision. So, whom did you support in the US election?” 
“Hillary Clinton.” 
“Was it because of Trump’s anti-Muslim statements or was there any other reason behind it?”

10083,Baltimore Agrees to Broad Change for Troubled Police Dept. - The New York Times,"BALTIMORE  —   Nearly two years after the death of a black man in police custody led to violent riots here, the Justice Department and city leaders announced on Thursday a   agreement to impose greater oversight and training on a police force found to have routinely harassed minorities. Negotiators have been rushing for weeks to complete the deal before the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald J. Trump and the expected confirmation of his attorney general pick, Senator Jeff Sessions. Both men are seen as hostile to police oversight agreements like the one put in place on Thursday, with Mr. Trump denouncing what he called the “war on police” during his presidential campaign. Justice Department negotiators are moving quickly to complete a second investigation in Chicago, which has also been wracked by violence and tension between the police and residents. The findings of that investigation could come as early as Friday. Announcing the Baltimore deal at City Hall, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said she was confident that the reforms mandated by the deal would take hold even if the Trump administration were to take steps to try to undo it. “This agreement is binding and it will live on,” said Ms. Lynch, flanked by Mayor Catherine Pugh, Police Commissioner Kevin Davis, Vanita Gupta, the head of the civil rights division at the Justice Department, and others. Mr. Davis said the pact provides “a path forward” that he said will benefit both his officers and the city’s residents and that it should serve as a model for thousands of other police departments in tackling tensions. Baltimore came under Justice Department scrutiny after an   man, Freddie Gray, 25, died of a spinal cord injury he received while in police custody in 2015 as he was being transported in a department van. The death led to widespread protests  —   Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, called in the National Guard to quell riots  —   and appeals for federal intervention. In the ensuing political fallout, the Democratic mayor, Stephanie   dismissed the police chief and six officers were charged in Mr. Gray’s death none were convicted. The episode roiled racial tensions nationwide amid a string of other deaths of black men in police confrontations nationwide, from Ferguson, Mo. to Staten Island. The Justice Department filed a   consent decree in federal court on Thursday just minutes before announcing the deal. A judge must approve it before the city and the Police Department begin putting in place more than a dozen changes, including improved training and technology, community oversight, and greater transparency in dealings between the police and the public. Once that is done, the crucial first step will almost surely fall to the Trump administration: working with the city to recommend an outside, independent monitor to determine whether Baltimore is adequately taking steps to address what a blistering Justice Department report in August found was systemic racial bias in its policing. Ms. Pugh, a Democrat who has been in office 33 days, recounted hectic, 1:30 a. m. phone calls with negotiators in the weeks leading up to the agreement. She called the results “a great day” for Baltimore. She made clear what she considered the most important element: “training, training, training, training. ” The agreement requires officers to go through 80 hours of training in practices like community policing and proper tactics for stops, searches and arrests. Another measure will require improved safety technology and video cameras inside police vans like the one used to transport Mr. Gray when he died. The Justice Department’s report on city policing last year found that officers routinely stopped large numbers of people in poor, black neighborhoods for dubious reasons, and arrested residents merely for speaking out in ways police officers deemed disrespectful. In Baltimore, a city that is 63 percent black, the report found that 91 percent of those arrested on discretionary offenses like “failure to obey” or “trespassing” were  . Blacks made up 60 percent of Baltimore’s drivers but accounted for 82 percent of traffic stops. Of the 410 pedestrians who were stopped at least 10 times in the five and a half years of data reviewed, 95 percent were black. The findings also painted a picture of a police culture deeply dismissive of sexual assault victims and hostile toward prostitutes and transgender people. The decree’s requirements are intended to prohibit unlawful stops and arrests, and to prevent discriminatory policing and excessive force. Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, called the agreement “a chance to   trust” between residents and the police after a painful few years. DeRay Mckesson, a   voice in the Black Lives Matter movement who lives in Baltimore, said he was impressed by the decree’s wide range. “It is the first consent decree that I have seen that addresses the Police Department’s internal affairs division,” Mr. Mckesson said by text message, “and goes further to ensure that officers are not targeting poor citizens or citizens in historically ‘ ’ areas and addresses the response to citizens in crisis or with mental health challenges. ” Provisions of the decree prohibit the police from stopping people based solely on where they are, or how they respond to the presence of a police officer. The Supreme Court has ruled that officers can stop a person who flees from them in   neighborhoods. “This starts to push back on that line and says, ‘Look, we’re really reinforcing that people have a right to avoid contact with the police and the place they live shouldn’t be an important factor in how much Fourth Amendment protection they get,’” said David Jaros, an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore. “But at the same time,” Mr. Jaros added, “it’s ambiguous as to what its reach is,” and whether it limits police actions further than existing law does. Tessa   the president of Baltimore’s branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said she was heartened to see that the Police Department had already implemented reforms  —   like testing body cameras and changing aspects of prisoner transport  —   and hoped the consent decree would bring more. But Tawanda Jones, the sister of Tyrone West, who died in 2013 after a struggle with the police, said the rush to finish the deal and the coming handover of power in Washington had eroded her faith that the decree would bring about meaningful change in Baltimore. “What does a piece of paper mean? It means nothing,” Ms. Jones said. “It’s not a training issue it’s a system that is broke. It’s a system that doesn’t hold people accountable. ”",0
10084,"Meet The Hitler Of Congo, Who Unleashed New Horrors On The African Continent","His name is King Leopold II of Belgium and the living incarnation of evil killed over 10 million innocent people in what is now called the Democratic Republic of Congo. Of the Europeans who scrambled for control of Africa at the end of the 19th century, Belgium’s King Leopold II left arguably the largest and most horrid legacy of all. — BBC 
Via AnonHQ 

Reign Of Terror To fulfill his dream to establish Belgium as an imperial power, Leopold led the first European efforts to develop the Congo River basin, founded his own private colony – the Congo Free State – in 1885 with the pretext to improve the lives of the native inhabitants, only to annex it as the Belgian Congo in 1908.
Under the reign of terror instituted by Leopold, as many as 10 million Africans lost their lives to one man’s greed, exploitation and brutality that Africa and the world must not forget. Presenting himself as a philanthropist eager to open the heart of Africa to Christian missionaries, Western capitalists, and Western civilization, Leopold embarked on an ultimately successful effort to make a vast fortune from his new possession by committing widespread atrocities against his colonial subjects.
He “bought” the Congo and enslaved its people, turning the entire country into his own personal slave plantation. He disguised his business transactions as “philanthropic” and “scientific” efforts under the banner of the International African Society. He used their enslaved labor to extract Congolese resources and services. His reign was enforced through work camps, body mutilations, executions, torture, and his private army. — Films For Action
The photo above shows a man named Nsala Wala with his daughter’s hand and foot. Alice Harris, working as a missionary in the Congo, took the photo in May 1904, after he had come into her mission at Baringa with a small package containing the severed body parts.
Leopold never set foot in “his” Congo — for all the 23 years — but his “rubber terror” and barbarity knew no bounds. Since the Congo economy was largely operated by forced labour, the effects were devastating. 10 million Congolese were either murdered or worked to death by Leopold’s private army. Women were starved and systematically raped, worker’s hands were cut off and hundreds and thousands of indigenous people endured kidnapping, looting and village burnings. Adam Hochschild, author of King Leopold’s Ghost, writes:
“Some were beaten or whipped to death for failing to meet the rigid production quotas for ivory and rubber harvests, imposed by Leopold’s agents. Some were worked to death, forced to labor in slave like conditions as porters, rubber gatherers or miners for little or no pay. Some died of the diseases introduced to (and spread throughout) the Congo by Europeans. And still others died from the increasingly frequent famines that swept the Congo basin as Leopold’s army rampaged through the countryside, appropriating food and crops for its own use while destroying villages and fields.
“Hostage-taking and the grisly severing of hands (from corpses or from living human beings) were part of the government’s deliberate policy — a means of terrorizing others into submission. As the “rubber terror” spread through the Congolese rain forest, entire villages were wiped out: Hundreds of dead bodies were dumped in rivers and lakes, while baskets of severed hands were routinely presented to white officers as evidence of how many people had been killed.”
The Curious Case of World Ignorance Ever wondered why the world and the media don’t remember Leopold and why his name doesn’t produce fear, hatred, and sorrow? Leopold ensured that his crimes would never make it into the history books. Shortly after the turnover of the colony, Hochschild writes, the furnaces near Leopold’s palace burned for eight days, turning most of the Congo state records to ash and smoke.
Is there a hidden agenda to not talk about genocides in Africa perpetrated by European capitalist monarchs? There’s a Wikipedia page called “Genocides in History” but the Congolese Genocide isn’t included in the list despite the fact that attempting to eliminate a portion of the population is enough to qualify as genocide under the UN convention. Wonder why?
He’s part of a long history of colonialism, imperialism, slavery and genocide in Africa that would clash with the social construction of the white supremacist narrative in our schools. It doesn’t fit neatly into a capitalist curriculum. Stories which support the white supremacist narrative about the sub-humanness of people in Africa are allowed to be entered into the records of history. The white guy who turned the Congo into his own personal part-plantation, part-concentration camp, part-Christian ministry and killed 10 to 15 million Congolese people in the process doesn’t make the cut. — Liam O’Ceallaigh

10085,Preventing Crime in New Jersey,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - 
Recently, around midnight, two young men were trying to steal some money from my car. Unknowingly, they tripped the car alarm and I woke up as soon as it went off since my bedroom is very close to the driveway. They stole my registration and insurance card. I immediately called Middle Township Police. The police were very kind and helpful, and I'd like to thank them. This is one example of many of increasing terror/criminal activities in New Jersey, which is an issue we need to address without delay. We have to make sure we are taking appropriate action to deter crimes throughout New Jersey. According to a report on NJ.com, the 2015 FBI data showed there were 363 murders in New Jersey -- up from 349 the previous year. The slight bump increased the rate to 4.1 murders per 100,000 residents. Sexual assault, murder, manslaughter, rape, and robbery are also increasing. Last month, in some counties, disputes between police and criminals resulted in shootings. Crime seems to be rising steadily and violently at an accelerating rate in New Jersey's major counties. The above-mentioned issues might affect tourism, which in turn will affect New Jersey's economy as a whole. New Jersey is a beautiful state but recently, higher taxes, limited job opportunities, crimes and poorly paid workers are adding to poverty, and need to be addressed properly. I think this has and will hinder the growth of New Jersey's economy and the rise of crime now and in the future. The executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Yury Fedotov, told the Convention in Vienna, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development acknowledged that confronting crime and promoting the rule of law were essential to the achievement of the sustainable-development goals. World Health Organization said, ""We need to integrate violence prevention into social and educational policies, and thereby promote social equality."" There is a variety of intervention programs we need to implement that may help people, especially young people, stop committing crimes. If our goal is to reduce crimes then programs related to those should be located in local areas. We also need a systematic approach to support schools to activate their involvement against crime activities to develop these kinds of programs that will demonstrate positive results. We also need to teach crime-resolution skills to our small children. In my opinion, the key to making New Jersey less dangerous is to reduce the time and effort that makes it so expensive to arrest and convict the guilty people, costing more for New Jersey as a whole. I think creating more job opportunities will reduce the crime. It is a basic human right to live crime-free and from being a victim of one. - Advertisement - However, many countries around the globe failed to identify the problems and have no program against it that has left many people with no choice but to become a victim of crime. There is an urgent need for crime protection and human-rights monitoring. - Advertisement -",0
10086,London Gets More N.F.L. Games. Too Bad About the Teams. - The New York Times,"Hey, London! You love American football? Well, great news, we’re sending you the Browns! Don’t worry, you’ll be getting the Jaguars and the Rams, too. The N. F. L. announced on Tuesday the teams that will be heading to London next season for a record four   games. The matchups are, well, not great. In Weeks 3 and 4, Wembley Stadium, the spiritual home of soccer, will get   and  . In Weeks 7 and 8, Twickenham, rugby’s iconic stadium, will get   and  . Fans in Britain have shown little discernment over the N. F. L. fare served up to them over the years, generally selling out every game in no time. Perhaps that explains why the league isn’t bothering to send over Tom Brady or Dak Prescott next season. This lineup will test even the most enthusiastic Briton’s patience. The Jaguars have become a virtual home team for London, and they will play a game there for the fifth consecutive season. That may be in part because they have not had a winning record since 2007. At   they are staggering to another disastrous year. The Jaguars have been rumored to be the team most likely to move to London if the N. F. L. decides to put a franchise there. Their opponents, the Ravens, at least have a winning record. But after losing to the Patriots on Monday night, the Ravens are uncertain for a playoff spot. Next fall is a long way away, but right now this quarterback matchup would be Blake Bortles vs. Joe Flacco. Perhaps the most unpredictable game on the London schedule is  . After a run of mediocrity, the Dolphins have sprung to life this year at   although the playoffs are by no means secured. The Saints, expected by many to bounce back this year, are a sad  . There is no telling what these teams will be like come September. The Cardinals have been one of the season’s biggest disappointments, slipping from Super Bowl contenders to    afterthoughts. Carson Palmer will be 37 next season, so it is hard to see a huge improvement. But at least they are not the Rams:   in their new home, Los Angeles, having just fired their coach, Jeff Fisher. And, of course, the Browns. On pace to be the second   team in N. F. L. history, they are perhaps the worst advertisement possible for the American game. The Vikings, their opponent, are   but two games behind the Lions  —   the Lions!  —   and looking at a   season as well. The N. F. L. points out that after the coming season, 26 of its teams will have played in London since the games began in 2007. That does include the Patriots, twice, including a game in 2012, a year after they were in the Super Bowl. This year’s   schedule included the Redskins, coming off a playoff season, and the Giants, a strong possibility for this year’s playoffs. The teams that have not played in London include some of the league’s most popular: the Seahawks, the Packers and the Eagles. The Panthers, the Texans and the Titans have also not made the trip. The N. F. L. must deal with television networks, who prefer that the good teams play at good hours, not early in the morning on United States time. And popular teams that pack their stadiums are reluctant to give up home games. Teams with less devoted fan bases are happy to do so because they make more money selling tickets in London. With eight slots to fill next season, the league has not rolled out its best, to say the least. At some point, football, because it is football, will lose its sheen for fans in Britain. They may start demanding better matchups, or even a team of their own. Until then, we may not see much meaningful football in London.",0

Ilhan Omar has made history this November by becoming the first Somali-American lawmaker in U.S. history. Ilhan is a former refugee from Somalia, is Muslim and is a mother of three. Ilhan Omar has made history in the U.S. 
Ilhan won House District 60B in southeast Minneapolis with 80% of the vote. 
Ilhan, who is 34 and a Minnesota resident said: “This really was a victory for that 8-year-old in that refugee camp. This was a victory for the young woman being forced into child marriage. This was a victory for every person that’s been told they have limits on their dreams.” 
“I think I bring the voice of young people. I think I bring the voice of women in the East African community. I bring the voice of Muslims. I bring the voice of young mothers looking for opportunities.” 
She is the youngest of seven children who fled from the Somali civil war and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp. In 1995 she and her family arrived in the U.S. and Ilhan spoke only Somali. Shortly after, her English improved and she began translating for her grandfather at local political events. Ilhan Omar gives hope to her supporters. 
Omar’s husband also spoke and began to describe his wife as a strong, Muslim woman: 
“For those men — wooo! — let me tell you something. When you see a strong, African, Muslim woman, don’t be afraid, no, you know what, appreciate that. That’s the model, that’s the new 2016, going into 2017.” 
Ilhan’s focus will be on renewable energy, sustainability, justice and the common good for all people. 
Also making history on Election Day was Stockton, CA Michael Tubbs, who is 26 and is Stockton’s first black mayor. Michael Tubbs became Stockton, CA’s first black mayor. 
“We have a great opportunity to show the nation, ‘How do you reinvent yourself?’ I’m tired of talking about where we’ve been. I’m more interested in talking about where we’re going. We have to mature as a community and start demanding solutions.” 
While the Presidential Election has many outraged, perhaps we can look at the positive that has come from this election as well as intend for more positive results to come from all elected leaders. What we need now more than ever is unity and focus towards building a better world. This must begin now and it must include us all. Share this good news with everyone you know!

10089,Illinois Senator Draws Fire for Racially Charged Attack on Opponent’s Family,"Illinois Senator Draws Fire for Racially Charged Attack on Opponent’s Family Alexandra Jaffe and Traci G. Lee, NBC News, October 28, 2016 
Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk is again under fire for making racially-charged comments, this time for questioning the military service of his Democratic opponent’s family. 
During Thursday night’s debate between Kirk and challenger Rep. Tammy Duckworth, Duckworth spoke about her desire to be in the Senate as a voice of reason and referenced her family’s history of service, saying, “My family has served this nation in uniform, going back to the Revolution. I’m a daughter of the American Revolution. I’ve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound. Because people are quick to sound the drums of war, and I want to be there to say this is what it costs, this is what you’re asking us to do. . . . Families like mine are the ones that bleed first.” 
Kirk responded: “I had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.” Tammy Duckworth is a vet who lost both legs in Iraq. Her family has served since the Revolutionary War. And yet… pic.twitter.com/DHd3kWrUsN 
— Anthony Breznican (@Breznican) October 28, 2016 
Though Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to a Thai mother of Chinese descent and an American father, did not respond on the stage, she tweeted a photo after the debate of herself with her parents–her father displaying medals of service on his coat. “My mom is an immigrant and my dad and his family have served this nation in uniform since the Revolution,” Duckworth wrote. 
Duckworth’s late father, Franklin, served in World War II and has “traced his lineage back to an ancestor who fought in the American Revolution,” according to a 2012 Mother Jones profile on Duckworth’s run for Congress.

On Friday, Kirk tried to tamp down the backlash and tweeted “sincere apologies to an American hero.” 
It’s not the first time the Illinois senator has courted controversy with racially-charged comments–he previously said President Obama was “acting like the drug dealer in chief” for the administration’s cash payment to Iran in exchange for the release of American prisoners, and talked about fostering opportunities for African-American entrepreneurs so “that the black community is not the one we drive faster through.”

The Daily Caller 
Republican nominee Donald Trump is tied with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan, according to a Strategic National Poll. 
The Michigan statewide poll revealed Trump is now dead even with Clinton, in a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. 
Clinton enjoyed as much as a 13-point advantage over Trump in Michigan just two weeks ago. 
“Trump is over performing in key segments of the electorate especially in rural areas and Macomb County while Clinton is failing to get the numbers she needs out of the city of Detroit,” John Yob, CEO of Strategic National , who conducted the poll, reported. ",0
10091,"D.N.C. Says Russian Hackers Penetrated Its Files, Including Dossier on Donald Trump - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Two groups of Russian hackers, working for competing government intelligence agencies, penetrated computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and gained access to emails, chats and a trove of opposition research against Donald J. Trump, according to the party and a cybersecurity firm. One group placed espionage software on the committee’s computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion. A senior government official said Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, based in Brooklyn, also appeared to have been targeted, but it was not clear whether it lost any data. The breach at the Democratic committee was first reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post. The committee’s systems appeared to have had standard cyberprotections, which are no challenge for determined   hacking groups. The attackers were expelled last weekend with CrowdStrike’s help, the committee said. It did not provide a detailed account of what had been copied from the systems, and it may never know. The connection to Russia may be explained simply by the global fascination with the presidential campaign and the mystery surrounding Mr. Trump, who has not been a major subject of foreign intelligence collection. But it also recalls a subplot to the race: Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, previously advised   politicians in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, including former President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine. Opposition research itself is not all that valuable to a foreign government, but it can point to a candidate’s vulnerabilities. To a foreign government fascinated by an American election, any intelligence a campaign develops on an opponent could be exploited. Dmitri Alperovitch, a   of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committee’s servers  —   a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach  —   appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House. In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions. “These are incredibly sophisticated groups,” Mr. Alperovitch said. “They covered their tracks well. It wasn’t until the second group came in,” stealing the opposition research on Mr. Trump, “that their presence was detected. ” The second group, named Fancy Bear, which appeared to have attacked in April, is believed to be operated by the G. R. U. the military intelligence service. Its past targets have included military and aerospace organizations from the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and South Korea. CrowdStrike concluded that neither Russian group knew the other was attacking the same organization. “One would steal a password, and the next day the other group would steal the same password,” Mr. Alperovitch said. Mrs. Clinton said on Telemundo that she had learned of the breach only after news outlets reported it. She called it “troubling,” but said she was unsure about the hackers’ goals. “Now, why?” she asked. “We don’t know yet. So far as we know, my campaign has not been hacked into, and we’re obviously looking hard at that. But cybersecurity will be an issue that I will be absolutely focused on as president. Because whether it’s Russia, or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information, to use it to their advantage, and we can’t let that go on. ” The Office of Personnel Management, whose files on about 22 million Americans with security clearances or applications for them were breached by Chinese hackers, is still trying to assess the damage first detected last year. The Democratic committee avoided any discussion of its vulnerabilities. “The security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with,” said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic national chairwoman. “When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately. Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network. ” The party did not say how it came to suspect the intrusion. Cyberattacks by foreign governments are a constant threat to political campaigns. Because campaign operations are temporary, they often do not invest heavily in the kind of security that financial institutions, large companies and government agencies spend millions or billions of dollars on each year. And because campaigns are so   with volunteers connecting through laptops and cellphones, they are particularly vulnerable. In 2008, hackers traced to the Chinese government infiltrated the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain. “It should come as no surprise to anyone that political parties are   targets for foreign intelligence gathering,” Representative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who has been deeply involved in cyberissues, said in a statement. “Nonetheless, it is disconcerting that two independent operations were able to penetrate the D. N. C. one of which was able to stay embedded for nearly a year. ”",0
10092,Iranian Official: ’Newcomer’ Trump Would Suffer ’Unprecedented Defeat’ If he Crossed Iran,"TEL AVIV  —   A senior Iranian official goaded President Donald Trump on Sunday, insisting the U. S. would suffer an “unprecedented defeat” at the hands of an “iron dam” like Iran. [Ali Akbar Velayati, head of the Expediency Council’s Strategic Research Center, told the   Tasnim news agency that a “calculating newcomer” like Trump wouldn’t dare confront Iran, which is far more powerful than other countries the U. S. has come up against.  Velayati was responding to Trump’s veiled warning on Friday to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in which he said Rouhani “better be careful” about threatening the U. S. “We are by no means worried about Trump’s comments,” Velayati said, adding that despite Trump’s public rhetoric, the president is a calculating politician. Furthermore, the Iranian official told Tasnim, the opposition Trump faces at home among the media, judiciary and influential politicians will prevent him from doing what he wants with Iran. Velayati, who also served as Iran’s foreign minister, said the Islamic Republic was not seeking war against any country, but would not waste a moment defending itself if necessary. His comments come after Rouhani addressed the Iranian people on Friday in an event to commemorate the 38th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. “We are experiencing conditions in which some novices have come to power in the region, in the world and in the U. S. as they should all know that they have to talk to the Iranian nation with the language of respect and dignity,” Rouhani said. The following day, head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations Kamal Kharrazi described the new president as “a rookie person and a newcomer on the political scene [who] has made many mistakes. ” The commemoration of the revolution was marked with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets and celebrating by burning effigies of Trump and chanting “Death to America,” and “Death to Israel. ”",0
10093,Germany cancels Armenian genocide concert in Istanbul - after Erdogan invited to the show,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:16 UTC A concert in Istanbul by the Dresden Orchestra to mark the 1915 genocide of Armenians by the Ottomans has been cancelled by Germany. That follows reports that the musicians sent out invitations to the Turkish President and his top aides. The concert, run by the renowned Dresden Symphony Orchestra, was scheduled to take place on November 13 in the German consulate in Istanbul. Called 'Aghet' or 'catastrophe' in Armenian, the performance was to commemorate the victims of the 1915 massacre that left around 1.5 million Armenians dead and hundreds of thousands forced to flee. Turkish President Recep Erdogan was personally invited to attend the event by the orchestra, along with other top Turkish politicians , including Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu, German T-Online news outlet reports , citing DPA news agency, which gained access to copies of the invitations. The invitations were made despite Erdogan taking a hard stance against Germany's recognition of the Armenian genocide - even threatening Germany with some ""response measures."" The concert was cancelled by Berlin . On Wednesday, the German Foreign Office said that ""the premises in the Istanbul consulate are not available on November 13th,"" according to Deutsche Welle . Later in the day, orchestra director Markus Rindt said he received notification from the ministry with nearly the same content. ""It's definitely been canceled. They said they wanted to reschedule at a better time, but when would that be? This has been planned for years ,"" Rindt told Reuters. The piece by the Dresden Symphony Orchestra includes musicians from Turkey, Armenia, Germany, and the former Yugoslavia. It premiered last year in Berlin with additional performances scheduled in Belgrade on November 5 and in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on November 10. The 'Aghet' has become one of several stumbling blocks in troubled Turkey-Germany relations. In April, the Turkish ambassador to the EU demanded that the bloc stop funding the project which received initial support from the European Commission's Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture. On June 2, 2016, the German parliament almost unanimously passed a symbolic resolution recognizing the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces as 'genocide.' The move was praised by Armenia and sharply criticized by Turkey, which even tried to pressure Germany ahead of the vote. Following the move, Ankara recalled its ambassador to Germany , while Erdogan said that the government would discuss response measures. The mass killings began on April 24, 1915, when 250 Armenian intellectuals were detained by Ottoman authorities and later executed in Constantinople, present-day Istanbul. Most of the Ottoman Empire's Armenians were then displaced, deported, or placed in concentration camps on the pretext of rebelling and siding with Russia in World War I. Up to 1.5 million Armenians were affected by these measures. Turkey, the successor of the Ottoman Empire, concedes that many Armenians were mistreated at the time, but maintains that the number of victims has been grossly exaggerated. Comment: The Armenian genocide is one of Turkey's major political 'red lines' and a top priority for the Turkish lobby. (The parallels to Israel, the Nakbah, and the Israeli lobby should be obvious.) After relations between Germany and Turkey worsened this past year over the refugee crisis and Turkey's EU bid, Germany passed its Armenian genocide resolution. But after the failed coup, and with Turkey's alliance with the West shakier than ever, the Germans seem more willing to play nice. Back on September 2, FM Steinmeier made sure to reassure Turkey that the Bundestag resolution was "" non-binding "". It looks like his latest event follows a similar line of force.",0

10096,Woman Thrown in Front of Train at Times Square Subway Station Is Killed - The New York Times,"A    Queens woman was killed after being pushed in front of a subway train in Times Square on Monday, the New York Police Department said. The attack disrupted traffic at one of the city’s busiest transit hubs as trains were diverted and emergency workers converged on the scene. Assistant Chief William Aubry, the commander of Manhattan detectives, said witnesses on both the subway platform and the train itself flagged down police officers and pointed out a suspect. Melanie   a    Queens woman, was taken into custody almost immediately and later charged with   murder. The police described her as emotionally disturbed and said that she had made up a story last month about pushing a woman onto the tracks. The victim’s name was not immediately released. The police were combing through video from the platform and the area to better understand what happened, but the preliminary investigation suggested that the attack was unprovoked. The attack occurred at 1:20 p. m. when a woman was pushed in front of a No. 1 train. Swarms of police officers and emergency workers converged on the station, and subway traffic was rerouted as emergency crews worked to remove the body, which was pinned under the third car of the train. The Times   Street station is the busiest on the subway system, with 66 million annual riders. It serves 10 subway lines and the shuttle to Grand Central Station. More than 200, 000 people navigate the tunnels there every day. Cases involving people being pushed in front of subway trains are exceedingly rare, but when they occur, they strike at some of the deepest fears held by city dwellers. In 2012, when   Han of Queens was struck and killed by a train in Manhattan, The New York Post published a   photograph of him on the tracks moments before his death. Less than a month later, when another person was pushed in front of a train in an unprovoked attack, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sought to reassure jittery riders. “You can say it’s only two out of the three or four million people who ride the subway every day, but two is two too many,” Mr. Bloomberg said then. “I don’t know that there is a way to prevent things. There is always going to be somebody, a deranged person. ” In 1999, two attacks involving mentally ill people pushing unsuspecting victims into the path of trains, one fatally, led to legislation giving families the right to demand   outpatient psychiatric treatment for their ill relatives. Known as Kendra’s Law, it permits state judges to order closely monitored outpatient treatment for people with serious mental illnesses who have records of failing to take medication, and who have frequently been hospitalized or jailed or have exhibited violent behavior. The law was named for Kendra Webdale, who was pushed to her death by Andrew Goldstein. He had stopped taking the medication he had been prescribed for schizophrenia.",0
10097,"Chuck Todd: Bill O’Reilly Not a ’Traditional Conservative’ - ’Tone Setter,’ ’Anti-Political Correctness’ - Breitbart","Thursday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd was asked how he would define embattled former Fox News Channel host Bill O’Reilly on the heels of his departure from Fox News.  Todd told host Hugh Hewitt that he didn’t view O’Reilly as a traditional conservative and was more an entertainer than the rest of his Fox News Channel colleagues. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy HughHewitt. com): HEWITT: Bill O’Reilly is gone. And I have been having an argument online today with our friend, Lachlan Markay at the Daily Beast, and Chris Cillizza. I have never considered Bill a conservative. I thought he was an entertainer, bombastic and loud, and there was a reason that President Obama would much rather be interviewed by Bill O’Reilly than Chuck Todd. He was never going to take you deep and focused. What do you, where do you put him on the spectrum of people who do what we do? TODD: Look, I agree with you. He was not sort of a traditional conservative. He was, to me, he gave voice, what he did, he was the tone setter. He was sort of that   correctness. That was, if he had a true north, that was it, right? HEWITT: Yup. TODD: If there was some way he could do that story, and if he could do that every night, right, he would find a way to do some form of that every night. But what he was, was the you know, it’s like he was the opening act that brought the crowds, but he became almost more fun to watch than the concert itself, sometimes. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: But he was the entertainer, probably more entertainer than any of the others, right? And anybody else in this ecosystem is, I mean, he said it in his own statement. I thought it was incredibly   that he said informed and entertained. He used the word entertained. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: No real journalist would use that. HEWITT: Yeah, yeah. TODD: Okay, and that’s fine. I admire the   at least by saying that. But, so but he set a tone, and I think so while he was never, you cannot take an issue and say Bill O’Reilly championed that issue beyond the war, the phony war on Christmas, right? That was like a fun, that was an entertainment thing for him. But you couldn’t say championed one issue or one cause or thing like that. But what was thought, what would the conservative media ecosystem be without him? HEWITT: Well, he brought people to Fox. He built the mall, right? He built the mall, and the mall has Sean Hannity in it, who like me is a partisan. TODD: Yeah. HEWITT: But he was an anchor store in a mall, but he was not selling conservative goods. That’s what I’ve always said. I’ve got to ask you about, though, the other thing. And I’m, I don’t, allegations are allegations. There are a lot of them about it. I just point out I’ve been doing this since ’89. I’ve never had one allegation against me. And last time I was on your set, I’m sitting next to Tom Brokaw, who’s been doing this a lot longer than that, and there’s never been one allegation against him. You know, it is a business in which it’s possible to be professional and a gentleman without ever attracting these kinds of charges. TODD: It is. And the fact of the matter is, look, here’s my understanding of what happened. The board of directors at 21st Century Fox said this is just bad for business. And I, the culture is bad for business. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: Obviously, advertisers are speaking. What are you doing? You’re paying all this money. And look, you cannot help but connect O’Reilly to Ailes and say there had to be a culture of look the other way if the guy approving settlements was also accused. So you know, it really underscores this idea that this stuff happens when you create a culture of tolerance for it. HEWITT: Yeah, workplace dynamic matters. I will say this as an NBC guy now, if they put Tucker Carlson in there, and they give Dana that hour, that’s stiff winds for us, because they’re both serious people and they’re smart. And that’s what we have to  …     TODD: You know, I don’t want to get into the lineup. I have, let’s just say there’s a lot of people who have a lot of theories about, I will say this. I think there has never been more, if you enjoy watching the cable news prime time game, I would just say this. There’s never been more jump balls. HEWITT: Exactly. TODD: The big guy, the big guy on the block looks more vulnerable than ever. Golden State, they look like, you know, it’s like Golden State without Kevin Durant. It looks pretty beatable. HEWITT: Wait a minute. You’re talking about the Cavaliers without LeBron, Chuck. TODD: Oh, sorry. That’s right. I’m sorry. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
10098,It Turns Out Spending More Probably Does Improve Education - The New York Times,"If you spend more on education, will students do better? Educators, politicians and unions have battled in court over that crucial question for decades, most recently in a sweeping decision this fall in Connecticut, where a judge ordered the state to revamp nearly every facet of its education policies, from graduation requirements to special education, along with its school funding. For many years, research on the relationship between spending and student learning has been surprisingly inconclusive. Many other factors, including student poverty, parental education and the way schools are organized, contribute to educational results. Teasing out the specific effect of money spent is methodologically difficult. Opponents of increased school funding have seized on that ambiguity to argue that, for schools, money doesn’t matter  —   and, therefore, more money isn’t needed. But new,     research suggests that conclusion is mistaken. Money really does matter in education, which could provide fresh momentum for more lawsuits and judgments like the Connecticut decision. The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in July, was conducted by the economists Julien Lafortune and Jesse Rothstein of the University of California at Berkeley and Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach of Northwestern. They examined student test scores in 26 states that have changed the way they fund schools since 1990, usually in response to a lawsuit like Connecticut’s, and compared them with those in 23 states that haven’t. While no two states did exactly the same thing, they all had the effect of increasing funding for the poorest districts. The   time frame is important: That’s when courts changed how they think about states’ obligations to public schoolchildren. Previously, nearly all school funding lawsuits focused on the question of “equity”  —   did disadvantaged students receive funding equal to that of their   peers? The problem with that perspective was the answer could be “yes,” even if funding was too low across the board. Starting with a 1990 court case in Kentucky, courts started asking about “adequacy” instead. Were school districts getting enough money, which might require giving extra money to districts that enroll many      students? “There’s been this wave of school finance reform across the country over the last few decades,” Mr. Rothstein said. “I think it’s fair to say it’s the largest reform aimed at equity since school desegregation, and we really didn’t know what the impacts were. There’s now growing evidence, from my work and from others, that those reforms did lead to improved achievement and improved outcomes for children in   school districts. ” Mr. Lafortune, Mr. Rothstein and Ms. Schanzenbach also solved a difficult methodological problem that had plagued school finance researchers for decades. More money isn’t an end unto itself  —   the goal is to produce better results. But before the recent widespread adoption of the Common Core State Standards, every state had its own standards and related tests. That made it hard to compare academic results from one state to another. The researchers took advantage of the one test that is taken by a representative sample of schoolchildren nationwide: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is administered by the Department of Education. Although NAEP results are usually published only for whole states and a small number of large urban school districts, the researchers got the education department to let them analyze individual student scores. Those results include information on the  ’s race and income, as well as school district attended. The researchers could compare performance in poor and wealthy districts before and after changes in spending. They found a consistent pattern: In the long run, over comparable time frames, states that send additional money to their   school districts see more academic improvement in those districts than states that don’t. The size of the effect was significant. The changes bought at least twice as much achievement per dollar as a   experiment that decreased class sizes in the early grades. Another paper, published this year in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, looked at the same question through a different lens. That study examined   outcomes, like how long students stayed in school and how much they earned as adults, for students in districts with and without   funding changes. Here, too, researchers saw gains with more money spent. That study was conducted by C. Kirabo Jackson of Northwestern, Rucker C. Johnson from the University of California at Berkeley and Claudia Persico, then a graduate student at Northwestern and now an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin. They examined outcomes for about 15, 000 people, born between 1955 and 1985, and found that for poor children, a 10 percent increase in   spending each year of elementary and secondary school was associated with wages that were nearly 10 percent higher, a drop in the incidence of adult poverty and roughly six additional months of schooling. “The notion that spending doesn’t matter is just not true,” Mr. Jackson said. “We found that exposure to higher levels of public   spending when you’re in school has a pretty large beneficial effect on the adult outcomes of kids, and that those effects are much more pronounced for children from   families. ” Donald J. Trump’s recent nomination of Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican   and longtime supporter of private school vouchers, to be secretary of education probably won’t help the cause of those who want to use this research to spend more in   public school districts. But because 92 percent of all   funding comes from state and local sources, the decision won’t be up to her. It will lie with state lawmakers who now have a better reason to invest more in school districts educating children who have the least money. What the studies do not offer, notes Jennifer Alexander, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition for Achievement Now, a group that backs charter schools and other overhauls, is robust information on the best use of the money. “How money is spent is equally important,” she said, “and I don’t think we have enough information about that from these studies. ” Mr. Rothstein cautioned that the idea that states could erase the achievement gap between poor and middle class students by simply cutting a few checks was unrealistic. “There has been a tendency to expect magic from these reforms,” he said. But a change does not have to solve a problem completely, he said, to be valuable. “We should consider them successful if they contribute in a meaningful way to closing the gap,” Mr. Rothstein said. “We have to make some assessment as to whether it’s enough to matter, but enough to matter can be quite a bit less than totally eliminating it. ”",0
10099,California Today: ‘Zoot Suit’ Memories - The New York Times," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Today’s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles, and the photographer Melissa Lyttle. When “Zoot Suit” made its debut in New York in 1979, it was the first time a Chicano show had made it to Broadway. But the musical by Luis Valdez was a distinctly Los Angeles production: it was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving      youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against   in the summer of 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group’s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the downtown stage for the first time since 1978. When tickets went on sale late last year, the production sold out quickly and has since been extended three separate times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and enthusiasm demonstrates how the play touches a deep nerve in Los Angeles, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to hear what the play means to them.

[MILO beat Vice   Mike Pence for the top vote, receiving 70, 000 votes, over 80% of all votes. Pence also received a formidable 23, 000 votes.    LGBTQ Nation say interview with MILO will be released next week. In their announcement of the award, LGBTQ Nation noted some of the allegedly “awful” reasons why MILO made the news in 2016, before acknowledging the Breitbart senior editor’s ability to influence the news cycle.  Yiannopoulos made the news throughout 2016 and always for truly awful reasons. He was a queer cheerleader for Donald Trump, whom he called “Daddy. ” He has harassed and demeaned transgender people repeatedly. Hate him or love him, one thing Yiannopoulos truly excels at is getting attention for himself and his causes. If he decides to highlight an issue, his fans will follow his every word on the subject and more often than not, it’ll get moved to a mainstream audience as the story picks up steam from online chatter. For a gay guy from Britain, he has truly made his mark on conservative American politics and entertainment. He’s been able to brand himself the ultimate gay provocateur in a year of provocateurs. Yiannopoulos, however, wanted to add to his list of accomplishments in 2016, telling LGBTQ Nation his list included, “My banishment from Twitter, recently announced book deal (  now!)   college tour, my jawline, and a really cute Siberian fox  sable fur I just snapped up. ” LGBTQ Nation’s editorial staff added a note to the article indicating they removed a reference to MILO as a member of the   movement.

10101,"Elie Wiesel, Auschwitz Survivor and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Dies at 87 - The New York Times","Elie Wiesel, the Auschwitz survivor who became an eloquent witness for the six million Jews slaughtered in World War II and who, more than anyone else, seared the memory of the Holocaust on the world’s conscience, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87. Menachem Rosensaft, a longtime friend and the founding chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, confirmed the death in a phone call. Mr. Wiesel, a charismatic lecturer and humanities professor, was the author of several dozen books. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But he was defined not so much by the work he did as by the gaping void he filled. In the aftermath of the Germans’ systematic massacre of Jews, no voice had emerged to drive home the enormity of what had happened and how it had changed mankind’s conception of itself and of God. For almost two decades, the traumatized survivors  —   and American Jews,   that they had not done more to rescue their brethren  —   seemed frozen in silence. But by the sheer force of his personality and his gift for the haunting phrase, Mr. Wiesel, who had been liberated from Buchenwald as a    with the indelible tattoo   on his arm, gradually exhumed the Holocaust from the burial ground of the history books. It was this speaking out against forgetfulness and violence that the Nobel committee recognized when it awarded him the peace prize in 1986. “Wiesel is a messenger to mankind,” the Nobel citation said. “His message is one of peace, atonement and human dignity. His belief that the forces fighting evil in the world can be victorious is a   belief. ” Mr. Wiesel first gained attention in 1960 with the English translation of “Night,” his autobiographical account of the horrors he witnessed in the camps as a teenage boy. He wrote of how he had been plagued by guilt for having survived while millions died, and tormented by doubts about a God who would allow such slaughter. “Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed,” Mr. Wiesel wrote. “Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself. Never. ” Mr. Wiesel went on to write novels, books of essays and reportage, two plays and even two cantatas. While many of his books were nominally about topics like Soviet Jews or Hasidic masters, they all dealt with profound questions resonating out of the Holocaust: What is the sense of living in a universe that tolerates unimaginable cruelty? How could the world have been mute? How can one go on believing? Mr. Wiesel asked the questions in spare prose and without raising his voice he rarely offered answers. “If I survived, it must be for some reason,” he told Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times in an interview in 1981. “I must do something with my life. It is too serious to play games with anymore, because in my place, someone else could have been saved. And so I speak for that person. On the other hand, I know I cannot. ” There may have been better chroniclers who evoked the hellish minutiae of the German death machine. There were arguably more illuminating philosophers. But no single figure was able to combine Mr. Wiesel’s moral urgency with his magnetism, which emanated from his deeply lined face and eyes as unrelievable melancholy. “He has the look of Lazarus about him,” the Roman Catholic writer François Mauriac wrote of Mr. Wiesel, a friend. President Obama, who visited the site of the Buchenwald concentration camp with Mr. Wiesel in 2009, called him a “living memorial. ” “He raised his voice, not just against   but against hatred, bigotry and intolerance in all its forms,” the president said in a statement on Saturday. “He implored each of us, as nations and as human beings, to do the same, to see ourselves in each other and to make real that pledge of ‘never again. ’” Mr. Wiesel long grappled with what he called his “dialectical conflict”: the need to recount what he had seen and the futility of explaining an event that defied reason and imagination. In his Nobel speech, he said that what he had done with his life was to try “to keep memory alive” and “to fight those who would forget. ” “Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices,” he said. A year earlier, on April 19, 1985, Mr. Wiesel stirred deep emotions when, at a White House ceremony at which he accepted the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement, he tried to dissuade President Ronald Reagan from taking time from a planned trip to West Germany to visit a military cemetery there, in Bitburg, where members of Hitler’s elite Waffen SS were buried. “That place, Mr. President, is not your place,” he said. “Your place is with victims of the SS. ” Mr. Reagan, amid much criticism, went ahead and laid a wreath at Bitburg. Paradoxically, the confrontation led to Mr. Wiesel’s first postwar visit to Germany. He said afterward that he had been extremely moved by the young German students he met and the depth of their painful search for an understanding of their country’s past. He urged reconciliation. “Has Germany ever asked us to forgive?” Mr. Wiesel asked. “To my knowledge, no such plea was ever made. With whom am I to speak about forgiveness, I, who don’t believe in collective guilt? Who am I to believe in collective innocence?” Mr. Wiesel had a leading role in the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, serving as chairman of the commission that united rival survivor groups to raise funds for a permanent structure. The museum became one of Washington’s most powerful attractions. “He was a singular moral voice,” said Sara J. Bloomfield, the museum’s director. “And he brought a kind of moral and intellectual leadership and eloquence, not only to the memory of the Holocaust, but to the lessons of the Holocaust, that was just incomparable. There is nothing that can replace the survivor voice  —   that power, that authenticity. ” In his 1966 book, “The Jews of Silence: A Personal Report on Soviet Jewry,” Mr. Wiesel called attention to Jews who were being persecuted for their religion and yet barred from emigrating. “What torments me most is not the Jews of silence I met in Russia, but the silence of the Jews I live among today,” he said. His efforts helped ease emigration restrictions. Mr. Wiesel condemned the massacres in Bosnia in the    —   “If this is Auschwitz again, we must mobilize the whole world,” he said  —   and denounced others in Cambodia, Rwanda and the Darfur region of Sudan. He condemned the burnings of black churches in the United States and spoke out on behalf of the blacks of South Africa and the tortured political prisoners of Latin America. Yet the plight of Jews was foremost. In 2013, when the United States was in talks with Iran about limiting that country’s nuclear weapons capability, Mr. Wiesel took out a   advertisement in The Times urging Mr. Obama to insist on a “total dismantling of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure” and its “repudiation of genocidal intent against Israel. ” Central to Mr. Wiesel’s work was reconciling the concept of a benevolent God with the evil of the Holocaust. “Usually we say, ‘God is right,’ or ‘God is just’  —   even during the Crusades we said that,” he once observed. “But how can you say that now, with one million children dead?” Still, he never abandoned faith indeed, he became more devout as the years passed, praying near his home or in Brooklyn’s Hasidic synagogues. On the airplane that was to take him to an Israel darkened by the   war in 1973, he sat shoeless with a friend, and together they hummed Hasidic melodies. “If I have problems with God, why should I blame the Sabbath?” he once said. Mr. Wiesel had his detractors. The literary critic Alfred Kazin wondered whether he had embellished some stories, and questions were raised about whether “Night” was a memoir or a novel, as it was sometimes classified on high school reading lists. Mr. Wiesel blazed a trail that produced libraries of Holocaust literature and countless film and television dramatizations. While some of this work was enduring, he denounced much of it as “trivialization. ” What gave him his moral authority in particular was that Mr. Wiesel, as a pious Torah student, had lived the hell of Auschwitz in his flesh. Eliezer Wiesel was born on Sept. 30, 1928, in the small city of Sighet, in the Carpathian Mountains near the Ukrainian border in what was then Romania. His father, Shlomo, was a   shopkeeper worldly enough to encourage his son to learn modern Hebrew and introduce him to the works of Freud. Later in life, Mr. Wiesel was able to describe his father in less saintly terms, as a preoccupied man he rarely saw until they were thrown together in Auschwitz. His mother, the former Sarah Feig, and his maternal grandfather, Dodye Feig, a Viznitz Hasid, filled his imagination with mystical tales of Hasidic masters. He grew up with his three sisters, Hilda, Batya and Tzipora, in a setting reminiscent of Sholom Aleichem’s stories. “You went out on the street on Saturday and felt Shabbat in the air,” he wrote of his community of 15, 000 Jews. But his idyllic childhood was shattered in the spring of 1944 when the Nazis marched into Hungary. With Allied troops fast approaching, many of Sighet’s Jews convinced themselves that they might be spared. But the city’s Jews were swiftly confined to two ghettos and then assembled for deportation. “One by one, they passed in front of me,” he wrote in “Night,” “teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs. ” “Night” recounted a journey of several days spent in an airless cattle car before the narrator and his family arrived in a place they had never heard of: Auschwitz. Mr. Wiesel recalled how the smokestacks filled the air with the stench of burning flesh, how babies were burned in a pit, and how a monocled Dr. Josef Mengele decided, with a wave of a bandleader’s baton, who would live and who would die. Mr. Wiesel watched his mother and his sister Tzipora walk off to the right, his mother protectively stroking Tzipora’s hair. “I did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever,” he wrote. In Auschwitz and in a nearby labor camp called Buna, where he worked loading stones onto railway cars, Mr. Wiesel turned feral under the pressures of starvation, cold and daily atrocities. “Night” recounts how he became so obsessed with getting his plate of soup and crust of bread that he watched guards beat his father with an iron bar while he had “not flickered an eyelid” to help. When Buna was evacuated as the Russians approached, its prisoners were forced to run for miles through high snow. Those who stumbled were crushed in the stampede. After the prisoners were taken by train to another camp, Buchenwald, Mr. Wiesel watched his father succumb to dysentery and starvation and shamefully confessed that he had wished to be relieved of the burden of sustaining him. When his father’s body was taken away on Jan. 29, 1945, he could not weep. “I had no more tears,” he wrote. On April 11, after eating nothing for six days, Mr. Wiesel was among those liberated by the United States Third Army. Years later, he identified himself in a famous photograph among the skeletal men lying supine in a Buchenwald barracks. Only after the war did he learn that his two elder sisters had not perished. In the days after Buchenwald’s liberation, he decided that he had survived to bear witness, but vowed that he would not speak or write of what he had seen for 10 years. “I didn’t want to use the wrong words,” he once explained. He was placed on a train of 400 orphans that was diverted to France, and he was assigned to a home in Normandy under the care of a Jewish organization. There he mastered French by reading the classics, and in 1948 he enrolled in the Sorbonne. He supported himself as a tutor, a Hebrew teacher and a translator and began writing for the French newspaper L’Arche. In 1948, L’Arche sent him to Israel to report on that newly founded state. He became the Paris correspondent for the daily Yediot Ahronot as well, and in that role he interviewed Mr. Mauriac, who encouraged him to write about his war experiences. In 1956 he produced an   memoir in Yiddish. Pared to 127 pages and translated into French, it then appeared as “La Nuit. ” It took more than a year to find an American publisher, Hill  Wang, which offered him an advance of just $100. Though well reviewed, the book sold only 1, 046 copies in the first 18 months. “The Holocaust was not something people wanted to know about in those days,” Mr. Wiesel told Time magazine in 1985. The mood shifted after Adolf Eichmann was captured in Argentina by Israel in 1960 and the wider world, in watching his televised trial in Jerusalem, began to grasp anew the enormity of the German crimes. Mr. Wiesel began speaking more widely, and as his popularity grew, he came to personify the Holocaust survivor. “Night” went on to sell more than 10 million copies, three million of them after Oprah Winfrey picked it for her book club in 2006 and traveled with Mr. Wiesel to Auschwitz. Mr. Wiesel wrote an average of a book a year, 60 books by his own count in 2015. Many were translated from French by his   wife, Marion Erster Rose, who survived the war hidden in Vichy, France. They married in Jerusalem in 1969, when Mr. Wiesel was 40, and they had one son, Shlomo Elisha. They survive him, as do a stepdaughter, Jennifer Rose, and two grandchildren. For Mr. Wiesel, fame did not erase the scars left by the Holocaust  —   the nightmares, the perpetual insecurity, the inability to laugh deeply. “I live in constant fear,” he said in 1983. In 2007, a    man who called Mr. Wiesel’s account of the Holocaust fictitious pulled him out of a hotel elevator in San Francisco and attacked him. (The man was convicted of assault.) From 1972 to 1976, Mr. Wiesel was a professor of Judaic studies at City College, where many of his students were children of survivors. In 1976 he was appointed the Andrew W. Mellon professor in the humanities at Boston University, and that job became his institutional anchor. In an effort to promote understanding between conflicting ethnic groups, Mr. Wiesel also started the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. Through a synagogue acquaintance of Mr. Wiesel’s, it invested its endowment with the money manager Bernard L. Madoff, and his   Ponzi scheme, revealed in 2008, cost the foundation $15 million. Mr. Wiesel and his wife lost millions of dollars in personal savings as well. Mr. Wiesel lived long enough to achieve a particular satisfying redemption. In 2002, he dedicated a museum in his hometown, Sighet, in the very house from which he and his family had been deported to Auschwitz. With uncommon emotion, he told the young Romanians in the crowd, “When you grow up, tell your children that you have seen a Jew in Sighet telling his story. ”",0
10102,Backpage’s Sex Ads Are Gone. Child Trafficking? Hardly. - The New York Times,"OAKLAND, Calif.  —   Since she was 14, Tiffany says, she has been sold for sex, offered via hundreds of advertisements on Backpage. com, a website that grew rich on classified ads for services like escorts, body rubs and exotic dancers. Far from being a marketplace for consensual exchanges, Backpage, the authorities said, often used teasers like “Amber Alert” and “Lolita” to signal that children were for sale. In the midst of a Senate investigation, a federal grand jury inquiry in Arizona, two federal lawsuits and criminal charges in California accusing Backpage’s operators of pimping children, the website abruptly bowed to pressure in January and replaced its sex ads with the word “Censored” in red. Even so, Tiffany  —   a street name  —   did not stop using the site, she said. Instead, her ads moved to Backpage’s dating section. “New in town,” read a recent one, using words that have become code for selling sex. “Looking for someone to hang out with. ” Other recent dating ads listed one female as “100% young” and suggested that “oh daddy can i be your candy. ” In the fight against child sex trafficking, shutting down an epicenter like Backpage was a major victory, but one against a relentless foe that quickly unfurled new tentacles. The demise of Backpage’s adult ads undermined the trade, but it also illustrated how difficult it is to stamp out the practice of selling children for sex. The crime is rarely punished with the full force of the law  —   charges like rape or statutory rape  —   officials say in many places it leads to just a citation, instead of an arrest. For Tiffany, 18, the demise of Backpage’s adult listings has made things far more unpredictable  —   and dangerous, she said. The old ads allowed her to try to vet customers by contacting them before meetings, via phone or text message. With far fewer inquiries from the dating ads, she said, her first encounters with men now take place more often on the street as she gets into cars in red light districts around the Bay Area. “It’s harder to catch a date now,” she said. “Now everybody’s daddy puts them on the street. ” Eric Quan, a sergeant in the   unit with the San Jose Police Department, said there had been a conspicuous rise in street prostitution in San Jose, where Tiffany is often forced to work. “When Backpage was running adult ads, we used to get tips, but that has dropped off,” Sergeant Quan said. “It makes it a lot more complicated for us to figure out what’s going on. ” “I do see more girls on the street, but we’re not sure why,” he said, referring to all females, not specifically minors. “There’s more guys out there, too, because there’s more girls to choose from. ” Advocates said that while the elimination of the listings was a step forward, by itself it was more an inconvenience than a crippling blow. “It was such a huge marketplace that any way to eliminate the widespread distribution of ads is progress,” said Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, a   organization focused on   violence. “But until we see a more comprehensive solution, it is going to pop up elsewhere. ” The fight against the sex trafficking of children is an old and often doomed one, in part because the crime is typically tied to poverty and dysfunctional families. Many of the girls and boys are runaways or foster children whose disappearances rarely set off a real Amber Alert. Nationally, about 35 percent of minors charged with prostitution are, like Tiffany,   according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In Alameda County, Calif. where pimps have sold Tiffany most often, more than 60 percent of children who are trafficked or at risk of being trafficked are   according to the Alameda County district attorney. The county’s   population is about 12 percent. Few jurisdictions keep data on the men arrested in such cases. But one area that keeps track, King County in Washington, found that 79 percent of the men charged with seeking to pay for sex with a minor from 2013 to 2015 were white, while 44 percent of those they were accused of propositioning were  . The county’s population is 7 percent  . “We educate our judges that although there is no single buyer profile, buyers are predominantly white, educated, married men,” said Victoria Sweet, a lawyer for the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. It is unclear how many minors are forced into prostitution each year, but the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said reports of online child sex trafficking had increased by more than 800 percent from 2010 to 2015. The organization said this was “directly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex. ” Backpage, where revenue increased to $135 million in 2014 from $5. 3 million in 2008, derived more than 90 percent of its earnings from its adult ads, according to the California Department of Justice. Backpage representatives declined to comment, but in a statement released in January the company said it had notified law enforcement whenever it became aware of illegal activity. It also said it was protected by a federal statute that shields   internet content providers from liability. “The shutdown of Backpage’s adult classified advertising is an assault on the First Amendment,” the company’s statement read in part. In Oakland, International Boulevard is among the busiest strips in the nation for the trafficking of minors, part of a network whose spokes extend to similar strips in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle and Reno, Nev. In warm weather, Tiffany said, she can often be found there, dressed in little more than a halter top and panties. The Oakland police, enmeshed in their own   scandal, said they had not seen a recent increase in prostitution along International Boulevard. Other departments around the nation acknowledged that they were not the best source for such information because officers infrequently made arrests and did not track activity. In January, a law barring children from being arrested for prostitution went into effect in California. Tiffany said she had been sent as far away as Pennsylvania and Florida, usually via Backpage ads. Once she was given a   bus ticket while her pimp took a plane, she said. Tiffany, who spoke on the condition that her real name not be used, said she was trying to quit the business. But without a high school diploma, her job prospects are slim. During an interview, she spoke    about the last four years, recounting the threat of violence from both pimps and the men who buy her. But she also said she had been in love with some of her pimps, most of them men, one a woman. Within the span of a few seconds, she burst into tears while talking about the betrayal she felt when one pimp punished her by having his brother touch her, then had a fit of laughter while reading complimentary text messages from men who had purchased her for sex. With her long fingernails, hair extensions and a preoccupation with the fashionable, she could easily be mistaken for an unremarkable teenager. She said she would be “too bored” to work a regular job. Tiffany’s mother, who she said might have worked as a prostitute, gave her to her grandmother the day she was born. Her father, she said, is a pimp. At 14, she was lured by two Facebook acquaintances to a party that became a gang rape, she said. Since then, she said, she had been conditioned  —   through beatings, gang rapes and other violence  —   to please her pimps, many of whom found her by perusing Backpage. “It’s something I’m good at,” she said. “Once you bust a first date, you’re likely to bust another. You have power, and you know you’ll never be broke again. ” (As it happened, though, pimps generally kept all her money.) For years, Tiffany said, she habitually took Ecstasy, which she said made her “happy and numb”  —   a state that she said enabled her to work long hours and forget the fact that she was being sold for sex. At 16, she was placed in the custody of Awaken, a Christian nonprofit organization that works to end sexual exploitation, but she repeatedly ran away to return to pimps. Awaken put Tiffany in touch with a reporter in the hope that her sharing her experience would help others in similar situations. In recent weeks, Tiffany said, she has become scared of being on the street after a man who had bought her showed her a loaded gun. “I feel like something’s going to happen to me,” she said. “The average life is seven years, and I started at age 14. When I started, the other girls called me ‘Baby. ’” She paused. “Now, I’m one of the older ones. ”",0
10103,Over 190 Countries Adopt Plan to Offset Air Travel Emissions - The New York Times,"Governments from more than 190 countries on Thursday adopted a measure that for the first time will reduce the climate impact of international jet travel. The accord adds an exclamation point to a week in which enough countries signed onto the broader Paris climate deal to ensure that it will enter into force later this year. The aviation plan, the product of years of negotiations, was approved by acclamation at a meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization, or I. C. A. O. in Montreal. The measure could force air carriers to take major steps to improve fuel economy in their routes and fleets, very likely accelerating the purchase of newer, more efficient planes. Carriers may pass the cost of the program on to consumers in higher airfares, though most experts think any increases would be relatively small. Leaders hailed the accord, which will take effect in 2021, as a major step in reducing the environmental impact of international aviation, which is currently responsible for about 2 percent of worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases. Secretary of State John Kerry called the measure “unprecedented” and said it built on the Paris agreement and other international efforts to reduce emissions. “This measure addresses a growing source of global emissions, demonstrates the international community’s strong and growing support for climate action in all areas and helps avoid a patchwork of potentially costly and overlapping regional and national measures,” Mr. Kerry said in a statement. Along with international shipping, international aviation was not covered by the Paris accord reached in December. On Tuesday, with the ratification of that pact by the European Union, it reached a threshold  —   acceptance by countries responsible for more than 55 percent of the world’s emissions  —   that causes it to go into effect. It is expected to enter into force before the next large United Nations climate meeting, in Morocco early next month. The aviation measure will be voluntary for the first six years, and even countries that commit to it voluntarily will be allowed to opt out on relatively short notice. Under the program, airlines will buy credits to offset emissions from individual flights. The credits will come from alternative energy installations, forest conservation programs and other projects that prevent some amount of greenhouse gas emissions. But critics point to several possible problems. Some environmental groups said the plan did not go far enough, forecasting that it would fall short of the goal originally set by the aviation organization to offset all of the growth in emissions from air travel after 2020. At least 65 nations, including the United States, China and the European Union countries, have signaled that they will participate during the voluntary phase of the measure. The measure exempts many smaller countries that do not have large international air carriers, and because of rules on competition, that could mean that some popular routes from participating countries could be exempt as well. Several countries that are significant sources of international air travel, including Russia and India, on Thursday expressed formal reservations about the agreement, indicating they would not participate, at least for now. Critics and supporters of the measure alike noted that much work remains to be done before the agreement is put into effect. Mechanisms must be developed to monitor and report current emissions, and criteria established to select conservation programs and other projects that will count toward offset credits. The aviation industry has supported the idea of mitigating the climate impact of its jet engines. Manufacturers have taken steps to improve the efficiency of current engines, and some carriers have begun replacing some of their conventional jet fuel with   biofuels. Some airlines have also encouraged environmentally conscious passengers to buy offsets voluntarily for their flights. Under the new measure, the airlines would buy the offsets, and they could pass the cost on to all passengers. But one estimate by the aviation organization forecasts that by 2025 the annual cost to airlines would be less than 1 percent of revenue. On Thursday, industry representatives welcomed adoption of the measure. Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of manufacturers, carriers and other companies, said he was heartened by how many countries, including small developing countries with a lot at stake as climate change takes hold, had agreed to participate voluntarily. “Despite some reservations over the scheme being voluntary in its initial years, the support of all these states  —   large, small, developed and developing  —   shows the commitment of the international community, working through I. C. A. O. to deliver a robust measure,” Mr. Gill said in a statement. But an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research group, shows that the agreement as approved will offset only about   of the growth in emissions from international aviation above 2020 levels. That means the proposal falls short of the goal originally set by the International Civil Aviation Organization of “ ” growth after 2020.",0
10104,What is Comey up to and who is he working for?,"Posted on October 31, 2016 by Michael Collins FBI Director James Comey. Wikimedia 
FBI Director James Comey’s letter to Congress on new evidence in the Clinton email scandal represents interference in the presidential campaign commensurate with his failure to indict candidate Hillary Clinton for crimes greater than those committed by citizens that are now serving time. His actions are a paradigm for the dysfunctional and dangerous state of the political system in the United States. 
UPDATE : Two former Republican Attorneys General harshly criticized FBI Director James Comey for his letter to Congress on the Hillary Clinton email affair. Michael Collins 5:42 EDT Mukasey blasts Comey and attorney general over Clinton email case Louis Nelson 10/31/16 07:16 AM EDT 
Director Comey’s letter to Congress of October 28 about “emails that appear to be pertinent in the [Clinton] investigation” was a deliberate, premeditated action that will harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s chances in the presidential election. His letter may have an even greater impact on Democratic Party down-ballot candidates in Senate and House races and, as a result, influence the post election balance of power in Congress. 
There is no question that Comey knew that his actions would have significant political impact just days before the election. The fact that he defied established procedures of the Justice Department and instructions from superiors shows the intentional nature of his acts. 
Comey’s abuse of power and illegal interference in the election is another major marker on the road to the total evisceration of constitutional rights and protection begun in earnest with the Patriot Act of 2001 . His actions should be judged as a blatantly illegal act by one of the nation’s most powerful law enforcement officials. It doesn’t matter if you support Clinton, Trump, Johnson, or Stein. Allowing the FBI to get away with this outrageous attempt to influence elections kills any hope of finally achieving the goal of an open political process and fair elections. 
Comey’s Profound Insincerity 
The Department of Justice has established policies for handling legal matters that may impact an election. Former Attorney’s General Janet Reno and Eric Holder outlined policies stating that the Justice Department should avoid prosecutions or other actions close to elections that might influence those elections. Attorney General Loretta Lynch made this point to Comey. Despite reports that FBI “agents had not been able to review any of the material, because the bureau had not yet gotten a search warrant to read them,” Comey somehow deduced that the emails might be significant. He took the unusual step of informing Congress about the emails he had yet to examine. 
Former Assistant United States Attorney , Nick Ackerman, argued: 
“Director Comey acted totally inappropriately. He had no business writing to Congress about supposed new emails that neither he nor anyone in the FBI has ever reviewed.” 
Does Director Comey think we are idiots? Clearly, he went out of his way to influence the election in a conspicuous fashion. There can be no doubt about this assertion. 
After some significant blowback from former Justice officials, Comey felt compelled to write an explanatory memo to FBI employees. He said: 
“I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record [of the original email investigation]. At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.” James Comey memo to FBI employees, Washington Post, Oct 28, 2016 , 
This passage from his letter is an admission that Comey knew his actions would influence the election. Before “know[ing] the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails,” he released an update to Congress that could easily be interpreted as an indication that there was a significant development in the Clinton case. Why else would he write the letter? 
Comey told FBI employees, “I don’t want to create a misleading impression.” If Comey wanted to avoid a “misleading impression,” he might have told the truth if he insisted on writing a memo to Congress. Based on what we know now, he should have said: 
There are some emails on the computer belonging to a close Clinton aid. No one at FBI has seen the emails. We don’t’ even have a warrant to download them. These emails might or might not be important enough to warrant reopening the investigation. 
The fact that Comey failed to tell the truth about the status of the emails proves his ill intent toward the Clinton campaign. 
Comey’s Violation of Law 
The 1939 Hatch Act bars Federal employees from a broad range of political activities. 
Richard Painter, a former lawyer in the Bush White House Counsel’s office, filed a formal complaint against FBI Director Comey for violating that act. He argued: “I believe that the Hatch Act and ethics rules are violated if it is obvious that the official’s actions [Comey’s] could influence the election, there is not another good reason for taking those actions, and the official is acting under pressure from persons who obviously want to influence the election.” 
Comey’s actions will clearly influence the elections. There was no “good reason” to release the memo on evidence not yet reviewed or analyzed. And, Comey admits that he acted “under pressure” from critics in Congress, Republicans, who obviously “want to influence the election.” 
In addition, Painter cited another law on the use of public office for private gain. Painter refers to the following section of the United States Code: 
2635.702 Use of public office for private gain. 
“An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise …” 
Comey’s actions have the direct effect of endorsing the Trump campaign “enterprise.” Trump has insisted again and again that the email case be reopened. Comey reopened it on the flimsiest of grounds. The net effect of his actions props up the Trump campaign just when it looked like the enterprise was finished. 
Comey’s Reports to … ? 
Comey’s actions serve the Trump campaign and its donors. It wasn’t an easy form of service by the FBI Director. Comey had to ignore established policies, common sense, his superior, the Attorney General, and the Hatch Act in order to send his very high impact letter. 
Will it be worth it? 
If Comey acted on his own without any outside inducements or threats, we should all pause and say a short prayer for him. In that scenario, he is an utter fool playing in a league way above his skill set and doing great and memorable damage to the political process. 
But, Comey is no fool. I wrote favorably about his willingness to stand up to the Bush White House in 2007, Comey’s Evidence of a Crime . Then, he seemed to have a quality not often seen in government or corporate environments – a willingness to “stand up to the boss.” That may have been true at the time. Today, however, Comey seems unable to decide who his boss is. He clearly caved in to the administration and the Clinton interests when he failed to indict Hillary Clinton for even a misdemeanor for her many violations of national security policies. Now, he’s caving into the interests of the Republicans and the repellant Trump campaign. 
The key question is who got to Comey and how? 
We know that both Clinton and Trump are unfit for the presidency or any other elected or appointed office in the United States. However, we need to know who has the type of power and force to make the FBI Director behave like a fool.",0
10105,"In Russian Doping Scandal, Time for a Punishment to Fit the Crime - The New York Times","You put the question to Sanya   a gold medal runner who has come back from so many injuries and who hopes to make another Olympic team before she retires. Would she let Russia, which carries about it the odor of   doping, into the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro? She shook her head. “You think about everything that happened, and how far up the chain it has gone there,” she said of Russia last month. “Missing the Olympics? For sure, that’s a reasonable punishment for the crime. ” The accumulating evidence of a   doping program filled with duplicity and evasion lay exposed to the sun. A Russian athlete, a former state official and even the director of Russia’s main drug testing laboratory say the world should not believe the results produced by Russian athletes, as illegal chemistry underlies them. The doping corruption begins at the highest reaches of the Ministry of Sport, they assert, and extends downward, accompanied by the suspicious deaths of two potential  . The good news is that the world’s best athletes are rising in revolt and demanding investigations. Nearly 600 British athletes, The Guardian reports, have called for a sweeping, worldwide investigation. American, European and Canadian skiers, swimmers and runners have added their insistent voices. The    news is that the regulatory bodies of world sports are like so many somnolent detective bureaus. The chiefs wag their heads and rummage through desks for musty reports and murmur, yes, yes, what a shame   …     Craig Reedie, the chief of the World   Agency, recently explained his regulatory approach to my colleague Rebecca Ruiz. “We’re not going to turn around to people and say: ‘These are the rules.’ If one of our stakeholders comes and says, ‘Can you advise us on how to proceed’? Then, clearly, we will advise them. ” I know Sir Craig is a knight and all that. So please, just this once, let him pull out his broad sword and slay a dragon. This week it’s the turn of another world body with a    record, the International Association of Athletics Federations. On Friday, the I. A. A. F. which governs track and field, will announce whether Russia and its athletes can participate in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The I. A. A. F. is run by another knight, the former Olympic gold medal runner Lord Sebastian Coe. In 2015, Lord Coe, a longtime vice president in the organization, replaced Lamine Diack, who had served as president for 16 years. Soon after he left the I. A. A. F. Diack was arrested. He has been accused of taking many, many bribes to cover up positive doping tests by Russian athletes. Diack held a seat on the International Olympic Committee, as Sir Craig does currently. International sport is cozy. (Olympic reform is best pushed genteelly, not to mention gingerly honk too loudly about transgressions and your country might find its hopes of hosting an Olympics dashed.) WADA has taken a few important steps. Last year, its report uncovered systemic corruption in Russian track and field and pointed to many strands of corruption in winter sports. However, agency leaders resisted for many months calling in investigators to plunge down the necessary alleyways. All the while, the agency’s own athletes’ committee, and the heads of various national federations, pleaded for full investigations. Now my colleagues Ruiz, Juliet Macur and Ian Austen reported this week that WADA not only sat on detailed tips from Russian   but also passed along word of one such   to the same government officials accused of running the doping program. “You need to have proper, corroborated evidence in order to prove things,” Sir Craig said. “Secondly, we didn’t have powers under the old code to investigate. ” Both of his claims are baffling. WADA had, since 2010, two firsthand witnesses, a top athlete and a top official in the Russian antidoping agency, testifying to corruption in doping. Now there is another witness, Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the laboratory that handled the tests of thousands of Russian Olympians, and who described for The New York Times how he developed a powerful,   doping elixir. Rodchenkov sounds an awful lot like the Joe Valachi of Russian sports. (Valachi was the first great Mafia informer.) The good doctor estimated that by the end of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, he and his work mates had expunged 100 dirty test results. Russian athletes won a splendid number of medals at those Winter Games. I’m no district attorney, but that strikes me as powerful firsthand testimony. As well, WADA was explicitly charged with monitoring code compliance by its signatories, which include Russia. In December 2014, the chief of the United States   Agency, Travis Tygart, wrote a tough,   private letter to WADA. He suggested that it strap on its police cap and badge and get to work. “Anything less than a full, complete and successful investigation by WADA   …     would constitute an abdication of WADA’s responsibilities,” he wrote in a letter also signed by the board chairman, Edwin Moses. “We do not believe that WADA lacks the power to conduct an investigation, protect witnesses or take steps” to investigate whether national agencies have become corrupted. Throat clearing is necessary here. Russian athletes are not uniquely fallen creatures. The list of American runners and bikers and skiers who have doped is long and desultory, although there is no evidence that this is  . The Salt Lake Winter Olympics in 2002 was a festival of bribes and doping. An Italian doctor was the Dr. Frankenstein of sports doping. The Finns had a major doping scandal a decade or so back. The Kenyan and Ethiopian   runners would be a heartwarming marvel were it not that so many keep getting nabbed by blood doping. Athletes everywhere face justifiable doubts. But that narrative coexists with a more hopeful one. Save for Russia and a few other nations, the battle against doping has taken many strides forward. Circumstantial evidence for this is found in the fact that in most disciplines, athletes no longer set records every few years. That was true during the 1980s and 1990s. (The    home run years in major league baseball offered a direct corollary, replete with complicity by the owners and rulers of that sport.) “It’s much harder to dope, and the advantage you can gain is less than it used to be,” notes Max Cobb, director of U. S. Biathlon and a longtime reformer in the arena of world sport. “  can take an athlete from 10th place to first place, but you’re no longer seeing those extraordinary, ‘Oh my God, how did that guy finish two minutes faster’ moments. ” The question now is what to do when a nation goes rogue and dedicates itself to systematically undermining doping regulations. The Russians under Vladimir Putin have lashed their national pride to the mast of athletic achievement. Russia is a global superpower, and not easily sent stomping to its room. But even the latest interim report from WADA this week gives not much cause for hope. A large number of athletes continue to evade tests, and when asked their whereabouts, as is required of every athlete worldwide so that drug testers can find them, a striking number of Russian athletes list   “military cities. ” Testing officers need special permission to enter these cities, which delays and in some cases prevents testing. When in Eugene, Ore. last month, I talked about this with the American runner  . “I’m literally tested at least two times a week,” she said. “At least. I’m happy to live up to those standards. I just want that standard to be the same all around the world, including Russia. ” That seems a reasonable request. On Friday, we’ll see if the cops of sport are up to the task of walking their beat.",0
10106,N.J. Transit Changes Rules for Trains Arriving at Hoboken Station - The New York Times,"In the wake of the fatal train crash in Hoboken last week, New Jersey Transit ordered on Wednesday that a second crew member must stand watch as the engineer pulls a train into that busy terminal. The railroad issued an immediate mandate that the conductor must move to the driving cab of the train to serve as a second set of eyes and ears during the last segment of trips into Hoboken and Atlantic City. On the train that crashed at Hoboken Terminal last Thursday morning, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others, the engineer was alone in the driving cab and the conductor was in his normal position farther back among the passengers. That train was speeding toward the terminal before it plowed through the bumper at the end of the line and jumped onto the platform, witnesses and elected officials said. As the front car of the train rose up, it brought the roof over the platform crashing down, causing the instant death of a woman who was passing by. The cause of the crash has not been determined. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday that they were extracting data and video from recorders they retrieved from the train’s driving cab. They said that the engineer told them he did not remember the crash but that he was rested when he started his shift that morning. No trains have run to or from Hoboken Terminal since the crash, and New Jersey Transit has not said when it will reopen. A spokeswoman for the railroad declined to comment on the new directive, so it was unclear if it was a reaction to what has been learned about the circumstances of the crash. But it is no small change in the railroad’s practices. The conductor’s role is to mind the passengers, ushering them on and off the train and collecting tickets. The conductor plays no part in the operation of the train. That is left to the engineer, who is like a captain of a ship. This change in procedures is akin to requiring that the first mate stand next to a ship’s captain and point out any route markers or potential hazards as the ship comes into port. The bulletin says the “conductor and the engineer are to focus exclusively on the railroad, calling signal, checking the route and ensuring that the train is operated safely in compliance. ” It applies to trains arriving in Hoboken and at the terminal in Atlantic City, both of which have platforms at the ends of the rails, creating the potential for    trains to crash into people. The new rule’s implementation on Wednesday afternoon came as a surprise to Stephen Burkert, the general chairman of a union that represents New Jersey Transit conductors. “They’re looking to have a safer railroad, which I fully agree with,” Mr. Burkert said. “Safety is always first for my members and the riding public. ” But, he added, the rules will require more work for conductors. “What it technically does is put more job responsibility on the conductor, besides what they had to do yesterday,” he said. “You have effectively doubled the work responsibilities for the conductor. ”",0
10107,Anonymous Released Video Exposing Huma Abedin Days Before FBI Announcement,"Share This 
The FBI’s recent announcement, that the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and private server has been reopened, made Huma Abedin a household name if it wasn’t already. However, many missed the chilling video released by Anonymous, exposing Abedin just days before the FBI’s announcement. It’s one that the mainstream media didn’t want you to see, but every American needs to watch it. 
After the laptop of Abedin’s estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, ended up in the hands of the FBI, Hillary’s misdeeds came under scrutiny once again. With another scandal and more controversy hitting the Clinton campaign, many have begun talking not only about Hillary Clinton but her closest aide as well. However, emails, laptops, and perverted husband Anthony Weiner are the least of our worries when it comes to Huma Abedin. 
In a mission to inform Americans, an informative but bone-chilling video has been released by Anonymous, exposing the real Huma Abedin. Although Mad World News previously reported on her ties to radical Islam, the recently released video that’s now begun to circulate on social media lays out her connections in an easy to follow visual that every American needs to see. 
“Who Is Huma?” the video asks, and the answer is chilling. The narrator of the video names four main players in exposing the truth behind Abedin and her disturbing ties to groups and people who fund terrorism. Those players are obviously Abedin herself and Hillary Clinton , but also Abdullah Omar Nasseef and Saudi Arabia, where Huma was raised from the age of two until she was 18. 
According to the video and verified by a lengthy piece in Vanity Fair , Huma worked for the Abedin family business, The Institute of Minority Muslim Affairs, which is a pro-Sharia Law newsletter “owned by the Muslim World League, Saudi Arabia’s global organization that promotes violent Wahhabi Islam,” BizPac Review reports. This family business was created by Abedin’s father and Nasseef, one of the four main players identified in the clip, who is also one of the founders of the Muslim World League. 
With Huma being Hillary’s closest aide, Huma’s close ties to terrorism extend to Hillary Clinton, which is a frightening thought considering she could be our next president. What’s worse, if Hillary is elected president, she would have Huma Abedin become Secretary of State, according to leaked emails between Hillary Clinton and her former chief of staff Cheryl Mills. 
While everyone is concentrating on what may or may not be in the emails discovered on the laptop of Abedin’s perverse husband, this is the information everyone should see before voting. This woman, with undeniable ties to terrorists and 9/11 funders, has been Hillary’s shadow and right-hand for decades, and that won’t change if Hillary becomes president. In fact, it could only get worse. If you want to know the true measure of someone’s character, look who they surround themselves with. The old saying, “Birds of a feather flock together,” rings true, and these are two birds that should be in a cage, not our White House.",0
10108,"London Terror: One Dead, One Arrested as Man Ploughs Van into Pedestrians Outside London Mosque","London police are investigating a suspected terror attack and have arrested a 48 year old on suspicion of attempted murder after a van was driven into a crowd of people on a London street near a mosque in Finsbury Park. Eyewitnesses have said the man got out of the vehicle and shouted “I want to kill all Muslims”. [One died during the attack and 10 were injured, but it is unclear whether the death was caused directly by the van ploughing into the crowd. Police said in a statement overnight that all the victims of the attack were from the Muslim faith.  Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick said in a statement Monday morning: London has woken up to the news of another appalling attack on our city. My thoughts are with the family of the man who has died and with all those who were injured. My officers were on the scene almost immediately, and other uniformed and specialist officers quickly arrived to support them. They worked quickly with colleagues from the other emergency services to treat the injured. I want to thank all those members of the public who assisted police and emergency services in our task. There is now an ongoing investigation by our Counter Terrorism Command to establish why this attack was carried out. London is a city of many faiths and many nationalities. An attack on one community is an attack on all of us. Terrorists will not succeed in their attempts to divide us and make us live in fear. ” Extra officers are on duty in the area to help reassure the local community. They will be there for as long as they are needed. Communities will see additional officers patrolling across the city and at Muslim places of worship. We are working as hard as we can to protect all our communities, and we will not be defeated. In a separate statement, police said the attack happened while a man was already “receiving first aid from the public at the scene” and that this was the individual who had died. Because it was unclear whether the man had already died before the attack took place, police said “Any causative link between his death and the attack will form part of our investigation. It is too early to state if his death was as a result of the attack”. “No matter what the motivation proves to be, and we are keeping an open mind, this is being treated as a terrorist attack and the Counter Terrorism Command is investigating. ” Speaking to Sky News Monday, Miqdaad Versi, assistant   of the Muslim Council of Britain described the moments leading up to the attack. He said: “This was a group of individuals who were praying at the Muslim Welfare House. They were just coming back from prayers and one individual happened to collapse on the floor, and people who wanted to help that individual came around him to support him, and at that moment in time that’s when the van mounted the curb and attacked that whole group, and resulted in that one injury that we’re aware of. ” Previous reports that there had been multiple individuals in the van, and that the driver was carrying a knife have not been confirmed by police Monday morning. The Finsbury Park Mosque outside which the attack took place had just let out after Taraweeh  —   special,   Ramadan prayers. Prime Minister Theresa May has described the attack as a “terrible incident” while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he is “shocked” by the “awful event”. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said in a statement: “We should make clear that if this attack is confirmed as a deliberate terrorist attack then this should be classed as an act of terrorism. “The British Muslim community requires all decent people to stand with us against this evil violence. “Rampant Islamaphobia [sic] has been on the rise for a number of years and those on the far right have perpetuated hatred against Muslims. They should be called out for their hatred. “The days ahead will be difficult, but with unity and tolerance we will prevail. We will not allow these far right extremists to divide our diverse communities. “Enough is enough, my condolences and prayers for all the victims and their families. They are in my prayers. ” The salafist Finsbury Park mosque has previously been in the news as having been the home of famed hate preacher Abu Hamza Al Masri, as well as having   attacker Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe bomber Richard Reid as attendees. In recent years the mosque has changed its management team and has not been mentioned in connection with any recent terror plots.

10110,Pope Francis: Europe Is in Danger of ‘Falling Apart’ - Breitbart,"Every nation is free to vote for the political leaders it wants, said Pope Francis Saturday, while Europe itself is in danger of “falling apart. ”[“Every country is free to make the choices it believes are right for itself. I cannot judge if it is making this choice for this reason or another, because I do not know its internal politics,” Francis said, in reference to the upcoming French presidential elections.  We must “respect people’s opinions, honest opinions of a political discussion,” he said. During the return flight from Egypt to Rome on Saturday, the Pope granted a press conference to the journalists aboard the papal flight, during which he was asked about the populist movements expanding in Europe. Virginie Riva of the French group, “Radio Europe 1,” made direct reference to the French presidential elections, claiming that French Catholics “are being forced to vote for either a populist or an extremist, and they are divided and confused. ” Late last month, a first round of elections reduced the list of presidential candidates to Marine Le Pen of the Front National party and Emmanuel Macron of the “En Marche!” party. The final,   vote will take place on May 7. Francis confessed that “I do not understand French internal politics,” but repeated the principle that every country is free to make the choices it believes are right for itself. “I have worked to have good relations, including with the current President, with whom there was a difficulty once, but afterwards I was able to speak clearly with him about the issue, while respecting his viewpoint,” the Pope said. “I do not know the history of the two candidates [Le Pen e Macron] I do not know where they are from,” he added. “Yes, I do know that one is a representative of the far right, but the other candidate, I truly do not know where he is from,” he said. “For this reason, I cannot offer a clear view on France. ” The Pope said that he was recently asked why there is not a Catholic political party, a proposal that the Pope found impractical and anachronistic. “This man is good, but he is living in the last century!” Francis said, referring to the person who made the suggestion. The Pope also reflected on the future of Europe, as he has done on other occasions. “Europe is in danger of coming undone this is true,” he said. “There is a problem that frightens Europe and perhaps increases populism: the problem of migration. This is true,” he said. “But let us not forget that Europe is made of migrants: centuries and centuries of migrants  …     that’s us!” “But it is a problem that must be studied well, and we must also respect people’s opinions, honest opinions of a political discussion with a capital “P”: great Politics, not the small national politics that eventually end up falling down,” he said.

10111,Gohmert: Congress Recessing Day After Comey Testified Left President Trump ‘To Dangle’,"Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) told Fox and Friends on Friday that Congress concluding business on Thursday and not being in session on the day after fired FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he leaked information about his private conversations with President Donald Trump left the president to “dangle. ”[House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s office on Tuesday sent out an email announcing the change.  “Members are advised that  —   pending timely completion of H. R. 10  —   votes are no longer expected in the House on Friday, June 9,” the email stated. “Last votes of the week are now expected at approximately 4:00 PM on Thursday, June 8. ” The Majority Leader’s office told Breitbart News that the decision was made because the Democrats withdrew all amendments from the Choice Act being considered by the House leading to business concluding a day early. But Gohmert said it sends the wrong message about Republicans support for Trump. “Tuesday, apparently, our leadership changed the week’s scheduling and said let’s go dark on Friday, which means the emphasis will not be on what we’re doing good in Washington,” Gohmert said. “We are basically leaving the president to dangle,” Gohmert said. “I’m very concerned we are not being supportive enough to get the message out and here President Trump is   …     as [Senator] Marco Rubio was pointing out   …     the only thing that didn’t leak was the truth  —   that [Trump] was not under investigation. ” Meanwhile, at his weekly press briefing on Thursday, Ryan said he didn’t have time to watch the Comey hearing but vaguely supported Trump by claiming he was “new” to the government and its modus operandi. “As far as the conversations and all that, I’m not going to speculate on any of this, I would just add that of course there needs to be a degree of independence between the DOJ, FBI and the White House and lines of communications established,” Ryan told reporters. “The president’s new at this, he’s new to government,” Ryan continued. “So he probably wasn’t steeped in the long running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. “He’s new to this,” Ryan said. “We now know why [Trump] was frustrated when the FBI director told him three times there’s no investigation of him yet the speculation was allowed to continue,” Ryan said. “So obviously we know now why he was frustrated. ”",0
10112,"Missing Money, a Vicious Attack and Slow Healing for a Charity’s Leader - The New York Times","D. Alexandra Dyer felt as though her face were on fire. She put her car into drive, but got only a couple of hundred feet before she had to pull over in searing pain and squeeze her eyes shut. Rescuers arrived as the caustic drain cleaner turned her face purple and dissolved her skin. As recounted later by her lawyer, she then screamed four words that they could not possibly comprehend. “Kim Williams did this!” Ms. Dyer had just left work on that hot evening last August in Long Island City, Queens. As she approached her car, parked on a deserted stretch of Skillman Avenue, a man she had never seen before was waiting for her. “Can I ask you a question?” he said. Before she could answer, he flung a cup of drain cleaner in her face, and fled. It was the terrifying climax of a   drama, with accusations of embezzlement, a   and collusion at the last place one might expect it: a charity that brings musical performances and arts programs to New York City’s hospitalized, disabled, elderly and poor. Three people have been arrested. Ms. Dyer, 60, who had recently been hired as executive director of the charity, Healing Arts Initiative, has undergone multiple operations to rebuild her face. Among those charged is Ms. Williams, 47, the charity’s payroll manager, who is accused of stealing more than $750, 000 and orchestrating the attack after Ms. Dyer questioned her about bookkeeping lapses. The defendants, including Ms. Williams, have proclaimed their innocence through their lawyers. The account of the attack, and the tense months leading up to it, were described by Ms. Dyer’s lawyer, Ronald G. Russo, because prosecutors have instructed Ms. Dyer not to speak publicly since she is a witness in the case. The fallout continues. This month, Ms. Dyer filed a lawsuit against the board of Healing Arts Initiative on behalf of the charity itself, saying board members let the thefts happen on their watch. The suit seeks their removal. (Mr. Russo, a former federal prosecutor, is Ms. Dyer’s lawyer in the suit.) A lawyer for Healing Arts, David G. Samuels, declined to comment on Thursday because of the continuing suit. Ms. Dyer, a seasoned nonprofit executive, had taken the helm of Healing Arts in July, joining one of the city’s   arts charities. It was started as Hospital Audiences Inc. in 1969 by a pianist named Michael Jon Spencer, after he played a recital to a rapt audience at the Manhattan State Psychiatric Center. Over the years, Healing Arts grew to a $    operation that serves 350, 000 people annually, through workshops and live performances. It provides handicapped seating at Shakespeare in the Park, presents concerts by Alvin Ailey dancers and runs a gallery for artists with mental illnesses. But some staff members had noticed a surge of fiscal irregularities in the past couple of years, Mr. Russo said. Checks were bouncing. The credit cards that Healing Arts used to buy blocks of discount tickets for its clients were being refused. The organization’s debt had ballooned from under $100, 000 to over $2. 2 million from 2012 to 2015, even as the executive director at the time, J. David Sweeny, cut the staff to 14 employees, from 28, and reduced the rent by moving the charity’s offices from SoHo to Queens. At the heart of Healing Arts’ fiscal operation was Ms. Williams. She had been hired in 2011, through an agency called Professionals for Nonprofits, as a payroll clerk. Under Mr. Sweeny, she enjoyed wide latitude, especially after he got rid of the chief financial officer and did not replace her, Mr. Russo said. Soon, she was effectively running the fiscal operations and had several other accounting employees reporting to her. Ms. Williams, who had an apartment in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, seemed to live fairly well for someone who had started out at a yearly salary of $43, 000 and had worked her way up to $60, 000. She drove a   Mercedes, had a second home in Florida and posted about her shopping sprees on Facebook. Some of her income may have come from a side business she owned and ran from her office computer called Virago Inc. which sold sex toys and offered online sex seminars. But the real secret to Ms. Williams’s lifestyle, prosecutors and the police say, was that she stole prodigiously from Healing Arts, cutting checks to dozens of phantom employees and   them into accounts controlled by her and her best friend, Pia Louallen. “That’s how the whole financial thing got to us,” Lt. Alexander Fagiolo, commanding officer of the 108th Precinct detectives, said at a news conference this month. From November 2012 through August 2015, according to prosecutors, Ms. Williams embezzled at least $750, 000  —   an average of more than $1, 000 per workday. She kept $600, 000 and gave the rest to Ms. Louallen, prosecutors said. One longtime board member, Kitty Lunn, said that while she did not suspect that Ms. Williams was raiding the till, she was concerned about the declined credit cards and the checks that did not clear. She urged fellow board members to investigate. In January 2015, the board hired a forensic accountant. His finding after several days of reviewing the books, according to Mr. Russo: “No improper transactions. ” Ms. Lunn, a paraplegic dancer who has headed her own nonprofit, was incredulous. In May 2015, she quit in frustration. “I said to the board, ‘There’s something funny going on with the money, and all of you are going to be responsible,’” she recalled. By this time, Healing Arts was looking for a new executive director  —   Mr. Sweeny had left for another charity, though he remains on the Healing Arts board. (He declined to comment, referring all calls to the board president, D. Leslie Winter, who did not respond to voice mail messages.) Enter Ms. Dyer, with an M. B. A. from Columbia and decades of experience managing nonprofits. She also holds a master’s degree in divinity, was ordained a Roman Catholic priest by a group called Roman Catholic Womenpriests and is   of a congregation in Greenwich Village. Concerned when her new colleagues told her about the money shortfalls and climbing debt, Ms. Dyer began digging around, Mr. Russo said. When she asked Ms. Williams for access to the accounting system, he said, Ms. Williams repeatedly stonewalled her. On Aug. 17, Ms. Dyer introduced Ms. Williams to a new chief financial officer she planned to hire. His name was Frank Williams (no relation to Ms. Williams) and, Ms. Dyer told her, he was an expert   who would decipher Healing Arts’ imbalanced books. Ms. Williams suddenly came down with a toothache, Mr. Russo said, and left the office. Later that day, the police said, she bought drain cleaner at a supermarket in Queens with her credit card. She was absent the next day, Aug. 18, claiming that she had to go for a dental procedure. Surveillance video revealed that she had come to the office at 6 a. m. and left with boxes of files, Mr. Russo said. Ms. Williams never returned to work and stopped communicating with Healing Arts. The day after that, on Aug. 19, Ms. Dyer was attacked. She spent the next two months at the burn unit of     Cornell Medical Center. But she continued to run Healing Arts from her second day in the hospital, Mr. Russo said, meeting with forensic accountants even though her eyelids were sewn shut, and fielding calls from colleagues. More troubles surfaced, Mr. Russo said. Healing Arts, it turned out, was paying workers’ compensation premiums based on a payroll of $5. 5 million, more than the charity’s entire budget. A company ledger showed a discrepancy of $480, 000 that was noted simply as a “payment adjustment. ” While Ms. Dyer mended, the police and the Queens district attorney’s office labored to piece together the criminal case and tracked Ms. Williams, who was spending time in Florida. In December, Ms. Dyer viewed a photo lineup and identified Jerry Mohammed, a    from Troy, N. Y. with a record of   convictions, as her assailant. Surveillance video taken the day of the attack shows him getting into a Mercedes belonging to Ms. Louallen, the police said. On April 4, Mr. Mohammed and Ms. Louallen were arrested. Ms. Williams fled, prosecutors said, but at 8:57 p. m. she was arrested behind the wheel of a white 2010 Mercedes E350 at a rest area on the New Jersey Turnpike. She was charged with two counts of   assault, two counts of conspiracy, two counts of grand larceny, weapons possession, falsifying business records and 48 counts of identity theft. She is being held without bail and faces up to 25 years in prison. Mr. Mohammed is charged with assault, conspiracy and weapons possession and also faces up to 25 years. Ms. Louallen is charged with grand larceny and conspiracy and faces up to 15 years. Mr. Mohammed’s lawyer, Michael D. Siff, said on Wednesday that Ms. Dyer had picked someone other than his client at an   lineup in Queens on April 12. The district attorney’s office declined to comment. Today, Ms. Dyer’s face is a pinkened map of scar tissue. One eye is   and runs continuously. The other opens only partially, beneath an imperfectly restored eyelid. But she is back at work. And Healing Arts continues its mission to bring cultural medicine to the sick and the injured. Ms. Dyer knows something of this firsthand. Last September, as Ms. Dyer lay in her hospital bed, a folk singer named Kathy Lord, one of Healing Arts’s contractors, entered the room. “I’ve seen a lot of things over the years, and that was probably just about as bad as it gets,” said Ms. Lord, who runs a nonprofit called Music That Heals. “I said, ‘Alexandra, here I am, Music That Heals,’” Ms. Lord recalled. Knowing of Ms. Dyer’s faith, she sang the country gospel song “One Day at a Time. ” “One day at a time, sweet Jesus,” it goes. “That’s all I’m asking from you.   Just give me the strength   To do every day   What I have to do. ” Tears ran down Ms. Dyer’s ravaged face.",0
10113,Ruth Bader Ginsburg Expresses Regret for Criticizing Donald Trump - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s indignant dissents from the bench have turned her into a heroine of the left, beloved for methodically skewering her conservative colleagues. On the internet, she has become the Notorious R. B. G. But after being roundly criticized for a remarkable series of interviews in which she mocked Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Justice Ginsburg on Thursday did something highly unusual for a member of the nation’s highest court: She admitted making a mistake. “Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office,” she wrote in a brief statement issued by the court, admitting her remarks were “ill advised” and expressing regret. “In the future I will be more circumspect. ” A revered figure at some of the nation’s most elite law schools since her appointment to the court in 1993, Justice Ginsburg, 83, flabbergasted many in the legal community when she called Mr. Trump a “faker,” and said she could not really imagine what it would be like if he became president. Barry Friedman, a professor of law at New York University who describes himself as a friend of Justice Ginsburg’s, said her comments were a stark example of a breach in the neutrality that justices must adhere to. “The price you pay for being on the bench is that you withdraw from politics,” Mr. Friedman said. “You need to be extremely circumspect. ” Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard, said Justice Ginsburg’s comments reflected the divisive nature of today’s politics, which had already affected the legislative and executive branches of government. “Maybe this is an example of how hyperpolarization affects the court,” he said. In expressing her disdain for Mr. Trump, Justice Ginsburg was anything but circumspect, leading some to wonder whether, after 23 years at the court, she is looking toward a possible retirement after the presidential election. Shana Knizhnik, the   of a biography titled “Notorious R. B. G.: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” said the justice was well aware that her time on the bench would not last forever. But Ms. Knizhnik said she was still surprised by Justice Ginsburg’s comments. “She has always said she is going to do this job as long as she can do it full steam,” Ms. Knizhnik said on Thursday. “But from an actuarial standpoint, she sees that there aren’t going to be too many more elections during her tenure. ” A legal advocate for most of her life, Justice Ginsburg made a name for herself when she represented the Women’s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in several landmark cases before the court on issues including gender discrimination, equal protection and due process. After serving on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for more than a dozen years, Justice Ginsburg was elevated to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the second woman to serve there. Though a stalwart of the court’s liberal bloc, she was hardly a household name. But that started to change in the last decade, as conservatives on the court more aggressively asserted their philosophy and Justice Ginsburg began reading fiery dissents. In a 2007 case about discrimination in the workplace, she said the court “does not comprehend, or is indifferent to, the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination. ” In 2013, she said that “only an ostrich” would believe that race would not continue to be a factor in university admissions despite the court’s ruling in an affirmative action case. In a religious liberty case the next year, Justice Ginsburg said the majority on the court had endorsed a radical overhaul of corporate rights. Her dissent in that case, involving whether Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts store chain, must provide insurance coverage for contraception to its employees, went viral on the internet, spawning Facebook memes and even a tribute song on YouTube. Ms. Knizhnik’s Tumblr site, Notorious R. B. G. sells   coffee mugs, iPhone cases and tote bags with Justice Ginsburg’s face on them. Ms. Knizhnik said the internet offered a caricature that exaggerated the liberal philosophy of Justice Ginsburg, who had formed a close personal bond with Justice Antonin Scalia, the court’s most outspoken conservative before his death this year. “The idea that she is this hyperpartisan is not true, even though certain people in political life paint her that way,” Ms. Knizhnik said. “She is very much about disagreeing agreeably. ” That may have been why her   comments about Mr. Trump took her allies and critics by surprise. Mr. Trump lashed out at Justice Ginsburg after her comments, and she was criticized in editorials and by legal ethics experts. “I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. “I think it’s a disgrace to the court, and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it. ” He later called on Justice Ginsburg to resign, something she did not respond to in her statement. Legal scholars said they could not remember a time that a sitting justice expressed regret publicly for something he or she said, though many justices have been known to socialize with political figures or to privately express their political preferences, only to have them reported in the media. Justice Scalia went hunting with Dick Cheney, the former vice president, even as he participated in cases involving Mr. Cheney’s activities in government. On the night in 2000 when news networks initially reported that Al Gore had won the presidential election, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was said to have told friends at a dinner party that it was terrible news. Mr. Tushnet said the idea of what was acceptable political activity for a Supreme Court justice had evolved over time. In the early 1900s, it was not uncommon, he said, for justices to openly express their desire to run for president. Charles Evans Hughes resigned his seat on the court in 1916 to run for the White House. But norms have changed, Mr. Tushnet said. Now, Americans expect the justices to keep their opinions largely to themselves. “My guess is that similar things occur today, but they are behind the scenes,” Mr. Tushnet said. “What’s different about this was that it was in front, on the record. ” Mr. Friedman said Americans should not be naïve by thinking that the justices do not have opinions. But he also criticized the current members of the court for being too willing to attend conferences with partisan leanings or too eager to grant interviews when they have a book to sell. “This comment comes as a part of the culture of the justices being public figures instead of paying greater attention to the black robes they wear,” he said. “It is still their job to operate from a position of neutrality. ”",0
10114,"США: реформироваться или распадаться?, Тьерри Мейсан","США: реформироваться или распадаться? Тьерри Мейсан Наблюдая за президентской гонкой в США Тьерри Мейсан отмечает возрождение давно забытых распрей. Хилари Клинтон недавно заявила, что на этих выборах главное не выбрать какую-то программу, а ответить на вопрос, кем являются американцы. На самом деле, не по политическим соображениям руководители республиканской партии отказались поддерживать своего кандидата Дональда Трампа, а из-за его поведения. До сих пор США остаются страной эмигрантов, прибывших со всех концов света и считающих свою страну особым государством. Однако реальная ситуация даёт о себе знать, и эти представления рушатся, что может повлечь за собой разрушение самих США.
Сеть Вольтер | Дамаск (Сирия) | 26 октября 2016 français Español italiano English Deutsch Português ελληνικά Türkçe عربي За время избирательной кампании, которая близится к завершению, риторика кандидатов значительно изменилась, и между двумя лагерями наметился раскол. Если вначале кандидаты обсуждали чисто политические вопросы (например, распределение материальных средств или национальная безопасность), то сегодня они рассуждают, в основном, о сексуальных отношениях и деньгах.
Именно эти, а не политические вопросы взорвали Республиканскую партию, лидеры которой отказались поддерживать своего кандидата, а это перемешало всю политическую шахматную доску и воскресило давно забытые распри. Г-жа Клинтон, с одной стороны, старается сохранять политическую корректность, а «Дональд», со своей стороны, разбивает в пух и прах лицемерие бывшей «Первой леди».
Хилари Клинтон выступает за равенство между мужчинами и женщинами, хотя она без колебаний нападала и очерняла тех, кто рассказывал о своих связях с её мужем, представляет себя не по своим личным качествам, а лишь как жена бывшего президента, и обвиняет в женоненавистничестве Дональда Трампа, который не скрывает своего неравнодушного отношения к женскому полу. А Дональд Трамп клеймит приватизацию государства и коррупцию Фонда Клинтон при предоставлении иностранным гражданам доступа в Госдеп, проведённую Обамой реформу здравоохранения, выгодную не гражданам, а медицинским страховым агентствам. Он доходит даже до обвинений в адрес самой избирательной системы.
Я совершенно согласен с тем, что речи Дональда Трампа порой смахивают на расизм, но я не считаю это основным содержанием предвыборной кампании, несмотря на тот шум, который делают из этого проклинтоновские СМИ.
Президент Клинтон по делу Моники Левински принёс публичные извинения и обратился к пасторам молиться о его прощении. И это важно. А Дональд Трамп, которого обвинили в подобных деяниях и подтвердили их звукозаписью, извинился только перед теми, кого он унизил, и к помощи духовенства не обратился.
Такие расхождения вызывают у католиков, православных и лютеран возмущение против кальвинистов, представленных в США, главным образом, пресвитерианами, баптистами и методистами. И хотя оба кандидата воспитывались в пуританских традициях (Клинтон как методистка, а Трамп как пресвитерианин), г-жа Клинтон обратилась к религии после смерти отца и сегодня она ходит на мессу в составе группы The Family, включающей начальников армейских штабов, а г-н Трамп свои религиозные чувства не выказывает и соборы почти не посещает.
Конечно, никто жёстко не ограничивает себя рамками канонов, по которым его воспитывали. Но когда у человека нет времени на раздумья, он бессознательно действует по этим канонам. Поэтому религиозная среда, в которой человек вырос, имеет значение.
Чтобы осмыслить, что поставлено на кон, нужно вернуться в Англию XVII века. Оливер Кромвель с помощью военного переворота смещает короля Карла Первого и устанавливает республику. Он намерен очистить стране её душу и приказывает казнить бывшего монарха. Руководствуясь идеями Кальвина, он устанавливает сектарный режим, массово расправляется с ирландскими папистами и вводит в стране пуританский образ жизни. Он также породил сионизм, призвав евреев в Англию, и стал первым в мире главой государства, который потребовал создания в Палестине еврейского государства. Этот кровавый эпизод вошёл в историю под названием Первой гражданской войны в Англии.
После возрождения монархии кромвелевские пуритане бегут из Англии. Они поселяются в Нидерландах, откуда некоторые из них на борту May flower направляются к берегам Америки и становятся «отцами-пилигримами», а другие в Южную Африку и становятся африканерами. Во время войны за независимость в США в XVIII веке кальвинисты вновь сталкиваются с Британской монархией, но в современных английских учебниках истории это называется Второй гражданской войной.
В XVIII веке во время войны Севера и Юга южные штаты, населённые в основном католиками, столкнулись с северными, где преобладали протестанты. История, написанная победителями, описывает эти события как борьбу за свободу и против рабства, что является чистейшей пропагандой, так как южные штаты отменили рабство во время войны, когда они заключили союз с британской монархией. По факту, это было выступление против британского трона, и некоторые историки по этой причине говорят о Третьей британской гражданской войне.
В ХХ веке распри внутри англо-саксов возобновляются, хотя в Соединённом Королевстве пуритане едины с христианами-неконформистами Премьер-министра Дэвида Ллойд Джорджа. Последние отделили Ирландию и вознамерились создать в Палестине «Еврейский очаг». Один из советников Ричарда Никсона Филипс Кельвин посвятил этим войнам обширную монографию, в которой он пришёл к выводу, что ни одна из проблем не была решена, и предсказал новую схватку [ 1 ].
Адепты кальвинистских церквей в течение 40 лет массово голосовали за республиканцев, а теперь они поддерживают демократов.
Я не сомневаюсь, что следующим президентом США станет г-жа Клинтон, а если г-н Трамп и будет избран, то его быстро устранят. Но за все эти несколько месяцев мы стали свидетелями масштабного перераспределения голосов в результате необратимого демографического процесса. Пуритане составляют всего лишь четверть населения страны, и многие из них склоняются к лагерю демократов. Но и их модель представляется исторической катастрофой. Она приказала долго жить в Южной Африке и не сможет долго просуществовать ни в США, ни в Израиле. После избрания президента, ситуация в США будет быстро изменяться, и вновь наступит разлад. В стране, где молодёжь поголовно не приемлет власть пуританских проповедников, вопрос о равенстве нельзя будет больше замалчивать. Пуритане выступают за общество, где все люди равны, но не равнозначны. Лорд Кромвель выступал за республику для англичан, но только после того, как перерезал ирландских папистов. Точно так же в США сегодня все равны перед законом, однако суды по одним и тем же статьям негров осуждают, а белым за те же преступления находят смягчающие обстоятельства. Во многих штатах одного лишь наказания за превышение скорости достаточно для того, чтобы человека лишили избирательного права. Так что белые и чёрные равны, но в ряде штатов многие чернокожие по суду лишены избирательного права. Парадигмой такого мышления во внешней политике является решение по «двум государствам в Палестине» - они равные, но, что более существенно, не равнозначные.
Пуританская идеология способствовала тому, что администрации пастора Картера, Рейгана, Буша (и мл., и ст. являются прямыми потомками «Отцов-пилигримов»), Клинтона и Обамы поддерживали ваххабизм вопреки афишируемым в стране идеалам. А в наши дни эта идеология используется для поддержки ИГИЛ.
Когда-то «Отцы-пилигримы» в Бостоне и Плимуте основали поселения, которые впоследствии были идеализированы в американском общественном сознании. Но историки более лаконичны, они назвали их «Новым Израилем», избравшим «закон Моисея». Их жители в своих соборах крестов не ставили, а расписывали их заповедями Моисея. Будучи христианами, они больше ценили еврейские тексты, чем евангельские. А своих женщин они обязали покрывать голову и ввели телесные наказания.

10115,FBI reopens Hillary investigation – with evidence from Anthony Weiner sexting scandal,"Print 
[Ed. – Hollywood wouldn’t dare dream this one up. What remarkable things life keeps organizing for us.] 
It takes a lot for the FBI to reopen an investigation. It takes even more for the FBI to reopen an investigation of a presidential candidate eleven days before the election. But that’s exactly what happened. 
Early this afternoon it was announced that the FBI was reopening the Criminal Investigation of Hillary Clinton’s conduct as secretary of state, with regards to her email server and America’s secrets (and don’t listen to any Clinton surrogates who say it’s not a criminal investigation…the FBI doesn’t do any other kind of investigation). … 
The new information didn’t come from Wikileaks, according to the NY Times , it came from Huma Abedin (thanks to the Weiner sexting investigation scandal). Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, an aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner.",0
10116,Worried About the Privacy of Your Messages? Download Signal - The New York Times,"BY the time you finish reading this column, you would be foolish not to download the messaging app Signal onto your smartphone and computer. The free encrypted messaging service has won the acclaim of security researchers and privacy advocates, including Edward J. Snowden. All have said that Signal goes above and beyond other chat tools in keeping electronic communications private. And now more than ever, we may need it. That’s because hacks are on the rise  —   look at how the activist group WikiLeaks posted a trove of emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, for all to see. Many are also watching for how government surveillance may grow under Donald J. Trump, who has chosen Mike Pompeo, who advocates greater surveillance, to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. Signal is one of many encrypted messaging services, but it stands out for its uncompromising security and ease of use. The chat service retains virtually no information from users, including messages and address books, on its servers. What’s more, messages remain encrypted when passing through Signal’s servers, meaning that the app’s creators can’t read them. “The default recommendation you’ll get from most security researchers for a messaging app is Signal,” said Joseph Bonneau, a postdoctoral researcher at the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford University. “It’s still the best in the field. ” That said, Signal is not perfect. It lacks some features of other messaging apps, like the ability to send stickers. And during my tests, the service had some glitches. But adding Signal to your folder of messaging apps is a must in an era when technology companies are collecting more personal information and government surveillance may expand. Some people have already cottoned on to this. Signal experienced a 400 percent jump in daily downloads since Mr. Trump won the election, according to Moxie Marlinspike, who founded Open Whisper Systems, the nonprofit that developed Signal. To Mr. Marlinspike, the surge in downloads reflects anxiety among Americans about the implications of Mr. Trump’s presidency for personal privacy. “Trump has threatened a lot of people and he’s about to be in control of the most pervasive and least accountable surveillance infrastructure in the world,” Mr. Marlinspike said. “A lot of people are justifiably concerned about that. ” Signal offers    encryption, meaning a message is scrambled so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient when it is sent from your device, and it remains so when it passes through the app’s server and reaches the recipient. When you initiate a conversation with someone on Signal, you and the recipient exchange   cryptographic keys. Only the person who receives your message holds the key to decrypt and read it. That means that if a government agency had a wiretapping order for your Signal messages, Open Whisper Systems would not have the key to decipher the messages and would be unable to comply. Signal’s technology sets the standard for other messaging services, with its protocol being an   system that other companies can freely use. WhatsApp, Facebook’s Messenger and Google embedded Signal’s encrypted messaging system into their own apps this year. Even so, security researchers said they preferred Signal over other messaging apps because it was more thorough in protecting users’ privacy. The only information Signal stores about users in its database is the last time someone connected to its server and when a person signed up for Signal. Other messaging apps maintain pieces of personal data on their servers. By contrast, while WhatsApp enables Signal’s full encryption by default in messages, there are caveats. WhatsApp may retain some   meta data on conversations, including the phone numbers used in an exchange and the times that the messages were sent, according to the company’s privacy policy. WhatsApp also regularly accesses your phone number and contacts list, so the app can provide an    list of your contacts who use its service to make it easier to message them. Google Allo, Google’s new messaging app that leverages artificial intelligence, does not enable Signal’s    encryption in all its messages by default. Google offers full encrypted messaging only in   Incognito sessions, a private mode that must be turned on manually. When you’re not chatting in Incognito mode, Google stores your Allo messages on its server. Similarly, Facebook’s Messenger enables    encryption inside a private chat mode called Secret Conversations. But by default, normal Messenger chats lack that encryption. Even though Signal doesn’t record your information, the app still works across devices, like a desktop computer and a mobile device. Messages and contacts’ data are stored directly on users’ devices and synchronized between them. Let’s say you already use Signal on your iPhone and want to use it to chat on a Mac (Signal is available as a web app for Google’s Chrome browser for desktop computers). To link the desktop app with your iPhone, you would use the iPhone’s camera to scan a bar code on the Mac web app, which links the two devices together. Then, to get your contacts list and conversations to appear on the Mac, the Mac app pulls your contacts list and messages directly from the iPhone via an encrypted channel, according to Mr. Marlinspike. “It’s a bit more work, from our perspective,” Mr. Marlinspike said. “It’s more complicated than storing all this stuff on a server. ” Signal occasionally runs into glitches, such as when it comes to synchronizing data between computers and smartphones. In my tests, there were several occasions when Signal messages that were sent or received on my smartphone did not immediately show up inside the desktop app  —   though the messages eventually synchronized minutes later. Mr. Marlinspike, who is also the former head of security at Twitter, says he encourages people to report bugs so the group can continue to improve the service. Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a time I could not, for instance, use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad. Mr. Marlinspike said it would support multiple mobile devices eventually. One last caveat is that Signal isn’t as fun to use as apps like Facebook Messenger, which lets you send stickers and animated GIFs to add color and personality to conversations. Open Whisper Systems said it planned to add these features, noting that GIFs are already supported in the Android version of Signal. Still, this is a trivial issue. I’d choose stronger privacy over sending stickers and animations any day. There is no logical reason to skip using Signal. The app is free for Android and iOS, and for computers it is a free   for the Google Chrome browser. Plus, it’s easy to install and so architecturally secure that you can have the confidence to say whatever you want without fear of being spied on. Another benefit is that Open Whisper Systems is a nonprofit that relies on donations and grants, not a business that might eventually have an incentive to share your information with third parties like advertisers. That’s not to say Signal should be your only messaging app. You could use it exclusively for sensitive matters, like   conversations. Then for casual chats like making plans with friends and loved ones, you could switch to more “fun” apps like Facebook Messenger and send all the stickers you want. Probably the biggest thing missing from Signal will be many of your friends. The app isn’t as popular among consumers as other mainstream messaging apps, so hanging out on Signal can feel lonely. So if you care about your privacy, other than installing Signal today, you should nag everyone you know to join the service, too.",0
10117,Oregon Topples Kansas for First Final Four Appearance Since 1939 - The New York Times,"KANSAS CITY, Mo.  —   For all of the storied history they can boast, the Kansas Jayhawks were not in the very first Final Four. The Oregon Ducks were. As their drought approaches eight decades, the Ducks will make their triumphant return. “Since 1939,” Ducks Coach Dana Altman said. “We waited a long time. ” In what was for all practical purposes a home game for   Kansas, Oregon delivered a   stunner on Saturday night, putting down speed bumps in front of the Jayhawks’ ordinarily turbocharged offense and displaying remarkable marksmanship to pull off an upset that has brought them closer to their second national championship than they have ever been. The   Ducks enter their second Final Four assured that they will face another   opponent. Next Saturday, in the national semifinals in Glendale, Ariz. they will play the winner of Sunday’s game between North Carolina and Kentucky. Had Oregon ( ) written a checklist for everything that needed to happen for them to advance, it is difficult to think of a single box they could not check off after the game. Jordan Bell being a monster  ? Check. Bell, a    junior, showed why he was named the   defensive player of the year. He had assumed the role of top   from Chris Boucher, who was lost to injury during the conference tournament, and was a force against the Jayhawks. Bell was a force against the Jayhawks, blocking eight shots and extending possessions, with 7 of his 13 rebounds coming on offense. He even found ways to create his own shots, chipping in 11 points. Do the math: He was two blocks from a   still a rarity in the college game. Altman said he had never seen Bell play so well. “He was Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher together,” Altman said. Tremendous shooting? Check. In the first half, Oregon made 60 percent of its shots  —   58. 3 percent from behind the arc, with seven  . At the   buzzer, the sophomore Tyler Dorsey banked in his fourth    —   from nearly 30 feet away  —   to give the Ducks a   lead. By the end of the night, he had sunk six of 10   shots en route to a   27 points. Trouble for the Kansas star Josh Jackson? Check. Within the game’s first three minutes, Jackson, a freshman forward who will almost assuredly be a top pick in the impending N. B. A. draft, had two fouls. He was limited to 10 minutes in the first half  —   and, more important, no points. The only thing Oregon could not do was neutralize Frank Mason III, the Jayhawks’ senior point guard and a contender for national player of the year. With 17 points in the first half  —   in one stretch, he scored 15 straight  —   Mason kept the game within striking distance. In his final game for the Jayhawks ( ) Mason finished with 21 points and 4 assists  —   and played all 40 minutes. But this was a Murphy’s Law game for Kansas. From Oregon’s hot hand to Jackson’s foul trouble to Devonte’ Graham’s shooting  —   Graham, a junior who was nearly 4 for 10 from   range over the season, was a stunning 0 for 7 from the field and missed all six of his   attempts  —   nearly everything that could go amiss did. Even when a tight  —   almost nervous  —   Oregon offense let them back in the game, Kansas could not convert on the opportunity. The Jayhawks led just once the whole night:   in the game’s opening minutes. Kansas had cruised through the first two rounds and demolished   Purdue,   in its previous game. The Jayhawks appeared to be poised for their 15th trip to the Final Four and a chance to win the tournament a fourth time. But the Jayhawks, who won the title in 2008 but have not reached the national semifinals since 2012, could not solve the Ducks. “They were the aggressor and certainly controlled the game almost from the jump,” Kansas Coach Bill Self said. Sprint Center is less than an hour’s drive from Lawrence, Kan.  —   the stands were a sea of red and blue, except for the section directly behind Oregon’s bench  —   and the crowd was overwhelmingly behind the Jayhawks, who kept it close by pushing the pace. Oregon, however, was not about to be beaten in a track meet. Especially not with Phil Knight, the Oregon   present. Knight, after all,   a shoe company called Nike that finds its roots in track. “We came in with the same   same game plan,” Bell said. “They like to play fast, we like to play fast, too. ” Even when things did not seem to go well for the Ducks, it turned out just fine. In the second half, the freshman Payton Pritchard airballed an open   from the corner only for Bell to catch the ball, go up with it and score  —   and draw a foul and complete the   play. It was that kind of game for Oregon. With a lead that grew as large as 16 points in the second half, Oregon appeared hesitant in   sets, milking the shot clock as though there were two minutes left, not 12. Kansas, undeterred, climbed back into the game. The Jayhawks cut the margin to   with less than three minutes left. But again, it would turn out fine for the Ducks. With his team’s lead down to 6, Dorsey missed a desperation   attempt to avoid a   violation. Ball, as he had done so many other times Saturday night, kept possession for the Ducks. It ended in another   by Dorsey. No stranger in the    crowd could doubt it was not the Jayhawks’ night. And so they will take a short ride home after missing the Final Four again. The Jayhawks may be able to trace their lineage back to basketball’s inventor, James Naismith, but they could not overcome the Ducks. Oregon, after all, has some history of its own.",0

10122,Hillary Clinton ‘Super PAC’ to Air First Attack Ads Aimed at Donald Trump - The New York Times,"The general election effort to take down Donald J. Trump through television ads will begin on Wednesday, with the main “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton airing its first two attack ads on broadcast television in four swing states. The effort kicks off a   campaign that will flood screens in those states in the months to come. The super PAC, Priorities USA Action, had initially planned to wait until after the June 7 primary contests to introduce TV ads attacking Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, but accelerated its effort against him. The group’s $6 million investment includes two ads that offer scathing critiques of Mr. Trump’s comments about women that will run for the next three weeks in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada. Mrs. Clinton’s most devoted donors have given roughly $80 million to Priorities USA Action to stop Mr. Trump, more than the group raised in the entire 2012 election to   President Obama. The ads are the beginning of the broader Democratic campaign against Mr. Trump, focused on convincing suburban and   women that he does not respect them. Priorities USA Action said it also planned to run ads that critiqued Mr. Trump’s business record and portrayed him as out of touch with the   Americans he says he represents, an approach similar to the one it used to depict the Republican nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, as a cold corporate titan. Mrs. Clinton’s allies said Mr. Trump’s mocking of a New York Times reporter’s disability also effectively turned off swing voters, potentially providing fodder for future ads that depict Mr. Trump as insensitive and unprepared for the presidency. Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals criticized Mr. Trump similarly on his comments about women and on his business record during the party’s nominating contest, but the effort came too late to stop his momentum. One of the super PAC’s ads, called “Speak,” shows voters   some of Mr. Trump’s caustic remarks about women as they wear shirts with Mr. Trump’s visage   on them. The other, “Respect,” shows quick interviews with the candidate in which he outlines his positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood. The super PAC had initially invested $130 million to reserve time for broadcast and digital ads that would start running the day after the California and New Jersey primaries in June. But it decided to add an additional buy to accelerate the time line, aiming to sow early doubts about Mr. Trump, particularly among female voters who will have a disproportionate effect on the fall election and with whom Mr. Trump has shown a particular weakness in polls. Female voters favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump, 55 percent to 35 percent, in a New York   News poll released in March, twice the gender gap of the 2012 presidential election, when President Obama defeated Mr. Romney. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, which cannot directly coordinate with the super PAC, has tried to raise money by showing Mr. Trump’s comments assailing the former secretary of state for playing the “woman’s card. ” Mrs. Clinton, though, has tried to avoid directly provoking Mr. Trump, relying instead on outside groups like the super PAC to carry out direct attacks. The campaign’s online videos against Mr. Trump have focused mostly on his policy positions and on criticism by his rivals in the Republican primaries. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the “Speak” ad had misrepresented one of his statements. “The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. ‘You can tell them to go BLANK themselves’  —   was about China, NOT WOMEN!” he wrote on Twitter. That drew a rebuke from the super PAC. “Sorry Donald, but the ad isn’t only about your overt sexism, it’s about your divisiveness and character being unsuitable for the office of the presidency,” Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the group, said in an email on Tuesday morning. In an interview, Mr. Barasky said the group thought it had to advertise earlier after seeing the Republican “stop Trump” effort fall short. “The decision was made recently to go up now because we learned from Washington Republicans that you can’t wait to go after Trump,” Mr. Barasky said. “What they did was too little, too late, and we weren’t going to make the same mistake. ” The new ads adhere to similar lines of attack taken by Our Principles PAC, the super PAC led by Republican operatives. It released an ad, “Quotes,” featuring female actors reciting Mr. Trump’s quotations about women. The ad tested highly in effectiveness, but came out only days before the Republican primary in Florida, which Mr. Trump won. “Speak” is slightly different in that the ad uses Mr. Trump’s voice rather than those of actors, along with the voices of voters. “Our research shows most people know very little about Donald Trump,” Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Priorities PAC, said on MSNBC on Monday night, adding, “When we tested a lot of the ‘Never Trump’ ads, we realized very quickly they really had no idea what Donald Trump had been saying on the stump and what his record had been in business or toward women, and so it’s our job to make sure they see it. ” He added that the group would also be focused on Mr. Trump’s business record, an issue that numerous Republican groups and campaigns highlighted during the nominating contest. Mr. Cecil specifically mentioned Mr. Trump’s record of “making ties in China and hiring people in Bangladesh. ”",0
10123,Trump Addressed Joint Session of Congress For the First Time - The New York Times,"President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress for the first time. Here’s how we analyzed it in real time, and our live fact checks. The State of the Union is   …     not happening this year, technically. But in a   address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, President Trump was expected to deliver the equivalent: a speech intended to set the course for his   policy agenda and mollify concerns on Capitol Hill after his uneven first month in office. ■ The president tries to set the tone in an   interview on “Fox and Friends. ” He gives himself a grade of A so far. ■ Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, said he would break a nearly   streak and not try to greet the president, citing policy differences. Here is what to keep an eye on: President Trump suggested on Tuesday that the recent spate of   bomb threats and cemetery vandalism could be politically coordinated attacks to “make people look bad”  —   an apparent suggestion that his opponents could be behind them. Speaking at the White House to attorneys general from around the country, Mr. Trump was asked by Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, about the wave of attacks and how the federal government could work with state governments to confront the violence. “First, he said the acts were reprehensible,” Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat who was elected to the post in November, said while recounting Mr. Trump’s response. “Second he said: ‘And you’ve got to be careful, it could be the reverse. This could be the reverse, trying to make people look bad.’ ” The comments echoed the Twitter post of an adviser, Anthony Scaramucci, who suggested that Democrats were behind threats to Jewish community centers. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump was questioned for his seemingly reluctant denunciation of David Duke, the former Klansman who backed him, and for the onslaught of   hate from supporters on social media. At a news conference this month, Mr. Trump suggested that people who were holding up   signs at rallies were doing so to make him look bad. “Some of it is written by our opponents,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “You do know that. Do you understand that?” Approximately 100 tombstones were toppled at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia this week, the second such attack in the city in the last month. Synagogues, community centers and cemeteries around the country have been targeted this year. Democrats condemned Mr. Trump’s remarks on Tuesday and called for an apology. “For millennia, Jews have not only endured unthinkable violence, but the subsequent denial of that violence,” said Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. “For the president of the United States to insinuate that threats to Jewish community centers are illegitimate is truly beyond the pale. ” The   League, which combats   said it was “astonished” by Mr. Trump’s sentiments and called on him to clarify his remarks. Mr. Shapiro, speaking on the sidelines of the attorneys general conference, said that he was not entirely sure of what to make of Mr. Trump’s comments. “I was a little surprised by it, and others were, too, Republicans and Democrats,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The question I asked was a genuine one and one of great concern to people in my state. ” Mr. Trump told the attorneys general that he planned to discuss the issue during his address to Congress on Tuesday night. Mr. Trump gave his presidency an A so far in an interview broadcast Tuesday morning, but he added that he would only give himself a C for communicating how great he has been. Appearing on “Fox and Friends,” which he has called one of his favorite shows, Mr. Trump blamed former President Barack Obama for organizing opposition against him, called Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, “incompetent” and gently criticized his own press secretary for how he has handled leaks. The interview, shown just hours before Mr. Trump was to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress, set the stage for a day when he will have perhaps the biggest audience available to him for the rest of his first year in office. He highlighted his plans to increase military spending, tighten borders and replace Mr. Obama’s health care program, and he boasted that he had already brought back jobs to America. “I think I’ve done great things, but I don’t think I have  —   I and my people  —   I don’t think we’ve explained it well enough to the American public,” he said. “I think I get an A in terms of what I’ve actually done, but in terms of messaging, I’d give myself a C or a  . ” He acknowledged that he did not have the support of a majority of Americans in polls, but he said those who do back him were more intense. “The love is great,” he said. “And I saw a poll where I was at 45 or 46 percent, but one of the things they said is that the level of enthusiasm for me is as strong as they’ve ever seen. ” Mr. Trump rejected criticism by Ms. Pelosi, who said that for all the sound and fury, the president had not actually accomplished much in his first month in office. “I’ve been watching Nancy’s tape, and so I think she’s incompetent, actually,” Mr. Trump said. Asked by the Fox hosts if he thought Mr. Obama was responsible for some of the protests against his policies, Mr. Trump agreed but brushed it off. “I think he is behind it,” he said. “I also think it’s politics,” adding, “And look, I have a very thick skin. ” Mr. Trump, who has railed against leaks, said some of them had probably come from holdovers from the Obama administration. But he said his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was wrong to have brought a group of staff members into his office and inspect their cellphones in the presence of White House lawyers. “Sean Spicer is a fine human being he’s a fine person,” Mr. Trump said. “I would have done it differently. I would have gone    with different people. ” He added: “I would have handled it differently than Sean. But Sean handles it his way, and I’m O. K. with it. ” For almost three decades, Representative Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat, has stood along the aisle of the House chamber for every presidential address to Congress, waiting to shake the president’s hand. But on Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump will become the first president since 1989 to not receive a greeting from Mr. Engel. As curious reporters mused whether Mr. Engel would repeat his annual ritual of claiming his seat long before the address begins, the lawmaker bypassed the prime empty aisle seat and a chance to shake hands with his fellow New Yorker. Among other disagreements that factored into his decision to skip the handshake, Mr. Engel said, were Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and his attacks on the news media. “The president needs to work with all people,” Mr. Engel said. “And therefore I will listen to what he has to say today, but I will not greet him and shake his hand. ” Mr. Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, has been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal critics in the House, pressing for further investigations into the administration’s ties to Russia. In January Mr. Engel introduced legislation that would punish any foreign entity found to have intervened in a federal election. Some Democrats planned to make a statement with their wardrobe as well: A group of female members planned to wear white, the color of the suffragist movement, in a signal to Mr. Trump on women’s rights. Representative Lois Frankel of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic Women’s Working Group, said on Twitter that the choice of attire symbolized “a pledge to protect women’s health, fair pay, paid leave  more!” Based on the preview that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to hark back to his “law and order” theme by promising more aggressive federal policing of gun crimes, drugs and other areas in response to a rise in violent crime in some big cities. Crime is near historic lows nationwide and remains far below levels seen in the 1970s and ‘80s. But Mr. Sessions, a former senator and prosecutor who was an important campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters he was worried that the increase in violence in some major cities, like Chicago and Baltimore, was “not a blip” and could signal “a   trend. ” Mr. Sessions gave speech of his own on that topic Tuesday morning to the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington. Mr. Sessions said he wanted to let local police officers know “that they’re being supported” in Washington, and he suggested that morale was lagging in some departments because of a lack of federal leadership. Mr. Trump will also be trying to affirm his role as commander in chief. In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump described a raid in Yemen that left an American commando and a number of civilians dead as something that generals “wanted to do” and that was planned before he took office, drawing charges that he was deflecting responsibility for a mission he approved. Mr. Trump was asked to respond to William Owens, father of Chief Petty Officer William Owens, 36, the Navy SEAL member who was killed in the Jan. 29 raid. Mr. Owens told The Miami Herald that he refused to meet with the president when his son’s body was returned home, and asked why the new administration had rushed into a “stupid mission. ” “Well, this was a mission that was started before I got here,” Mr. Trump said. “This was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do. They came to see me, they explained what they wanted to do, the generals. ” Moments later, he reiterated that “this was something that they were looking at for a long time doing. ” His statement drew sharp responses from critics who said he was defying a long tradition of commanders shouldering responsibility for what happens under them. “He’s the opposite of a `buck stops here’ president,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “Trump has a predilection for always blaming somebody else for what goes wrong. ” Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter that in the Trump worldview, “Trump is responsible for all the victories, his team for all the defeats. ” Though he spoke of the Yemen mission not as his own, but as a project of “the generals,” Mr. Trump boasted, “My generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. ” In fact, the military command consists almost entirely of people who were in their posts before he took office. Muslims. Immigrants. A recent detainee. Officially, the Democratic rebuttal to Mr. Trump’s speech will come from Steven L. Beshear, the former governor of Kentucky, who will defend the Affordable Care Act. But inside the House chamber where Mr. Trump will speak, Democrats plan to assemble a cadre of human symbols, bringing as guests several people imperiled by the president’s policies. Eschewing   boycotts of the speech  —   a feature of Mr. Trump’s inaugural address  —   members of Congress have used their invitations as another form of protest. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is bringing an Iraqi refugee who settled in the state in 2010 and is now an American citizen. Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York invited Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked as a translator for American forces in Iraq and was detained last month at Kennedy International Airport under the Trump administration’s travel ban. Other guests include undocumented immigrants who were protected from deportation under Mr. Obama, an Iranian graduate student and the founder of the Syrian Community Network.",0
10124,"Norbert Schemansky, Who Won Weight-Lifting Gold but Little Applause Back Home, Dies at 92 - The New York Times","Norbert Schemansky, one of the world’s greatest weight lifters and the first to win medals in four Olympic Games, all while scraping to make a living in a hometown, Dearborn, Mich. that more than 60 years ago greeted his achievements with a shrug, died on Tuesday at his home there. He was 92. The   Funeral Home in Dearborn confirmed his death. Schemansky competed across four decades, winning competitions, breaking records and, with his   heaves, leaving spectators in awe. A bear of a man with a mild countenance, he could be instantly picked out of a bevy of musclemen in tights by his signature   eyeglasses, as if Superman had shown up still wearing Clark Kent’s. But there was no disguising his prowess. “Norbert Schemansky is the greatest and strongest athlete I have ever seen,” his Cold War rival and fellow Olympian Yuri Vlasov of Ukraine was quoted as saying. Schemansky himself said, “One time I figured it out, and I’d lifted enough weight to lift the Queen Mary. ” At just under six feet tall and weighing 265 pounds or so, Schemansky had   thighs, wrists like    and, by all accounts, steel in his sinews since childhood. The Detroit Free Press called him “born strong. ” At 11 years old he had gotten a job at a Detroit market unloading   bags of potatoes. He began his Olympic run in 1948 in London, where he won the silver medal in the super heavyweight class. In 1952, in Helsinki, he won the gold in the   class. He missed the 1956 Games, in Melbourne, Australia, while recovering from two back operations to repair damaged disks. But the injuries did not deter him. He returned to the Olympics in 1960, in Rome, to win the bronze as a superheavyweight, and then in 1964, in Tokyo, to bring home the bronze again. In between, he was winning world and national championships and breaking records. In 1964 he became the first man ever to lift a total of 1, 200 pounds: 400 with the press (no longer used in competition) 355 with the snatch and 445 with the clean and jerk. He later exceeded that total, lifting 415, 363 ¾ and 445 (totaling 1, 223 ¾ pounds). An international poll in 1954 ranked him as the fifth greatest athlete in the world. “What Muhammad Ali and Joe Louis are to boxing, what John Grimek and Arnold Schwarzenegger mean to bodybuilding, and what Gordie Howe and Wayne Gretzky represent in hockey, Norbert Schemansky is to Olympic weight lifting,” Richard Bak wrote in his 2007 biography of Schemansky, “Mr. Weightlifting. ” Yet for all his success, Schemansky was consigned to stardom in a sport that drew little notice in the United States. Even his hometown, Dearborn, seemed indifferent, particularly before and after the 1952 Games. “I was working at Briggs Manufacturing, and I asked for time off,” Schemansky told The Detroit News in 2002, “and one of the guys from downstairs said: ‘Give him all the time off he wants. Fire him. ’” Schemansky quit, went to Helsinki and won the gold medal. When he returned home, a gold medal in his bag, no one was there to greet him. Only an airport porter recognized him. “The bus porter said, ‘Nice going, Semansky,’” he recalled. “He mispronounced my name, but he knew who I was. ” Schemansky took a bus home alone. It was not an unfamiliar experience. As he told Strength  Health magazine in 1973, “The worst part of competing was coming home. ” Norbert Schemansky was born in Detroit on May 30, 1924, and grew up there, one of four brothers. He started lifting at 15 with an older brother, a national junior champion, and training in a converted   garage. In high school he was a    . In World War II he fought in the Battle of the Bulge. While competing across the country and abroad, he took mostly menial jobs  —   one was cleaning latrines  —   despite a reported I. Q. of 132. Sometimes he was out of a job or took unpaid leave just so he could compete. His straitened circumstances dismayed the sportswriter Mark Kram, who in a sympathetic 1966 profile in Sports Illustrated expressed incredulity that Schemansky had not earned more than $3, 000 in any of the previous eight years, a time when he and his wife, Bernice, were rearing four children and scratching to make payments on their house. “How can it be,” Kram wrote, “that a man who has won respect for himself and prestige for his country clings to the shadowy periphery of life, is a nonperson without status or function and one whose wife for most of the last 20 years has, in effect, supported his participation for the U. S. with an $   job?” Schemansky said he had to work because there were no endorsements in his day and no money for athletes. “Not a penny,” he said in 2002, adding, “If I was competing now, I’d be a millionaire. ” The Soviet news agency Tass was quick to recognize Schemansky’s plight as a useful propaganda tool when he and Vlasov met in front of 8, 000 fans in Budapest in 1962 in what was billed as the “heavyweight match of the century. ” After Schemansky beat Vlasov in the press and the snatch but lost the match on total points (his ankle collapsed on the final lift) Tass made ideological hay, declaring that “the story of Schemansky” illustrated “the attitude toward man in a capitalistic world. ” Schemansky retired from competition in 1972 after 26 years of lifting and became a civil engineer for the city of Dearborn, which named a park after him in 1996.

Schemansky could be ambivalent about the fame and fortune that never accrued to him in any great measure. “Norb himself is an anomaly, a man of contradiction,” Strength  Health magazine observed in 1973. “He appears to disdain recognition, yet he feels he should have it for what he has done. ”   years later, his attitude remained the same. “I always thought something good would come out of it,” he said of his career, in an interview with The Detroit Free Press, “but nothing ever did. I thought it would help me get a better job. When I worked for Stroh’s Brewery, I asked for a salesman’s job. They said, ‘We’re not hiring athletes.’ Then, a couple of months later, I find out they hired a football player. You give up so much. Yeah, sometimes I wonder why I did it. ”",0
10125,Simon and Schuster Children’s Authors Publish Letter Protesting MILO - Breitbart,"More than 160 Simon and Schuster children’s book authors have signed a   letter to the CEO of the company protesting the publishing of Breitbart Senior editor MILO’s upcoming book, “DANGEROUS. ”[The letter, organised by Simon and Schuster’s children’s authors, was published Thursday morning with signees such as Newbery, Caldecott, and honorees of the National Book Award. Arun Gandhi, the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi also texted his signature from India according to the release.   The letter reads, We, as Simon  Schuster children’s and YA authors and illustrators, have deep respect for our publisher, our editors, and the Simon  Schuster Children’s Division, which we believe strives to publish the strongest, most diverse list it can acquire, for the betterment of literature and children everywhere. Sadly, we cannot extend this same respect to Simon  Schuster’s Threshold imprint following their decision to lend the legitimacy of this publisher’s venerable brand to   Milo Yiannopoulos. Threshold has placed Simon  Schuster’s considerable reputation and weight behind one of the most prominent faces of the newly repackaged white   nationalist movement and financially supported a man who routinely denigrates, verbally attacks, and directs dangerous internet doxxing and hate campaigns against women, minorities, LGBTQ individuals, Muslims, and anyone he chooses to target who supports equality and human decency. Irrespective of the content of this book, by extending a mainstream publication contract, Threshold has chosen to legitimize this reprehensible belief system, these behaviors, and white supremacy itself. Additionally, they have associated all of Simon  Schuster with it, and therefore weakened the reach of the many other brilliant imprints that daily attempt to contribute to humanity instead of destroy it. This is not an issue of advocating or suppressing free speech, as Mr. Yiannopoulos has a broad internet broadcasting platform and the support of many extremist organizations and publications. His voice is certainly being heard, and it is a voice of hate that stirs its followers to emotional, verbal, and physical violence directed at anyone who disagrees or speaks to the contrary. Insinuating that people who protest this terrible decision wish to suppress free speech is gaslighting. As Simon  Schuster authors and illustrators who are already published, with books in the release pipeline, with contracts in place, we do not have to quietly accept or assent to this “Gleichschaltung,” this getting in line with fascism and making it mainstream. We reject the wisdom of this decision. This man, and this book, are not America. This man, and this book, are not the bulk of Simon  Schuster. This man, and this book, are not us, the authors and illustrators of Simon  Schuster. We believe that the children we write for deserve a better America. We the undersigned pledge to continue to advocate tolerance, acceptance, love, diversity, and equality, and respectfully ask you to take an irrefutable stand against hate. Simon and Schuster has yet to respond to the letter.",0
10126,"Owner Was Target, but Restaurant Workers Are Swept Up in Immigration Raids - The New York Times","BUFFALO  —   Immigration enforcement agents were supposed to be targeting the restaurant owner. But Antonio Ramos Salazar, a cook, was the one with guns pointed at his head. One morning last month the officers burst through the back door at La Divina, a   Mexican market and taco counter in suburban Buffalo, capping a   investigation into the labor practices of the restaurant’s owner, Sergio Mucino. According to the authorities, Mr. Mucino, 42, a legal permanent resident from Mexico City, along with two associates, had been harboring undocumented workers in homes around Buffalo, transporting them to jobs at his restaurants and paying them off the books. Mr. Mucino was arrested at his home on Oct. 18. But two dozen of his workers were swept up in simultaneous raids that morning at all four of his restaurants. It amounted to one of the largest immigration workplace sweeps in recent years. In the days after the presidential election, immigrant rights advocates and supporters of immigration restriction alike wondered whether these raids were a preview of the stricter enforcement policies that   Donald J. Trump promised during his campaign. The sweeps hark back to the workplace actions of President George W. Bush’s administration, and deviated significantly from the Department of Homeland Security’s longstanding enforcement strategy of avoiding roundups of unauthorized workers and instead targeting abusive employers. During the raids, the authorities discovered that nine workers had   the country after having been deported, which is a federal crime. Three more, including Mr. Salazar, were charged with immigration violations  —   which are administrative offenses only  —   and were ordered deported. The remaining 10 workers were released. “The targets of the investigation were the employers,” a homeland security spokesman, Khaalid Walls, said. “After investigating the case, we alleged that many of the employees were either subject to criminal charges or immigration violations, and we charged accordingly. ” Camille Mackler, the legal director of the New York Immigration Coalition, which oversees immigrant advocacy groups, said, “There’s always collateral damage in a criminal investigation, but the workers in this case are victims. ” Now, Ms. Mackler added, workers and advocates fear that this could be the blueprint for future raids under Mr. Trump  —   “and that would be on the small side. ” Mr. Trump pledged that in his first year in office he would deport unauthorized immigrants with criminal records, putting their number at two million, while increasing enforcement operations to deal with an undocumented population of more than 11 million people in the United States. “I don’t see Mr. Trump as the kind of individual who is going to make such a large promise and neglect to keep it,” said Tom Bauerle, a Buffalo native and conservative talk show host on WBEN, who voted for Mr. Trump. “I expect the law to be enforced. ” Mr. Bauerle said that after the raids the radio station received numerous comments from listeners cheering the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “At the same time,” he added, “they are disappointed because apparently these places made awesome tacos. ” The authorities said the raids were set in motion more than two years ago, thanks, in part, to a tip from a former employee who was fired. According to the workers and their lawyers, Mr. Mucino paid weekly salaries for   days that worked out to be below the minimum hourly wage of $9. Two workers interviewed said salaries started at $450 a week for a dishwasher and increased at different positions in the kitchen. The federal complaint stated that each restaurant grossed $50, 000 per week, which was not reported for state or federal taxes. The authorities said Mr. Mucino operated some of the business on the books, endorsing payroll checks to 28 employees. “Building and supporting a business through the intentional use of people not lawfully authorized to work here is a model that H. S. I. will not tolerate,” said Kevin Sibley, the acting special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Buffalo. He added that such practices undermine competition and “often come at the peril of the workers. ” But the United States attorney’s office for the Western District of New York did not charge Mr. Mucino or his associates with human trafficking, nor have tax evasion or labor violation charges been filed. Nicole Hallett, a University at Buffalo law professor who is representing three workers in their immigration cases, called the government’s actions counterintuitive. “If you are concerned about the exploitation of workers, you should not be prosecuting or deporting worker victims, because that discourages workers from coming forward in situations where they are being exploited,” Professor Hallett said. In interviews, four workers said they were not mistreated at the restaurants. They noted that the pay was better than that at agricultural or factory jobs they held previously. Mr. Salazar, the head cook at La Divina, is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor as he awaits deportation proceedings, though he is charged only with a civil offense. “If this is just from being here to work,” Mr. Salazar said, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, “what would happen if I actually committed a crime?” He said he had earned a law degree in Mexico, but was unable to find work there to support his family of three. Sergio Roblero, 19, said he had paid a recruiter in Mexico $4, 480 for a guest worker’s visa and travel expenses to pick blueberries in Georgia. He was told he would be making $10. 59 an hour he made only $3, he said. Mr. Roblero was unable to leave the farm unless he paid $1, 000 to get his passport back. To recoup his losses, he moved four months ago to Buffalo, where a friend from Mexico was working for Mr. Mucino’s restaurants. “I’m afraid that other people are going to go through what I did,” Mr. Roblero said. “I know that the economy in Mexico is always going to be bad and people are always going to come to this country. ” According to statistics from 2014 released this month by the Pew Research Center, nearly eight million undocumented people in the United States were part of the work force or seeking employment. In New York State, undocumented immigrants represented 6 percent of the labor force. While some of his workers are still detained, Mr. Mucino was released on $85, 000 bail and reopened La Divina, though his other restaurants, which are full service, remain closed. Mr. Mucino parked a black Mercedes sport utility vehicle behind the store last week and spoke of his employees. “All of them are very nice people and they’re hard workers,” he said. “I feel very bad for everything that happened. ” He declined to comment further on the charges. According to the authorities, an incident in August accelerated the investigation. Fourteen men went to play basketball after their shifts around 10 p. m. at a suburban Buffalo playground. The local police answered a call about the group and asked for identification. When some of the men could produce only Mexican identification cards, the police called the United States Border Patrol. By 1:30 a. m. 10 people were detained and five were arrested, charged with having illegally   the country. Later, a manager, Manguin Sanchez, a United States citizen, went to collect the men’s cash, which had been seized by immigration officers, and told the authorities it was their pay. According to the federal complaint, he also said restaurant workers lived in properties he owned. It was confirmation for investigators. In addition to Mr. Sanchez, 22, and Mr. Mucino, the authorities arrested another manager, Jose   37. The men provided two houses and nine apartments for their employees’ housing. Leticia and Saul    —   Jose  ’s brother  —   live in one house, along with four children, all of whom are United States citizens. Ms.   who had started working with her husband at La Divina only two days before the raids, said the family moved in 2015 from Los Angeles to Buffalo to be closer to relatives. Her daughter, Magali, 17, is the best student in the family, she said, and had saved more than $9, 000 in cash for her college fund. It was confiscated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during a raid of the house. “It’s been like a nightmare for the whole family,” Ms.   said in Spanish, through an interpreter. The workers have received support from local churches, community organizations and a national workers’ rights group, Movimiento Cosecha, which organized several protests in Buffalo. Some Buffalo residents have put aside questions of immigration policy and the exploitation of immigrant labor in favor of their taste buds. Since opening in 2015, La Divina has drawn rave reviews and long lines for its authentic, overstuffed $2. 50 tacos. Gaetano Augello, 60, acknowledged that he felt uncomfortable hearing that workers might have been taken advantage of. “Of course, who wants to subsidize that? That’s not a   story,” he said. But he had returned for the tacos. And now that Mr. Mucino has hired replacement cooks to make the recipes? “I don’t know if they’re quite as good,” Mr. Augello said. “They’re good, don’t get me wrong. ”",0

10129,Solving the Debt Crisis,"The solution to our debt crisis is for “We the People” to take our Republic back from the special interests by educating voters to enforce the Constitution, not by adding a Balanced Budget Amendment via an Article V convention. 
“Our country is run by a close network of special interests, public officials, and the media.” — Eighty-one percent of Americans agreed with this statement in a 1996 survey. 
Back in 1996, the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture at the University of Virginia published the results of their survey of the American public based on 2,000 face-to-face, in-depth interviews. They titled their survey “The State of Disunion — 1996.” 
Their finding that 81 percent of Americans believe “Our country is run by a close network of special interests, public officials, and the media” was recently reaffirmed by a January 2016 Gallup poll that revealed that 84 percent of Americans agree with the statement, “powerful special interests [have] too much control over what the government does.” According to the Gallup poll, 51 percent believe that this is a “major problem,” while 33 percent believe that this is a “crisis” situation. 
This widespread belief that “Our country is run by a close network of special interests, public officials, and the media” has also been validated by the presidential election campaign of 2016. Rarely have we seen so clearly the political power plays of this “close network,” which includes of course the establishment elites of both parties, as during the 2016 election cycle. 
You might wonder what all this talk of special interests’ control over our government has to do with our debt crisis. The connection is that for the last four decades there has been an organized movement to get Congress to call an Article V convention for the purpose of proposing a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA), ostensibly to avert a national debt crisis, such as national bankruptcy or some other type of “economic meltdown.” The proponents of this BBA constitutional convention tell us that the government is out of control, as shown by our steady diet of $500 billion or higher federal deficits and the resulting skyrocketing national debt, currently around $20 trillion. According to these proponents, the solution is to add a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution via an Article V convention. 
However, the federal government is not out of control. It is under the control of a “close network” of powerful special interests, aka establishment elites, whose carefully nurtured voting blocs benefit from ever-larger, unconstitutional federal programs. The problem is not just the huge annual federal deficits and the towering national debt they contribute to, it is the bloated and tyrannical federal government that has been created and powered by congressional approval of myriad special interest-sponsored unconstitutional programs. 
Establishment Elites Plot to Rewrite the Constitution 
Throughout its 30-year history, this magazine has led the way in exposing the powerful establishment elites who run this country. These elites are found in such leading special-interest groupings as Big Business, Big Labor, Big News Media, the education establishment, foundations, internationalist foreign policy organizations, big political donors, and the major political parties. An excellent example of this magazine’s exposés is “Council on Foreign Relations,” an article that was originally published in the August 3, 2009 issue. That article described the amazing degree of influence over our government exercised by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the preeminent internationalist foreign policy special-interest group, as follows: Chief among these groups is the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the most visible manifestation of what some have called the American establishment. Members of the council have dominated the administrations of every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the cabinet and sub-cabinet level. It does not matter whether the president is a Democrat or Republican. 
Although the CFR has only about 5,000 members, a very large number of them are leaders of other leading special-interest groups, serve as public officials, and hold leading management and editorial positions in the media. This is true to such an extent that the CFR membership alone could be thought of as “a close network of special interests, public officials, and the media” that run our country. 
An earlier article in this magazine, “ Bicentennial Plot ” (February 10, 1986 issue), exposed the plans of a powerful establishment special-interest group, the Committee on the Constitutional System (CCS), which was leading the charge to “formalize radical changes that have already been taking place by rewriting the Constitution.” As you would expect, two out of the three CCS co-chairs were members of the CFR, and 15 of the 41 members of the CCS board of directors were also CFR members. 
Since that special-interest establishment’s attempt to rewrite the Constitution in the 1980s fizzled out, there hasn’t been another such transparent attempt by the establishment to replace the Constitution. However, we shouldn’t neglect to point out that since the 1970s the leading organization promoting the calling of an Article V convention for the purpose of proposing a Balanced Budget Amendment has been the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), an establishment special-interest group that boasts of having nearly one-fourth of our nation’s state legislators, as well as nearly 300 corporations (including many multinational corporations) and private foundations, as members. ALEC is on record on its website as officially supporting congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), two signature causes of the establishment elites. For more information on this, see our 2014 article “ The Not-so-smart ALEC .” 
Although the establishment’s fingerprints are otherwise hard to find on today’s leading initiatives to bring about an Article V convention, there is a somewhat stealthy bipartisan movement to bring about such a convention, as revealed in “Working Together to Rewrite the Constitution” in our June 9, 2014 issue. 
Republics and Democracies 
To better understand the connection between increasing numbers of unconstitutional programs and an increasingly tyrannical federal government, consider the distinction between republics and democracies. 
On September 17, 1961, Constitution Day, Robert Welch (who had founded The John Birch Society less than three years earlier) gave a speech entitled “ Republics and Democracies ” to a patriotic Chicago-based organization, “We the People.” This speech went on to influence millions of Americans to understand that our nation is a republic, not a democracy. It is still available at TheNewAmerican.com. 
In his speech, Robert Welch demonstrated that the United States is a constitutional republic characterized by the “rule of law,” not a democracy characterized by the “rule of men.” And he quoted approvingly from James Madison in The Federalist , No. 10, regarding the nature of a democracy: Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. 
One’s first reaction to Madison’s assertion that democracies are “short in their lives” might be to say, “Madison is wrong because our nation is a democracy and it has lasted for over 200 years.” However, our nation is a republic, not a democracy. That’s why it has lasted so long. The problem is that the more our nation is transformed into a democracy, the shorter its life will be. 
And our nation is being transformed into a democracy by the ongoing passage of unconstitutional programs by Congress. After a century or more of congressional seizures of powers not granted to it by the Constitution (as discussed below), we’ve long since reached the point where almost the only consideration taken into account by congressmen voting for a bill is whether a majority of their constituents will approve. Very few congressmen vote for a bill based on whether it is constitutional. As Representative “Pete” Stark (D-Calif.) famously opined at a town hall meeting in 2010, “The federal government … can do most anything in this country.” 
We live in an era of “the tyranny of the majority,” which is the basic critique of democracies. In a pure democracy, everything is decided by a simple majority vote of the people or their representatives. There are no constitutional restraints, such as the enumerated powers of Article I, Section 8 of our Constitution or a Bill of Rights. 
If Congress and the rest of the federal government continue on the path of bowing primarily to majority opinion, usually artfully crafted by the special-interest elites, and not obeying any constitutional limitations on their power, then we will lose all remaining constitutional bulwarks against tyranny, and finally, lose all security for our God-given rights. 
Robert Welch ended his “Republics and Democracies” speech by stating, “This is a Republic, not a Democracy. Let’s keep it that way!” We need to take this slogan to heart and reject the ongoing transformation of our constitutional Republic into a democracy. 
Therefore, the solution to our nation’s twin problems of too much national debt and too powerful a federal government is to defeat the special interests’ control over our government by educating voters sufficiently to get a majority of constitutionalists elected to Congress. This constitutionalist majority would eliminate or gradually phase out all unconstitutional programs, thereby balancing the budget, reducing taxes, securing our rights, and restoring our constitutional Republic and the rule of law, not of men. 
So in terms of the above overview of the national debt/tyrannical government crisis and solution, our main objection to bringing about a Balanced Budget Amendment Article V convention at this time in our nation’s history is that the “close network of special interests, public officials, and the media” that runs our country would dominate such a convention process and would most likely end up revising the Constitution in their favor. 
History of the National Debt/Tyrannical Government Crisis 
Now let’s take a look at the history of our national debt/tyrannical government crisis to see how long we’ve had it, how big it is, and what caused it. 
First of all, take a look at the chart in Figure 1a (right), which shows our national debt from 1792-2020 as measured in dollars, uncorrected for inflation and the size of our economy. This chart gives the false impression that we never had a significant national debt in our nation’s history until somewhere around 1940, and that sometime in the 1980s the national debt began to increase exponentially and shows no signs of slowing down. This false impression is due to not correcting the chart for inflation and the size of our economy. This is not to say that we don’t have a public debt problem. We emphatically do. It’s just that the history of our national debt has been more nuanced than what is displayed in Fig. 1a. 
Meanwhile, the Balanced Budget Amendment Article V convention movement got rolling in the 1970s. Proponents of such a convention made the argument to state legislators in the 1970s, as they have ever since, that large annual federal deficits and the rapidly growing national debt were leading to economic and fiscal disaster. They argued that the solution was to add a BBA to the Constitution. But since Article V of the Constitution provides only two ways to propose amendments, either by a vote of two-thirds of both houses of Congress or by a state-initiated constitutional convention, and since Congress had still not approved a proposed BBA, then we just had to get 34 states to apply to Congress to call an Article V convention in order to get a BBA proposed and ratified. 
It turns out that the dire predictions of economic and fiscal crisis have not come true — yet. However, the catastrophic situation depicted in Fig. 1a does reflect a truly dangerous fiscal situation as revealed in a more accurate way in Fig. 1b. In this chart the level of national debt is measured in terms of percent of real GDP, which provides an automatic correction for inflation and the size of our economy. Just as in Figure 1a, the graph in Fig. 1b shows a dangerous buildup in national debt. In contrast to Fig. 1a though, Fig. 1b provides some valuable information about the history of our nation’s national debt. Figure 1b shows that we’ve had a buildup in national debt many times since 1792. Until the 1980s, these increases in national debt have always been associated with wars, such as the War for Independence, the War of 1812, the Civil War, WWI, and WWII. After each of these wars, we’ve paid most of the debt off. 
But since 1980, we’ve had a rapid increase in the national debt without being involved in a full-scale war. Since the increases in our national debt are basically due to our annual federal budget deficits, let’s examine what’s been going on with federal spending and deficits as revealed in Figures 1c and 1d. In these two figures, spending and deficits are measured as a percent of real GDP, again to correct for inflation and the size of our economy. We see a familiar pattern in both 1c and 1d. There are the peaks of spending and deficits corresponding to the major wars we’ve fought. 
However, there’s also something very interesting that is revealed in the pattern of federal spending. We see a rapid increase in federal spending beginning in the 1930s and continuing into the 1980s. We know from American political history that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in 1932 and that he inaugurated many new government programs, not authorized by the Constitution and known collectively as the “New Deal.” Once FDR and Congress had opened the floodgates for large-scale unconstitutional spending, there was no turning back. 
Unconstitutional programs begat more and more unconstitutional agencies, departments, and programs, and this process has continued right up to today. We’ll verify the unconstitutionality of the vast majority of federal spending below when we look at the specific spending categories for fiscal year 2015. 
One very striking statistic from Fig. 1c is that during President Obama’s first term, annual federal spending set a new, post-WWII record of nearly 25 percent of GDP. 
Now look at Fig. 1d. In the 1930s, the increased federal spending led to immediate increases in federal deficits. Next, the massive deficits of the WWII years masked any deficits that were caused by increases in non-war spending. But within a few years after WWII, a pattern of seemingly modest deficits developed. Then, in the 1970s, these deficits began to increase toward five percent of GDP and remained at or near the five-percent level until the late 1990s when federal deficits were eliminated for a few years in the wake of the Republican Revolution of 1994. Under George W. Bush the deficits returned, but it was during the Obama years that some of the deficits set a new post-WWII record of nearly 10 percent of GDP. 
So, what’s the point of all of this analysis of spending, deficits, and debt? It is that Congress was authorized with specific enumerated powers in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution; however, in the 1930s Congress began a lavish spree of unconstitutional spending that increased rapidly for many decades and continues to increase to this day. 
The Unconstitutionality of Most Federal Spending 
Now take a look at Figure 2 (below). This pie chart shows all federal spending for fiscal year 2015, which amounted to $3.8 trillion (about 20 percent of GDP). Let’s see if our characterization of the rapid increase in federal spending since the 1930s as unconstitutional holds up. 
If you’ll compare the 12 spending categories listed for the various pie pieces in Fig. 2 with the powers granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8, you’ll find that over 70 percent of current federal spending is unconstitutional. About the only categories of spending that appear to be constitutional are “Military,” “Veterans’ Benefits,” and “Interest on Debt.” Sure there are some constitutional programs buried within the various categories, but the vast majority of spending within the unconstitutional categories is still unconstitutional. 
Even a very brief review of some of the various categories of federal spending in Fig. 2 reveals the seeds of the destruction of our freedoms by a tyrannical federal government present in these categories. 
For example, the “International Affairs” category includes our unconstitutional foreign aid program and the dues for our unconstitutional United Nations membership. These expenditures are being used to help build a global government, which would destroy our nation’s independence and our personal rights and freedoms. 
The “Education” spending is used by the federal government to exert its unconstitutional control over all levels of education with the goal of producing compliant citizens who will vote to support the “close network of special interests, public officials, and the media” that runs our country. Think Common Core. 
The “Food & Agriculture” spending hides the surprisingly large unconstitutional “food stamp” program, which in 2014 cost $74.1 billion and was used by 46.5 million Americans. This program develops and maintains the loyalty of millions of voters to the special-interest elites on a daily basis. 
Then there’s the huge “mandatory spending” categories of “Social Security, Unemployment & Labor,” and “Medicare & Health,” which constituted fully 60 percent of federal spending in 2015. Here is where we find the spending for the big three entitlement programs — Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Various economists have estimated that the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs have unfunded liabilities of between $100 and $200 trillion. This is equal to between five and 10 times the size of our annual GDP. In short, the promises to pay specific levels of future benefits for these unconstitutional entitlement programs are simply promises that our government can’t keep. 
Also hidden inside the spending shown in the Fig. 2 pie chart is about $500 billion in unconstitutional federal aid to states each year for health, education, etc., which amounts to about 30 percent on average of each state’s annual budget. This unconstitutional federal aid is passed through by the states to its citizens and thereby makes the states complicit in the special interests’ rampant unconstitutional federal spending. This level of federal subsidization of state budgets severely compromises state sovereignty. 
Furthermore, consider that the 10th Amendment states, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution … are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” When Congress illegally seizes the power to “do most anything in this country,” then that leaves virtually no powers reserved to the states to exercise. 
The point of this brief review of the unconstitutionality of over 70 percent of federal spending in 2015 is to confirm that the rapid increase in federal spending that occurred between the mid-1930s and 1980, and that has continued, albeit at a slower pace, right up to today, can be characterized as mostly unconstitutional spending. 
BBA Article V Convention Movement 
In 1957, Indiana became the first state to apply to Congress to call an Article V convention for the purpose of proposing a Balanced Budget Amendment. Although a sprinkling of states applied to Congress for such a BBA “constitutional convention” in the 1960s and early 1970s, the movement didn’t really take off until sometime in the mid-1970s, when the American Legislative Exchange Council began promoting a “Balanced Federal Budget Petition,” which later became known as a “Balanced Budget Amendment” petition. (See our 2015 article “ The New BBA Con-Con Threat ” for more BBA Article V convention history.) 
Nowadays most proponents of such a convention deny that it can be properly called a “constitutional convention” — because such a reference warns Americans of the potential danger of such a gathering. However, The John Birch Society and many other organizations and activists continue to correctly refer to an Article V convention as a constitutional convention (often abbreviated as Con-Con). The 1979 fifth edition of the widely used Black’s Law Dictionary even explicitly refers to an Article V Convention as an example of a constitutional convention. 
By 1983, 32 of the required 34 states had applied to Congress to call a BBA Article V convention. This was the high-water mark of the BBA constitutional convention movement; it has not been surpassed up to the present day. The next state to apply for such a convention was Florida in 2010. 
By the mid-1980s members of The John Birch Society and other organizations, such as Eagle Forum, were working with state legislators to oppose the approval of any new Article V convention applications and to rescind (cancel) existing applications. From 1988 to 2010, 17 states, including Florida, rescinded their previous BBA Article V convention applications. 
Current Status of the BBA Article V Convention Movement 
Although the numerous Article V convention application rescissions during the years 1988 to 2010 reduced the number of states that still had “live” (unrescinded) applications for a BBA Article V convention down to 17, the momentum shifted again in 2010. From 2010 to 2015, eight states that had formerly rescinded their applications reapplied for a BBA Article V convention. Then, Ohio and Michigan made their initial BBA convention applications in 2013 and 2014 respectively, yielding a new total of 27 states with “live” applications as of September 2015, just seven short of the required 34 states. 
Then, in 2016 two more states, Oklahoma and West Virginia, applied for a BBA Article V convention to be called; however, Delaware rescinded its existing “live” application for a BBA Article V convention. So, the BBA convention proponents gained a net of one state this year for a total of 28. That leaves them six short of the required 34 states for forcing Congress to call a convention. 
Now look at the “BBA Article V Convention Status November 2016” map (right) and see what your state’s status is. The John Birch Society is recommending that those readers living in a green state (no “live” BBA Article V convention application) work with others and your state legislators to stop the approval of any BBA Article V convention application in your legislature. 
If your state is orange, your state already has an existing “live” BBA Article V convention application. The John Birch Society is recommending that you work with others and your state legislators to get a resolution introduced and approved to rescind all existing Article V convention calls, especially of the BBA variety. Remember that for every additional state that rescinds its BBA convention call, the BBA convention movement is one state further away from its goal of 34. For further information about how to rescind Article V convention applications, see our article “ Save the Constitution by Rescinding Article V Convention Applications .” 
See the sidebar “Why a BBA Article V Convention Is Not a Wise Idea” at the end of this article for a summary of the reasons for opposing a BBA Article V convention. 
This Is a Republic, Not a Democracy! 
The point is that our problem with the federal government is not just due to deficit spending, and the federal government is not simply out of control. Our problem with the federal government is that Congress has seized (usurped) powers not granted to it by the Constitution, and special interests have taken control of the federal government by taking advantage of these usurped powers to reward their carefully cultivated constituencies. 
Our Republic is being converted into a democracy by the establishment’s deliberate flouting of the Constitution, along with its cultivation of voting blocs that are electing congressmen who are moving our nation toward a “tyranny of the majority.” Even though our nation was founded on the principle in the Declaration of Independence that “governments are instituted among men” to “secure” our God-given rights, a “tyranny of the majority” would eventually strip our nation of all our rights. 
Therefore, the solution to our twin problems of too high a national debt and too powerful a federal government is not to add a BBA to the Constitution, but rather to support grassroots efforts by independent, private organizations to create a constitutionally informed electorate that would nominate and elect a majority of constitutionalists to Congress and state legislatures. We the People are the last resort for enforcing the Constitution and thereby securing our rights. We must not enable the powerful special-interest establishment to revise our Constitution in their favor via an Article V convention process at this time in our history. 
The Constitution must be preserved as a rallying point for freedom-loving Americans. This is a republic, not a democracy. Let’s keep it that way! * * * 
Sidebar: Why a BBA Article V Convention Is Not a Wise Idea 
• The national debt is not the real problem. The real problem is how “a close network of special interests, public officials, and the media” control the federal government based on their ability to build voting blocs that benefit from the unconstitutional federal programs that they initiate. The fiscally dangerous size of the national debt is a measure of just how effective the special interests are in getting their deficit-spending programs funded. The solution to the debt crisis is to create a constitutionally informed electorate and pay the national debt off by phasing out unconstitutional spending. 
• A runaway convention could rewrite the Constitution. An Article V convention has the inherent power to extensively revise or completely rewrite the Constitution based on the precedent of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and on the right of the people to alter or abolish their form of government (including the ratification procedure) as stated in the Declaration of Independence. 
• An Article V Convention would play into the hands of the special interests. The “close network of special interests, public officials, and the media” that control our nation would lead an Article V convention process to revise the Constitution to favor the special interests, and would also massively influence the ratification process to favor the special interests. 
• Virtually all BBA proposals include loopholes, such as national emergency exceptions and supermajority exceptions, that would enable Congress to continue approving deficit spending, even if a BBA were to be added to the Constitution. 
• A BBA would legitimize unconstitutional spending by shifting the focus away from whether a certain bill is unconstitutional and toward whether the bill would fit within a balanced budget. The BBA Article V convention movement has never been about restoring the spending limitations contained in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. 
• A BBA would further transform our Republic into a democracy by making the main criterion for approving a proposed bill the degree of popular support that bill has for including it in a balanced budget, as opposed to its constitutionality. A constitutional republic is characterized by the rule of law, while a democracy is characterized by the rule of men and leads to a tyranny of the majority.

10130,Women’s Day Protest Groups Conflict over Race in Santa Cruz - Breitbart,"Conflict emerged between protest groups demonstrating on International Women’s Day in downtown Santa Cruz, California on Wednesday, as a “Brown Squad” focused on racial issues faced off against a “less diverse” group of protesters. [The local Santa Cruz Sentinel described an “intense conflict” between the two protest groups, which it described as follows:  The protest’s two distinct groups clearly had different agendas. The first included roughly 75 younger protesters, mostly women of color, who marched down from UC Santa Cruz. This group’s messaging was focused on racism, white privilege, patriarchal oppression, as well as transgender and queer issues. The second group consisted of about 150 women and a few men dressed mostly in red who had been brought together by the Santa Cruz General Strike Organizing Committee. Older and less diverse, this group focused on issues primary to the larger International Women’s Day Strike  —   reserving most of its anger for the administration of President Donald Trump. Protest splintered into 2 groups. One blocking traffic. Still no SCPD. #scsrt pic. twitter.   —   Ryan Masters (@ryanmasters831) March 8, 2017,  The “Brown Squad” was the more radical of the two, according to the Sentinel. It blocked traffic downtown, leading to a tense standoff with a pickup truck driver that was captured on YouTube: At one point, a member of the “Brown Squad” delivered a speech to the “less diverse” group, exhorting it to address its own internal privilege, according to the Sentinel: ““  means getting off your high horse and realizing that other people are suffering a lot more than you   …     To join those people over there you have to address the darkness within you. ” Footage, apparently of the two groups together, shows some demonstrators wearing masks, a protester carrying a Palestinian flag, and a speech railing against capitalism.  According to the Sentinel, the groups later splintered. Protests were also held in other cities across the country, though they did not match the scale of protests on the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Photo: file, Joel B.

10133,Comey Letter Hurts GOP As Hillary Clinton Raised $11.3 Million Online In 72 Hours,"The letter from James Comey about the Hillary Clinton email scandal has motivated Democrats, as the Clinton campaign says they raised $11.3 million online in the last 72 hours.

— Lisa Lerer (@llerer) November 1, 2016 
The Comey letter was supposed to boost Trump and depress Democratic turnout, but the opposite appears to be happening. James Comey’s interference in the presidential election has motivated Clinton supporters to work harder, give more money, and get to the polls, which in not what Republicans wanted at all. 
Democrats have seen through Comey’s letter and the Republican spin. The October surprise has failed. Instead, it has made Hillary Clinton even stronger while giving her campaign more resources to use to close out the presidential election. 
As a political tactic, the Comey letter is harming Republicans. 
Republicans have thrown everything that they can think of at Hillary Clinton, and nothing has stopped her. Hillary Clinton and her supporters continue to grow stronger, while Donald Trump is marching back into reality television star C-list celebrity obscurity.",0
10134,"In Year Before Florida Shooting, Suspect’s Problems Multiplied - The New York Times","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  —   Signs of Esteban Santiago’s unraveling had mounted over the past year. But it was not until early November, when he walked into an F. B. I. office carrying an ammunition clip  —   leaving a pistol and his infant son in his car  —   to complain about a C. I. A. plot against him, that his behavior became disturbing enough to earn him a short stay in a psychiatric hospital unit. In the months before, the police were called repeatedly to his home about domestic disturbances, and the National Guard kicked him out because of “unsatisfactory performance” after nearly a decade of service. Mr. Santiago, an Iraq war veteran, increasingly spoke to relatives and associates about voices in his head that were tormenting him. Then, a little before 1 p. m. Friday, Mr. Santiago, 26, turned up far from his Alaska home, in Terminal 2 of the Fort   International Airport. There, law enforcement officials said, he retrieved his checked luggage, pulled a   handgun out of his suitcase and used it to kill five people and wound six others, setting off a panic that shut down the airport. After running out of ammunition, he lay   on the floor, waiting quietly to be arrested, witnesses said. Late Saturday afternoon, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida announced that Mr. Santiago had been arrested and charged on a federal criminal complaint “in connection with the deadly shooting of multiple victims at Fort   International Airport. ” His first court appearance was scheduled for Monday morning before a federal magistrate in Fort Lauderdale. Law enforcement officials said they had not determined a motive or cause for the attack. And while they said they could not exclude the possibility of terrorism, the initial investigation suggested that Mr. Santiago had acted alone and that there was no evidence that he had terrorist ties. “It’s way too early for us to really rule out anything,” George Piro, the agent in charge of the F. B. I. ’s Miami office, said at a news conference here on Saturday. But family members said they had a pretty good idea of what led to the attack. “He said he heard certain voices, that the U. S. government wanted to enroll him in certain groups for ISIS, and he was very paranoid,” Bryan Santiago Ruiz, an older brother of Mr. Santiago’s, said in an interview on Saturday in Peñuelas, the small town in Puerto Rico where they grew up. Esteban Santiago lived in Anchorage, and Bryan Santiago said he had visited him there, most recently staying with him from August through October. “He said that the C. I. A. controlled him through secret messages over the internet and told him the things he had to do,” he recalled. It was on Nov. 7 that Esteban Santiago went to the F. B. I. office in Anchorage “to report that his mind was being controlled by U. S. intelligence agencies,” Marlin L. Ritzman, the agent in charge of the office, said on Saturday. “During the interview, Mr. Santiago appeared agitated, incoherent and made disjointed statements. ” Elaborating, a senior law enforcement official said Mr. Santiago had claimed that the C. I. A. put terrorist propaganda on his computer. F. B. I. agents called the local police, who took him to a psychiatric facility. “Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS,” said Christopher Tolley, the Anchorage police chief, referring to the Islamic State. When Mr. Santiago went into the F. B. I. office, he left a pistol and his newborn in his vehicle, Chief Tolley said, and he had an ammunition clip in his pocket. The senior law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said the gun was the same weapon used in the airport shooting on Friday. The police confiscated the gun but returned it to Mr. Santiago in December, Chief Tolley said. Bryan Santiago said his brother was held at the hospital for just a few days before being released and, as far as he knew, did not have any   treatment, like medication or therapy. The Fort Lauderdale airport reopened on Saturday, as the F. B. I. led an investigation that sprawled across the country and airport officials tried to reunite people with what they said were 20, 000 items that had been recovered from the terminal, left behind by passengers and airport workers fleeing for their lives. Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but was raised in Puerto Rico, where he joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2007 before he finished high school. A classmate said he had always wanted to be a soldier. In 2010, Mr. Santiago was deployed to Iraq for nine months, working with the 130th Engineer Battalion clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. His company was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. Guard officials said at least two members of the company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is no record indicating that Mr. Santiago was ever involved in combat. Family members said Mr. Santiago was never quite the same after his return. “After Iraq, something happened,” Hernan Rivera, 70, Mr. Santiago’s uncle, said Saturday afternoon as he stood in his driveway in Union City, N. J. “When he came back from Iraq, he was a different person. ” He described his nephew as a “normal kid” who enjoyed reading. “He was a person who used to talk a lot,” Mr. Rivera said. “And then when he came back, he kept to himself, he’d go to his room, he wouldn’t talk to anybody. ” In 2014, Mr. Santiago moved to Alaska and joined the Alaska Army National Guard. He got a job as a security guard and found a girlfriend 14 years his senior. A few months ago, they had a baby a law enforcement official said it was not clear whether that was the same child that he brought with him to the F. B. I. office in November. In January 2016, the girlfriend told the police that Mr. Santiago had flown into a rage while she was using the bathroom, broke down the bathroom door and was “strangling her and smacking her in the side of the head” while screaming at her, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. A month later, he was charged with violating a court order to stay away from his girlfriend after the police found that he had been living with her again. In March, a deferred judgment was entered in the case, meaning that it could be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble, but the signs of unrest continued. Chief Tolley said that once in March and twice in October, Mr. Santiago was the subject of domestic disturbance calls, but each time, officers lacked the basis for making an arrest. In August, Mr. Santiago, who had reached the rank of private first class and had won several commendations for his earlier National Guard service  —   including the Army Good Conduct Medal  —   was discharged by the Alaska Guard for “unsatisfactory performance. ” Despite the disturbing nature of the episode with the F. B. I. in November, it did not land Mr. Santiago on any law enforcement watch lists or on the federal “ ” list. Neither did it impede his right to possess a gun. At a news conference on Saturday in Anchorage, officials with the F. B. I. and local law enforcement said that although Mr. Santiago was clearly incoherent during his encounter with F. B. I. agents, he was not deemed to be threatening. In two other mass killings, perpetrators had drawn attention from the F. B. I. before carrying out their attacks. Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June, had fallen under F. B. I. scrutiny twice for possible ties to terrorism. And Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was interviewed by agents looking into whether he had extremist tendencies, but their investigation of him ended there. On Thursday night, Mr. Santiago boarded a flight in Anchorage, changed planes in Minneapolis on Friday morning, and flew into Fort Lauderdale. Law enforcement officials said that he had a semiautomatic handgun in his checked suitcase and that he followed all legal procedures for transporting the weapon. He went into a terminal restroom, took out the gun and loaded it, then returned to the baggage claim area and started shooting, officials said. He apparently acted alone, Agent Piro said on Saturday, and “the early indication is that there was no specific reason that he chose Fort Lauderdale International Airport, but we’re still pursuing that and trying to really determine why he came here. ” “The suspect did cooperate with the interview team,” which Agent Piro described as a joint effort by the F. B. I. and the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. “The interview went over several hours and concluded sometime this morning. ” While people who knew Mr. Santiago recently saw anger, instability and paranoia, those who knew him earlier in his life had known someone very different. Relatives and acquaintances in Puerto Rico remembered him as being quiet and shy  —   so reserved that in his hometown, Peñuelas, on the island’s southwest coast, few people knew anything about him. Workers at the barbershop, the bakery and the furniture store, and parishioners at the churches near his family’s home, said they did not know Mr. Santiago or his family at all. At the police station, officers said they did not recognize him from the photograph that has been shown repeatedly on network and cable television since his arrest. A neighbor of the family’s, Carlos Cruz, a man in his 50s who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life, said he remembered speaking with Mr. Santiago just once. Those who did recall him described him as highly intelligent, kind and very quiet, part of a somewhat nerdy group who listened to American rock rather than music in Spanish. He spoke of joining the military, seeing it as a way out of the sleepy, economically stagnant region. Rosemarie Zapata, 27, who attended middle school and high school with him, credited him with persuading her to join the Puerto Rico National Guard. At first, she failed the exam by two points, but it was Mr. Santiago who talked her into persevering and introduced her to his recruiter, she said. “He told me, ‘Study, go, they will help us pay for college, so why don’t you try it out? ’” she said. He convinced her that she could do it, saying, “You are going to defy all odds,” she recalled. Years later, she ran into him in a Walgreens parking lot, shortly after he had returned from Iraq. “He was very different,” she said in a telephone interview from Puerto Rico. “He told me: ‘You would never want to go to Iraq. I saw horrible things, horrible.’ He was very different. He was sad. ” Delia Candelario, who went to Josefa Vélez Bauzá High School with Mr. Santiago, said he played basketball with the   boys, who always followed the teachers’ orders. “He was the most peaceful of all of them,” she said. “He participated in classes and all that, but he was pretty shy. ” Another classmate, Joshua Ortiz, said Mr. Santiago was so quiet that when word got out that someone from their school had committed a massacre, hardly anyone could remember his name. Mr. Santiago and his friends were “never known to be involved in any problem or any fight during the whole time we were in school,” Mr. Ortiz said. “We wonder, how could his life have changed so much for this to have happened?” José Hernández, who taught Mr. Santiago history at the school, said: “He was brilliant and did not show any indications of being disturbed. It’s one of those strange cases. There are students who you expect mischief from, but not this one. ”",0
10135,"Trump, Easing Emissions Rule, Vows to Expand Auto Jobs - The New York Times","YPSILANTI, Mich.  —   President Trump came to the heart of the auto industry on Wednesday with a manifesto for American manufacturing: to remove the shackles of regulation and restore an age of industrial glory. Granting the automakers their top wish, Mr. Trump halted an initiative by the Obama administration to impose stringent   standards by 2025  —   rules meant to cut carbon emissions and meet international commitments to address climate change. Instead, Mr. Trump vowed to keep cutting regulations as a means to accelerate economic growth and add new jobs. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he declared. The move to reopen the government’s review of the standards will allow automakers to argue for less stringent  —   and less costly  —   mileage standards than the target of 54. 5 miles per gallon set in 2012 by President Barack Obama. But the Trump administration is expecting things from the automakers in return for its   stance: new American jobs, and less investment in foreign operations. And while Mr. Trump vowed to improve business conditions at home, he pledged again to stop the flow of automotive investment and jobs to Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he termed “a total disaster. ” “We want to be the car capital of the world again,” the president said. “And we will be. ” The announcement on pollution standards was delivered before hundreds of auto executives and workers in a former assembly plant near Detroit. It drew sharp criticism from environmental groups contending that laxer regulations would increase global warming and hurt consumers. But Mr. Trump had little to say about climate change or fuel prices on Wednesday, preferring to focus on his evolving economic doctrine, which he termed “the American model” for stimulating growth and business expansion. “Under this system, we will reduce burdens on our companies and on our businesses,” Mr. Trump said. “But, in exchange, companies must hire and grow in America. ” His policies will get their initial test with an auto industry that was was brought to its knees by the recession eight years ago and required an $80 billion taxpayer bailout, including the   bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler. But now the industry is coming off two straight years of record sales in the United States, and automakers are flush with profits. By acceding to the automakers’ plea for regulatory relief, Mr. Trump is challenging them to funnel more resources into their American manufacturing operations. One auto industry analyst said the decision to reopen   negotiations appears to have been brokered during meetings between the president and the chief executives of the three big American automakers  —   G. M. Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler  —   shortly after he took office. “We believe an ‘art of the deal’ may have been struck trading jobs for regulatory relief,” the analyst, Brian Johnson of Barclays, wrote in a letter to investors on Wednesday. Detroit auto executives have been   about their    with the White House. All three companies have, however, already made promises to add or retain thousands of American jobs in response to Mr. Trump’s previous criticisms of their investments in Mexico. And just hours before Mr. Trump’s speech on Wednesday, G. M. said it would create 220 additional jobs in a Michigan transmission plant and retain 680 workers who were facing layoffs at another factory. Without mentioning the president’s decision on fuel standards, G. M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the new and preserved jobs underscored the “overall positive outlook for the auto industry and the U. S. economy. ” Mr. Trump called G. M.’s move “just the beginning” of a new era of job growth in the industry. “That’s peanuts,” he said. “We’re going to have a lot more. They’re going to be building new plants, expanding their plants. ” But automakers may be   to meet Mr. Trump’s expectations. The financial collapse of the industry during the recession is still a fresh memory, and companies have streamlined their manufacturing operations to eliminate costly excess capacity. Adding new plants in a market at its peak could upset the industry’s steady recovery and jeopardize the big profits earned in recent years on larger vehicles like pickups and sport utility vehicles. Automakers are also spending heavily on new technology for autonomous vehicles, yet they are not near the point of building plants to produce   models. And despite the blooming partnership between the industry and the Trump administration, there are lingering worries among automakers about the potential for a border tax on imports from Mexico and elsewhere. A tax on imported models could raise prices on several vehicles in high demand by American consumers, including pickup trucks made in Mexico by G. M. and Fiat Chrysler. But Mr. Trump has an unlikely ally in Detroit for a tax on Mexican imports: the United Automobile Workers union, which supports his plan to renegotiate Nafta. The union’s president, Dennis Williams, has praised Mr. Trump for his position on Mexican trade. “We’ve been hollering about this for 20 years and he is the first president who has brought this up,” Mr. Williams said last month in a meeting with reporters. He was less supportive of Mr. Trump’s move to cut back on   rules, noting that consumers benefit directly from improved mileage on new cars and trucks. Despite reopening the review of the fuel standards, Mr. Trump notably did not initiate any action to revoke the waivers of states, in particular California, to set their own emissions rules. That leaves California with the ability, for now, to impose stricter standards than whatever is ultimately decided by federal regulators. The   rules, aimed at cutting   carbon dioxide, were a pillar of President Obama’s climate change legacy. They would have required automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 54. 5 miles per gallon by 2025, forcing automakers to speed development of highly   vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars. In the final days of the Obama administration, the Environmental Protection Agency affirmed the standards, despite the automakers’ appeals for further review. The review of the fuel rules will now stretch into 2018, and environmental groups are preparing for a fierce debate on the need for strict standards to combat climate change. “The future of the U. S. auto industry is at stake, and Mr. Trump is being shortsighted,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign. Mr. Becker and other environmental activists argue that the auto companies have the technology necessary to meet the 2025 standards set by the Obama administration. Moreover, they contend that any increase in sticker prices from   equipment would be more than offset by savings consumers get at the gas pump.",0
10136,Trump says he’d be ‘neutral’ with Israelis and Palestinians,"Email 
Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ‘Sometimes agreements can’t be made’After being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it “one hell of a shot” and called it “probably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.”But when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
“You know, I don’t want to get into it, because … If I win, I don’t want to be in a position where I’m saying to you and the other side now says, ‘We don’t want Trump involved,'” Trump said. 
“Let me be sort of a neutral guy,” he continued. “A lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don’t want to say whose fault is it. I don’t think it helps.”Trump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
“It’s possible it’s not makeable, because don’t forget it has to last — it’s wonderful to make it and it doesn’t work, but it has to last,” he said. “To make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I’m going to give it a shot.” 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
“A lot of people say an agreement can’t be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can’t be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,” he said. “I was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it’s impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they’re children to hate Jewish people.”In the past, Trump has questioned Israel’s commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “a good friend.” 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, “I don’t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don’t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.” 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: “A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal — whether or not Israel’s willing to sacrifice certain things,” he said. “They may not be, and I understand that, and I’m okay with that. But then you’re just not going to have a deal.” 
Trump’s comments Wednesday came hours after a dramatic upset in polls saw Trump fall behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the first time in 31 consecutive polls, coming in at 26% of registered Republican voters nationally, two points behind Cruz at 28%.",0

10138,Chinese Communist Wants to Own Hollywood Studio,"Email 
Vladimir Lenin, the first dictator of the Soviet Union, said “the motion picture” was the most important art form for spreading communism to other countries. And his successor, the murderous dictator Joseph Stalin, is reported to have predicted he could convert the whole world to communism if he was given control of the American movie industry. 
In 1935, the cultural commissioner of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), V.J. Jerome, planted a branch of the party in Hollywood, and went to work to use the industry to advance the cause. The Soviet-backed communists recruited actors, directors, and writers to the cause, and eventually did battle with the studio owners in labor strikes. 
But now, Chinese communists have surpassed their Russian comrades, and they aren’t bothering with recruiting “lowly” actors, directors, and writers to advance Chinese communism; they are looking to buy theater chains and movie studios. 
In fact, they purchased AMC Entertainment Holdings back in 2012, gaining control over hundreds of cinemas in 30 U.S. states, and at least five other nations. It is the world’s largest operator of I-MAX and 3D screens. 
Now, Chinese company Wanda Group, which took over AMC, wants to obtain at least one American studio, and invest in several others. 
Much of the American media have referred to Wanda as a “private company,” run by multibillionaire Wang Jianlin (shown). But most media outlets neglect to mention Wang is a high-ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party, and the company is actually owned by the Chinese communist government. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, “Dalian Wanda Group Corporation Ltd. Operates as a subsidiary of China National United Oil Corporation, Ltd.” Known as “China Oil,” it is in turn owned and controlled directly by the communist regime through two other state-owned companies — the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinochem Corporation. 
Wang is regarded as China’s wealthiest man. While rarely watching movies himself, he has strong interest in the American motion picture industry. He made a $3.5 billion deal for distribution with Legendary Entertainment, located in Burbank, California; is poised to obtain Dick Clark Productions in a $1 billion acquisition; and is presently building the world’s largest film studio in China at a price tag of $8.2 billion. 
But he wants an American movie studio, expressing special interest in obtaining a majority ownership of Paramount. Until he can wrest control of one studio, he has established an investment fund to buy shares in all six major Hollywood studios. 
“I want to acquire one of the big six, but whether we can is a different story — it’s uncertain,” Wang admits. “We will continue to work on a potential acquisition. But it won’t hurt to start by doing what we can. Participating via investment seems like a wise choice for the time being.” 
Wang was recently honored at a Hollywood banquet at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Studio executives from Sony, Lionsgate, Universal, and Warner Brothers all attended, along with movie stars such as Harrison Ford. 
The move by Wang and the Chinese government to gain such clout in the industry has caused concern in Congress. Sixteen members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote a letter to the U.S. Government Accountability Office in September, asking for them to scrutinize Chinese purchases of American entertainment companies as a national security concern. The letter mentioned Chinese efforts to “censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media” 
Because of the sheer size of the Chinese movie market, among other reasons, the industry has already shown extreme caution not to offend the communist giant. For example, when the 1980s movie Red Dawn was re-made, the original script called for the invaders to be Chinese communists rather than Russian communists attempting to take over America. After the film had already been made, MGM became concerned enough to make the invaders North Koreans . 
And that was a year before Wanda took over AMC. 
Stanley Rosen, a political science professor at USC, contends that Hollywood “is already altering their films to make them China-friendly — or at least China-neutral — to gain market access there.” He argues that Wanda doesn’t need to buy studios to change things all that much. 
Wang recently addressed some of the concerns about his company’s investments in the movie industry. He blames the criticism to the current presidential election campaign, and said he did not believe it represents the “mainstream” of America. “With the general election as the backdrop, voices against China, or Chinese enterprises, will certainly attract attention.” 
When asked for his views on Donald Trump, Wang allowed that Trump had been somewhat successful as a businessman, but that he was just not in the same league with America’s “real mega-rich,” citing Bill Gates as an example. He is withholding judgment of Trump as a politician until after the election. 
Wang was born in 1954 to parents who were in the Red Army of Mao Tse-tung. His formal schooling came to an abrupt halt when Mao ended China’s education system in 1966. At that point, Mao gave the Chinese two choices, “We could go to the rural areas and participate in farming or become a soldier.” Because of his parents’ past service in the People’s Liberation Army, he chose a military life. 
He recalled a 745-mile march during a period of time when the temperatures were below zero. “I remember once when we had to march for three days and three nights nonstop. A lot of people just slept while marching.” The troops formed three rows so that a soldier could grab the backpack of the soldier in front of him. That way, only the leader kept his eyes open as the rest trudged along behind him. 
“I saw one person in the next row fall off a cliff from walking with his eyes closed.” 
After 16 years in the PLA, he was assigned a provincial government post. Then, in 1988, he became the manager of a government-owned real estate company that was deeply in debt. Wang turned the company around, and the company was re-named Wanda in the early '90s. Today, Wanda Group employees 130,000. 
Wang is a tough task-master. Employees who violate the company’s strict dress code are fined, and sometimes fired. All employees, even the top executives, are required to punch in and punch out. 
Over the years, as the Chinese government-run industries have become wealthier by selling cheap goods made with what is essentially slave labor, they have bought up natural resources around the world, especially in Africa and Latin America. Now, the regime is moving to purchase Western businesses, including computers and technology, banks, agriculture, and automobiles. 
But the propaganda opportunities in the motion picture industry far surpass any such possibilities to be advanced by growing wheat or making cars. For many people, once they have seen something on the silver screen, or heard something in a movie theater, it becomes “reality” for them. Writing in the communist newspaper The Daily Worker in 1925, Will Muezenberg explained the importance of the movie industry to advancing the goal of the communist world. Muezenberg, an agent of the Comintern (created to spread communist ideology and promote Soviet interests worldwide), said, “One of the most pressing tasks confronting the Communist Party in the field of propaganda is the conquest of this extremely important propaganda unit [the movies], until now the monopoly of the ruling class. We must wrest it from them and turn it against them.” 
And that is what is involved in the Chinese moving into Hollywood. Photo: AP Images Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment

10139,"Media Reports State Dept. ’Mass Resignation,’ Officials Actually Fired","Today’s Fake News freakout began with a buzzing swarm of headlines about “mass resignations” by the “entire senior level of management officials” at the State Department resigning in some stunning act of protest against President Trump. [Before long, we learned we were talking about four people, and they did not resign, they were fired.  “The State Department’s Entire Senior Management Team Just Resigned,” gasped the Washington Post, prompting a ripple of secondary headlines across mediaspace. Some of those headlines were a bit more cautious, such as the Jerusalem Post reporting that the State Department team resigned “in a possibly coordinated walkout. ” As it turns out, that “walkout” was coordinated by the Trump administration: Breaking: Four top @StateDept Mgmt officials all fired by Trump admin, part of effort to ”clean house”  —   officials tell @eliselabottcnn,  —   Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 26, 2017,  From CNN’s full story on the matter: All four, career officers serving in positions appointed by the President, submitted letters of resignation per tradition at the beginning of a new administration. The letters from the White House said that their resignations were accepted and they were thanked for their service. The White House usually asks career officials in such positions to stay on for a few months until their successors are confirmed. “Any implication that that these four people quit is wrong,” one senior State Department official said. “These people are loyal to the secretary, the President and to the State Department. There is just not any attempt here to dis the President. People are not quitting and running away in disgust. This is the White House cleaning house. ” “These positions are political appointments, and require the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm them in these roles. They are not career appointments but of limited term,” said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. “Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service. ” The “entire senior management” team suffering this “mass” obliteration consists of Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Anne Barr, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Michele Bond, Ambassador Gentry O. Smith of the Office of Foreign Missions, and most notably Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who tried to drag the FBI into Hillary Clinton’s  . Kennedy has also been accused of playing a role in the Benghazi disaster, although the State Department’s internal review “downplayed” his role in the “  that led to the inadequate security posture in Benghazi,” as the Washington Examiner recalls. The Examiner also notes his “you can’t fire me, I quit” retirement was announced yesterday, so treating it like big news today is somewhat disingenuous. The Trump campaign said that Kennedy had to go, and called (in vain, of course) on Hillary Clinton to speak out against him, as well. This is not some shocking walkout by a defiant Resistance speaking truth to power  —   it is President Trump fulfilling a campaign promise on his fourth day in office. Also, while most news reports described the four outgoing officials as holding their offices under both Republican and Democrat administrations, to promote the impression they were nonpartisan fixtures of the bureaucracy who just couldn’t handle the arrival of President Trump, that is really only true of Kennedy, and he was only in position for two years before the Obama administration began. Joyce Barr was appointed in 2011, while Michele Bond and Gentry Smith were appointed in 2015. The Hill reports that these four joined “a number of other officials who have departed since President Trump took office last week,” but goes on to cite only two names: Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Gregory Starr, who retired, and Bureau of Overseas Building Operations Lydia Muniz. CNN notes that Starr only came out of retirement in 2012, and planned all along to retire at the end of the Obama administration, even if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election. The American Foreign Service Association also shot down the narrative about mass resignations: While this appears to be a large turnover in a short period of time, a change of administration always brings personnel changes, and there is nothing unusual about rotations or retirements in the Foreign Service. Indeed, both are essential to the development of a steady stream of experienced leaders ready to assume critical roles at State. “Given the talent available in our diplomatic corps, we expect that the new Secretary will have no trouble finding the right people at State to fill out his senior leadership team,” the AFSA added, referring to Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, who still awaits a final confirmation vote. The New York Daily News falsely implied Tillerson’s visit to the State Department on Wednesday actually prompted the “ ” that didn’t happen, adding another prime clipping to the day’s scrapbook of Fake News. All of these folks are entitled to their opinions, just like anyone else, and if they are profoundly displeased by the election of Donald Trump, they are free to say so. The American people are equally entitled to wonder if the State Department should have so many partisan officials, and to look back on the long record of scandals and   in the Obama State Department as justification for a vigorous  .",0
10140,Tiny Home Test Drive - The New York Times,"Last week, the first tenants moved into the city’s first micro apartment development on East 27th Street. I did, too, for one night. Tucked into a New York City Housing Authority site, on a spot between First and Second Avenues that was once a parking lot, and flanked by linden and honeylocust trees and a small plaza lined with park benches, the   building, with 55 apartments between 260 and 360 square feet, is an elegant design by nArchitects, and built by Monadnock Development and the Lower East Side People’s Mutual Housing Association. It’s also adorable, a compressed vision of the city in both ethos and mien. Eric Bunge and Mimi Hoang, nArchitects’ founding principals, imagined it as four slender stepped towers, like a mini skyline. On that hot evening, the benches outside were full of kibitzing men of a certain age the playground across Mount Carmel Place, the   street that bisects the site, had largely emptied out but for a few stragglers. Knots of pedestrians wafted by. The ghost of Jane Jacobs hovered. Carmel Place, formerly known as My Micro NY, was the winner of the small   home competition sponsored by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development in 2013. For the last three years, its flourishes and features  —   the modular units prefabricated in a factory in the old Brooklyn Navy Yard and stacked like Legos on site its capacious common areas and windowed hallways the humane and lovely elements of the apartments, like   windows and nearly   ceilings  —   have been on display, at first in renderings, and finally, in a model apartment that was tricked out last winter. For housing advocates, the architectural community and urban policy makers, the building is a trial balloon for a medley of themes: the changing demographic of a city with inadequate housing (according to the NYU Furman Center, a third of the city’s households are single people) a culture eager to make a smaller environmental footprint by paring down belongings and sharing resources and what has become a unicorn in this city, affordable housing. Carmel Place is no affordable housing utopia, but it’s a start. While the lion’s share  —   32  —   of the units are market rate, with monthly rents ranging from $2, 446 to $3, 195, eight have been set aside for formerly homeless veterans, and 14 units are designated affordable, with monthly rents from $914 to $1, 873, and for which 60, 000 people applied in a lottery. One apartment has been set aside for the superintendent. Fifty percent of the building is already leased. It’s a nice place for a sleepover. The    unit I stayed in rents for $2, 670 a month, furnished, which includes convertible and   objects from Resource Furniture. That company’s   bed combination called Penelope (my destiny?) made in Italy by Clei, is the linchpin of the space: a   bed, surrounded by deep cabinets, that unfolds over a diminutive   sofa. I spent a good   practicing opening and closing that bed, which is heavier and trickier than anything Bernadette Castro ever tackled, but much, much more comfortable, because it has a   mattress and a firm base. (The two photographers who had accompanied me on my mission declined to help, perhaps taking their journalistic ethics too seriously.) The aesthetic vibe of the apartment is hipster Scandinavian, a state that had been achieved by Jacqueline Schmidt, the director of design at Ollie, a company that has embellished Carmel Place with housewares, furniture and services, from dry cleaning to “unique community engagement opportunities”  —   in other words, mixers, day trips and other “curated events” geared to   millennials (urban renters, in Ollie’s parlance). There were knobbly succulents in small ceramic biomorphic planters with leather straps hung on a wall (succulents are good pets for   living, since they don’t need much attention, as Ms. Schmidt pointed out) black and white prints of endangered animals and voluminous canvas baskets set here and there, to hide the sofa pillows and other detritus when you unpack your bed for the night. There was also a white   table, also from Resource Furniture, that extends (with leaves) to seat 10. The leaves live in the large   closet. The kitchen is, proportionally, massive. With a    counter, its total zone, if you count the opposite wall, is 84 square feet, more than a quarter of the apartment’s entire volume. There are a   stove top, a very large microwave and a toaster oven, but no conventional oven, which concerned Ginia, one of five colleagues I invited to dinner and to   the apartment. “If groovy millennials are all about cooking and Instagramming the vegan cheesecakes they are making,” she said later, “how do you live that life with a   stove?” Feh, countered Julia, another of my colleagues. Very few people living alone use their whole stove for cooking or fill their   refrigerators, she said. “Many of them use their ovens to store shoes or sweaters. ” In any event, I ordered in, pizzas and fennel salads from Motorino on East 12th Street. Vivian brought flowers, in case someone was moved to Instagram. I hankered for candles, and flicked off the overhead lights. The apartment comes with recessed ceiling and undercabinet lights on dimmers, along with a nifty task light you tap on and off, and a   standing lamp with a bare bulb, chosen by Ms. Schmidt. Still, there was no way to read comfortably in bed. Ms. Schmidt said she had been bothered by that deficiency, too, so she’s ordered LED lights you’ll be able to clip to the side of the cabinets on either side of the bed. We could have sat eight 10 would have been pushing it. As it was, there wasn’t room to open the fridge or push back the chairs  —   these were solid Italian folding chairs with a slim profile that fit in the closet you get four with your furnished apartment. We didn’t really notice, being well exercised by office gossip and shared work trauma. My guests were delighted by the Penelope contraption, and plopped down on the bed to test its mettle. They enthused over the spare décor and shiny surfaces. Easy to hose down, opined Alexandra and Julia. “It is the working mother’s dreamscape!” wrote Ginia a few days later. “Micro apartments take me away  —      square feet! But where do you put the books?” The best part of the evening, to my mind, was being alone again, after whisking away the pizza boxes and the bottles, shrinking the table back to its slim desk size, and unfolding my namesake bed. I killed the lights, slid open the window and raised the opaque shade, so I could see a linden tree from my nest. As I drifted off to sleep, I imagined a life swept clean of my grubby, needy possessions and instead envisioned a new, improved one that was sparely accessorized by Ms. Schmidt’s resilient and independent succulents, neutral art prints and soft baskets. So lightly encumbered, I would spring easily from my tasteful and tidy micro unit into the cultural soup of the city. Which is the point, of course. I thought, too, of the canon of the studio apartment  —   from the dreary   housing the heroines of Anita Brookner and Barbara Pym novels to Laurie Colwin’s cozy nest in the West Village, where she hunkered down happily, alone with an eggplant and a chipped Meissen dish and Quentin Crisp’s gothic and lordly squalor on East Third Street. And I worried. Perhaps this apartment is too good, too soft, for the demographic it purports to address. How will they mature in a   environment? It irritated me that a    would soon be lolling in my bed, or in the lounge chairs on the roof deck, after having fired up the commercial grill there, and after a long day of networking in some shared work space, or returning home from a day’s surfing in the Rockaways, tucking his surfboard into the space Mr. Bunge and Ms. Hoang designed for it. Carmel Place’s rent includes not just internet and   but a weekly tidying service and a monthly deep clean, along with dog walking, dry cleaning pickup and any number of customized errands through an app called Hello Alfred, all organized by Ollie. Ms. Schmidt said her company is about to announce more building alliances that will allow Carmel Place residents to avail themselves of more and more thermal pools, yoga studios and barbecue pits all over town. “You will meet with your home manager to say what you want for your home experience,” Ms. Schmidt said. “Maybe you want your slippers by the door, or your towels folded a certain way. ” As it happens, it’s not just the   tenants who will be coddled. Ollie has donated its services to the veterans, and offered them at cost to those in the affordable units. It was her intent, Ms. Schmidt said, to think aspirationally about micro living. (She and her husband, David Friedlander, sold all their belongings a few years ago and moved with their two young sons from a    foot loft to a light and lean    apartment Ms. Schmidt gutted and redesigned with sliding panels instead of doors, convertible beds and a few choice pieces of furniture.) The single state itself is also now aspirational, with boosters like Sasha Cagen, the author behind the quirkyalone blog and book Rebecca Traister, a writer at large at New York Magazine and the author of “All the Single Ladies: Unmarried Women and the Rise of an Independent Nation” and Eric Klinenberg, a professor of sociology and the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. A decade ago, Mr. Klinenberg set out to write a book tentatively called “Alone in America” that would chronicle the rise of single adults in the United States  —   according to a Pew study published in 2011, only 51 percent of adults 18 and older are married (compared with 72 percent in 1960)  —   and explore themes of isolation and loneliness. What he found instead was that for the overwhelming majority of single people, living alone meant being social. His 2012 book, “Going Solo,” examined the ways contemporary urban singletons, as he called them, were finding community and generally having a blast. “People live alone together in neighborhoods that are full of people just like them,” he said recently. “You can name those neighborhoods, in cities like Chicago or San Francisco or New York,” he added, “because those are the places you visit to have the best time. It’s where the bars and restaurants and galleries are. It’s where you want to be. ” In his book, Mr. Klinenberg traces the history of single living in bohemian enclaves like Greenwich Village, where at the turn of the 20th century, you could live alone without stigma. The male pioneers were followed by single women, who had been liberated by work and evolving social norms some were buoyed by the ideals of “the free and independent republic of Washington Square,” as Marcel Duchamp and friends famously proclaimed from the arch. Developers were already building   bachelor apartments there. “New York has long been a leader in social innovation,” Mr. Klinenberg said. “The trend of living alone happened here before anywhere else. ” My first  ’s apartment in New York City was a studio on Christopher Street, in a prewar tenement building with a hallway that smelled of cat and scorched garlic. There was a kitchen of sorts in a cubby space with a tiny Royal Rose stove, a sink and a mini fridge  —   but I never cooked there. I was no Laurie Colwin (I don’t recall owning a pot) and anyway, the Korean market on Bleecker Street was my cafeteria. It was 1984 on weekends, the young men who came downtown to showboat kept me awake until 5 a. m. but I didn’t care. When I wasn’t cursing them, I loved watching the performance. The kitchen and bathroom windows looked out onto a grimy air shaft, and right into my neighbors’ apartments, so at night I did a lot of ducking, being too slack to install a shade or even tack up a sheet. If you closed the bathroom door, you’d be stuck until a PATH train rumbled past and shook it free. (My first night in the apartment, I spent two hours trapped in there, having closed the door firmly to clean the black and white herringbone tile floor.) Mostly, my tiny apartment was a launching pad, and I was thrilled to be living alone.",0
10141,"CA High-Speed Rail: Over Budget, Behind Schedule - Breitbart","A new, confidential federal report shows that the initial segment of California’s partially   high speed rail (HSR) project will come in massively over budget and far behind schedule, the Los Angeles Times reports. [The Times obtained the  Federal Railroad Administration risk analysis report, which shows projected costs for just the first   Central Valley section of the “bullet train” will soar to 150 percent  —   $3. 6 billion more, over a previous estimate. It’s the “bridges, viaducts, trenches and track from Merced to Shafter” that could now cost between $9. 5 and $10 billion dollars. This section of the project won’t even yet serve the promised dream of a San Francisco to Los Angeles line.  Not only are costs projected to soar, but the segment that was supposed to be complete this year has been projected in the federal report to lag seven years behind schedule with a new projected completion set for 2024. The Federal Railroad Administration provided California with $3. 5 billion between two federal grants for the project. President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus granted funds to the project however, if the state fails to meet a September 30 deadline that requires paperwork to be submitted by June 20, the rail authority could lose up to $220 million of those funds. The federal report that the Times exposed included a host of reasons for the delays, among them, “  management problems: significant delays in environmental planning, lags in processing invoices for federal grants and continuing failures to acquire needed property. ” The federal report further found that billing invoices took an unacceptable three months to process, and that environmental reviews have been far too slow and getting worse. The rail authority has pushed back on many of the report findings according to the Times report. Rep. Jeff Denham, who serves as Chairman of the House Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, released the following statement regarding the new report: Despite past issues with funding this boondoggle, we were repeatedly assured in an August field hearing that construction costs were under control. They continue to reaffirm my belief that this is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars. I will continue to fight against any further federal funding of this project. They can expect an audit and oversight hearing in the near future.   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) also released a statement: This report makes one thing clear: California   rail must be stopped immediately. There have been repeated concerns that this project was a designed failure since day one, and what’s worse, this report underscores a pattern of falsehoods that has misled taxpayers on what this project might actually cost and how much more taxpayers might be on the hook for. The California   Rail Authority was briefed about this estimate in December, yet decided to keep this report under wraps from California taxpayers and the public. My colleagues and I have been   from the start. The train was sold on rosy predictions not grounded in reality, has disrupted the lives and communities of Californians, and remains a   publicity project that we cannot afford. This needs to end now. I urge Governor Brown and his Administration to recognize that the only solution left is to pull the plug on this boondoggle.

10143,Good Samaritan Helps Boy Survive ‘Internal Decapitation’ in Idaho Car Crash - The New York Times,"A    boy who was “clinically decapitated” in a recent car accident in Idaho survived after a rescuer resisted the urge to pick up and cradle the screaming child and instead held his head in place for a   most likely saving his life, his mother and the rescuer said. The story of the boy, Killian Gonzalez, who endured one of the worst traumatic injuries that can affect small children in car crashes but escaped with his life through the actions of a good Samaritan, unfolded on State Highway 51, a   road slicked by a hailstorm at the time. Killian’s mother, Brandy Gonzalez, said she was driving home to Nevada after attending a party in Idaho to celebrate the boy’s birthday when her car skidded and went into a lane of oncoming traffic, colliding with another vehicle. Pinned in the wreckage and with broken bones, she tried to turn to reach her son, who was strapped into a   car seat in the back. “I was like: I have to get to my baby. I looked back and he is just hunched over. He is not crying he is not awake. ” “I kept talking to him and trying to get him to wake up,” she said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Then a sound from the boy: a whimper, and the word “Momma. ” Killian’s skull was separated from his spine, and he also had a ruptured spleen and broken ribs and arms, a local television station, KBOI, reported from the hospital. Ms. Gonzalez suffered broken arms and legs. The other driver been pinned but was O. K. she said. The accident happened in Owyhee County, which is in the southwestern corner of Idaho on the border with Nevada, at 3:14 p. m. on May 22, Chief Deputy Lynn Bowman, of the county Sheriff’s Department, said in a telephone interview. Leah Woodward and her husband, Joel Woodward, an officer with the  Police Department in Nampa, Idaho, were driving home with their two children from a camping trip when they crested a hill and came upon the accident. Ms. Woodward said she saw a man in the driver’s seat of one vehicle, bloody and disoriented. In the other vehicle, she saw Ms. Gonzalez, her arm clearly shattered, unable to unlock her car doors to help the Woodwards reach her. In the back, Killian was not moving, but he was screaming. “As a mom, that just goes right to your heart,” Ms. Woodward said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “My immediate instinct was: ‘You have to help that little guy.’ ” To reach Killian, her husband broke a window of the Gonzalez vehicle, then squeezed through, cutting himself on the glass. He then told his wife to hold the child upright, keeping his head steady, until help came. “My first instinct would have been to cradle the little guy, but clearly that would have been the wrong choice,” Ms. Woodward said. The boy’s broken arm was backward, so they draped it against his side and covered him with a blanket. Ms. Woodward said a pinkish   substance was splattered on the seat, the boy and her. Later, her sister, a nurse, told her that might have been spinal fluid. “I had my hands kind of, like, thumbs by his ears and hands wrapped behind his neck holding it still,” she said. “He didn’t fight, he was not moving every now and then he would come to. ” As she held his head for about 30 minutes, she said, she talked to the boy. Asking Ms. Gonzalez details about her son, Ms. Woodward tried to keep his attention, chatting to him about his strawberry birthday cake and toy dinosaur, trying to fight the boy’s impulse to drift off. His eyes rolled around in his head, or flashed in fear, she recalled. At one point, she said, he spoke: “I don’t hurt anymore. I am all done. ” When emergency medics arrived, she continued holding his head as they worked around her, finally fixing him with a collar and getting him into an ambulance. “I am just glad I did not know his injuries at the time,” she said. Killian, his mother and the other driver were flown by air ambulance to hospitals, Chief Deputy Bowman said. Leslie Dorn, Killian’s grandmother, stayed with the boy in the hospital while Ms. Gonzalez underwent treatment for her injuries. She said doctors told her four of the six ligaments connecting the boy’s skull and spine were stretched by an inch from the impact, but then sprang back to leave Killian about   of an inch taller than he was before the accident. Officials from the hospital, St. Luke’s Boise, where Killian was treated, declined to comment. A   page for the boy said that he had “a fracture at the base of his skull where the brain stem connects to the spinal cord. ” Clinical, or internal, decapitation is a colloquial term for an injury known to surgeons as   dislocation. It happens when the ligaments, muscles and joints that connect the base of the skull to the top of the spine are damaged. “So the term ‘decapitation’ in the true sense of cutting someone’s head off is a bit extreme,” said Dr. Nicholas Theodore, the director of spinal surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute, who has operated on more than 60 patients with the injury. He has used titanium rods, wires or screws to reattach the base of the skull to the spine. Dr. Theodore said the injury was almost always associated with   accidents in which the head is pulled away from the spine, and it occurs more often with children than adults because their neck musculature is still undeveloped and weak. “Especially younger patients, the head is like a bowling ball on a stick,” he said. “Their head sort of bobbles. ” Dr. Theodore, who treated a    boy with the injury in 2010, did not comment on Killian’s case but said: “You don’t ever want to move an injury patient unless a car is on fire. Immobilizing a child is exactly what you want to do. ” On Tuesday, Killian, who had been discharged from the hospital over the weekend, was walking unassisted at home, fitted with a hard collar to support his head and neck, Ms. Gonzalez said. “He can take a few steps, but his equilibrium is still off,” she said. He does not talk about the accident.",0
10144,War on cash goes into full effect – Citibank stops accepting cash at multiple branches,"War on cash goes into full effect – Citibank stops accepting cash at multiple branches Governments loathe cash transactions because they’re private and hard to tax By Jack Burns - Thursday, November 17, 2016 1:36 PM EST 
In 2015, as a guest on Ron Paul’s Liberty Report, Economics Professor Joseph Salerno warned of a coming war on cash. Apparently, now, that time has come. Governments loathe cash transactions because they’re private and hard to tax. As a result, some countries are taking drastic measures to reclaim their bank notes. Salerno said, “The French premier last year (2014) drew a parallel between the war on terror and the war on cash,” and warned the world’s economic elite are now “using the war on terror as a cover to get at cash.” The Mises Institute professor and VP predicted to Paul, “I think this could come in the next couple of years. If they have to bail out the financial system again…they’ll block the cash in the banks to prevent it from escaping and destabilizing these fractional reserve banks,” Salerno said. 
At the time of the interview, 2015, Salerno said the war on cash has already begun in the U.S. and pointed to Citibank’s new policy which disallows patrons to use cash to pay their mortgages and credit cards with cash. He also pointed to Louisiana’s new law forcing “second hand dealers defined as Goodwill Stores, Flea Markets, Garage Sales, to report any cash transactions in which they were receiving or paying cash, and they had to report them on a daily basis to the local police authorities.” He said, “they (secondhand stores) had to get the sellers’ names and license plate number and a number of other of private details.” 
“This is only a first step,” even though it was only on a state level. “It would be awful if it was on a federal level,” Salerno declared. 
While it hasn’t happened yet on a federal level in the United States, cash reclamation is occurring today in India. But before we get to what’s taking place in India, we must first examine the reasons frequently given by government to resort to controlling the public’s access to cash. Salerno stated the government offers phony reasons why it must control cash. It’s to prohibit terrorists, tax evaders, money launderers, and profiteering by drug cartels. If one hears the government making such claims, get ready, a cash grab is about to happen. 
Salerno pointed to Greece’s implementing a “cash point charge” for withdrawing Euros from their bank accounts, allowing government to charge citizens for withdrawing their own funds. He says mainstream economists have been promoting the war on cash for some time in order to prop up fledgling banks. 
“I assure you other governments are watching this experiment (in Greece),” he said. Salerno also stated the real war on cash seeks to “force the public to make payments to the financial system” in order to “enable governments to expand their ability to spy on and keep track of their citizens’ most private financial dealings in order to milk their citizens out of every last dollar of tax payments that they claim are due.” He stated another reason to destabilize cash is to “prop up the unstable fractional reserve banking system which is in a state of collapse all over the world.” 
Keep in mind, Salerno made his comments a year ago. 
Fast forward to 2016, and the world is now witnessing the first major bank to announce it will no longer accept cash deposits or deal in cash. Citibank Australia’s head of retail bank Janine Copelin offered an explanation saying, “We have seen a steady decline in the demand for cash services in our branches — in fact, less than 4% of Citi customers have used this service in the last 12 months.” The company stated it will no longer handle currency as a result. 
“This move to cashless branches reflects Citi’s commitment to digital banking and we are investing in the channels our customers prefer to use…While the number of customers visiting our branches to access cash handling services has fallen, the branch network remains an important component of how we serve our high-net-worth customers,” said Copelin. 
Maybe no one’s eyebrows are raising after Citibank made its declaration because some advanced societies have quite naturally moved away from hard cash transactions, preferring the ease of pay by phone, debit cards, or credit card purchases. After all, someone in the United States could very easily live without cash. Many do already. 
According to the Guardian , Sweden leads the world when it comes to not using cash. “Cards are now the main form of payment: according to Visa, Swedes use them more than three times as often as the average European, making an average of 207 payments per card in 2015.” But in some parts of the world, cash is still king. 
Just this week, India made a major move to control its citizens’ access to their cash by banning the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. According to the LA Times , “An exasperating cash crunch has gripped India in the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the unprecedented step of withdrawing the country’s large currency notes from circulation. Modi surprised the nation by announcing an instant ban on the 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee notes, worth about $7.50 and $15, respectively, and which account for 86% of the cash in the market.” 
And just as Salerno predicted governments would do, the Indian government claimed the move was meant to serve as a ”sweeping move against corruption that would force Indians who hold large amounts of undeclared wealth to deposit the money at banks and make their assets official.” In other words, just as Salerno declared, rich Indians, whose private business dealings were done in cash, will now be forced to deposit their banned bank notes — or risk losing all of their wealth. 
The value of the currency, if deposited, will then be able to be tracked by the Indian government, a move Salerno stated would lead to higher taxes on its wealthy citizens, and greater returns for the banking system. And the Indian government has already admitted that’s precisely what they’re trying to do. 
Also, as Paul and Salerno predicted, the move has had devastating effects on the poor, many of whom have now reverted to bartering for their needs, according to the Times. The financial decision “stunned hundreds of millions of poor and working-class Indians who live an almost entirely cash-based existence, paying in bills for everything from rent to groceries to cellphone credit.” And they never saw it coming. 
“The plan was shrouded in such secrecy that even India’s financial institutions were ill prepared, creating long, sometimes unruly lines outside banks, ATMs and chronically understaffed post offices that are authorized to exchange the now-worthless notes and dispense new ones,” writes the Times. 
Exacerbating the financial crisis is the fact the government issued a smaller-sized currency which no longer works with current ATMs, forcing many customers not to be able to make any purchases at all, and thereby creating a loss of revenue for businesses hit hard by fewer customers, and chaos for everyone else. The best way to describe the upheaval in India is by imagining all Americans attempting to pay all of their purchases with one dollar bills. 
In India, according to the Times, two-thirds of all transactions are done in cash, an economy the government has labeled “black money.” Modi’s administration aims to tax that money. “Much of the wealth that India has accumulated since economic reforms began in the 1990s has never been taxed or accounted for, parked instead in real estate, gold, foreign investments and, in some cases, bundles of cash sitting at home. It is those stacks of bills that Modi, who took office 2½ years ago on promises to curb corruption, aimed to bring into the open. Supporters of the prime minister’s plan said those holding cash stockpiles would have to deposit them at banks, where huge amounts would draw the scrutiny of tax authorities, or allow their value to evaporate.” 
Sounding, as some would say, like Donald Trump, Modi said over the weekend, “I promise you I will give you the India of your dreams.” But right now, India is living a nightmare. 
India’s decision to reclaim its currency has some questioning whether the United States would attempt to follow suit and reclaim its own currency. 
For free thinkers everywhere, it may be time to take those 100 dollar bills and swap them out for one dollar denominations, or even begin to purchase gold and silver as many preppers have done already. If the proverbial shit hits the fan, taking notice of what’s happening in the world may prove to be a wise decision. With Australia’s Citibank declaration it will no longer deal in cash, with Sweden’s cashless society as a model of the future, and with India’s reclamation of bank notes, it’s anyone’s guess what the American economic crisis may look like. But it probably won’t involve cash.",0
10145,"Zac Goldsmith, Prominent ‘Brexit’ Advocate, Loses Election in London - The New York Times","LONDON  —   In a surprise upset, a candidate of the centrist and   Liberal Democrats defeated a prominent supporter of British withdrawal from the European Union in a parliamentary   on Thursday. The victory, by Sarah Olney, delivered a badly needed lift to the Liberal Democrats, who were in danger of becoming extinct after disastrous losses in last year’s national elections, and it highlighted some of the deep divisions in Britain over its looming departure from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. In the election in the Richmond Park and North Kingston constituency in southwest London, Ms. Olney had 20, 510 votes, to 18, 638 for Zac Goldsmith, according to results announced early Friday. Mr. Goldsmith won the same seat for the governing Conservative Party only last year, and by more than 23, 000 votes. He resigned from Parliament in protest over government plans to expand Heathrow Airport  —   a project that is unpopular locally. In the latest contest, Mr. Goldsmith stood as an independent but was not opposed by the Tories, who did not field a candidate. Ms. Olney, who also opposed the expansion of Heathrow, campaigned on the issue of Europe, in an affluent constituency where a large majority voted in the June 23 Brexit referendum to remain in the bloc. That move appeared to have paid dividends, helping Ms. Olney achieve one of the most striking   triumphs of recent years. “Today we have said ‘no’,” Ms. Olney said in her victory speech after the result was declared, “We will defend the Britain we love we will stand up for the open, tolerant, united, Britain we believe in. ” “The people of Richmond Park and North Kingston have sent a shock wave through this Conservative Brexit government, and our message is clear: We do not want a hard Brexit,” she added, making a reference to the clean break with the European Union desired by some   supporters of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Ms. Olney’s campaign probably benefited from several days of headlines suggesting that the government of Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to develop a coherent Brexit strategy. Other factors may have contributed, too. Though known locally as an assiduous member of Parliament, Mr. Goldsmith attracted criticism during his campaign for mayor of London earlier this year when he accused his Labour Party rival, Sadiq Khan, of having given tacit support to extremists in the past. That tactic apparently backfired Mr. Khan won the election and became London’s first Muslim mayor. Nevertheless, Europe seems to have been a key factor in Richmond Park and North Kingston, following the Brexit referendum in which Britons voted by 52 percent to 48 percent to quit the bloc. Not only was Mr. Goldsmith a supporter of Brexit, but his father, the financier Sir James Goldsmith, was a prominent critic of the European Union in the 1990s. Zac Goldsmith’s defeat gives only a snapshot of current opinion, however, and took place in one of the most   parts of country. So far there is little evidence that Brexit supporters are changing their minds in significant numbers. Still, this win will encourage the Liberal Democrats who before last year’s electoral rout had spent several years as junior partners in a coalition government led by the Conservative prime minister, David Cameron. Mr. Cameron resigned after the Brexit vote, then gave up his parliamentary seat in Witney. In the contest to succeed him in October, the Conservatives held Witney, but with a majority reduced by more than 20, 000 votes. The Liberal Democrats finishing second. The Labour Party, the main opposition party, campaigned to remain in the European Union, but its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a lifelong critic of the bloc.   class voters, who have often supported Labour, voted for Brexit. That has allowed the Liberal Democrats to present themselves as the voice of the 48 percent who wished to remain in union.",0
10146,"After Rare Walkout, Louis Vuitton and Workers in France Agree to Extend Talks - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Talks between the luxury house Louis Vuitton and workers at its ateliers across France were extended on Thursday, a day after scores of the company’s employees staged a walkout for the first time in 15 years to demand wage increases. Shortly before a deadline that had been imposed by Louis Vuitton, both sides agreed to prolong discussions, the company announced. While the employees are back at work for now, the image of striking leather workers on Wednesday might have had especially negative connotations for the luxury brand. For luxury businesses  —   where profits are often   and the bespoke craftsmanship at its ateliers is front and center in marketing messages  —   a nasty shadow could be cast over those seen to be exploiting workers who cater to the whims of the elite. Louis Vuitton, known for its   monogrammed leather goods and the   skills of its French master craftsmen and women, is the jewel in the crown of its parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the largest luxury group in the world by sales. The hourlong walkout on Wednesday, which was first reported by Agence   started with employees gathering in front of their various production facilities across France at 7:30 a. m. Union representatives from Force Ouvrière and the Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail told Agence   that the workers were staging the protest after a wage increase offer from Louis Vuitton management failed to meet expectations. The company had offered a gross raise of 30 euros a month, or about $31. 95, for every employee, union representatives said  —   far lower than the €55 workers requested. Managers had also offered raises of an additional €10 to €20 a month for 80 percent of workers. As the luxury industry has grappled with an increasingly volatile trading climate because of geopolitical instability, fluctuating foreign exchange rates and the demands of consumers, LVMH  —   for the most part  —   appeared to be weathering the storm. In 2016, it posted record results, with total sales of €37 billion. Sales from its fashion and leather goods division  —   which does not break out results by brand  —   rose 8. 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, to €3. 78 billion. The label also registered 9 percent organic growth, beating analysts’ estimates of about 5 percent. The latest set of strong results appears to have been one motivating factor for the workers’ strike, the first in over 15 years, according to a Force Ouvrière representative,   Damelincourt. “Calling for a walkout at Vuitton is tough, people are afraid of being seen badly,” Mr. Damelincourt said. “But today, a good part of the employees have mobilized to show their dissatisfaction. ” “Louis Vuitton has once again registered an exceptional year of results in 2016, and we are proud to have contributed to this result,” he added. “We now want a remuneration worthy of our commitment. ” Mr. Damelincourt said that the turnout for the strike was 30 percent of all employees from the workshops in Issoudun and in Condé, more than 50 percent from the facilities in Asnières, and 25 percent to 50 percent of employees in workshops in the Ardèche area and in the Drôme. But LVMH had a different story. Louis Vuitton has 18 leather workshops, including 12 in France four of the French sites were involved in the walkout action on Wednesday, a company spokesman said. Louis Vuitton employs a total of 3, 100 atelier workers in France, hired 370 new employees last year and continues to be a highly   place for creative workers to seek employment, the spokesman said. “In addition to their 13 months of payment every year, employees had in March 2017, for the last business year, the equivalent in   of between four and five months in compensation,” the spokesman said, adding that this type of bonus was relatively rare in France. About two weeks before the start of the French presidential election, where employment laws are a major topic of debate, the impact of labor conflicts continues to be a problem in several business sectors. The French air traffic control walkout last month caused a   1, 500 flight cancellations, according to estimates by the commercial aviation group Airlines for Europe. In 2016, the country was paralyzed by strikes of pilots, train drivers, taxi drivers and garbage collectors. The unrest, alongside other factors such as a fear of terrorist attacks, has played a part in a decline in tourism to France, currently the most visited country in the world.",0
10147,"With Coverage in Peril and Obama Gone, Health Law’s Critics Go Quiet - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   For seven years, few issues have animated conservative voters as much as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But with President Barack Obama out of office, the debate over “Obamacare” is becoming less about “Obama” and more about “care”  —   greatly complicating the issue for Republican lawmakers. Polling indicates that more Republicans want to make fixes to the law rather than do away with it. President Trump, who remains popular on the right, has mused about a replacement plan that is even more expansive than the original. The conservative news media are focused more on Mr. Trump’s   skirmishes with Democrats and reporters, among others, than on policy issues like health care. And the congressional debate, as well as the paid advertisements on both sides, is centered on the substance of the law rather than its namesake, draining some of its toxicity on the right. As liberals overwhelm congressional town   meetings and deluge the Capitol phone system with pleas to protect the health law, there is no similar clamor for dismantling it, Mr. Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment. From deeply conservative districts in the South and the West to the more moderate parts of the Northeast, Republicans in Congress say there is significantly less intensity among opponents of the law than when Mr. Obama was in office. “I hear more concerns than before about ‘You’re going to repeal it, and we’re all going to lose insurance’ because they don’t think we’re going to replace it,” said Representative Mike Simpson, a Republican who represents a conservative district in Idaho. Since Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, about 20 million Americans have gained insurance because of it. And millions more who had   health conditions have been able to obtain coverage under the law. At the same time, many Americans have seen their premiums rise or their choices of insurance carriers dwindle. But it was not until now, with the Republicans taking control of the federal government, that the debate fully shifted from the theoretical to the tangible. It was easy for conservatives to rally against a law identified with a president they despised when he was capable of vetoing any repeal. Now that he is gone and the law’s benefits appear to be on the chopping block, the people who stand to lose the most are the most vocal. “I’ve heard from constituents who have been harmed by the Affordable Care Act over the course of its being in existence,” said Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, whose affluent district Mr. Trump narrowly lost last year. “More recently, because of our discussions on repairing it, I’ve heard from those who do not wish to have the act amended. More recently, that is the preponderance of those who have contacted me. ” It is a longstanding rule of politics that rallying opposition to a proposal is usually easier than galvanizing support. And never is this more the case than when a widely distributed benefit is at risk of being taken away. “I was here in 2009 and 2010, and we’re not getting the   calls like that,” said Representative Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who is on one of the committees tasked with rewriting the law. “I think people are going to hold us accountable for making sure we not only repeal, but we have a law in place that creates a better opportunity for people. ” The demands from   constituents in districts like Mr. Guthrie’s are plainly shifting. In a nationwide CBS News poll last month, 53 percent of Republicans said they wanted to change the law to make it work better while 41 percent said they wanted to abolish it. Overhauling the law, however, is far more politically complicated than simply scrapping it. Congressional Republican leaders were met with a backlash from their own ranks after it emerged that they were considering financing a new law by ending the longstanding practice of letting employers exclude from taxation the health benefits they offer. “Our voters do expect action, but as you make changes you become vulnerable to attack,” Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said. “This is fraught with difficulties, no doubt about it. ” Adding to the anxiety is Mr. Trump, who is a wild card on the health law. His health secretary, Tom Price, signaled to House Republicans at a private meeting on Thursday that the administration would let Congress draft a replacement bill, Mr. Cole said. But the president has said multiple times that he is uneasy about depriving anybody of health insurance, and he may bridle if Democrats attack any Republican plan that may lead to that. As Democrats note, Mr. Trump owes his victory in part to voters who have benefited from the law. “A lot of economically vulnerable Republican voters have come to rely on government’s involvement in making sure they have affordable health care,”said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. And with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers facing less pressure from the right than the left, conservative groups worry that the party will not ultimately have the stomach to repeal the law, which Republicans have been running against since 2010. “Voters gave Republicans the charge to repeal and replace Obamacare, and the continued delays and discussions about repairing Obamacare need to stop,” David McIntosh, the head of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group, said last week.",0

10150,"Three Texas Border City Cops Shot, 1 Injured, Suspect Dead","An armed murder suspect allegedly opened fire, shooting three Laredo, Texas, police officers and injuring a fourth. The suspect is reported to be dead. [Police were searching for    Antonio Gerado Rodriguez in connection to the shooting death of his girlfriend, according to a report by KSAT ABC12 in San Antonio. The shootout between the suspect and the police happened at a Stripes convenience store. Police reports identified the murder victim as Reyna Gonzalez Zamora, 50.  Laredo Police Department Investigator Joe Baeza told Breitbart Texas the suspect was spotted by three officers involved in the search. Rodriguez opened fire on the officers with a hundgun. The officers returned fire. Additional responding officers engaged the suspect and continued shooting until the suspect went down. Baeza confirmed three officers were shot and a fourth officer received an injury from flying glass during the shooting. An unnamed source within the department with knowledge of the situation told Breitbart Texas that one officer had been shot in the face. That officer has been airlifted by helicopter to San Antonio where the officer will undergo surgery. Baez said that officer is in serious condition. The other three officers received   threatening wounds  —   one to the shoulder, one in the leg, and one in the hand the unnamed source stated. Emergency personnel transported Rodriguez to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. “We ask the community for prayers for the officer and their families,” Detective Baeza told reporters. Earlier in the day, Laredo police officers issued an “armed and dangerous” alert for the suspect. The officers later found him at the convenience store and shooting soon broke out. Earlier on Friday, officers were dispatched to a house to conduct a welfare check on a woman. When they arrived, they found the woman had been shot. She sustained a single gunshot wound to the upper torso. She died at the scene from her wound, the Laredo Morning Times reported. The original shooting took place at about 11:15 a. m. Friday.

10151,"Jupiter's stripes go deep, and other surprises from NASA's Juno probe","Thu, 20 Oct 2016 20:46 UTC © NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/GSFC This composite image depicts Jupiter's cloud formations as seen through the eyes of Juno's microwave radiometer (MWR) instrument as compared to the top layer, a Cassini imaging science subsystem image of the planet. The MWR can see a couple of hundred miles into Jupiter's atmosphere with the instrument's largest antenna. The belts and bands visible on the surface are also visible in modified form in each layer below. Jupiter's stripes are more than skin deep, according to observations by NASA's Juno probe, which has revealed many new surprises about the Jovian giant. Juno arrived at the Jupiter system in July. On Aug. 27, the probe made a close flyby of the planet, during which, the science team was supposed to calibrate Juno's instruments and get familiar with the intense environment around Jupiter, according to Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton. But the encounter proved more fruitful than expected. Jupiter's bold, colorful stripes are clouds, and optical light can't penetrate them to see what's underneath. However, Juno is carrying microwave instruments that can each probe those clouds to different depths; together, these instruments can effectively peel back the clouds like layers of an onion. An artist's impression based on the microwave data reveals a striking feature: Some of the stripes are visible deep into the cloud layers. ""The structure of the zones and belts still exists deep down,"" Bolton said during a news conference at the 2016 meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences. ""So whatever's making those colors, whatever's making those stripes, is still existing pretty far down into Jupiter. That came as a surprise to many of the scientists. We didn't know if this was [just] skin-deep."" The new images penetrate to depths of about 200 to 250 miles (350 to 400 kilometers) below the surface cloud layer, Bolton said. He noted that the bands seen on the cloud tops are not identical to the bands seen in the subsequent layers, although there is clearly a strong similarity. ""They're evolving. They're not staying the same,"" Bolton said. The finding ""hints [at] the deep dynamics and the chemistry of Jupiter's atmosphere. And this is the first time we've seen any giant planet atmosphere underneath its layers. So we're learning about atmospheric dynamics at a very basic level."" Another breathtaking result came from the JunoCam , a visible-light camera that is being used for public outreach. The instrument took a snapshot of Jupiter's terminator line, or the place where night turns to day. As is the case with viewing the moon's terminator line, the change in light casts shadows, allowing viewers to see many features in three dimensions (like being able to see the depth of craters on the moon). In the Juno photo, scientists spotted a cyclone rising above the main atmospheric layer. The storm appears to be about 52 miles (85 km) tall and about 4,300 miles (7,000 km) wide, which is more than half the width of the Earth. © NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Alex Mai The sunlit part of Jupiter was created by a citizen scientist (Alex Mai) using data from Juno's JunoCam instrument. JunoCam's raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. The first flyby also demonstrated that scientists have a lot to learn about what's happening inside Jupiter, the researchers said. The Juno team discovered that very close to the planet, Jupiter's magnetic field, its auroras and its gravitational field (that is, the characteristics of the planet's gravity at different points in space) all provided surprises. The auroras on Jupiter, which were first spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope, are not unlike the northern and southern lights that flash in the polar skies on Earth. But the data collected by Juno on Aug. 27 has thrown into question the models scientists had for Jupiter's auroras. ""Nothing about the aurora that we measured on Aug. 27 was as expected,"" Bolton said during a talk at the meeting. The probe flew over the auroras with multiple instruments turned on, but ""the things we expected to see weren't there, and things we didn't expect were there. ""We're sort of sorting it out,"" Bolton said. ""We've certainly got a mission of discovery [with regard to] the aurora and understanding that complex system."" In addition, measurements of the planet's magnetic field matched planetary models fairly well as Juno sped toward Jupiter. But in the last few minutes before the probe reached its closest point of approach to the planet, the data drastically diverged from the predictions, showing that the magnetic field was much stronger than expected, Bolton said. That implies that the internal magnetic field is ""much more complex than people thought"" he said. But, of course, Bolton noted, no probe has ever come this close to Jupiter before, and the purpose of the Juno mission is to gather data that will put models like those to the test. More surprises came from preliminary measurements of Jupiter's gravitational field (that is, the strength and direction of the planet's gravity at different points in space). Bolton said the Juno team members who made initial models of the planet's internal gravity field ""are already having to redo the field model"" based on those early measurements. ""The internal gravity field also holds a lot of guarded secrets that are going to help us understand Jupiter,"" he said. © NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM An infrared image of the southern aurora of Jupiter, captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft on Aug. 27, 2016. More science to come Juno's orbit around Jupiter isn't circular. Instead, the probe makes a loop that takes it right up next to the planet — to within 3,100 miles (5,000 km) of the cloud tops — and then far out into space, before looping back in for another close pass. Jupiter is surrounded by a donut-shaped ring of very intense radiation that could easily destroy most electronic equipment. Juno, with its unique orbit, does a thread-the-needle maneuver, slipping between the planet and the radiation ring. Right now, Juno makes one orbit every 53 days. Juno was scheduled to fire its engines on Oct. 19 and reduce its orbit to every 14 days. Because of a problem with the engine valves, the Juno team has delayed that engine firing until the issue can be diagnosed. Juno is still able to complete its science mission if it stays in the 53-day orbit, Bolton said.",0

In 2015, Kendrick showed her support for Hillary in such an eloquent way. She tweeted , “Madonna kissed Drake, Hilary’s running for president, but HBO STILL hasn’t shown this dude’s dick (with a picture of an actor) ?? #FeministPriority ” 
From Daly Mail : Her nomination for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for 2009’s Up In The Air catapulted her to stardom. But Anna Kendrick revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Wednesday that at the time she was completely broke. 
‘It was this weird combination of like all these great things are happening but at the same time nothing has changed,’ the actress, 31, said. 
‘My stylist told me I had to wear the perfect shoes for an outfit, and because the movie isn’t out yet, she said, nobody really knows who you are. The shoe places don’t want to loan you the shoes so can you buy a pair of Louboutins? ‘ Kendrick explained. ‘And I’m like, I’m so poor….’ she said. 
The horror didn’t stop there either. 
She recalled how she was sent by the film distribution company to New York to promote the film that also starred George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, and they put her up in a very nice hotel. 
‘At one point I was like, if we do another trip to New York can you put me up in a less nice hotel room and then I could keep some of the cash ,’ she recounted. ‘And they were like, ‘no this is not how this works!” 
Kendrick was on Ellen to promote her new book Scrappy Little Nobody and also to promote her new film Trolls. 
In the animated feature, she worked with Justin Timberlake who also provided one of the character voices. The two also sang together including recording a version of True Colors for the soundtrack. 
‘It was a career highlight for me watching him do his thing,’ she gushed of the former NSync’er.

10156,US Government Acknowledges That al-Qaeda Is Not A Priority In Syria,"Store US Government Acknowledges That al-Qaeda Is Not A Priority In Syria One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? Darius Shahtahmasebi | Anti Media - October 26, 2016 Comments 
Last week, the U.S. State Department acknowledged that al-Qaeda-linked terror group Jabhat al-Nusra is not a “priority” for the United States’ efforts in Syria. 
One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? 
State Department spokesman John Kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating: 
“The only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar al-Assad and his supporters . We recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I’ve talked about this ad nauseam.” 
Largely missing from the American narrative of the Syrian conflict is that al-Nusra is shelling residential areas in Aleppo, where the government holds control of the majority of Aleppo’s citizens. In other parts of the world, these al-Qaeda-linked extremists are seen as the enemy, whereas in Syria, Western media will often refer to them as mere “rebel” groups. 
The United States first officially used the term “war on terror” on September 20, 2011, to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of September 11. The stated aim at the time was to defeat Islamic-linked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the U.S. government accused of supporting terrorism. 
In 2013, Obama stated : 
“ We must define our effort not as a boundless ‘Global War on Terror,’ but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.” 
The fact that a terror group — one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the United States on American soil — is not a priority of the United States State Department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is. 
This change in rhetoric, which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the Middle East, is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from al-Qaeda-linked terrorists.

10157,"Edward Albee, a Playwright Intent on Naming, and Goading, the Beast Within - The New York Times","Edward Albee never expected or even wanted you to like his plays. “Like” is too pale and friendly a word for the   emotions he hoped to elicit. Rage and bewilderment, fear and loathing and that grand old Aristotelian couple, pity and terror: These were all welcome and entirely appropriate responses to have in the theater of Mr. Albee, one of the genuinely great dramatists of the last century, who died on Friday at 88. If you left one of his plays feeling good about yourself, then it would seem that Mr. Albee hadn’t done his job. But the real problem probably would have been that you hadn’t been paying attention. “You don’t listen,” as a character in one of his   plays kept saying to anyone who would  —   sorry, wouldn’t  —   listen. The challenge within that accusation rang through everything he wrote. That play, “Listening,” was the first work by Mr. Albee that I wrote about as a critic for The New York Times. First staged in 1977, it had been revived in New York in the fall of 1993 by the invaluable Signature Theater Company, created by James Houghton (who died in August) which was devoting a season to Mr. Albee’s more obscure work. By that time, New York critics and audiences had mostly turned their backs on Mr. Albee. It had been a decade since he had had new work produced in the city. And the feeling was that he belonged to an earlier, artier generation that took its provocative intellectual postures far too seriously. Sure, the consensus seemed to go, “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ,” the marital boxing match of a play that had been made into a movie starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, was great. But, be honest now, did anyone really understand such arcane plays as “Tiny Alice” and “The Lady From Dubuque,” with all their cryptic, cosmic talk? Being just another New York sheep, I had probably absorbed that perspective without even thinking about it. But as I left “Listening,” and its companion piece “Counting the Ways,” in 1993, I realized that my mind was still churning, in excitement and agitation and a bit of annoyance, in ways it seldom did at the end of any show. I wrote in The Times that I was certainly glad to be able to listen to Mr. Albee again. He in turn wrote me a crisp and courteous letter, saying it was refreshing to be treated fairly again. As it turned out, New York was more than willing to embrace Mr. Albee again. (O. K. maybe not embrace, since that implies huggability writing about Mr. Albee, the most exacting of semanticists, makes you question every word you use.) That same autumn of 1993 saw, in addition to the Signature season, the New York premiere (Off Broadway, at the Vineyard Theater) of Mr. Albee’s “Three Tall Women,” a portrait of the three ages of a rich and selfish suburbanite who was clearly modeled on the playwright’s adoptive mother. It became the   play of the season for people who no doubt included fashionable, captious,   Americans rather like its title character. It also won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. And so began one of the greatest second acts in any dramatist’s career. Soon, Mr. Albee would be back on Broadway again, first with an exquisite revival of his “A Delicate Balance” in 1996. Plays that had seemed annoying and obscure a couple of decades earlier, including “Tiny Alice” and “The Lady From Dubuque,” were reincarnated to illuminating effect. One of his new works, “The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?” which opened on Broadway in 2002, put to rest any notions that Mr. Albee might have started playing nice with his audiences. The titular animal was the love (and lust) object of the play’s anguished married hero, first portrayed by Bill Pullman. You can listen to Mr. Albee  —   in the “Last Words” interview I conducted with him some years ago  —   contentedly cataloging the different points in the production at which theatergoers walked out. He didn’t even mention the bit of dialogue that made me think, “No, surely he did not say that”  —   a description of a man dandling an infant on his lap and realizing to his distress that he had acquired an erection. In 2002, Mr. Albee was evidently still quite capable of making even jaded critics, who had done their time with the naked fornicators of fringe theater, squirm. But it is never just the shocking detail that unsettles with Mr. Albee. What’s most disturbing, always, is his insistence that our most primitive instincts keep asserting themselves in even the most civilized settings, like a Minotaur at a cocktail party, and usually they wrestle us to the ground. “Violence! Violence!” chants the mousy Honey, with a cheerleader’s delight, in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” And nasty eruptions of the impulse to hurt, and its frequent conflation with the sex drive, were always a part of the    with Mr. Albee. So was death, with and without a capital D, most pointedly in “All Over” and “The Lady From Dubuque,” but its shadow looms large in everything Mr. Albee wrote. That unsentimental insistence on our mortality may have been the biggest turnoff to New York theatergoers of the   century. Mr. Albee repeatedly dared to ask what most of us retire to the closets of our minds for as long as possible: the fact of our inevitable ends, and what it means for our tenuous  . I should say that few dramatists of the 20th and 21st centuries matched Mr. Albee as a spinner of filigree dialogue. It can hold its own with that of Wilde, Shaw, Coward and Stoppard. Mr. Albee loved words and wordplay  —   sometimes to the point of giddiness. But he also made it clear that he fully grasped the inadequacy of language as a means of staving off  —   never mind defining  —   the darkness that waited to claim his characters. Performing his work required, to borrow a title of his, a delicate balance. (“If I am sharp, it is because I am neither less nor more than human,” says Agnes in that play.) And one of the joys of my job as a theater critic has been watching performers, actresses in particular, discover that balance, with an appropriate mix of glee and bitterness, bravura and uncertainty. Kathleen Turner, Rosemary Harris, Uta Hagen, Marian Seldes and Elaine Stritch all created   performances in Albee works. I met Mr. Albee several times, socially and professionally. The first time, he pointed out that, like so many people, I had mispronounced his name. (“It’s   Ben, not  . ”) Generally, he was gentlemanly, polite, reserved and attentive, in a way I associate with a   era. There was power in his gaze, though, an assessing twinkle that you suspected might easily be fanned into a flame that could scorch. Once I saw him, for an interview, the day after I had attended a new play of his at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N. J. I told Mr. Albee that my   nephew, whom I had taken to the show, had greatly enjoyed the production. “Good,” said Mr. Albee, who then paused and added, “I hope he didn’t enjoy it too much. ”",0
10158,Адская Клинтон,"Политика 
Предвыборная президентская гонка в США всё больше напоминает некогда весьма популярный тележурнал «Каламбур», особенно его рубрику «Деревня дураков». Последние известия из-за океана напоминают именно этакую большую деревню, размером с добрую часть западного континента, жители которой задались целью развеселить весь мир. 
Из самых свежих веселушек: католическая церковь в Сан-Диего предупредила своих прихожан о том, что проголосовать за демократов равносильно наитягчайшему смертному греху. Ведь эти «нечестивцы» рассматривают возможность разрешения абортов, эвтаназии и легализации лёгких наркотиков. Памятка, разосланная жителям, напоминала, что наказанием всем, поддерживающим подобную программу — прямая дорога в ад. Как думаете, кто же спустя несколько дней был объявлен «засланцем» самого Сатаны? Разумеется, Хиллари Клинтон, стабильно опережающая своего соперника (не иначе, как агнца божьего) на три процентных пунктика, так вожделенных Трампом. 
Вроде бы смешно было рассчитывать, что после подобного выпада положение «дьявольской» дамочки сильно пошатнётся, если бы не одно «но»! До этого (феноменального по уровню мракобесия!) политического хода была целая череда инсинуаций, направленных на уничтожение репутации Хиллари Клинтон. Если припомните, то она: 
— настолько легкомысленна, что пользуется личной почтой (совершенно не защищённой) для пересылки важнейшей информации;— так склеротична, что забывает секретнейшие документы в отеле вражеской страны, где, традиционно, разведывательные органы бдят неусыпно;— больна в такой степени, что теряет сознание на публичных мероприятиях;— кровожадна настолько, что ей инкриминируют ливийскую войну и тесную связь с террористическими организациями. 
Даже её сторонники как будто задались целью подтвердить «греховность» Клинтон. Чего стоит только выходка Мадонны, объявившей во всеуслышание, что всякому (всякой?), кто проголосует за Хиллари, гарантирован сеанс орального секса от певицы. А в соцсети расшалившаяся последовательница демократии выложила фото своего обнажённого тела (изрядно постаревшего, но по-прежнему «звездатого»), призвав отдать голос той, «кто действительно нужен» Америке. 
В каждой шутке присутствует небольшая доля шутки, не так ли? Мир оценил, мир развлекается за счёт происходящего в Штатах. Но требуемого результата «юмористы», похоже, всё-таки, добились: перед самым часом «X» Трамп явно обходит «дьяволицу»! Газета Los Angeles Times утверждает, что последний опрос показал следующие результаты по состоянию на 04.11.2016: за Дональда Трампа считают нужным отдать голоса 47,5% из опрошенных 2094 граждан, а за Хиллари Клинтон — 42,5%. Такой вот «экзорцизм» из американской политики происходит, пока американцы пытаются сделать окончательный выбор. А вам не страшно?

10159,"EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt at CPAC: After 8 Years We’ll Have Better Air, Better Water - Breitbart","Newly confirmed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told Tea Party activist and conservative commentator Dr. Gina Loudon in an interview conducted on the main stage at CPAC Saturday that the country needs to get back to the rule of law. [Pruitt predicted: “I really believe that at the end of eight years [of the Trump administration] we’re going to have better air quality, we’re going to have better water quality because we’ve invested in a partnership,”  The partnership between the states and the federal government, Pruitt said, is one “that exists legally, that exists constitutionally. ” Pruitt also focused on two of the themes that he addressed last month during his confirmation hearings: (1) The actions of the Environmental Protection Agency must be guided by the rule of law. (2) The goals of environmental quality and energy production are not incompatible. “I think when we have a mutually exclusive kind of approach  —   that if you’re   you’re   when you’re   you’re    —   what that means is that we’ve been used to serve political ends,” Pruitt told Loudon. “We as a nation are better than that,” he added. “Because we do both. We grow jobs we also take care of our air, our water we also take care of our children,” the former Oklahoma Attorney General added. “How can the people here at CPAC help you take that message to their peers, their work environments, their schools as they go back out into the real world?” Loudon asked. “Another key term is trust. There’s distrust right now that exists between the states and Washington, D. C. as it relates to the environment,” Pruitt responded. “We need to do what we can to restore trust. I’m going to be spending time in West Virginia and Ohio with the state governors and the executive branches of government there,” Pruitt promised. “I’m going to send a message. Let’s join    to do what’s important for the environment,” he concluded.",0
10160,"For Cubs Fans, Enemy Home Runs Come With a Duty: ‘Throw. It. Back.’ - The New York Times","CHICAGO  —   When the Chicago Cubs pitcher Travis Wood unexpectedly hit a home run Saturday night in Game 2 of his team’s National League division series against San Francisco, the baseball found a happy nesting spot in the   bleachers at Wrigley Field. The Cubs fan who snared it even returned it to Wood after the game rather than keep it as a memento. But at Wrigley, not all home runs are received equally. A longstanding protocol there dictates that when a visiting player hits one out, any upstanding Cubs fan who catches the ball is obliged to launch it back onto the field. Even the people who position themselves beyond the outfield walls at Wrigley and attempt to snag home runs hit onto Sheffield and Waveland Avenues sometimes follow this code. It is a symbolic act, turning the baseball into a bitter pill that is better spit out than swallowed. “It’s awesome. It’s part of the history of the Cubs,” said Anthony Prerost, who had caught what, until Saturday night, was the most significant home run of Wood’s career, a grand slam against the Chicago White Sox in 2013. “We’re not going to accept opposing teams or opposing players. So why should we accept their home runs? We might as well reject them, too. ” Not everyone, however, is so enthusiastic about this practice. “It’s stupid,” said Jeff Gorski, who caught Miguel Montero’s   homer last month that put an exclamation point on the Cubs’ National League Central title. “Catching a home run is a     experience. Why should you have to throw it back just because it wasn’t somebody on the Cubs who hit it?” The tradition, which dates back nearly five decades, has spread over the years to other ballparks, including Yankee Stadium. Last year, a fan there threw back a home run ball hit by Toronto’s Jose Bautista and struck Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner in the back of the head, leaving him with a welt. When Bautista hit another home run last week at Texas in Game 1 of an American League division series, a Rangers fan reached the infield with his defiant throw. At places like Wrigley Field and Yankee Stadium, anyone who does not throw back an opposing home run can expect to hear adamant chants of “Throw. It. Back. ” Sitting in the   bleachers before the   series began on Friday night, Colleen Solomon, a schoolteacher, frowned when her friend Jennifer Dompke said she would gladly chuck a Giants home run back onto the field. “It’s hard not to fall victim to the mob mentality,” said Solomon, who equated fans’ chants to throw a ball back with the bullying behavior she points out to her students. “There’s a deindividualization when you’re in a crowd. I wouldn’t walk up to a Giants player and boo, but when I’m surrounded by thousands of people, I’m more likely to do it. ” Solomon was spared any angst because the Giants, in losing the first two games of the series, did not manage to hit any balls into the bleachers. But that was not a surprise. They hit only 130 home runs this season, the third fewest in baseball. But if the Cubs enjoy as prosperous a postseason as their fans are pining for, and they move on to the National League Championship Series and then  —   dare we say it?  —   the World Series, sluggers like the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Corey Seager or the Blue Jays’ Edwin Encarnacion might end up launching a drive into the Wrigley bleachers. Which, in turn, will give some Cubs fan the chance to throw the ball back. The tradition, like so much else in the Cubs history, apparently traces its roots back to 1969, the year the Cubs collapsed in the last part of the season, blowing a   lead over the Mets. That season at Wrigley, Hank Aaron hit his 521st career home run, tying him with Ted Williams. The ball was caught by Ron Grousl, a    bartender who was a denizen of the   bleachers. Grousl said he offered the ball to Aaron after the game as the slugger was making his way to the Braves’ bus, but Aaron refused, apparently angry that fans in right field had dumped beer on him when he ventured near the wall. The next season, when Aaron hit a home run at Wrigley Field and Grousl caught it, he said he was still so upset with Aaron’s rejection (and maybe everything else that happened in 1969) that he threw the ball back onto the field. “I just thought: ‘Get this out of here. I don’t want it,’” Grousl, 70, said in a telephone interview. “I just threw it back. ” Asked if, after all these years, he regretted throwing back a home run hit by one of baseball’s greatest players, Grousl said: “No. I went to every game. I caught a lot of home run balls. You were just mad about the whole thing in ’69. ” Slowly, Grousl’s act caught on. Some Wrigley fans needed prodding to throw the balls back, so an empty beer cup would be passed around to collect a bribe many people would put in a dollar or two. “We’d get about $25, and the guy would give up the ball then we’d throw it back,” Grousl said. On other occasions, the Cubs relievers  —   who were stationed in the bullpen down the   line  —   would provide an autographed ball to trade for the one headed back to the field. “It might take an inning,” Grousl said. But it was not until the 1980s, when the bleachers became a preferred place to watch a game at Wrigley, that throwing back home runs became a staple of the park’s culture. And with Cubs games being broadcast nationally on the superstation WGN, the ritual gained broad exposure. When Shawon Dunston became the starting shortstop for the Cubs in 1985, he was baffled the first time a home run ball was thrown back on the field and rolled toward him. “I wanted to fire it back, and then somebody said, ‘No, it’s a tradition,’” said Dunston, who is now a coach with the Giants and was known for having one of the strongest arms in baseball. “I didn’t like the ball going over the fence, so when the fans threw it back, they went crazy. I kind of liked it. ” Over the years, the regulars in the bleachers have forged a personal bond with the players. Gary Matthews, nicknamed Sarge, was the left fielder when the Cubs ended a   playoff drought in 1984. He bought Army caps for the fans in left field. When the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2003, right fielder Sammy Sosa broke off the clubhouse celebration and returned to the warning track to spray champagne on those still rejoicing in the bleachers. And after the Cubs clinched the division this season, the team’s president, Theo Epstein, put on a fake mustache and sunglasses and sat in the bleachers, too. Bob Dernier, the Cubs’ center fielder in 1984, recalled joining Matthews during pitching changes for conversations with fans in the bleachers. “This is as intimate as a ballpark can be,” he said. “It’s a unique relationship you have with the fans out there. ” Just ask David Rudstein, a    law school professor who has been attending games since he was he was 7. When Alfonso Soriano played left field for the Cubs, he would toss Rudstein several balls a game. After Soriano was traded in 2013, Rudstein struck up a friendship with Soriano’s friend Hector Rondon, a reliever. Rudstein said that when he was waiting in line to enter the ballpark, a Range Rover with tinted windows came to a stop on Waveland Avenue. The window rolled down: It was Rondon, pausing to say hello. Rudstein has thrown balls back  —   he said he once caught two within three innings, hit by the Houston Astros’ Craig Biggio and Craig Shipley  —   but he, like many of the bleacher regulars, is sophisticated. They bring a dummy ball, perhaps one they caught during batting practice, and then slyly throw that one back if they catch a visitor’s home run. “I don’t like it all,” Rudstein said of the    tradition before momentarily interrupting an interview to  —   what else?  —   catch a   homer. “When you catch a game ball, I don’t think throwing it back says anything at all. A home run ball is a home run ball. ” After tucking away two   home runs in a duffel bag for future use as dummy balls, Walter Scott, 54, an airline pilot, said: “Sometimes you see a real rotten one go back. But as long as one goes back, everybody’s happy. You’re just appeasing the crowd. ” There is a certain etiquette that comes with sitting in the bleachers at Wrigley. Attempting the wave is a grave offense. Offering a baseball to a child might be repaid with a beer by a parent. “Bleacher currency,” said Gorski, 35, who sells   jewelry. “It’s good karma. ” And some elements of the social contract in the bleachers are  . “Once, a random fan bought me a hot dog,” said Solomon, the schoolteacher, who was touched by the gesture. “Then I put ketchup on it, and he took it away. ” The expectations for visitors’ home runs are more straightforward. A weak throw, one that does not reach the field from the bleachers  —   while rare  —   is a sure way to generate boos at Wrigley. Timing is important, too. Ideally, the throw should be seen by the hitter  —   that means launching it from right field as he rounds first base and from left field as he rounds second. And do not wait until the offending player has returned to the field after the inning, as one fan did during the 2008 playoffs. He was ejected for throwing Manny Ramirez’s home run ball back at Ramirez when he returned to left field. There is one way, however, to cut through discomfort with social mores and longstanding tribal rituals. It is in the hands of the Cubs pitchers, who for many years were not as proficient as they are now at a singular task: keeping baseballs out of the bleachers.",0
10161,Megyn Kelly Finally Reveals The Details Of Ailes’ Sexual Harrassment,"Comments 
FOX News star Megyn Kelly has finally revealed the disturbing details of the abuse and harrassment she endured at the right-wing propaganda factory. Serial sexual predator and fascist ideologue Roger Ailes lost his job as the CEO of FOX News a few months ago after anchor Gretchen Carlson publicly accused her old boss of sexually harassing her and using his position to try to extort sexual favors from her. 
As the male stars of the network rushed to defend Ailes and over a dozen women came forward to share their own stories, Kelly stayed silent – for a time. Now, she’s adding material to her upcoming memoir detailing how Ailes harassed her and threatened her job : 
“Roger began pushing the limits. There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger’s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me—veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the ‘very sexy bras’ I must have and how he’d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.” 
Kelly also claims Ailes offered to promote her through the ranks “in exchange for sexual favors.” At one point, she writes, he “crossed a new line—trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.” Upon her rebuffing his advances, she recalls, “he asked me an ominous question: ‘When is your contract up?’ And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.” 
After Ailes was fired (with a $40 million severance package!), he almost immediately joined the presidential campaign of fellow serial sexual predator Donald Trump. 
The fall of Ailes and the backlash surrounding Donald Trump’s “hot mic” audio comments in which he admits to sexual assault have brought the issue of sexual harassment and the ways in which powerful white men abuse women in the workplace into the forefront of the public eye. 
Men like Ailes and Trump have gotten away with their crimes for far too long; women have been forced to suffer in silence, forced to choose between their dignity and agency over their own bodies or their careers and financial well-being – a choice nobody should have to make. The more women that come forward to tell their stories, the more will follow – and hopefully we can someday geld the toxic patriarchy which silences women and allows predators to roam free.",0

“I’m endorsing Donald Trump,” Kallstrom said on Fox News. “I’ve known him 40 years. I’ve never endorsed a candidate. He’s a good human being. He’s a generous person. He’s got a big heart. He’s done hundreds and hundreds of things for people without fanfare.” 
“He’s a good guy. He’s a patriot of this country and regardless of what he says, his acts show that he is not that person. He’s been in this Hollywood crowd that talks like that, a lot of people talk like that,” he continued, in reference to the leaked audio tape from 2005 in which Trump made lewd comments about women. 
“He doesn’t do these things. He’s a good guy. I’ve known his family from the time they were kids. Look at his children. Could you find a better family than he brought up in this country? This country is absolutely going in the wrong direction.”

10163,Kristen Stewart: We Must ‘Shatter’ Idea That Playing With Toy Guns Is Cool,"During the June 7 Brady Center Bear Awards —  where celebrities applaud other celebrities for their gun control support —  actress Kristen Stewart warned that it is time to dispel the idea that playing with toy guns is cool. [The awards ceremony honored Chelsea Handler, who refers to gun ownership as a “hobby” rather than a right, and were attended by January Jones, Tom Arnold, and The Voice champion Alisan Porter. Will Ferrell also attended and served as “auctioneer” for the evening.  According to People, Stewart’s attendance was highlighted by Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Gross said Stewart had approached him with an idea about a new way to push gun control and that he was “impressed” by her proposal. He said, “She came to us because she has something she wants to do with this issue. She eagerly shared her idea and without hesitation and is showing up tonight. She is committed to actually doing something, not just lending her name. ” While no specifics were given about Stewart’s gun control idea, People reports that it will revolve around taking “classic American depictions of our fascination with guns” and adding a new message. Stewart spoke about using images to change the way Americans perceive what is considered to be “comforting. ” And talked about how we need to work to keep children from playing with toy guns because it convinces them that real guns can offer protection when they grow up: One of them involved the shattering of the idea that it’s cool to play with toy guns and little kids grow up thinking that’s going to protect and empower them. We kind of take that idea and go, ‘Actually this is something else that could happen,’ and that needs to be considered by people who might not think about that kind of thing.

10164,GOP Senator Silences the Entire Room With Remark About War Hero Opponent's Heritage at Debate,"Share on Twitter 
Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) ignited a political firestorm Thursday night after he randomly brought up his Democratic rival’s heritage after she touted her military experience during a debate. 
Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who is of mixed Thai and American descent, cited her military service as well as her family’s when making the case against rushing into war. 
“I’m a daughter of the American Revolution. I’ve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound,“ she said. ”Because people are quick to sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say, ‘This is what it costs, this is what you’re asking us to do’. Let’s make sure the American people understand what we are engaging in.”

Kirk’s campaign later issued a statement addressing the controversy: 
“Senator Kirk has consistently called Rep. Duckworth a war hero and honors her family’s service to this country. But that’s not what this debate was about. Rep.

10165,"Hillary's 33,000 emails might not be 'missing' after all","THE DELETER OF THE FREE WORLD Hillary's 33,000 emails might not be 'missing' after all Files backed up on multiple platforms never subpoened by FBI Published: 7 mins ago 
(New York Post) For months now, we’ve been told that Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 missing emails were permanently erased and destroyed beyond recovery. But newly released FBI notes strongly suggest they still exist in several locations — and they could be recovered, if only someone would impanel a grand jury and seize them. 
In a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton’s private server revealed that an underling didn’t bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton’s aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress. 
The Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta “created a ‘vehicle’ to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the ‘vehicle,’ but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.”",0
10166,"Is ICE’s Help-Wanted Sign a Welcome Mat for Rogue Applicants, Too? - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump has vowed a hiring surge of 10, 000 immigration and customs officers to accelerate the deportation of unauthorized immigrants. But the aggressive pace he has laid out risks adding to the ranks of rogue agents who have been charged with abusing immigrants. Over the past decade, dozens of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and contract guards responsible for the detention and removal of undocumented immigrants have been arrested and charged with beating people, smuggling drugs into detention centers, having sex with detainees and accepting bribes to delay or stop deportations, agency documents and court records show. One agent took pictures of himself having sex with a minor in a foreign country after dropping off deportees. In another case, an ICE lawyer pretending to be an immigration judge took bribes to remove official documents from the files of people awaiting deportation. These officials make up a small fraction of the work force at the agency, now comprising almost 20, 000 people, but former Homeland Security officials and human rights workers say that even a few bad officers can be a problem because they hold such power over a vulnerable population. John Roth, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general, told a Senate committee in February that the agency would “face a number of challenges” in executing Mr. Trump’s executive orders because it had “inadequate systems to track and process applicants. ” Mr. Roth said his office was conducting an audit of previous hiring surges to help the agency avoid practices that may have led to corruption and misconduct by staff members. Human rights activists expressed similar worries about a hiring wave. “Given the things that have been documented in the past  —   beatings, sexual assaults and other abuses  —   it doesn’t seem like they have much oversight of the people they have now. And they want to add more?” said Justin Mazzola, deputy director of research for Amnesty International in New York. Mr. Mazzola’s concern is borne out in a number of cases in which ICE employees have been accused or convicted of abuse. In Philadelphia, Justin Ford pleaded guilty to stealing money from undocumented immigrants being processed for removal. In New Jersey, Arnaldo Echevarria was convicted on charges of extracting bribes from people facing deportation. And in Detroit, Clifton Divers was arrested after the authorities said he had provided false information to federal immigration authorities in order to delay the deportation of several immigrants facing removal. Mr. Ford and Mr. Echevarria were deportation officers who supervised unauthorized immigrants. Mr. Divers is a special agent with ICE Homeland Security Investigations who prosecutors say took $5, 000 from an immigration attorney to put off several deportations by claiming that the immigrants had information about crimes. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary, has directed the agency to “take all appropriate action to expeditiously hire 10, 000 agents and officers,” as sought by Mr. Trump in his executive order. Mr. Kelly said the agency would maintain a rigorous hiring process and add personnel to ensure that it would not be compromised. “I will not skimp on the training and the standards,” he told a congressional panel last month. According to immigration and customs officials, agents and deportation officers undergo   security checks and full background investigations, and then   every five or 10 years, depending on the sensitivity of the position. Still, some former Homeland Security officials said they worried that in an effort to accelerate hiring, the agency would be tempted to lower its standards. Leaked documents outlining plans to beef up a sister agency, the Border Patrol, first reported in Foreign Policy magazine, show that Customs and Border Protection officials are considering waiving polygraph tests for some applicants and applying less stringent background checks to speed the hiring of 5, 000 agents. ICE does not administer lie detector test to applicants. In 2016, the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility sought permission to use   polygraph examinations for law enforcement applicants similar to those used by the Border Patrol and Secret Service, but the proposal stalled. James Tomsheck, a former assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said that while polygraph tests were not foolproof, they could help weed out applicants susceptible to corruption. “What needs to be implemented are protocols for keeping bad people from getting in in the first place,” he said. “Background checks alone are insufficient at vetting people. ” Background checks failed to find problems with Mr. Ford, who authorities said was facing financial problems when he stole from the vulnerable immigrants he transported to detention facilities in New Jersey. He was arrested in March 2015 by a Philadelphia Police Department SWAT team as he dropped off an undercover agent at a detention facility. Mr. Ford, who told the authorities that he had taken only a few hundred dollars from detainees “a couple of times,” pleaded guilty in June 2015. Mr. Echevarria, who was indicted last year, accepted $75, 000 in bribes in exchange for employment authorization documents for several immigrants in the country illegally, the authorities said. Prosecutors said he also had demanded sex in at least one instance. From 2012 to 2014, they said, Mr. Echevarria made false statements to immigration authorities about the status of the undocumented immigrants under his supervision. Mr. Divers, who is awaiting trial, was arrested in October. According to court records, between 2009 and 2015 he took thousands of dollars from Charles T. Busse, an immigration attorney, to help with deportation cases.’ ”In one instance, Mr. Divers was accused of sending an email to officials at Homeland Security that falsely said one of Mr. Busse’s clients was assisting in a criminal investigation. As a result of Mr. Divers’s email, the client was not deported, court records show.” ’In another case, Mr. Divers arranged for a   deportation deferral for another client of Mr. Busse, a Mexican man, after providing false information to ICE officials, according to court documents. “Some of these guys don’t have any respect for the people they are rounding up or deporting,” said an ICE deportation officer, who requested anonymity because he fears losing his job for speaking out publicly. “I’ve heard agents refer to all Somalis as ‘pirates’ and other ethnic slurs. Others are just hostile to aliens being here breaking the law. It’s not our job to judge. ”",0
10167,Bernie Sanders Vows Fight to Convention as Hillary Clinton Wins a Primary - The New York Times,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif.  —   Senator Bernie Sanders defiantly vowed again on Sunday to take his campaign to the Democratic National Convention this summer, even as Hillary Clinton edged closer to clinching the party’s presidential nomination and the final primary contests drew near. Two days before Tuesday’s primaries in California and five other states, Mr. Sanders repeated his pledge not to concede even if Mrs. Clinton acquires enough delegates to reach 2, 383, the threshold for securing the nomination. A win in California is critical to Mr. Sanders’s plan to stay in the race through the convention and would give him a significant lift. But with her victory in the Puerto Rico primary on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton is only 28 delegates short of the threshold and will most likely declare victory on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders, however, insists that the convention will be contested because he is still lobbying superdelegates  —   party officials and state leaders who cast their final votes at the convention  —   to withdraw support from Mrs. Clinton and back him instead. He plans to make the case that he is a stronger candidate against Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. A number of polls, he said, show he can beat Mr. Trump by larger margins than Mrs. Clinton can. On Sunday, Mr. Sanders opened a new line of attack against Mrs. Clinton, criticizing donations made by foreign governments while she was secretary of state to the Clinton Foundation, the organization founded by former President Bill Clinton. When Mr. Sanders, who greeted fans in West Hollywood, was asked by reporters if he remained committed to pushing for a contested convention, he said he “absolutely” was. A convention is typically seen as contested when a candidate cannot reach the necessary delegate count using both pledged delegates and superdelegates. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton conceded to Barack Obama shortly after the final primary and before the convention. But Mr. Sanders is promising to break with tradition and extend his fight further than initially expected. Mr. Sanders reiterated his stance on Sunday at a restaurant filled with disco lights as he urged supporters to back him. “We need a real change in this country,” Mr. Sanders said to a cheering crowd at the restaurant, Hamburger Mary’s, in West Hollywood, “and we need a government which represents all of us, not just the 1 percent. ” During a news conference on Saturday in Los Angeles, Mr. Sanders said it would be wrong for Mrs. Clinton to claim victory on Tuesday based on her total delegate count. News media outlets should not call the race, he said, unless she reaches the threshold with only pledged delegates. “It is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now, I have heard reports that Secretary Clinton has said it’s all going to be over on Tuesday night. I have reports that the media, after the New Jersey results come in, are going to declare that it is all over. That simply is not accurate. ” Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders in both pledged and total delegates. In a sign of his campaign’s urgency to win in California, Mr. Sanders criticized the Clinton Foundation during an interview on Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union. ” “If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, governments which are dictatorships?” Mr. Sanders said. “You don’t have a lot of civil liberties or democratic rights in Saudi Arabia,” he told the interviewer, Jake Tapper. “You don’t have a lot of respect there for opposition points of view for gay rights, for women’s rights. Yes, do I have a problem with that? Yes, I do. ” Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton spent Sunday campaigning in California, where polls indicated a tight race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Clinton visited black churches, appealing to a demographic that had given her important support in past nominating contests. In Oakland, Mrs. Clinton spoke at Greater St. Paul Church. Tailoring her remarks to her audience, she recalled working briefly in Oakland in the 1970s, and she praised the Golden State Warriors, who were set to host Game 2 of the N. B. A. finals. Mrs. Clinton also talked about issues like gentrification and gun violence and told congregants how difficult it was to be president. “I wish it was only about making speeches,” Mrs. Clinton said. “You know, just get up there and promise the moon and make all of these rhetorical flourishes. That’d be a lot easier than what the job is. ” Mr. Clinton visited First African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Los Angeles, where he took aim at Mr. Trump and addressed criticism that he and his wife were part of the “political establishment. ” “This is not an establishment campaign,” he said. “This is an inclusion campaign. ” Mr. Sanders spent much of his day walking around greeting voters in several places, including the Santa Monica Pier, where dozens of fans hugged and snapped photos with him. Some shouted, “That’s our next president!” But there were signs of opposition from Clinton supporters. One woman shouted, “Get out of the race!” As Mr. Sanders shook hands, he quickly moved past Jenny Swiatowy, 33, who sat next to a fruit arrangement with a sticker showing her support for Mrs. Clinton. “In the beginning, I thought it was great for him to come out as a new candidate with a new voice and to start bringing out the young new voters,” said Ms. Swiatowy, who works at a record label. “But it’s time to concede and unite the party. ” Mr. Sanders, though, was not bowing to the pressure. “See you in Philly,” he told one smiling supporter.",0

Breyer joining the court’s more conservative members “as a courtesy. ” He said that this would preserve the status quo until the court decided whether to hear the case. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. The court’s order has no effect on any other case. The move came amid a national debate over transgender rights. A North Carolina law that requires transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates has drawn protests, boycotts and lawsuits. A directive from the Obama administration threatening schools with the loss of federal money for discrimination based on gender identity has been challenged in court by more than 20 states. The case in the Supreme Court concerns Gavin Grimm, who was born female but identifies as a male and will soon start his senior year at Gloucester High School in southeastern Virginia. For a time, school administrators allowed Mr. Grimm to use the boys’ bathroom, but the local school board adopted a policy that required students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms for their “corresponding biological genders. ” The board added that “students with gender identity issues” would be allowed to use private bathrooms. Mr. Grimm sued, and a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. ruled the policy unlawful. A trial judge then ordered school officials to let Mr. Grimm use the boys’ bathroom. The school board has said that it will file a petition in late August asking the Supreme Court to hear its appeal. In the meantime, the board submitted an emergency application that asked the justices to let school officials continue to bar Mr. Grimm from the boys’ bathroom. The alternative, the board’s lawyers said, was harm to “the basic expectations of bodily privacy” and “severe disruption to the school in the upcoming school year. ” The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Mr. Grimm, responded that the trial court’s order did not amount to the kind of irreparable harm that warrants a stay from the Supreme Court, as it concerned a single student in a single high school which has taken steps to increase privacy in restrooms for all students. The legal question in the case, Gloucester County School Board v. G. G. No. 16A52, is whether the Obama administration was entitled to interpret a regulation under Title IX, a 1972 law that bans discrimination “on the basis of sex” in schools that receive federal money, to ban discrimination based on gender identity. The regulation, adopted in 1975, allowed schools to provide “separate toilet, locker rooms and shower facilities on the basis of sex. ” Last year, the federal Department of Education weighed in on the Gloucester School Board’s policy, saying schools “generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity. ” In May, the department issued a more general directive that said schools may lose federal money if they discriminate against transgender students. The Fourth Circuit said the 1975 regulation was ambiguous and that the department’s interpretation of it was entitled to “controlling weight. ” Under a 1997 Supreme Court decision, Auer v. Robbins, agencies’ interpretations of their own regulations are generally entitled to deference. The Auer decision has been the subject of much criticism, and several justices have urged the Supreme Court to revisit the ruling. In a dissent in May, Justice Clarence Thomas said it was “on its last gasp. ”",0
10169,Bret Weinstein to Tucker Carlson: It May Not be Safe to Return to Evergreen State - Breitbart,"Evergreen State College Professor Bret Weinstein claimed that it may be unsafe for him to return to campus in his second interview with Tucker Carlson, which aired on Monday night.[  Professor Bret Weinstein made a second appearance on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program on Monday evening to speak on the status of the chaos that erupted after he gently pushed back against Evergreen State College’s “Day of Absence” event, which encouraged white community members to leave campus for a day. Carlson began the interview by claiming that Weinstein has relocated his family for their safety. Weinstein claimed that he has not returned to campus because the administration has yet to acknowledge the danger that their handling of the protests has put Weinstein and his family in. He also suggested that returning to campus may not be safe at this moment. Weinstein claimed that he has received tremendous support from the public outside of the college, but lamented the fact that only one of his colleagues had publicly condemned the witch hunt. “Not leaving meant that you were not an ally,” Weinstein said, referencing the backlash he received to his refusal to participate in the “Day of Absence. ” “On a college campus, people should be equally free to be on campus, irrespective of their skin color,” Weinstein added.

10171,Donald Trump Finds Himself Playing Catch-Up in All-Important Ohio - The New York Times,"COLUMBUS, Ohio  —   Since the Republican Party’s   founding, not one of its nominees has won the White House without carrying Ohio, a most diverse and perennially   state. But as Republicans head to Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump in two weeks, a convention city chosen with Battleground Ohio much in mind, a vortex of headwinds are rising against Mr. Trump in the state. The barely concealed disdain of Gov. John R. Kasich, a former rival who has not endorsed the presumptive nominee, echoes through the state’s Republican leadership, whose full engagement in the fall campaign will be needed to turn out voters. Images of disunity in Cleveland, where delegates are gathering July   in the shadow of local polls showing a majority of Republicans prefer a different nominee, could make it harder for the party to attract   activists for the fall campaign. Mr. Trump ignored Ohio for six weeks after clinching the nomination, until a visit last week to coal country, where he spoke to an audience of largely white   voters, including some Democrats. It was the group he has performed best with in primaries and polls. But in describing a trade deal during the same visit as a “rape of our country,” his oratory and protectionist policies are turning off other   voters, including suburban women and business interests, in a state whose economy depends on global exports. “If you look at the primary and extrapolate, Trump could get   of the white working class,” said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron. That would improve on Mitt Romney’s share of these voters in Ohio in 2012, when the state slipped from his grasp by only 103, 000 votes. “The flip side is Trump’s appeal to white   men very well may cost him other kinds of Republican voters,” Mr. Green said. Public polling of Ohio, which has been scant, shows Hillary Clinton with an average lead of about three percentage points. Mrs. Clinton and her supporters are already spending heavily in the state on ads to define Mr. Trump negatively, and last week Mrs. Clinton visited Cincinnati with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who electrified the crowd by mocking Mr. Trump for running a campaign no deeper than the slogans on his “goofy” hats. A recent Quinnipiac Poll of Ohio, showing the race deadlocked, indicated women were moving toward Mrs. Clinton while Mr. Trump’s strength among men was unchanged. Bob Seszko, a school bus mechanic from rural Bellaire, Ohio, said he voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary but planned to vote for Mr. Trump in November. In the 1980s, he had made good money at a steel plant in the Ohio River Valley  —   until it closed. “Overseas was selling it cheaper than we could make it, so I lost my job,” he said. “I think Trump’s more sincere than Hillary is. She’s riding on the coattails of her husband. ” Mr. Trump’s appeal to such voters is likely to be strong, especially in the industrial region around Youngstown and Akron. That he has kept the race tight even after weeks of negative news  —   about his visit to Scotland, his firing of his campaign manager and his congratulating himself after the nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla.  —   is a testament to the strength of Mr. Trump’s appeal with his base, as well as the polarization of the electorate. To counter the threat, Mrs. Clinton and her supporters began a barrage of   television ads in Ohio and other swing states in May, and for the Fourth of July weekend, they planned a $13 million blitz mostly in Ohio and Florida. Mr. Trump, who is skeptical of TV ads and short on campaign cash, has not bought any general election ads in the state. The first ad supporting him from an outside group, the National Rifle Association, featuring a survivor of the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was just rolled out. “I’ve gotten to the point where I feel so much of this is on the Trump campaign,” said Matt Borges, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. He said Mr. Trump recently called him after reading that Mrs. Clinton was far ahead in hiring field staff members in Ohio. In March, Mr. Borges and other Republican leaders in the state bluntly warned that if Mr. Trump were the nominee, he could not carry their perennially   state. “We want to distance ourselves from the kind of rhetoric that Donald Trump is using to divide Americans,” Mr. Borges said at the time. “If Donald Trump is unfortunately our choice and our nominee, it could imperil not only the race for the White House but many other candidates  . ” The state’s Republican leaders, who supported their native son Mr. Kasich before his withdrawal from the race, no longer openly scorn Mr. Trump. But they pick their words carefully, withholding full support. “A great many people in Ohio are watching Mr. Trump closely to see if over the weeks and months he will emerge as an individual of presidential stature,” said Brad Sinnott, chairman of the Republican Central Committee of Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital. “There is some work to be done. ” Mr. Trump, who has signaled a strategy of outsourcing   organizing to the national party, hired a state director only late last month. The Republican National Committee, which promised last year to hire more than 200 field staff members in the state, has about 50 now, and has yet to open its first Ohio office. The Clinton campaign, which declined to say how many staff members it has in Ohio, is also coordinating with state and national Democrats, who collectively have more than 100 people in the field, said Kirstin Alvanitakis, a state party spokeswoman. The Clinton campaign plans to open offices across the state in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump’s appeal helped drive record turnout in the primary in March. “I told him we had a million new Republicans,” Mr. Borges recalled of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump. “He asked, ‘Is that because of me? ’” “I told him yes,” he said. What he did not say is that many Republican primary voters came out to vote against Mr. Trump, who received nearly 36 percent of the vote in the contest, which Mr. Kasich won. “You don’t have a   movement without Trump,” Mr. Borges said.",0

10173,Rio Games Highlight Problems With the Olympic Model - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Proud and beautiful as this seaside city is, glorious as the feats of athleticism and sportsmanship were these past two weeks, these Games underline that the Olympic model is fractured. As we depart, Rio de Janeiro is left with stadiums for which it has little use and swimming pools far removed from the working class who could dearly use them. Tens of thousands of residents were displaced, a golf course sits atop a former nature preserve, and the towers of the athletes’ village will have a second life as luxury housing. Rio’s state government turns its pockets inside out looking for money to pay salaries and to keep hospitals open. The army withdraws, and fears rise that crime will spiral. The International Olympic Committee has taken steps toward reform. But what it demands of nations is basically unchanged: Build us expensive monuments with a shelf life of two weeks. The I. O. C. has no hammer to bring down when cities fail to deliver on environmental promises. There is a more sustainable and less ruinous path, and I will get to that. First, I should wrestle with the challenge tossed down by my colleague Roger Cohen. He is an incisive, humane observer, and he argued that critics have the Rio Olympics all wrong. His perspective should be reckoned with, even as I disagreed with nearly every word. “I am tired, very tired,” Cohen wrote last week, “of reading negative stories about these Brazilian Olympics  —   the anger in the slums, the violence that continues (including the armed robbery of four American swimmers) the enduring gulf between rich and poor, the occasional organizational hassles, the Russian doping and the Brazilian mosquito, money that could supposedly have been spent better. ” He argued that the developed world harbors an antipathy for grand sporting events held in the developing world. I would turn his formulation on its head. The greatest honor we can pay to a nation is to take its maladies seriously. Brazil overthrew a dictatorship and remains a gloriously messy democracy. Yet police and paramilitary violence and human rights violations accompany its grand sporting events. Brazilian officials, desperate to tamp down the vicious drug gangs before the Olympics, let the army and the police ratchet up violence, to the point that last year the police committed   of the homicides in Rio. Such problems are not unique to Rio de Janeiro. “A major sporting event,” Amnesty International wrote of Rio, “tends to increase the human rights violations that already occur in a host city. ” Corruption scarred these Games, as contractors and politicians sluiced hundreds of millions of dollars into their coffers. Brave journalists here exposed this, and Brazilian prosecutors, to their credit, investigated the metastasizing scandals. Earlier this year, the scion of the nation’s largest construction companies, Odebrecht, an investor in the athletes’ housing, was sentenced to 19 years in prison for his role in another political scandal. We would do well to stanch any North American impulse toward  . The United States walked this twisted path, too. Our Salt Lake 2002 Winter Olympics were a bacchanalia of bribes, doping and corruption. My colleague Cohen claimed to detect another double standard he could recall no reporters poking around impoverished corners of London during its Summer Olympics. If that is so, that is our failure. London remains one of the globe’s more grossly unequal cities, and terrific activism was afoot during those Olympics. I recall walking through London’s East End before those Games and talking with the imams, bakers, construction workers, students and pastors who were the backbone of East London Communities Organization. They successfully pressured the London organizers to pay living wages to all who worked inside the Olympic perimeter. “They said they had obligations to their contractors,” Lina Jamoul, an organizer told me at the time. “We said: ‘What you have is a bureaucracy. That isn’t our problem. ’” Activists in London also applied concerted pressure to get the Olympic corporation to create 2, 000 units of affordable housing after the Games. The Rio Olympics offer nods toward a sustainable future. The handball courts, an example of nomadic architecture, will be dismantled and used to build schools. The media center will become dorms, and sections of the Olympic center could become a public park. There was, however, no movement to ensure livable wages for workers. And not a single flat in the towers where the athletes were housed will be reserved for   and poor Cariocas. The developers obtained the public land for free. A recessionary housing market does threaten their profit margin, which is a pity. More to the point, the loudest protests about these Olympics came not from Berkeley or Oxford but from within Rio de Janeiro. Labor unions, teachers and activists on either side of the coastal mountains that divide this city joined in marches. Their anger, coupled with a wounded economy, might account for the thousands of empty seats seen here these past two weeks. “We liked the talk of the Olympics at first,” noted Carla Maria Avesani, who runs a respected nutrition institute at Rio de Janeiro’s state university, which has suffered grievous cuts in pay and services. “Then Brazilians awoke from this dream. It became a nightmare. ” So what’s the solution? We could place the Games in Los Angeles, London or Paris, or seek a permanent home in Athens, which has historical and emotional resonance. “I very much understand the I. O. C. ’s desire to be more equitable in delivering the Olympics to the developing world,” said Allen Hershkowitz, the founder of Green Sports International, who is an environmental consultant to pro sports leagues and the Olympics. “But the Sochi and Rio Olympics indicate that there are such huge environmental, transportation, water and   questions. ” To retreat to the cities of the Northern Hemisphere, however, strikes me  —   and Hershkowitz  —   as a defeat. What if the I. O. C. instead had awarded Rio de Janeiro three cycles of Olympics: 2016, 2020 and 2024? City officials would have time to learn and grow, to ride out a bad recession and market Rio as a true Olympic city. Activists might have forced the Olympics to truly integrate into the lifeblood of the city, incorporating favelas no less than the beach community of Barra. They might have demanded that the athletes’ towers become   housing. They might demand living wages and true apprenticeship programs. Sewage treatment plants could come on line over the course of a decade. (I opposed the efforts of the former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to bring the Olympics to New York, the cacophonous echo chamber that is my native city. But I admired his equitable proposal to put Olympic swimming pools and kayak routes in   city parks.) Olympic officials would also possess a stick: If city leaders did not offer measurable progress, the I. O. C. could withdraw the next two rounds of Games. Such a plan offers much for prospective Winter Olympics sites as well. Argentine or Chilean developers in the Andes  —   or Russians in Sochi, for that matter  —   would have time to build out   and environmentally sensitive winter sports resorts over 12 years, cushioned by the security of Olympic branding. (Tennis’s biggest events, from Wimbledon to the United States, French and Australian Opens, build out their businesses in this fashion year after year. The United States Tennis Association recently added renewable energy and recycling at Flushing Meadows.) “You can’t just do this for a   event it’s got to be a   planning,” Hershkowitz said. “Otherwise, you’re left with empty stadiums and a wrecked environment. ” In the end, the Olympics must change. Travel to Athens or Sochi and you will find a shattered vase of a model. Fewer and fewer cities desire that. In the past few years, residents of   host cities revolted, and Oslo and Boston, among other cities, canceled bids to host the Games. I’m no dour Puritan I love great athletics. My heart leapt as I watched Usain Bolt fly down the track and Simone Biles spin and flip as if exempt from the laws of gravity. To stand in the legendary Maracanã stadium for the gold medal men’s soccer game and listen as Brazilians transformed it into a joyous asylum was a wonder. Cariocas were gracious, from Copacabana baristas to an impoverished    Marie Auxiliadora, who invited me into her home in Favela do Mandela to listen to her upset with these   Games. One day, perhaps even next time, we can deliver a sustainable Olympics worthy of them.",0
10174,News: Democracy Win: Volunteers Across The Country Are Oiling Up The Sidewalks To Help Voters Slide Uncontrollably To Their Polling Place,"Email 
Despite the fact that voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, only 60 percent of eligible voters turn out in a presidential election. But this year we may see that number spike, because groups of incredible volunteers are doing everything they can to get out the vote: They’re hitting the road and oiling up the sidewalks to help voters slide uncontrollably to their polling places. 
Democracy FTW! 
You might not know their names, but these hardworking men and women are out there in the trenches from Maine to California, slathering thick, black oil on the ground so every American can skid down the road, windmilling their arms wildly to try and stay upright, and careen straight through the doors of a voting booth. Republican or Democrat, these patriotic volunteers want every American to have access to a frictionless slick of oil that leads right to a polling place. 
Yes! These incredible volunteers are absolutely killing it! 
Rather than letting our election be decided by a select few, people from across the nation are volunteering their time to make sidewalks well-lubricated and slippery for as many voters as possible. As of this morning, footpaths have been oiled in all 50 states, giving people who would not otherwise have the time or desire to vote the opportunity to lose their balance and slide forward at alarming speeds with their arms flailing and legs kicking, until they crash face-first into a registered polling location. 
We might live in a democracy, but we wouldn’t have a truly representative election without the help of a select few everyday heroes. So when the polling stations close and every last slippery, oil-covered voter has put their ballot in the box and slid back out the door, remember those brave volunteers, because we couldn’t do it without them.",0
10175,Leaked Memo Exposes Shady Dealings Between Clinton Foundation Donors And Bill’s “For-Profit” Activities,"Zero Hedge October 27, 2016 
We have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band back in 2011 after Chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Band’s firm, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department(see here , here, here and here ). 
The feud ultimately resulted in Band being forced to draft a memo spelling out, in vivid detail, the many entangled relationships between himself, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Fortunately, today’s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band’s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family’s private business endeavors. 
The memo starts with a brief background on Teneo, which was created in June 2011, shortly after Declan Kelly resigned from his position as “United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland,” a position to which he was appointed by Secretary Clinton. 
In June 2009, DK Consulting was founded by Declan Kelley. Mr. Kelly served as COO of FTI Consulting until June 2009, when he stepped down and established DK Consulting. At that time, he also became the United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland . Pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with FTI and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the State Department, Mr. Kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients (Coke, Dow, and UBS) and one pro bono client (Allstate) . In late 2009, Declan retained me as a consultant to DK Consulting to help support the needs of these clients. In May 2011, Mr. Kelly resigned his Envoy position at the State Department. In June 2011, Mr. Kelly and I founded Teneo Strategies ; simultaneously, Mr. Kelly closed DK Consulting and shifted its clients to Teneo. 
Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation . This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally. 
In a subsequent section of the memo entitled “Leveraging Teneo For The Foundation,” Band spells all of the donations he solicited from Teneo “clients” for the Clinton Foundation. In all, there are roughly $14mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being Coca-Cola, Barclays, The Rockefeller Foundation and Laureate International Universities. 
The donations from Dow Chemical are particularly notable for several reasons. First, because of other emails revealed by WikiLeaks and other FOIA requests, we now know that Dow Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris, was granted special access to then Secretary Clinton back in July 2009 at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed joint-venture that would have netted Dow $9BN in cash . As Band notes in his memo, 1 month after being granted special access to Secretary Clinton, Liveris invited President Clinton and Band out for a day of golf. Moreover, shortly after his meeting with Secretary Clinton and golf outing with President Clinton, Liveris decided to donate $500,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative …very convenient timing for all involved. 
In August of 2009, Mr. Kelly invited Mr. Liveris to play golf with President Clinton and me. Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Dow to become a CGI sponsor at the $500,000 level, which they did , as well as making a $150,000 donation to the Foundation for President Clinton to attend a Dow dinner in Davos. 
The story gets even more bizarre when Band reveals in the following footnote that Liveris provided the Dow Chemical plane to fly President Clinton and his staff from New York to California and then California to North Korea for their golf outing . We would assume this is a simple typo by Band and/or he’s just geographically challenged…if not, this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for Bill. 
Mr. Liveris provided the Dow plane to fly President Clinton and his staff to and from California for our trip to, and from, North Korea . As a private trip, the Foundation had to pay the costs of airfare; Mr. Liveris’ in kind contribution saved the Foundation in excess of $100,000 . 
According to the Dialy Caller , Dow Chemical paid Teneo $2.8 million in 2011 and $16 million in 2012 for a variety of “consultancy services”. Of course, Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Teneo and, as such, was set to be paid $3.5 million for that position even though he ultimately only kept $100,000 because of the scandals that erupted around the firm, including their advisory relationship with MF Global. 
Finally, Band also offers the following commentary on the “$50 million in for-profit activity” he was able to secure for Bill Clinton (as of November 2011) as well as the “$66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements.” 
Independent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities – including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements . In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President’s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family – for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than $50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements). With respect to business deals for his advisory services, Justin and I found, developed and brought to President Clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject. Of his current 4 arrangements, we secured all of them; and, we have helped manage and maintain all of his for-profit business relationships. Since 2001, President Clinton’s business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements. 
A big part of those “for-profit” activities was a $3.5mm annual payment from Laureate… 
…and millions in speaking fees arranged by Band. 
Confused? Here is a simpler recap from the NYT’s Nick Confessore: This Doug Band memo, in the latest Podesta dump, is the Rosetta stone of the Teneo-Clinton Foundation complex. https://t.co/a1g3nSoGPM 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Band's argument: I am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff I do for Clintonworld, so you should let me do Teneo. Everyone wins. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Now, you could argue: So what? If Band gets his clients to pop over money to a charity, why is that bad? 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 But consider that Band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was, in essence, a way to bolster their influence. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Clinton & Band built a platform for executives to bolster their companies' images, bathe in BC's praise, and do some good, while… 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 …Teneo extracted earnings for Band and, depending on what you see in these e-mails, Clinton himself. Teneo paid Clinton until late '11. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 I guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger. But Chelsea Clinton and some of Clinton's other aides were clearly freaking out. 
— Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Generally, the emails show Clinton's *own closest aides* troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off.

Abdul Rashid Dostum, the more senior of Afghanistan’s two vice presidents, and his bodyguards refused to show up for questioning about the allegations, despite repeatedly being summoned by prosecutors. The case is testing the government’s resolve to deliver justice in the face of a potentially dangerous showdown between a powerful former warlord and the shaky coalition administration of which he is a part. Ahmad Ishchi, a    elder from General Dostum’s own Uzbek ethnic group, has accused the vice president of abducting him from a sports stadium in November, personally and repeatedly beating him, and ordering his men to sexually assault him with an assault rifle during five days of captivity in the northern province of Jowzjan. Attorney General Mohammad Farid Hamidi declined to discuss the case in detail on Tuesday but said that his prosecutors were focused on enforcing the law with precision. “We are following the law in this case hair by hair,” Mr. Hamidi said. President Ashraf Ghani has said that he takes the allegations against General Dostum seriously and that the case will be handled fairly within the judicial system to show that no one is above the law. Mr. Ghani has told Western diplomats that he is tired of officials breaking the law with impunity, and he characterized the Dostum case as a    challenge to his government. But many have said that Mr. Ghani shares the blame for bringing General Dostum onto his ticket in the first place, despite grave concerns about the former warlord’s human rights record. Spokesmen and aides to General Dostum could not be reached for comment about the warrants on Tuesday, but in recent weeks, they have rejected the summons against him as unconstitutional. Bashir Ahmad Tayanj, a spokesman for General Dostum, said last month that the allegations were baseless and that the vice president had constitutional immunity from prosecution as part of the president’s elected ticket. In recent weeks, however, senior government officials say General Dostum’s aides have been in contact with the attorney general’s office, where they have been clearly told that the vice president has no choice but to cooperate. The general’s aides have asked for time, two senior officials said. Mr. Ishchi welcomed the news of the warrants and insisted that the bodyguards be arrested immediately. But he said justice would only be served once General Dostum’s fate had been made clear. “Dostum committed an obvious crime, and when the crime is evident, the government can arrest the criminal even if he is a very   person,” he said. General Dostum is part of a generation of Afghan warlords who stand accused of human rights violations, mostly during the country’s civil war in the 1990s. But until now, most of those figures have seemed immune to the consequences, remaining in positions of power. Before issuing the summons for General Dostum, the attorney general sought the support of Mr. Ghani and the national security council, which includes all the security ministries. A detailed plan of action was discussed at a meeting of the council, at which all the agencies pledged support for the prosecutors. General Dostum’s supporters have insisted that Mr. Ishchi was not abducted but, rather, arrested by security forces on charges of aiding the Taliban in Jowzjan Province. “Force, injury, and mistreatment  —   we cannot deny that, because in the past these accusations have been there against Afghan forces, that they mistreat suspects during arrest and interrogation,” Mr. Tayanj said in the interview last month. But he denied the accusation of sexual assault. Both sides have also made emotional appeals to the public on the nightly news. On one news program, Mr. Tayanj presented a medical document that he said was from a government forensics examination he said it disproved Mr. Ishchi’s assertions of sexual assault but did not go into detail, simply brandishing the paper. A day later, Mr. Tayanj allowed two New York Times reporters to examine the document. It stated that there had been a wound next to Mr. Ishchi’s rectum but that it had been treated, making it difficult to determine what had caused it. Two other medical reports seen by The Times also attest to the presence of a significant wound. One was written by doctors at the United States military air base in Bagram, the other by doctors at the   Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, in Kabul. When the reporters pressed Mr. Tayanj about the wound, he said it was not evidence of sexual assault. “If someone hits someone with a rifle, no matter where they hit, is that sexual assault? Sexual assault has its own specific meaning,” Mr. Tayanj said. “They have made it seem as if he was an    girl who was taken and done something wrong to. ” Aides to General Dostum have called for traditional mediation by tribal elders to resolve the issue, flatly rejecting the judicial process. He is also said to have sent a delegation of elders to negotiate with Mr. Ishchi. Baktash Ishchi, one of Mr. Ishchi’s sons, said that they insisted on following the legal process and would not engage in traditional mediation. “This is not an issue for traditional mediation  —   it is not like he took our camel, so we accept a horse in return,” he said. “There is a crime that has taken place. ”",0
10177,NATO chief downplays concerns over formation of joint European army,"EU NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a press conference at the organization’s headquarters in Brussels on October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has downplayed suggestions that EU military buildup might undermine the Western alliance as the bid to establish an independent European army appears to gain momentum. 
""I strongly believe it is absolutely possible to strengthen European defense without duplicating efforts by NATO,"" Stoltenberg said on Thursday, adding, “EU leaders have (also) conveyed that this is not about the EU doing collective defense, the EU building structures that would compete with NATO."" 
Stoltenberg made the remarks following a meeting between European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and NATO defense ministers in Brussels. 
Mogherini, one of the strongest supporters of a joint European defense force, has drawn up a global strategy for the bloc, which says the 27-nation bloc should seek ""strategic autonomy"" to face multiple security threats, ranging from conventional to hybrid warfare, from the Ukraine crisis to Syria, from poverty in Africa to massive refugee flows. 
The proposal has sparked concerns that the bloc is seeking a more independent role. 
Mogherini on Thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations, such as in Africa or in the Mediterranean, and needs to improve command and control centers to run them. 
She, however, attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an EU force could lead to the duplication of NATO functions, saying, ""But this can be done ... without any kind of overlapping or duplication with NATO.""

In July, an EU strategy document said that the bloc should look to create greater military autonomy from NATO. It stated the EU could no longer rely on the alliance regarding various security issues and must instead develop an ability to “act autonomously if and when necessary.” 
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was the first to call for the establishment of an EU army in March 2015. 
""A joint EU army would show the world that there would never again be a war between EU countries,” he said. 
His suggestion, however, received a cool response from NATO. Loading ...",0
10178,Moving Your Computer Off Grid,"Carmela Tyrell November 1, 2016 Moving Your Computer Off Grid 
More than a few preppers feel that as long as they can provide food, shelter, water, and basic medical needs for themselves and their families, nothing more is required. Other preppers may feel that self defense, power generation, education, and machine repair are skills that will be required in the post crisis world. 
Sadly, many preppers and also off-gridders tend to ignore or underestimate the need to have a computer that can be used to help make it easier to survive. 
In all likelihood, these are also the people most likely to have serious problems in the post crisis world because they do not have a computer available to help meet a range of goals. 
Computers and Prepping Can Get Along 
A computer cannot hunt a deer for you, boil water, or make a pair of shoes, obviously. On the other hand, any computer with a connection to the internet can help you find out how to do these things and much more. When you find good information, it is also very easy to store those files on your computer so that you can read them and work with them whenever you want. 
And if you are in a situation where internet access is still available, you can use your computer to contact friends and loved ones as well as people that might be able to help you get through a crisis. Then you can certainly relate to the quandary of many preppers that are finding out it is becoming impossible to make or obtain raw materials that would be needed in a major crisis scenario. 
On the other side of the equation, many of the items you need for basic prepping can still be purchased online. All you really need is a prepaid debit card and an internet connection so that you can find websites where you can place your orders. Not only will you be able to get the supplies you need, you will also have a much wider selection of other goods to choose from. 
Regardless of whether you are interested in the best quality gun cleaning kits, need a certain type of fishing reel, or need good quality vintage hand tools, you can find them all online. In fact, even if you are disabled, you may be able to find customized materials and tools that have been modified to meet your needs. 
Most people don’t realize just how important it is to network with preppers from diverse geographic regions and make plans for bugging out that include those friends and connections. Consider what would happen if an earthquake or hurricane strikes your area. 
If you only have friends and family in a local, or small area, chances are everyone will be affected. If you have friends in other states that might be able to offer temporary shelter or help you make a new start, then you will be well ahead of the game. 
In these times and beyond, both money and barter systems are vital for exchanging needed goods and services. A computer is very important for expanding your trade and marketing options. It is also very important for securing alternative currencies that may play a vital role in remaining solvent in the face of currency collapse. 
Most people would be truly amazed at how easy it is for the average consumer to secure foreign currencies, keep a good supply of them, and even use them as down and dirty form of currency trading or flipping. 
The Tough Choice on the Best Device(s) 
Obsolete devices may still be very useful because certain older technologies are easier to work with and may be safer than newer devices that are routinely overclocked or are based on unstable hardware platforms. 
If you are interested in newer devices, here are some categories, brands, and models that you can start off with for each category of device: 
Desktops 
If you are primarily interested in a conventional desktop computer, my own experience leads me to believe the best option is to build the computer yourself so that you know exactly what parts are being used and how best to optimize the BIOS (this is where you can determine how fast the computer will run, whether or not the system can boot from a USB drive, and other aspects of basic operation) settings. 
Since modern computer chips tend to run hot, it is very important to provide plenty of ventilation and cooling options inside the case. If your CPU and motherboard kit come with sub-par heat conducting gel, do not hesitate to find the best on the market. It is also very useful to add extra fans and other cooling devices right inside the case. 
Always remember, the cooler you can keep the chips during operation, the lower your chances of erratic freeze-ups or even ruining the chips. 
Insofar as other vital parts such as hard drives, CD/DVD drives, and video cards, it truly depends on your personal tastes. 
You will need a dedicated video card to gain access to these specialized chips that will reduce wear on the CPU and enhance computer performance at the same time. Be sure to study gamer forums and video editing forums to find out which video cards work best with specific CPU and motherboard combinations. A bad fit between these parts can truly be a disaster. 
Memory cards (RAM) are yet another tricky, yet vital area of the computer that you will need to think about. This is also one area where only the best will do. It is better to go with the fastest cards that the motherboard will take, and also from the best rated vendor. 
Laptops 
Unlike desktop computers, you will have far less control over what parts are found inside the case. Before purchasing a laptop, be sure to find out the model number of the CPU and motherboard. From there, you will need to look up the chipsets to find out what the optimal clock speeds are. 
I have seen more than one laptop burn up at around the 1 year mark because a sub-part mother board with a slower timing chip was paired with a faster CPU. Since most buyers do not ask about the motherboard model, there was no way for them to find out that they basically had an overclocked system that was going to fail very quickly. 
Overall, I can safely say that I don’t recommend spending 3 – 4 times as much money on a laptop when I can choose a much cheaper tablet and optimize it with less intensive apps. The only advantage a laptop might have over an off grid tablet is that it is easier to customize the programs. 
Tablets 
An unlocked tablet will give you just about everything you need for basic document access and communicating with others. You can also choose apps that will enable you to create your own apps and carry out other more complex tasks. 
Tablets also have the advantage of taking far less power than a desktop or laptop computer. They can easily be recharged on a portable solar pack, and it is also fairly easy to bypass the battery. 
Insofar as brand names, I tend to favor Lenovo, but have also found Alldaymall tablets to work well. The Alldaymall tablets are also a good bit cheaper, so you can purchase more of them and put them in your bug out bag as well as other locations. 
Smart Phones 
When it comes to a comfortable viewing experience combined with relatively low power usage, larger tablets will work much better than smart phones. That being said, in a “something is better than nothing” or a vital tool for your EDC, few things can rival a good quality unlocked smart phone. 
While I recommend a 10” tablet for bug out gear, a 5” smart phone is truly more than enough for EDC. Not only a phone this size fit easily into a purse or backpack, it is even easier to power than a larger tablet. 
They also work well for reading a range of documents and will give you a good sized window for viewing videos. You can also hook up a folding keyboard and be able to carry out a number of tasks that would be difficult using the screen keyboard. 
The Challenge on Providing a Steady Source of Power 
Today, the vast majority of computers have sub par power supplies that make them more susceptible than ever to fluctuations in power coming into the system. 
As our electric grid continues to crumble, rolling blackouts, brownouts, and line voltage fluctuations caused by excess usage during peak hours will shorten the life cycle of many computers. If you are generating your own power, it is just as important to make sure you know how to keep the current going into your computer as steady as possible. 
There are some things you can do now, as well as consider when building a power system that will help you get the most out of every computer that you own. CLICK HERE to subscribe to Survivopedia’s newsletter and get the free report on how to take your computer off grid. 
Understanding the Impact of Utilization 
No discussion about preparing your computer hardware for off gridding would be complete without at least touching on the resource cost involved in each program that you run on the system. For example, if you have a simple word processor program with no fancy graphics, it will take up far less processor and memory resources than one that has funny critters dancing around all over the place. 
Apps that automatically play videos or programs that automatically play music also shorten the hardware life of your computer. Therefore, when it comes to choosing the best computer for your off grid or prepping needs, it is always important to study benchmark tests and hardware longevity tests under certain loads. 
Once again, you will find some of the best and most accurate information in the gaming forums. 
Important Parts to Keep On hand 
For each device in your EDC, bug out bag, or other location, there are some important parts that can help double or even triple the useful lifespan of your computer. Even if you lose some functionality, the main parts should still work for 2 – 3 decades on desktop units, and up to 10 years on laptops, tablets, and smart phones. Start off by buying all of your devices brand new and with the maximum warranty available. If something breaks down during the warranty period, let the manufacturer or repair center take care of the problem. Buy at least 3 to 5 non-functioning devices that are compatible with the make and model of each device. Usually, you can pick these units up for around 10 to 20% of the cost of a brand new device. You can choose different manufacturers as long as the parts are fully interchangeable with your device. You will use these devices to learn how to make repairs, and also for spare parts if something breaks down on your main device. Since RAM chips take the most abuse on any computer system, keep a few spare ones on hand. Have at least one extra power supply for desktop units. Unlike other parts of the system, you should never open up the case on the power supply unless you have a good bit of experience working with electronic devices. Never forget that the capacitors inside these power supplies may not be fully discharged, and that touching them or a live circuit can cause death or severe injury. Keep at least 2 USB hubs handy that also have the capacity to power any device you hook up to them. When connecting devices to the USB ports on your computer, try to never at least one pair of ports. 
What Happens When the Battery Dies? 
If you have been thinking about using a smart phone or tablet as a place to store important survival information, you may hesitate because you know that the battery can easily be ruined by over charging , or that it will wear out sooner rather than later. 
While some devices will continue to work while the battery is “charging”, others will not. If you have a device that will not work while charging, you will need to remove the battery and apply current directly to the device. 
In this scenario, you must know how to keep the voltage and amperage as stable as possible before they reach the device. You can make your own controllers for this purpose then hook them up to solar panels or anything else that you will be using as a power source. 
Just remember that you power controller may also need to go safely from AC to DC current as well as match the voltage and amperage needs of the device. If you aren’t sure how much power to provide for laptops, tablets, or smart phones, just go by what the battery is rated for. Video first seen on PrepareForTheUnexpected . 
Basic Toolkit 
It will not be of much use to have plenty of parts on hand, and then no way to install them or make good use of them. Here are the most essential tools you will need for building computers or making repairs: chip extractors for chips that are installed in sockets high heat conducting gel precision and larger size screwdriver kit magnifying glass low wattage solder iron, solder, and flux suitable for computer parts desoldering bulb",0
10179,"Navy, Marines Make Sharing Private Nude Photos a Crime Following Scandal - Breitbart","Posting nude pictures of servicemen and women without consent is now a crime in the U. S. Marine Corps and Navy following a nude photo sharing scandal. [“An interim revision to Navy regulations prohibits Navy and Marine Corps personnel from posting intimate photos ‘if the person making the distribution or broadcast does so without legal justification or excuse,’” reported the Navy Times on Wednesday. “The statute details three conditions that will be considered a violation of Navy regulations, including if images are broadcast or transmitted: ‘with the intent to realize personal gain with the intent to humiliate, harm, harass, intimidate, threaten, or coerce the depicted person or with reckless disregard as to whether the depicted person would be humiliated, harmed, intimidated, threatened, or coerced,’ the regs read. ”  The new rules, which were reportedly signed off by Acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley, are also set to begin immediately. “It is characterized as interim until the next edition of Navy regulations is printed,” the Navy Times explained, adding that those who ignore the new regulations could be charged with “failure to obey a lawful order. ” “The addition of Article 1168 ‘Nonconsensual distribution or broadcasting of an image’ to Navy Regulations serves to underscore leadership’s commitment to eliminating degrading behaviors that erode trust and weaken the Navy and Marine Corps Team,” said Rear Adm. Dawn Cutler in a statement. “It provides commanders another tool to maintain good order and discipline by holding Sailors and Marines accountable for inappropriate conduct in the nonconsensual sharing of intimate imagery. “This article adds the potential charge of Article 92 ‘Failure to obey [an] order or regulation’ to the possible charges that can be used against an alleged perpetrator,” he continued. “Each case of alleged misconduct will be evaluated on its own facts and circumstances. ” In March, it was reported that both the NCIS and the Pentagon had launched an investigation into the scandal, which saw the distribution of “explicit photos of current and former female Marines and other service members” through a Facebook group. “A private Facebook group called ‘Marines United’ contained a link to a Google Drive folder, where the photos were being stored,” reported CNN last month. “Members on the site solicited others to submit photos of women without their knowledge. The cloud storage folder has been removed at the request of the military. ” “It was not clear to the Defense Department how many current and former Marines may be involved in potential wrongdoing,” they continued. “A former Marine originally brought the matter to the attention of the Marine Corps last month. ” Since the beginning of the scandal, the private images have spread across different parts of the internet and were even reportedly found up for sale on the dark web earlier this month.

10182,Trump Can Put Obamacare into Death Spiral on May 22 - Breitbart,"Obamacare will go into a death spiral on May 22 if the Trump administration chooses not to continue fighting in court to preserve   subsidies that were ruled illegal last year.  On May 12, 2016, U. S. District Court Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled House v. Burwell that the Obama Administration’s payment of   subsidies without congressional approval was a violation of the Constitution’s Appropriations Clause. The Obama odministration appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia District, where it was renamed House v. Price to reflect the current Secretary of Health and Human Services. Monday, May 22 is the last day for the Trump administration to give notice to the Appellate Court if it wants to continue the appeal. If Trump drops the appeal and ends the illegal   subsidies, Obamacare Silver Plan healthcare premiums will jump by 19 percent. But the national average for Obamacare Silver Plan patient deductibles would also more than quadruple from $709, to $3, 064, according to the amicus brief filed by America’s largest hospital groups. The   Congress was happy to pass Obamacare’s radical expansion of social justice entitlements, but had little interest in appropriating a $7 billion subsidy for healthcare insurance companies that saw their stock price triple under Obamacare. President Obama then directed the IRS to make “Section 142 Offset Program” payments to   insurers from the collection of penalties, fees and legal judgments against taxpayers. Congressman Ron Paul ( ) warned in 2010 that the IRS would hire up to 16, 500 new agents to increase audits to generate more penalties and fees to subsidize Obamacare. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare are expected to release their “Proposed Health Insurance Rate Increases for the 2018 Coverage Year” on June 1. Obamacare premiums have increased by double digits each year since 2015, and 73 insurers announced last year that they were withdrawing from the program. As a result, many rural areas of the U. S. now only have one provider that can charge any rate it chooses. According to the authoritative ACASignups. net blog, that closely follows state healthcare premium increase requests by insurers in each state, Virginia is looking at a 42. 6 percent increase Maryland a 22. 6 percent increase Oregon a 17 percent increase and Connecticut a 13. 9 percent increase. Covered California, the Golden State’s Obamacare exchange, has been mum on what type of premium increase its participating insurers will ask for. But the San Francisco Business Journal reported that the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine estimated that Covered California healthcare premiums for 2018 would rise between 28 and 49 percent, not including the 19 percent added cost if the Trump administration drops the illegal   appeal. The hospital groups’ argument to the Appeals Court is that without the court allowing illegal   subsidies, Obamacare will go into a “death spiral. ”",0
10183,"Indian Woman Sold, Tortured After Entering Saudi Arabia on Housemaid Visa","A woman from India was sold to her immigration sponsor for an estimated $4, 700 after she entered Saudi Arabia on a housemaid visa and is being tortured by her captor, her daughter tells the Times of India (TOI). [“My mother is in trouble in Saudi. She wants to return home, but her Kafeel [visa sponsor] is not allowing her to get back here,” Sameena Begum, the victim’s daughter, told TOI.  Her daughter revealed that the victim “is facing mental and physical harassment at the hands of her kafeel (sponsor) in Saudi Arabia,” points the Indian news outlet. “The torture started when she denied to a contract marriage with her Kafeel in Saudi Arabia. She, however, informed me sending a message that she was sold by agents. So the Kafeel does not want to send her back,” added the daughter, noting that her mother told her she was sold for 3 lakh, or 300, 000 rupees (about $4, 700). Sameena’s mother has been identified as Salma Begum, 39, a resident of Babanagar, a suburb of Hyderabad in India’s Telangana state. “I am trying all efforts to bring my mother back home. I kindly request Telangana and central governments to bring my mother back to India,” implored Sameena, noting that her Salma is asking New Delhi to intervene on her behalf. In January, Salma was reportedly taken to Saudi Arabia on a housemaid visa by two local Indian agents identified only as Akram and Shafi. “I even met Akram requesting him to get my mother back, but he did nothing so far. We went to [the local] Kanchanbagh police station, but the police appear to be unmoved by the matter and have not taken any action so far,’’ noted the daughter. Although Indian authorities are aware of Akram and Shafi’s involvement, they have failed to take action against them. Salma traveled to Saudi Arabia in search of greater financial security, Salma is reportedly the second woman to be deceived into going into the Sunni Saudi kingdom ruled by strict Islamic rules where authorities are known to broadly infringe women’s rights. “The GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries   Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE  —   manage its ‘temporary’ migrant workforce through the sponsorship or Kafala system,” explains TOI. “Under this system, a local citizen or local company (the kafeel) must sponsor foreign workers in order for their work visas and residency to be valid. ” “This means that an individual’s right to work and legal presence in the host country is dependent on his or her employer, rendering him or her vulnerable to exploitation,” it adds.",0
10184,Tripp - If I Had Leaked To Drudge Clinton Might Have Been Removed From Presidency,"During a radio interview, Linda Tripp, once the chief cooperating witness to the Independent Counsel probing whether Bill Clinton committed impeachable offenses, said that she deeply regrets not leaking details about various Clinton scandals to Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport. com. [She explained that leaking to Drudge may have resulted in a different outcome for the impeachment investigation, which was led by   Counsel Kenneth Starr, possibly leading to Clinton’s removal from office.  She was speaking on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Tripp stated: “As a cooperating witness, and at that point I was the chief cooperating witness, I didn’t even question abiding by their requirements. That I speak to no one. That I was solely and one hundred percent their witness. Since I believed they had the intention of unearthing all of the scandal and all of the corruption that I had witnessed I was eager and willing to do so. ” She explained that leaking to Drudge may have changed the course of the impeachment probe: What I regret now in retrospect was allowing the entire media during that time and the Clinton machine in concert to define not only me but the Independent Counsel and everyone else as being the bad guys. I should have been leaking to Drudge on a daily basis. He was the only one at that point trying to get out the truth. The only entity trying to get out the truth. The rest of the media, their aim at that point was to cover the story, yes.  But to find a way to make Bill Clinton the victim. And to do that they needed to essentially vilify me and anyone, including the Independent Counsel, that would dare go after him. So yeah, I regret not going to Drudge. I think the whole story would have had a different outcome had I done that. Tripp explained that she fully cooperated with the Independent Counsel, serving at once point as the chief cooperating witness, because she believed the investigation would expand its probe into other alleged Clinton misdeeds beyond the issue of whether the president lied under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.  Instead, the impeachment investigation zeroed in on the Lewinsky issue only  —   on one account of perjury and another on obstruction of justice. Clinton was impeached in the House but the Senate did not reach the   majority vote required for impeachment. Tripp’s front row seat during her White House days afforded her access to some inside stories on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she says she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster’s office the morning after the Deputy White House Counsel was found dead in an apparent suicide. During the Clinton administration, Tripp first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton’s Oval Office. After three months, Tripp was asked to work for the White House Counsel’s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons for their infamous alleged misdeeds.  Tripp’s office was located adjacent to Hillary Clinton’s. In an interview with this reporter last October, Dave Schippers, who served as the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee’s probe into whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses, also revealed that he wanted the focus to expand beyond the Lewinsky issue. Schippers alleged that outside forces put the brakes on the expansion of the probe: When we started our investigation, Henry Hyde said, “How wide do you want to go?” And I said, “Get us an open investigation. We have so many things that we want to investigate. ” And we got an open investigation where we were permitted to investigate as far as whatever came up in the impeachment inquiry. Immediately after the 1998 election, the leadership in the House put the brakes on. We had a meeting and Henry Hyde said the House has told us that we’ve got Monica Lewinsky and we can go no further. We are not permitted to do any additional investigation. And I said, “My God, we’ve got at least three murders and other things that we are going into. ” And he says, “I’m sorry we can’t do it. ” Schippers described the room at the Ford House Office Building where the evidence was housed during the impeachment probe as having armed guards outside. He said those who were permitted to enter were not allowed to bring anything in or out. He said he was one of the few people who actually reviewed all of the evidence in the impeachment case. He added that only 65 House members accepted an invitation to review the evidence in the room and that all senators declined before they voted against impeaching Clinton. Asked about the specifics of the evidence, Schippers said he was barred from answering the question. However, he replied, “Let me say this.   Congressmen saw that evidence. And 64 voted to impeach. Take your own conclusion. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

10185,Brigham Young Students Who Report Sexual Assault Won’t Face Honor Code Sanctions - The New York Times,"Brigham Young University announced on Wednesday that it would spare students who report sexual assaults from facing punishment for violations of its honor code, such as drinking or extramarital sex, that may have happened near or at the time of the assault. The university called the handling of sexual assault reporting “a complicated and evolving issue” and said in a report released on Wednesday that offering amnesty from potential sanctions would help encourage students to report   crimes. “We do not have all the answers to this problem, which is a nationwide issue affecting all colleges and universities,” the university’s president, Kevin J. Worthen, said in an email to students and faculty and staff members. “But this report provides an excellent framework on which to build. ” The   report, researched and drafted by a   advisory council starting in May, came after news accounts that the   university in Provo, Utah, had investigated students for possible honor code violations after they reported being sexually assaulted. Some experts in law and gender issues on college campuses called that approach troubling. The cases set off a torrent of online criticism as well as a protest on campus in April. The code, known as the Church Educational System Honor Code, is the cornerstone of the university’s philosophy, directing students and faculty and staff members toward “moral virtues encompassed in the gospel of Jesus Christ,” and emphasizing chastity, honesty and virtue. It requires modest dress on campus, discourages consensual sex outside marriage and, among other things, prohibits drinking, drug use,   intimacy and indecency, as well as sexual misconduct. The recommendations about amnesty will need to be reviewed and approved by three separate advisory councils, but the proposal will be in effect in the meantime, Julie Valentine, an assistant professor in the College of Nursing and a member of the group that worked on the report, said in an interview on Wednesday. As for whether the amnesty might encourage false reports of sexual assault to cover for possible code violations, Professor Valentine said the group had few concerns about that possibility. She said the overriding mission was to do whatever possible to encourage victims to report, adding that a 2008 study in Utah found that only 12 percent of victims come forward.",0
10186,Fukushima Cover Up,"Email 
It is literally impossible for the world community to get a clear understanding of, and truth about, the Fukushima nuclear disaster. This statement is based upon The Feature article in Columbia Journalism Review (“CJR”) d/d October 25, 2016 entitled: “Sinking a Bold Foray Into Watchdog Journalism in Japan” by Martin Fackler. 
The scandalous subject matter of the article is frightening to its core. Essentially, it paints a picture of upending and abolishing a 3-year attempt by one of Japan’s oldest and most liberal/intellectual newspapers, The Asahi Shimbun (circ. 6.6 mln) in its effort of “watchdog journalism” of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In the end, the newspaper’s special watchdog division suffered un-preannounced abrupt closure. 
The CJR article, whether intentionally or not, is an indictment of right wing political control of media throughout the world. The story is, moreover, extraordinarily scary and of deepest concern because no sources can be counted on for accurate, truthful reporting of an incident as powerful and deadly dangerous as the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima. Lest anybody in class forgets, three nuclear reactors at Fukushima Diiachi Nuclear Power Plant experienced 100% meltdown, aka The China Syndrome over five years ago. 
The molten cores of those reactors melted down to a stage called corium, which is a lumpy hunk of irradiating radionuclides so deadly that robotic cameras are zapped! The radioactivity is powerful, deadly and possessed of frightening longevity, 100s of years. Again for those who missed class, TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) has no idea where those masses of sizzling hot radioactive goo are today. Did they burrow into the ground? Nobody knows, but it is known that those blobs of radioactivity are extraordinarily dangerous, as in deathly, erratically spewing radioactivity “who knows where”? 
Fukushima is a national/worldwide emergency that is the worst kept secret ever because everybody knows it is happening; it is current; it is alive; it is deadly; it has killed (as explained in several prior articles) and will kill many more as well as maim countless people over many decades (a description of radiation’s gruesomeness follows later on in this article). 
Yet, the Abe administration is talking to Olympic officials about conducting Olympic events, like baseball, in Fukushima for Tokyo 2020. Are they nuts, going off the deep end, gone mad, out of control? After all, TEPCO readily admits (1) the Fukushima cleanup will take decades to complete, if ever completed, and (2) nobody knows the whereabouts of the worlds most deadly radioactive blobs of sizzling hot masses of death and destruction, begging the question: Why is there a Chernobyl Exclusion Zone of 1,000 square miles after one nuclear meltdown 30 years ago, but yet Fukushima, with three meltdowns, each more severe than Chernobyl, is already being repopulated? It doesn’t compute! 
The short answer is the Abe administration claims the radioactivity is being cleaned up. A much longer answer eschews the Abe administration by explaining the near impossibility of cleaning up radioactivity throughout the countryside. There are, after all, independent organizations with boots on the ground in Fukushima (documented in prior articles) that tell the truth, having measured dangerous levels of radiation throughout the region where clean up crews supposedly cleaned up. 
The Columbia Journalism Review article, intentionally or not, paints a picture of “journalism by government decree” in Japan, which gainsays any kind of real journalism. It’s faux journalism, kinda like reading The Daily Disneyworld Journal & Times. 
Based upon the CJR article: “The hastiness of the Asahi’s retreat raised fresh doubts about whether such watchdog journalism— an inherently risky enterprise that seeks to expose and debunk, and challenge the powerful—is even possible in Japan’s big national media, which are deeply tied to the nation’s political establishment.” 
Japan’s journalists belong to “press clubs,” which are exclusively restricted to the big boys (and girls) from major media outlets, where stories are hand-fed according to government officialdom, period. It is the news, period! No questions asked, and this is how Asahi got into trouble. They set up a unit of 30-journalists to tell the truth about Fukushima and along the way won awards for journalism, until it suddenly, abruptly stopped. A big mystery ensues…. 
According to the CJR article, “The Investigative Reporting Section [Asahi] proved an instant success, winning Japan’s top journalism award two years in a row for its exposure of official cover-ups and shoddy decontamination work around the nuclear plant.” 
Furthermore, according to the CJR article: “The abrupt about-face by the Asahi, a 137-year-old newspaper with 2,400 journalists that has been postwar Japan’s liberal media flagship, was an early victory for the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which had sought to silence critical voices as it moved to roll back Japan’s postwar pacifism, and restart its nuclear industry.” 
And, furthermore, the truth be told: “In Japanese journalism, scoops usually just mean learning from the ministry officials today what they intend to do tomorrow,’ says Makoto Watanabe, a former reporter in the section who quit the Asahi in March because he felt blocked from doing investigative reporting. ‘We came up with different scoops that were unwelcome in the Prime Minister’s Office.” 
It comes as no surprise that Reporters Without Borders lowered Japan’s rating from 11th in 2010 (but one has to wonder how they ever got that high) to 72nd in this years annual ranking of global press freedoms, released on April 20, 2016. 
Koichi Nakano, a professor of politics at Sophia University in Tokyo, says: “Emasculating the Asahi allowed Abe to impose a grim new conformity on the media world.” 
When considering the awards Asahi won during its short foray into investigative journalism, like Japan’s equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for reporting about a gag-order on scientists after the Fukushima disaster and the government’s failure to release information about radiation to evacuating residents, now that Asahi has been forced to put a lid on “investigative journalism” and it must toe the line in “press clubs,” any and all information about the dangers or status of Fukushima are ipso facto suspect! 
The world is dead silent on credible information about the world’s biggest disaster! (Which causes one to stop and think… really a lot.) 
The evidence is abundantly clear that there is no trustworthy source of information about the world’s biggest nuclear disaster, and likely one of the biggest dangers to the planet in human history. However, time will tell as radiation exposure takes years to show up in the human body. It’s a silent killer but cumulates over time. Fukushima radiation goes on and on, but nobody knows what to do. To say the situation is scandalous is such a gross understatement that it is difficult to take it as seriously as it really should be taken. But, it is scandalous, not just in Japan but for the entire planet. 
After all, consider this, 30 years after the fact, horribly deformed Chernobyl Children are found in over 300 asylums in the Belarus backwoods deep in the countryside. Equally as bad but maybe more odious, as of today, Chernobyl radiation (since 1986) is already affecting 2nd generation kids. 
According to USA Today, Chernobyl’s Legacy: Kids With Bodies Ravaged by Disaster, April 17, 2016: “There are 2,397,863 people registered with Ukraine’s health ministry to receive ongoing Chernobyl-related health care. Of these, 453,391 are children — none born at the time of the accident. Their parents were children in 1986. These children have a range of illnesses: respiratory, digestive, musculoskeletal, eye diseases, blood diseases, cancer, congenital malformations, genetic abnormalities, trauma.” 
It’s taken 30 years for the world, via an article in USA Today, to begin to understand how devastating, over decades, not over a few years, radiation exposure is to people. It is a silent killer that cumulates in the body over time and passes from generation to generation to generation, endless destruction that cannot be stopped!",0
10187,Pacific Islanders may have DNA of unknown human species,"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © Guido Amrein Switzerland/Shutterstock Melanesian children of Papua New Guinea Hints of an unidentified, extinct human species have been found in the DNA of modern Melanesians - those living in a region of the South Pacific, northeast of Australia. According to new genetic modelling, the species is unlikely to be Neanderthal or Denisovan - two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record - but could represent a third, unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists. ""We're missing a population, or we're misunderstanding something about the relationships,"" Ryan Bohlender, a statistical geneticist from the University of Texas, told Tina Hesman Saey at Science News. Bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid DNA that modern humans still carry today, and say they've found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn't the whole story. It's thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of Africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass. This contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes. And that's not all they've given us. Earlier this year, researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals , and found that they're associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression, heart attack, and a number of skin disorders. And a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts - otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) - were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa. While our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the Denisovans - the distant cousins of Neanderthals - is less clear. The problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia, but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008 . Using a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans, Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent. That result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. But when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia - a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, West Papua, and the Maluku Islands. As Hesman Saey explains for Science News: ""Europeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry, and people in China have a tiny amount - 0.1 percent, according to Bohlender's calculations. But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals. And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. While investigating the Denisovan discrepancy, Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians."" ""Human history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,"" he told her. This find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, who analysed DNA from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 locals from the Papua New Guinea highlands. As we reported last month, this was the most comprehensive genetic study of Indigenous Australians to date, and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth, dating back more than 50,000 years ago. But the results revealed something else - DNA that was very similar to that of the Denisovans, but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third, unidentified hominid . ""Who this group is we don't know,"" lead researcher Eske Willerslev told Hesman Saey. Until we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesised third human species (some fossils would be nice), we can't prove this , and we should point out that Bohlender's estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed , so they might shift with further scrutiny. And it could be that our identification of Denisovan DNA is more ambiguous than we think, given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth. But the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we'd assumed, which shouldn't be much of a surprise, when you think about it. Just because we don't see them in the fossil record doesn't mean they didn't exist - preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn't easy, and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up. Hopefully, the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies, the more hints we'll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn't make it to modern times. The results of Bohlender's analysis were presented last week at the 2016 American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Canada.",0
10188,Canada Receives Record Numbers of Mexican Asylum Seekers After Trudeau’s Welcome Tweet,"This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics. com,  Migrants board ‘La Bestia’ (The Beast) in southern Mexico to travel to the US border. (AP, 2014) According to a new report by Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières  —   MSF) an estimated 500, 000 migrants cross the border from Central America into Mexico each year. Many of these migrants are fleeing violence in what MSF calls the Northern Triangle of Central America (NCTA) consisting of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. However, their countries of origin are not limited to those in Central America. In just a few days in September of last year, there was a surge of almost 5, 000 Haitian, African and Asian migrants entering by Mexico’s southern border. None of these migrants requested permission to stay in Mexico, as they all wanted to reach the United States. The huge sudden surge of migrants overwhelmed officials at US border crossings in California. Most migrants enter Mexico in the hope of continuing through Mexico to the United States. The MSF says that as they travel through Mexico, they are often victimized by kidnapping, extortion, rape, assault, torture and murder by criminal organizations, often with the tacit approval of Mexican authorities. 68. 3 percent of migrants and refugees surveyed by MSF reported having been victims of violence on the transit route to the United States. In 2014, under pressure from the United States, Mexico instituted increasingly harsh   measures in the form of Plan Frontera Sur, a Mexican crackdown on border security funded in part by the U. S. This change in Mexico’s policy has substantially increased the likelihood that the refugees will face violence, since the crackdown forces refugees to depend on human traffickers and travel on underground routes operated with impunity by organized crime. In February, during the first month of Donald Trump’s administration, Mexican officials met with US military officials to try to find common ground on immigration and other issues. The relationship between the United States and Mexico has become strained after president Trump vowed to build a wall between the two countries to keep out illegal immigrants, drug dealers and criminals and make Mexico pay for it. Details of the meeting were not released. To resolve the humanitarian crisis, MSF calls on governments across the region  —   mainly El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Canada, and the US  —   to ensure better alternatives to detention and deportation to countries of origin where they’ll be once again subject to violence. These countries should increase their formal resettlement and family reunification quotas. Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières  —   MSF) and Reuters ( ) and AP (  ) and iPolitics (Canada) Related Articles, Mexicans are seeking asylum in Canada at a rate four times greater than in 2016. The first three months of 2017 already saw more cases recorded than in the entire year 2016. One reason for the surge is president Trump’s travel ban, announced in January, which raised concern in refugees that they might be prevented from entering the United States. Instead of trying to cross the border into the US, they get on a plane that takes them to the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia, in Canada. The second reason is that Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau invited them in. In 2016, Trudeau eliminated a visa requirement, imposed in 2008, for Mexicans traveling to Canada. The visa requirement sharply reduced the number of migrants, until it was lifted. In addition, Trudeau decided to react to Trump’s travel ban by tweeting the following on January 28: To those fleeing persecution, terror  war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength[1] #WelcomeToCanada, Trudeau’s tweet was followed by a picture of him greeting a refugee family. The two tweets garnered over a million likes and    retweets. The Canadian government has threatened to reinstate the visa requirement, and has told the Mexican government that it will do so if asylum claims continue to increase.

When most people think about their eye health , the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses. Although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health, there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about. For example, there are a staggering 56 common disorders that can plague your eyes. These issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines. Fortunately, there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy. 
Nutrients Your Eyes Need 
There are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes: Lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin. Each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals. As Natural News has pointed out before, free radicals are the main basis of all injuries, illnesses and deaths. 
Antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals, so it’s a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye. But what happens when something interrupts this process? Sadly, you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness. 
Instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen, you can be proactive and start taking supplements. The good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find. Research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain meso-zeaxanthin, although this isn’t usually disclosed on the label. In fact, it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin. 
Of course, this doesn’t absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not meso-zeaxanthin is present in their products. However, their negligence also doesn’t reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients. In addition to stocking up on these supplements, it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants, including Vitamin E, Vitamin C and beta carotene. 
Food Sources 
There are many foods that contain antioxidants . Carrots are perhaps the most well-known resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene. It would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource, though. You can also turn to oranges, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins. These are some of the best foods for eye health. Even better, you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs, pistachios, corn, peppers and kale. With enough of these food items in your diet, you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy. 
Additional Eye Health Tips 
If you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health, now is a good time to carefully consider quitting. Unfortunately, people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration, optic nerve damage and cataracts. If you begin abstaining from tobacco products now, though, your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline. 
Other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible. If you use a computer for work, take a 20 second vision break every 20 minutes. 
Ultimately, combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life. If you’re currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss, you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises. This is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses. As usual, the natural way is better!

10191,The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to ’84 Olympics - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Late in 1983, months before they announced a boycott of the Los Angeles Olympics, sports officials of the Soviet Union sent detailed instructions to the head of the nation’s track and field team. Oral steroid tablets were not enough, they said, to ensure dominance at the Games. The team should also inject its top athletes with three other kinds of anabolic steroids. Providing precise measurements and timetables for the doping regimens, the officials said they had a sufficient supply of the banned substances on hand at the Research Institute of Physical Culture and Sports in Moscow, a division of the government’s sports committee. The potent drugs were critical to keeping up with the competition, they wrote in the instructions. The document  —   obtained by The New York Times from a former chief medical doctor for Soviet track and field  —   was signed by Dr. Sergei Portugalov, a Soviet sports doctor who went on to capitalize on a growing interest in new methods of doping. Now, more than 30 years later, Dr. Portugalov is a central figure in Russia’s current doping scandal. Last fall, the World   Agency named him as a key broker of   drugs in Russia, someone who in recent years injected athletes personally and made a business of covering up drug violations in exchange for money. Revelations of the recent schemes, which antidoping authorities said dated back at least a decade, compelled the international governing body for track and field to bar Russia’s team from the Rio Games, the most severe doping penalty in Olympic history. At the track and field events here this week, no one will represent Russia, a nation that is usually a fixture on the medals podium. The 1983 document and the account of Dr. Grigory Vorobiev, the former chief medical doctor, who spent more than three decades with the Soviet track team, provide new evidence of how far back Russia’s   doping stretches. At 86 years old, Dr. Vorobiev still stands more than six feet tall. Before finishing medical school in St. Petersburg, then known as Leningrad, he played for the Soviet Development Basketball Team in the 1950s, choosing not to pursue a professional athletic career because he thought it unstable. He was coached, he noted proudly, by the man who later led the Soviet Union to an upset victory over the United States at the 1972 Olympics. His career in Russian sports medicine lasted through the 1990s. In deteriorating health, Dr. Vorobiev left Moscow five years ago for Chicago, where his son and grandchildren live. Over two days of interviews there, in an   complex with   newspapers lying around the lobby, Dr. Vorobiev wore a blue Soviet tracksuit with “CCCP” on the back as he recounted his career. He spoke at the encouragement of his son, who had accompanied him to the hospital in recent weeks and said he wanted his father’s life documented in light of the recent doping revelations. Dr. Vorobiev, speaking Russian that was translated by his son, recalled some details more vividly than others, relying on journals, documents and    photographs of athletes in motion to trigger memories dating to 1959, when he was hired as one of the Soviet Union’s first   sports doctors. He specialized in improving coordination, strength and flexibility among elite athletes, with expertise in foot injuries. With little emotion, he described a system in which winning at any cost without getting caught was paramount. He projected loyalty to his country while plainly wrestling with contradictions: As a member of the medical commission of track and field’s global governing body, he policed doping at international competitions while knowing that many of Russia’s top athletes were using banned substances. Russia’s sports ministry and sports science institute did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment. Dr. Vorobiev said he was not sure whether the doping scheme detailed in the 1983 document was carried out. Regardless, the communication captures the   mentality of the nation’s sports committee, which he said intensified over time as athletes became preoccupied with drugs. By the 1970s, he said, most of the several hundred athletes with whom he worked were asking about   drugs, particularly after traveling to international competitions. When athletes sought advice in individual consultations, he said, he told them to take “as low a dose as possible,” cautioning them to watch for cramps or changes in voice as signs that they had overdone it. Most of all, he stressed that drugs were not a substitute for rigorous training. Not everyone chose to use illicit substances, he said, defending Soviet sports as not uniformly tainted. He was unable to estimate how many athletes had used drugs, adding that some who had shown drastic physical changes had denied doping during private consultations with him. But low doses of oral steroids were common among top track athletes, Dr. Vorobiev said, asserting that if he had dissuaded them from taking drugs, he would have been blamed for poor results and summarily fired. East Germany, later found to have run an aggressive doping program, was a particular motivator after the 1976 Olympics, in which the country won nearly as many gold medals as the Soviet Union. The antidoping movement was in its infancy at that time the World   Agency, the regulator of drugs in sport, was not created until more than 20 years later. Still, sports officials were conscious of the need to combat drugs at major competitions. Anabolic steroids had been banned by the International Olympic Committee, and testing for them debuted at the 1976 Games, making the regimen that Soviet officials proposed for Los Angeles unambiguously prohibited. Dr. Vorobiev said he had consistently opposed steroid injections  —   typically administered with a shot in the thigh or buttocks. He considered that method too concentrated and too dangerous, he said. The 1983 letter  —   addressed to Dr. Vorobiev’s boss, the head of Soviet track and field  —   cited competition as a main motivation for adding injections to the “special pharmacological profiles” already developed for national athletes following a meeting of the country’s sports committee on Nov. 24, 1983. (The letter was translated independently from the original Russian by The New York Times.) The three additional drugs were Retabolil, Stromba and   forms of the steroids nandrolone decanoate and stanozolol. The officials had enough Retabolil in their possession, they said. “A range of data,” the letter said, “proves that the main opponents of Soviet athletes will use the aforementioned injection form of anabolic steroids at the upcoming Olympic Games. ” The letter  —   signed and archived by Dr. Portugalov, and bearing the signature of a colleague at the Institute for Physical Culture, Roshen D. Seyfulla  —   said that top athletes with chances of winning medals were prime candidates for injections. It suggested paying particular attention to those who had performed well while taking oral steroids. Three to five vials of 50 milligrams each should be injected into those athletes, the officials instructed, with the final doses administered 145 to 157 days before the Olympics. Drawn into the plot, according to the document, was the Soviet antidoping lab, which the officials  —   mindful of Olympic    —   had recruited to determine how long the steroids in question would linger in the system. “There is only one basic reason to reject the injection form  —   the lack of definite data about how much time it takes to clear the body,” the letter said. “We will have the official recommendation and conclusion no later than Dec. 15, 1983,” it continued, suggesting that national sports officials and antidoping authorities were colluding to cover up doping. Such collusion happened in Russia as recently as last year, antidoping investigators said in a report last month, detailing how the national   lab helped formulate special drug cocktails for Russian athletes and covered up drug violations on orders from the country’s sports ministry. In May 1984, about five months after the document outlining a doping plan was circulated, the Soviet Union withdrew from the Los Angeles Games, citing the “  actions of the U. S. authorities and organizers of the Games” in a statement. “Chauvinistic sentiments and an   hysteria are being whipped up in the country,” it said. But the fixation on beating the competition by using banned substances did not end, Dr. Vorobiev said. He described an atmosphere in which winning was supremely important, in which drugs displaced training as the primary method of preparation, and in which Dr. Portugalov’s profile continued to rise. For decades, Dr. Portugalov was a   figure outside Russia. Inside the country, however, he was a “fairly authoritative and very knowledgeable” figure who was not shy about advertising access to the best   substances, according to Dr. Vorobiev. Dr. Vorobiev said that his own philosophy on developing elite athletes was not aligned with that of Dr. Portugalov’s, and that he preserved the document over several decades because he considered it proof of how Dr. Portugalov was masterminding the Soviet   program. Dr. Portugalov came to global prominence in 2014 when two Russian   identified him as a linchpin distributor in Russia’s   doping scheme. Yuliya Stepanova and Vitaly Stepanov, a married couple  —   she a   runner and he a former employee of Russia’s antidoping agency  —   told the German public broadcaster ARD that Dr. Portugalov had provided Ms. Stepanova with   drugs and outlined a tiered payment system whereby he received a   percentage of winnings, depending on whether an athlete won gold, silver or bronze medals. “He bragged to Yuliya that over the past few decades, he had made so many Olympic champions,” Mr. Stepanov said in an interview this summer, describing Dr. Portugalov as “arrogant” and more interested in turning a profit than seeing athletes succeed. An investigation commissioned by the World   Agency confirmed Ms. Stepanova’s account and concluded that Dr. Portugalov’s enterprise stretched much wider. In the wake of a damning report published by the antidoping agency last fall, Dr. Portugalov was suspended from Russian track and field and from his post at Russia’s sports research institute. Dr. Portugalov could not be reached directly by The New York Times. Neither the track organization nor the government institute responded to emailed requests for information about his employment status or ways to reach him. His name is no longer listed on the website of either organization. A spokesman for WADA said the Russian ministry of sport had told the agency that Dr. Portugalov no longer worked for the government. Investigations into his work, meanwhile, are continuing last month, the global governing body for swimming appointed a lawyer to look into claims that Dr. Portugalov provided drugs to Russian swimmers. Richard W. Pound, the former president of the antidoping agency who led last year’s investigation into doping in track and field, called the 1983 document an unsurprising indication of the long history of Russia’s doping program. “It shows the foundation on which a lot of this has been built,” he said. “The system we encountered is not new. It’s a continuation of the Soviet days. ” Russia has responded to the charges of systematic,   doping with a mix of defiance and contrition. President Vladimir V. Putin has criticized scrutiny of the country as being politically motivated, but he has also suspended implicated officials and announced broad efforts to change Russian attitudes toward doping in sport. “It’s a problem of culture and education,” Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said in an interview this summer, noting that he had told Mr. Putin in 2009 that doping was a “black spot” on the country. “Our aim is to have a healthy nation,” Mr. Mutko said. “We’re moving away from the old Soviet legacy. ” Dr. Vorobiev’s career with the national team ended after he was blamed for an athlete’s drug violation in the  . The violation in question, he said, involved the drug Phenotropil, which was used by Russian astronauts and military members to combat fatigue. He is characteristically pragmatic about the terms on which his   tenure ended. “That’s life,” he said, expressing a steady loyalty to the ministry while criticizing people like Dr. Portugalov who, he said, corrupted sports and shifted focus away from skillful coaching. “Am I happy now that the problems have surfaced 20 years later?” he said, referring to his 1996 departure. “It was inevitable. ” Well into his retirement, Dr. Vorobiev remains intensely interested in discussing physical preparations for competition, asking a reporter for her exercise routine. “Do you agree that training is more important than steroids?” he said after four hours of discussing doping, during which he often pounded his fist and foot for emphasis. Dr. Vorobiev is blind in one eye and has weak vision in the other. He rarely turns on the television, which sits atop a small piece of furniture that holds   athletic socks. He did, however, plan to watch the track and field events in Rio this week, and he neither condemned nor condoned the recent doping scandals that had precipitated the ban on Russia’s team. He expressed a statesmanlike support of “the Olympic movement” and of decisions about who could compete. “Obviously, it would be better with Russia,” he said, shrugging    in his Soviet team uniform. “I hope this will be a lesson to train harder, and maybe there will be less steroids as a result. ”",0
10192,"Gunmen Kill Scores of Civilians in Western Ethiopia, Official Says - The New York Times","ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia  —   Gunmen have killed more than 140 civilians near Ethiopia’s western border with South Sudan, an Ethiopian official said on Saturday. The attackers came from South Sudan and killed civilians, including women and children, said Getachew Reda, the communications minister. “The Ethiopian defense force is currently chasing after the perpetrators,” Mr. Reda said, adding that the attackers did not have links to South Sudan’s government or its rebel fighters. “Our defense forces have so far killed 60 members of the attackers,” he said. Mr. Reda added that Ethiopian forces might cross into South Sudan to pursue the gunmen. The attack took place on Friday in Jakawa, in the Gambela region of Ethiopia, and the attackers were members of South Sudan’s Murle tribe, Mr. Reda said. A number of children were abducted and taken into South Sudan, he said. The Gambela region hosts thousands of refugees who fled South Sudan after war broke out there in December 2013. It is also home to armed Ethiopian and South Sudanese groups that attack government installations and soldiers. In the 1980s, the Ethiopian government forcibly resettled hundreds of thousands of people, and the negative effects of those relocations are still felt in many Ethiopian communities, most notably in the Gambela region. In 2004, attackers killed 196 people in the western Gambela region in an outbreak of communal violence.",0
10193,"Donald Trump, After Fits and Starts, Focuses on Foreign Policy - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump embarked on one of the rituals of the American presidency on Thursday, meeting in New York with the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, as he continued his fitful adjustment to the protocols of   diplomacy. “I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,” Mr. Abe said after the meeting at Trump Tower. He described the   encounter as “really cordial. ” The visit with Mr. Abe came after 32 congratulatory phone calls from foreign leaders in the nine days since Mr. Trump won the election. None seem to have adhered to established diplomatic practice, in which the State Department choreographs the sequence of the calls and provides policy guidance and translating services. On Thursday night, the State Department said it was finally in contact with Mr. Trump’s emissaries. But until now, they had not requested any briefings, nor had the  ’s calls  —   including with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other adversaries of the United States  —   been routed through the State Department, as is customary, according to a department official. Mr. Trump’s aides did not respond to questions about whether the   had used his own interpreter in the meeting with Mr. Abe and calls with other leaders, or whether he had relied on interpreters provided by them. “The order that the calls are done in seems like a silly protocol issue. But it’s one that people really think about,” said Loren DeJonge Schulman, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former top aide to the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice. “They are taking messages away from that, whether you think it’s important or not. ” Mr. Abe’s visit  —   Mr. Trump’s first with a foreign leader since the election  —   came on a day when the   was steeped in foreign policy. He met with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to discuss “events and issues around the world,” ranging from Russia and China to Iran and the European Union, according to the transition team. He met with Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, who told reporters afterward that “Israel has no doubt that   Trump is a true friend of Israel. ” Mr. Dermer said he looked forward to working with “all of the members of the Trump administration, including Stephen K. Bannon,” Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, who has been accused of promoting   through his   news media operation, Breitbart News. He met Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the top officer at the military’s Cyber Command, which gave him his first   exposure to the government’s surveillance abilities. And he met with Gen. Jack Keane, a former Army vice chief of staff who has been a longtime informal adviser to Hillary Clinton and a mentor to Gen. David H. Petraeus, as well as a prime architect of the Iraq troop surge in the George W. Bush administration. “I was impressed, frankly, for a couple of reasons,” General Keane said in a telephone interview. “One, by how personable he is, and two, by his intellectual curiosity about national security events. Most presidential candidates don’t have an   knowledge of national security issues. But he asked excellent questions. ” General Keane declined to discuss the advice he had given Mr. Trump. But he said the new president’s greatest challenge would be to maintain America’s leadership in a world in which radical Islamic militancy was threatening to metastasize into a “global jihadist movement,” and hostile powers like Russia, China and Iran were seeking regional dominance. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called into question the network of security alliances that the United States had maintained since World War II, saying the country’s partners in Europe and Asia were not paying their fair share for the American umbrella of protection. Few allies were as rattled by Mr. Trump’s campaign statements as Japan. At one point, he suggested that Japan and South Korea consider acquiring nuclear weapons to protect themselves. In the days leading to Thursday’s meeting, officials from the Japanese Foreign and Trade Ministries were urging Mr. Abe to take a tough line with Mr. Trump on the value of the   Partnership  —   a huge trade deal that Mr. Trump opposes  —   and the countries’ defense alliance, which Mr. Trump has said Japan must contribute more money toward, according to Michael J. Green, a former official in the Bush administration with close ties to Japan. But Mr. Abe appeared to reject that advice, preferring to focus on cultivating a personal relationship with Mr. Trump. Some Japan experts speculated that Mr. Abe was concerned about getting off on the right foot with Mr. Trump because when the Japanese leader traveled to New York in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, he met with Mrs. Clinton, who was then the favorite in the presidential race, but not Mr. Trump. “The Japanese prime minister has done very well with strongmen like Modi and Putin,” said Mr. Green, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and the Russian president. “The question the Japanese side still cannot understand is what a Trump administration will actually do on Asia,” Mr. Green added. Dispelling such confusion is one reason for the choreographed nature of the first calls made to leaders. In 2008, Mr. Obama’s transition team had a plan for the  . On the morning of Election Day, Ms. Rice, who later became Mr. Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations, described the plan in an email to two of his other advisers. “In anticipation of the many calls from foreign leaders, we have prepared a list of priority calls to return and the briefing memos,” Ms. Rice wrote at 9:13 a. m. “Our view is that he should return the calls through the State Dpt. Ops Center, which is comparatively apolitical and professional, has translation capabilities and can assist as desired with  . ” The Ops Center serves as a giant switchboard for the government, providing interpreters as needed to ensure that American officials are confident their words are being translated accurately. Using government switchboards can also help prevent hoaxes. During the 2008 campaign, two French comedians pretending to be the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, pranked Sarah Palin, the Republican   nominee, two days before the election. That call got through despite the fact that advisers to Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee, had a policy of never letting Mr. McCain take a call from a purported foreign leader without first checking out the telephone number with the State Department, according to a person familiar with that campaign’s operations. In Mr. Trump’s case, it has been    . Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia reached out to Mr. Trump early in the week after getting his phone number from Greg Norman, a professional golfer, apparently becoming the second world leader to congratulate him after President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt. Mr. Turnbull beat Theresa May, the British prime minister. In the case of Mr. Trump’s brief conversation with the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, it was conducted in English, though the   said to Mr. Renzi, “Ciao. ”",0

“Halloween is supposed to make your skin crawl, but not like this. A new study finds the scariest part of the holiday may not be the costumes, but makeup for kids. Out of 48 makeup palettes, almost half contained toxic heavy metals. 
Nearly 20 percent of makeup palettes contain lead and cadmium, according to the newly published study by the Breast Cancer Fund. The study found that some products contained as many as four metals, including arsenic and chromium. Indiana housing complex to be razed after toxic lead levels detected https://t.co/qZy4gfTmnC pic.twitter.com/5bGsRti1Im 
— RT America (@RT_America) August 31, 2016 
Nine of the palettes were found to contain lead, a chemical that is unsafe at any level, for children particularly. Parents may have purchased and applied these products to their children unwittingly, as the makeup doesn’t have to list ingredients on their labels. 
The BCF may have been among the first to test the palettes, as the FDA does not regulate this particular product. 
“ The FDA that regulates makeup does not have the power to require pre-market testing ,” Jen Coleman with the Oregon Environmental Council told KGW. 
The cosmetic safety law enacted 75 years ago does not require testing even for products marketed to children. While the FDA cannot do anything about the problem, they have issued guidelines to avoiding “ a rash, swollen eyelids, or other reaction ” this Halloween. 
The guidelines make no mention of potential heavy metal poisoning, but they do offer advice like “ Follow all directions carefully ,” and “ Don’t decorate your face with things that aren’t intended for your skin. ” 
What’s a parent to do in the meantime? Other than use all-natural makeup, the best option is to avoid dark pigments. The BCF study found a correlation between the darkness of the color and the lead content. The darker the color, the more lead it was found to contain.",0

10196,"To Create a Quieter City, They’re Recording the Sounds of New York - The New York Times","On Thursday, microphones mounted outside two buildings in Manhattan went live. Bright yellow signs that say “Recording Underway” announced their arrival. But these devices are not eavesdropping on your conversations. A group of researchers from New York University and Ohio State University are training the microphones to recognize jackhammers, idling engines and street music, using technology originally developed to identify the flight calls of migrating birds. Think of it as the Shazam, the smartphone app that can identify songs, of urban sounds. Snippets of audio, about 10 seconds each, will be collected during random intervals over the course of about a year to capture seasonal notes, like   and snowplows. The cacophony will be labeled and categorized using a   engine called UrbanEars. The sensors will eventually be smart enough to identify hundreds of sonic irritants reverberating across the city. The goal of the project, Sounds of New York City, or Sonyc, is to create an aural map that a group of researchers hopes will help city agencies monitor and enforce noise pollution, and will empower citizens to assist in the process. During the first phase of the   program, which is primarily financed by a $4. 6 million grant from the National Science Foundation, about 100 sensors will be mounted on the second floor of public buildings, first around N. Y. U. ’s campus near Washington Square Park and eventually in Brooklyn and other parts of Manhattan. Each $100 machine contains a small computer processor and a   antenna that connect to a custom microphone, shielded inside a    foam wind guard. The machines are also outfitted with plastic spikes to ward off unwanted interference. “Pigeon poop is the killer of all microphones,” said Charlie Mydlarz, a British researcher who worked in an anechoic chamber, a room designed to deaden sound, to ensure that the devices met noise measurement standards set by the city. So far, the contraptions have been tested in the heat, Dr. Mydlarz said. But the cold of winter has yet to arrive. The antagonizing effects of noise have been well documented: hearing loss, disrupted sleep and cognitive impairment in children, among other ills. One study found that nine out of 10 adults in New York City are exposed to noise that exceed levels considered safe by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Others have made links to a loss of productivity and property values. But taming the city’s din has been an elusive ambition. For more than a century, groups like the Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise, the Noise Abatement Commission and Citizens for a Quieter City have been waging war on this unwanted neighbor. Still, New Yorkers continue to howl about the racket. But there are limitations to the way humans can respond to and even report these issues, said Juan Pablo Bello, the lead investigator for Sonyc. It takes an average of four days for one of the city’s 53 noise inspectors to respond and review to a complaint, according to the city’s Environmental Protection Department. By then, the house party is over and the cat has calmed down. And grievances filed through the 311 system tend to be dominated by certain groups of residents. Manhattanites are two to three times as likely to report a disturbance than those who live in the other boroughs, he said. Enter “smart” technology. Dr. Bello, who is the director of the Music and Audio Research Lab at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development at N. Y. U. is leading a team of specialists in big data, citizen science, data visualization and   to create a network of sensors that will not only monitor noise, but also possibly track the effectiveness of noise ordinances. Recording devices in public places might give some New Yorkers pause, but Dr. Bello said conversations picked up by the microphones could not be reconstructed from the recordings. An independent acoustical consultant was hired to make sure. During the next phase of the project, sensors will transmit data about the time and day that, say, a dog barked or a street performer crooned, and an estimate for the sound level. Eventually, an app called Urbane will allow users to interact with the data, while another app will complement 311 reporting and possibly help New Yorkers track how complaints are handled. “There’s a lot that needs to be investigated and a lot of things that need to be solved before it’s in a place to really help people,” Dr. Bello said. So far, he said, the reception to the project’s potential has been enthusiastic. The team is scouting new sites for sensors, but the process is   because they need a strong internet signal, a power source and approval from building owners. N. Y. U. has also made efforts to talk to nearby residents to explain the program. Ted Timbers, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Department, said officials “look forward to reviewing the data produced through the Sonyc research project to determine if it would be helpful in our enforcement efforts. ” Other cities such as Chicago have deployed a network of sensors that act like a fitness tracker to measure livability through the climate, air quality and noise information. But according to Claudio Silva, the interim director of the Center for Data Science at N. Y. U. Sonyc researchers are conducting the first   analysis about the sources of noise in the wild. Dr. Silva will be wrestling with troves of data from the city to contextualize noise with factors like traffic and census information to generate “a full geometry” of the urban landscape. “On the geek side,” he said, it is exciting to be able to translate technology in ways that “could change the city. ” Making stronger correlations between crime patterns and noise levels, for example, could help shape public policy. Or it could help someone decide where to live or where to start a business. “Having this information can inform people on making the best decision for their lifestyle,” Dr. Silva said.",0
10197,"Joyous Africans Take to the Rails, With China’s Help - The New York Times","DJIBOUTI  —   The 10:24 a. m. train out of Djibouti’s capital drew some of the biggest names in the Horn of Africa last month. Serenaded by a chorus of tribal singers, the crush of African leaders, European diplomats and pop icons climbed the stairs of the newly built train station and merrily jostled their way into the pristine,   carriages making their inaugural run. “It is indeed a historic moment, a pride for our nations and peoples,” said Hailemariam Desalegn, the prime minister of Ethiopia, shortly before the train  —   the first electric transnational railway in Africa  —   headed toward Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. “This line will change the social and economic landscape of our two countries. ” But perhaps the biggest star of the day was China, which designed the system, supplied the trains and imported hundreds of engineers for the six years it took to plan and build the   line. And the $4 billion cost? Chinese banks provided nearly all the financing. Having constructed one of the world’s most extensive and modern rail networks at home, China is taking its prodigious resources and expertise global.   subway cars will soon appear in Chicago and Boston, Beijing is building a $5 billion   rail line in Indonesia, and the Chinese government recently christened new rail freight service between London and Beijing. Another ambitious system in the works, the     Railway Network, would link China to Laos, Thailand and Singapore. But few places are being reshaped by China’s overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century. Despite years of steady economic growth,   Africa remains hobbled by an infrastructure deficit, according to the Africa Development Bank, with only half of its roads paved and nearly 600 million people lacking access to electricity. Chinese companies, many of them   and grappling with an economic slowdown at home, have stepped unto the breach, earning about $50 billion a year on new ports, highways and airports across the continent, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Many of the projects are part of Beijing’s new Silk Road initiative, a $1 trillion effort intended to deepen ties between China and its trading partners in the developing world. Much of that spending has been directed at rail projects that planners hope will transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another, and the rest of the world.   and   projects include a      system in the Ethiopian capital a $13 billion rail link between the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and the port city of Mombasa that will open later this year and an ambitious rail modernization project in Nigeria that includes an urban transit system for Lagos. “For the longest time, railroads across Africa were limping along and in decline, but with the Chinese, that’s definitely changing,” said Andrew Grantham, the news editor at Railway Gazette International, a trade publication. China’s enthusiasm for constructing railroads, schools and stadiums in Africa stands in marked contrast to the role of the United States, which has largely shied away from financing infrastructure on the continent. One of the few exceptions, Power Africa, a $9. 7 billion initiative announced by President Barack Obama in 2013, has fallen far short of its goal of providing electricity to 20 million households within five years. When it comes to trade, China surpassed the United States in 2009 to become Africa’s biggest trading partner. It remains unclear how that calculus might change under the Trump administration. President Trump has questioned the benefits of free trade agreements, and a questionnaire from his transition team that was sent to the State Department last month expressed skepticism for foreign aid and development efforts in Africa. That worries some African officials and longtime experts, who fear the loss of American influence and largess  —   and the good will that is often produced by desperately needed infrastructure projects. Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the United States was also missing opportunities to cultivate loyal customers. “If you’re looking for new markets, Africa is the place to be,” he said. “But right now, the U. S. is not leveraging Africa’s huge potential. By contrast, the Chinese are there, and they are willing to take risks. ” China is placing more than $14 billion worth of bets here in Djibouti, a geopolitically strategic speck of a country beset by soaring poverty and unemployment. The projects include three ports, two airports and a pipeline that will bring water from Ethiopia, its landlocked neighbor and a regional economic power that depends on Djibouti’s ports for 90 percent of its foreign trade. Also on the drawing board are a series of     power plants that would ease summertime electricity failures and help fuel a new   manufacturing zone that officials hope will turn Djibouti into a Hong   entrepôt and international shipping hub. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, said he hoped the new railway linking his country to the Ethiopian capital would be just the first leg of a     route, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. “The train is already a ” he said, noting that it will cut to 12 hours what until now had been a grueling   or   trip by truck. Mr. Hadi praised the Chinese for going all in after Western banks declined to help finance the nation’s glaring infrastructure needs. “We approached the U. S. and they didn’t have the vision,” he said. “They are not thinking ahead 30 years. They only have a vision of Africa from the past, as a continent of war and famine. The Chinese have vision. ” Not everyone is comfortable with China’s vision. Some worry about the leverage China wields and what happens when countries fall behind on loan payments. For Djibouti, the debt is especially daunting, amounting to 60 percent of its gross domestic product. But Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh, the country’s finance minister, dismissed such concerns, saying Djibouti’s heady 6. 7 percent growth rate would allow it to meet its loan payments. “If we don’t take this risk now and develop our infrastructure, we will remain stuck in poverty,” he said. “Come back in a few years, and you will find that Djibouti has become the logistics hub of the continent. ” Others worry about the Djiboutian government’s lack of transparency, its authoritarian impulses and a vexing legacy of official corruption. Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a leader of Djibouti’s embattled opposition and a former presidential candidate, said the lack of information about the terms of China’s loans raised questions about potential malfeasance. “We’re talking about billions of dollars and complete opacity,” he said. “Have there been kickbacks to government officials? There is no way to know. ” Others wonder what will happen to the system after the Chinese leave. European imperialists in Africa built a skein of lines, most of which fell into disrepair in the decades after their colonies achieved independence. Jamie Monson, the author of “Africa’s Freedom Railway,” a book documenting the legacy of the   train linking Tanzania and Zambia, said   maintenance could be more challenging than initial construction. Built during the Cold War and hailed as a symbol of   friendship, the train, the Tazara Railway, has struggled to maintain regular service, prompting talk of a Chinese takeover. “Without proper maintenance comes problems, which can have a huge impact on a regional economy and local people’s livelihoods,” she said. For now, however, much of nation is euphoric over the completion of Djibouti’s first modern railway, which follows the path of a creaky   line, completed in 1917, that met its demise several years ago after generations of neglect. Although workers from China did much of the technical and engineering work, thousands of Djiboutian and Ethiopian laborers were hired to lay tracks and dig tunnels, helping to head off some of the local resentment that has dogged other Chinese projects in Africa. The system will be operated by Chinese conductors for five years and then turned over to local citizens, many of them trained in China. After a boisterous opening day ceremony in the broiling sun, only the   attendees were allowed to board the train, which filled with applause and song as it glided out of the station. Daha Ahmed Osman, 34, a tech specialist who works for the Djiboutian government, displayed a wide grin as he watched the arid, harshly beautiful landscape spill across the train’s picture windows. He predicted that the new train would transform Djibouti and Ethiopia, and eventually all of Africa. “For this, we have the Chinese to thank, because they shared with us their money and their technology,” he said. “More than anything we thank them for showing confidence in us. ”",0
10199,Autopilot Cited in Death of Chinese Tesla Driver - The New York Times,"Tesla Motors came under renewed questioning about the safety of its Autopilot technology after news emerged on Wednesday of a fatal crash in China that may have occurred while the automated   system was operating. The crash took place on Jan. 20 and killed Gao Yaning, 23, when the Tesla Model S he was driving slammed into a road sweeper on a highway near Handan, a city about 300 miles south of Beijing, according to a report broadcast on  Wednesday by the Chinese government news channel CCTV. The report includes   video looking through the windshield as the car travels in the left lane at highway speed just before ramming into a parked or   orange truck. The video, apparently shot by a camera mounted on the rearview mirror, recorded no images, sounds or jolts that would suggest the driver or the car hit the brakes before impact. At that point, the   video ends. “When it was approaching the road sweeper, the car didn’t put on the brake or avoid it,” a police officer said in the CCTV report. “Instead, it crashed right into it. ” In an emailed statement, Tesla said on Wednesday that it had not been able to determine whether Autopilot was active at the time of the Handan accident. The company declined to say when it learned of the fatality in China, or whether it had reported the crash to United States safety officials, who are investigating a fatal accident in Florida on May 7 in which Autopilot was engaged. So far, that Florida accident is the only confirmed death involving a Tesla with Autopilot turned on. In that accident, there was no sign that the driver or Autopilot had applied the brakes before the car collided at high speed with a   that had turned in front of it. Although Tesla learned of the Florida accident a few weeks after it happened, it did not publicly disclose it until late June, when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced it was investigating the crash. News of the Chinese crash will renew questions about when the company should disclose information about accidents in cars equipped with Autopilot and what information should be shared. “Because of the damage caused by the collision, the car was physically incapable of transmitting log data to our servers, and we therefore have no way of knowing whether or not Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash,” a Tesla spokeswoman, Alexis Georgeson, said in the company’s statement. “We have tried repeatedly to work with our customer to investigate the cause of the crash, but he has not provided us with any additional information that would allow us to do so,” she said of the car’s owner, Mr. Gao’s father. She said Tesla was saddened to learn of the death of Mr. Gao. “We take any incident with our vehicles very seriously and immediately reached out to our customer when we learned of the crash,” she said. Tesla and Autopilot have been under scrutiny since the disclosure of the May fatality. That crash killed Joshua Brown, 40, whose 2015 Model S was traveling 74 miles per hour when it collided with a   that had turned left and was crossing a highway near Williston, Fla. Autopilot’s radar and cameras failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky. News of the China crash comes just three days after Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, outlined changes planned for Autopilot that he said would have prevented Mr. Brown’s accident and that he contended would make the Model S one of the safest cars on the road. The changes include refinements in Autopilot’s radar that improve its ability to spot and identify obstacles down the road and additional warnings to force drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road while the system is active. Tesla has said Autopilot is not meant to take over completely for a human driver. When Autopilot is turned on, drivers are given audio and text warnings to remain alert and engaged while using it. In August, Reuters reported that Tesla removed a Chinese term for “ ” from its China website after a driver in Beijing had a nonfatal crash while Autopilot was engaged. That driver later complained that the carmaker had oversold Autopilot’s capability. The video of the January accident indicates the type of unexpected problem that can crop up at highway speeds. Critics of Autopilot say a driver can be lulled into complacency, leaving too little time to take back control of the vehicle. Mr. Gao was traveling in the left lane of a   highway with another car ahead of him. When the car ahead moved into the center lane, it revealed the orange truck, which was straddling the road’s left shoulder. Mr. Gao’s car never slowed before plowing into the truck. Police investigators concluded that Mr. Gao was responsible for the accident, CCTV reported. But in July his family sued the dealer who had sold the Tesla. The driver’s father, Gao Jubin, told CCTV he thought his son had been relying on Autopilot to drive the car and so was not watching the road when the crash took place. The lawsuit was filed “to let the public know that   technology has some defects,” the family’s lawyer said in the report. “We are hoping Tesla, when marketing its products, will be more cautious.

Next Tuesday is the American election, and, for better or for worse, we’ll pick the next President at that time (assuming we don’t get mired in voter fraud and recounts), and we’ll either brace for government mandated SJW enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people. But, today, I want to talk on Trump once to match an article from last week, and I intend to focus on how he is the American candidate, as opposed to the special interest groups’ one. 
I had a conversation last week with some people who acted as SJWs, but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian. The discussion immediately went nasty, with my opposition painting Trump (and anyone who supported him) as a racist and a bigot. Upon trying to determine why two of the left’s ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time, I learned that their perspective was, unless you were universally for all special interest groups, you were a bigot or a racist. False Dichotomy And The American Nightmare 
The problem, I found out, was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation. Either you want all refugees here from the Middle East, all the Hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here, and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around, or you’re a racist. There’s simply no middle ground. 
They don’t understand that Trump is not a special interest candidate, by which I mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense, but he is not racist towards minorities, or sexist towards women. 
It is possible to be against illegal immigration, but treat Americans of Hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent. It is possible to be against feminism, Affirmative Action, and the persecution of men for the profit of women, yet still value American women as Americans themselves. It is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime, yet note that some police are racist, and see that there are bad and good cops AND bad and good black people. 
The American Dream is that all men are created equal, and that’s men as in humanity, not just males. It is not that all men are equal, and there’s a big difference to note here. You have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability, and I do not know anyone, myself included, that is against governmental aid for the disabled. 
What we have, instead, is the American Nightmare, where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes, trying to fix any disadvantaged group’s lot, real or imagined, so that things will be better. They take from the producers, and give to the non-producers so that, according to their idealistic vision, they will suddenly become productive members of society (or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote Democrat for the rest of their lives.) The Good Of The Country Over That Of The Individual 
Long gone are responsible Democrats like Kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country. Every recent Democratic President, from Carter to Obama, and most of the Democrat Congressmen, view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups. Trump is the first candidate in a long time who isn’t for the blacks, or the gays, or the Muslims, or the feminists, or whatever, and that matters a lot. 
The reason why not being for a special interest group (which is ALL that Hillary is for, with her youth vote, black vote, women’s vote, gay vote, etc.) is so important is that these groups, even put together, do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country. Don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of good, hardworking black people, just like there’s the same for women, and for gays, and for young people, but these hardworking folks from all these groups aren’t going to be part of the BLM, or La Raza, or Lamda, because they’re too busy being productive Americans. Activism is for unemployed people. 
What’s going to happen if we don’t placate BLM and just ignore them? They riot a bit more and some get arrested? What if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is ass-backwards thinking and counter-productive to their goals? They’d quit rioting. 
What would happen if we shut the Mexican border down to illegal immigration, but made a straightforward, but strict, path to citizenship for Hispanics that wanted to be citizens? What if we said, this is America, we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children, but the national language IS English, and all business and schooling will be done in it, and in it only, and it’s your choice to not learn it, but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you? They’d be Americans, proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well. 
What would happen if we told gay people that it’s cool if they have civil unions under the law, and have the same rights as everyone else, but it’s not cool trying to pick a fight with a Christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their God and that you’re sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right? 
What if we told them it’s ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult, but you don’t have to try to make five-year-olds decide if they’re gay or straight when they shouldn’t be wondering about that till puberty hits? They’d be normal Americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender, and they’d quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces. 
What would happen if we talked to Muslims and said that there is a huge, deafening, silence when it comes to the subject of Islamic Terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them? What if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism, and part of that help means supporting us vetting Muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities? They’d go along with that and maybe realize we’re fixing a problem, not hating a people. 
What would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for false-rape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor? What would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters, that of merit; that of excellence? 
What if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism, but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and, when you do that to the majority of men, you’ll be just as successful, and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past? They’d realize that it’s not a competition, it’s a cooperation, and maybe skill should be valued over sex. 
What would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really don’t do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy, on rights for all, on border security? What would happen if we simply looked at each other as Americans, and put us, all of us, first? What would happen if we ripped out the crap in the Federal government that overtaxes people, or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen? What would happen if we made the Supreme Court Constitutional again, and made term limits a reality for Congress? Maybe we could get a government for, by, and of the people again. Maybe America can indeed by great again like the man says. Conclusion 
I’m not in a special interest group. No President, outside of George W. Bush right after the September 11th attacks, that I can recall since my childhood, has been for me as an American. I’ve always been someone to be taxed, to be disarmed, to be hated, to be blamed. It’s not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before I was born, or more recently yet with which I had nothing to do. 
I’m not part of the problem. I’m an American; the people who say I am part of the problem are the problem. Their candidate, mired in scandal, corruption, and treason, is Hillary Clinton. Mine, with a message of hope for the country, not just some groups in it, is Donald Trump.",0

If there is some hesitancy in the israeli-american-eu terrorist ops in Syria, something which I’ve not seen evidence for, I think this may be due to the zionazis being unsure they will be able to force a clinton regime on their american colony. If Trumps wins, they run the risk of exposure if he decides to not go along with israel’s war against Syria.

10202,Seeing ‘Nothing to Live For’ as Haiti Seeks a Body Count After Hurricane Matthew - The New York Times,"  Haiti  —   The loss in this coastal town is all but entire. Dead animals float in tidal pools.   heaps mark where homes once stood. Trees, stripped of leaves, branches and tops, impale the earth like ragged posts. But the loss here runs deeper. The local hospital has registered 13 deaths since Hurricane Matthew flung     winds and a wall of water at   but many more have died without so much as an official word. Emilien Clerveaux died trying to save his daughter, his head split open by flying debris. Elouse Maître’s aunt and four cousins were swept out to sea when the water claimed her beachfront shack. Destine Rosevald’s two children, 6 and 4, died in his arms as he tried to rush them to safety. “When I think about them, I cry,” Mr. Rosevald said as he stood in a neighbor’s yard on Saturday, water filling his eyes. “She was just in elementary school. My son, he was going to start kindergarten this year. ” As access and information to   areas of Haiti increase after the hurricane, the news only gets worse. The death toll has climbed to nearly 900 people, while an outbreak of cholera in three southern towns has killed 13 people and infected 62 others, health officials said. For now, though, there is no way to know the precise toll of the storm. There are still 500, 000 people stranded in the south alone, officials said, because of extensive damage to an already feeble infrastructure. More than 170 people have been reported dead in Les Anglais, which for now is accessible only by helicopter. Just as the impoverished island nation, bereft of resources and capacity, struggled to prepare for the storm, the recovery has been hampered by the same shortcomings. And communications have been scattered. Although news outlets are reporting nearly 900 dead, the government has for two days insisted on a figure less than half of that. That gap is partly the result of how the deaths are reported. The government is counting only those it can verify, a formal process that cannot be completed until access to areas cut off by the storm is restored. But in towns like   many have already buried their dead or stopped searching for loved ones carried away in the storm surge. “Honestly, we don’t even know how many died,” said Sanite Moïse, seated with a group of women washing clothes in a shallow flood pool. Small children bathed in the murky water. Mrs. Moïse said her    father had died a few days earlier, drowned in the floods that engulfed his home near the beach. When she went to look for him, there was nothing left  —   just an embankment and   debris. The house, she said, was gone. “God gives and God takes,” she said with a shrug. “Mankind, for all the evil he does, could never do something like this. ” The devastation in   was hard to overestimate. Hardly a home was left untouched, and many were reduced to splinters and rocks. Fields fallowed by salt water baked in the afternoon heat, while palm trees the width of telephone poles were snapped in half. Periodically, the stench of death wafted through the tropical air, filling nostrils with a choking, rotten smell. The areas of   farther west are the worst hit, with entire stretches of the waterfront washed away. Residents spoke about homes that used to line the picturesque beaches along with restaurants and shops. Standing by the side of the road, Mr. Rosevald barely registered the activity around him. As men brushed debris from the road and collected wood to reconstruct homes, he leaned against a rusted Mack truck, looking lost. He could not bear to be near his home, he said. When the storm hit, Mr. Rosevald tried to remain with his children and mother. But by late Monday, as the wind and rain belted his home, finally tearing off his roof, he decided to flee. He rushed to the front door but heard a crash in the living room and went running back. He found his    son, Kendy, and his mother buried in the wreckage. He pulled them out and clutched his unconscious son at his waist, determined to get them out of the house. He lifted his daughter, Naomie, onto his shoulders and ran outside, his mother close behind. Almost immediately, a stick whirred through the air and struck the little girl in the ribs. Frightened by the force of the impact, he looked down at her but kept moving until they reached a neighbor’s house. By the next morning, both children were dead. His daughter, he said, was a playful and talkative girl in second grade. She loved math and jumping rope with friends. His son, he said, was a chatterbox and was excited to start kindergarten this year. Mr. Rosevald paused and apologized for not recalling everything clearly. “They tell me my daughter died a few hours later, at 6 a. m.,” he said. The force of the blow caused extensive internal bleeding, he said. “My son, they said, was dead the entire time I was carrying him,” he stuttered. The boy was dead the instant the wall fell on him. On Saturday, residents cleaned up wooden debris that littered the town, working with machetes and axes and stacking trees and branches felled in the storm. Fisherman repaired their nets on the beach. The water was postcard Caribbean. At the local hospital, the injured turned up by the dozens. An old man was carried from the bed of a truck into the waiting room, unconscious, as nurses and doctors trained in Cuba attended to him. A young girl issued bloodcurdling screams as nurses cleaned cuts running up her leg. A young man beside her gingerly touched deep gashes on the back of his neck. “I knew this place before,” Orthela Genima, a doctor who has worked in the hospital for several years, said of the town. “Now I can’t even recognize it. ” Among those who had lost loved ones, many struggled to recognize even themselves. “It’s like we are slowly dying,” said Micheline Clerveaux, 18, whose father, Emilien, died Tuesday afternoon. “We have nothing to live for. ” The family was gathered near where its house had been, an area reduced to a mound of stones and an odd assortment of furniture, a dismantled speaker and a wooden box spring. Mr. Clerveaux was buried in the family grave beside the home, a concrete slab sitting above ground, painted a dull blue. He had been searching for Micheline when the storm raged on Tuesday morning. The family had fled the home moments earlier, seeking refuge in an open field to the west. The parents split up, and Micheline and her sister, Francise, went with their father. The other four children went with their mother, Marie Rose Jacob. But when they met in the field and lay flat on the ground to avoid the flying objects, Micheline was missing. A strong gust had knocked her off course, placing her closer to a neighbor’s house. “He told me he was going to look for her,” Mrs. Jacob said. After an hour, the children and their mother left the field and, by good fortune, found shelter in the same home where Micheline was taking cover. But Mr. Clerveaux was not there. They waited until the worst of the storm had passed and went searching for him. Hours passed. Eventually, a few hundred yards away, they found him leaning against a tree, talking to himself. They hoisted him and looked for injuries. There was a huge wound on the back of his head. At home, lying in bed, he told his wife that he was going to die. A few hours later, he did. Mr. Clerveaux was a subsistence farmer, growing corn, potatoes and beans to feed his family. Those crops are now gone, unlikely to grow again in the salt water marsh that his land has been turned into. The family’s livestock  —   a cow and three sheep  —   are also lost. Neighbors pitched in to bury Mr. Clerveaux, and they are housing and feeding his wife and children. They say they will continue for however long it takes the family to rebuild. “If we survive, they will survive,” said   Nazaire, 56, the neighbor with whom the family took shelter during the storm. “If we have only one loaf of bread to eat, we will share it with them. ”",0
10203,An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers,"Tweet Widget by Black Power Front 
With students joining workers in revolt against South Africa’s neoliberal regime, young people are demanding to know why Black police are engaged in the same kind of repression that was previously used by white governments “to systematically counter Black resistance?” In a letter to Black cops, activists note “an increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence.” An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers by Black Power Front 
“As a Black Police Officer, you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too.” 
Dear Black Police Officer, 
How are you today? Well, we hope. You may be wondering who we are, why we have decided to write to you and perhaps why we are addressing you as a “Black Police Officer” -- as opposed to just saying “Police Officer.” 
Who are we? We are the Black Power Front or BPF. We are a non-party political pro-Black platform which seeks to serve as an instrument to organize and collaborate with like-minded Black individuals and organizations, under a common program that provides practical responses to what is commonly understood as the Black Condition today. 
Why have we decided to write to you? First, given the nature of your work, it is not always easy to sit down with you and just talk about issues that affect our country and, in particular, the Black community. 
Second, like other members of the Black community, we in the BPF are deeply disturbed by the continued brutality of the police against Black workers and students -- particularly those who engage in legitimate protest action. And third, the BPF holds the view that, given where Black people find themselves economically, socially and otherwise today in relation to other racial groups, it is extremely urgent that like-minded Black groups and individuals (everywhere in the world) come together in exclusive spaces, and engage in constructive dialogue, with the view to find ways of getting Black people out of the quagmire they currently find themselves in. 
The anti-Black role of the police before 1994 
As members of the Black community, you would know that, in the Azanian (South Afrikan) context, from the 1400s onwards, various forms of colonial police structures were key instruments in enabling the European invaders to advance and bolster their evil agenda of slavery, colonization and land theft. It was these colonial police structures that were used to systematically counter Black resistance, through amongst others the capture, torture and in many cases beheading of our warrior ancestors such as uKumkani uHintsa, Kgosi Toto, Kgosi Galeshewe, uKumkani uStuurman and many other heroes and heroines of Black resistance. 
In the 20 th century, it was through these European colonial police structures that successive white supremacist regimes in Azania (South Afrika) were able to murder and torture our freedom fighters and ordinary Black people. They were directly responsible for the murder of our people in Sharpeville and Langa in 1960. The execution by hanging of martyrs like Vuyisile Mini and Solomon Mahlangu, in 1964 and 1979, respectively. 
It was the colonial European police who assassinated visionaries such as Onkgopotse Tiro and Steve Biko, in 1974 and 1977, respectively. It was them who murdered the young Zolile Petersen and Christopher Truter, during the student uprising of 1976. And it was them who ensured that many of our revered freedom fighters such as Kgalabi Masemola, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Lekoane Mothopeng, Pandelani Nefolovhodwe, Nkosi Molala, Muntu Myeza and many others, were banished to Robben Island. 
Even though it is often argued that the White Police Officers who were involved in these atrocities against Black people were acting under the orders of their superiors, the truth of the matter is that, at an individual and basic level, they knew that what they were doing to Black people was wrong, inhumane and unjustified. 
The anti-Black role of the police after 1994 
Given this painful history of centuries of systematic and state violence against Black people, the declaration of “freedom” on April 27, 1994, created a legitimate expectation on the part of many Black people that the type of wanton violence and naked brutality that the successive colonial white supremacist regimes unleashed on Black people would be a thing of the past. But to our horror, even after the declaration of “freedom” in 1994 and the installation of a government that is led by Black people we began to see an increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence. 
This type of anti-Black police [U1] brutality was palpable in the killing of Andries Tatane, young Nqobile Nzuza, Mike Tshele, Lerato Seema, Osiah Rahube, Jan Rivombo and of course the brutal and targeted assassinations of Mgcineni “Mambush” Noki and other Black workers in Marikana, in August 2012. 
All of these anti-Black atrocities beg the question: how it is possible that a government that is led by people who, as part of the Black community, have first-hand experience of the brutality of state violence through the police, do not just unleash the same type of state violence against their own people, but also seek to justify the use of such anti-Black violence? 
Our attitude towards Black police officers 
By highlighting the involvement of Black Policer Officers (after 1994) in the killing of ordinary Black people who are simply fighting for their right to be human the BPF does not seek to create the mind-set that Black Police Officers are the enemy of the Black community or that Black Police Officers are inherently bad people. Of course, there are many examples of Black Police Officers who don’t just do their job with integrity and dedication, but also do a lot of good work in the Black community. 
This notwithstanding, the main focus of this letter, however, is not so much the individual conduct of Black Police Officers but rather the continued use of Black Police Officers (as a state function) in the brutal suppression of the right of ordinary and mainly poor Black people to freely articulate their social, economic and political concerns and aspirations. 
Our appeal to Black police officers 
As the BPF, we regard Black Police Officers as members of the Black community first and therefore an integral part of Black life in Azania. We also hold the view that the on-going demands by Black workers for decent wages and better working conditions or those of Black students for free-decolonized-Afrocentric education, are not just demands that will benefit individual Black Police Officers (majority of them Black young people), but also their children who might be at university or will be going there in future. Therefore, as a Black Police Officer, you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too. 
As the BPF we fully understand that, just like all ordinary Black people, Black Police Officers are under severe financial stress and like most Black people, they are struggling to make ends meet. For these reasons, the BPF’s clarion call to all Black Police Officers is as follows: 
* Understand that the economic struggles and frustrations of ordinary Black people are your struggles and frustrations too. And that Black workers and students continue to be oppressed by the same system that is responsible for your personal financial stress; 
* As part of the Black community, you must (through your labor unions), engage the management of the SAPS to stop the state’s campaign of apartheid-style violence that is currently being unleashed on Black people in general; 
* You are our Black Brothers and Sisters and must never allow yourselves to be used by self-serving politicians as part of an elitist anti-Black-pro-capitalist plot that uses the pretext of “law and order” to justify the murder of poor Black people and wanting that Black people timidly accept their status as economic slaves in the land of their ancestors; and 
* Lastly, Black students and workers are not fighting against you (as Black police officers) but against the anti-Black-pro-capitalist system that is using some of you against your own Black Sisters and Brothers.

10204,Full Transcript and Video: Trump News Conference - The New York Times,"President Trump on Thursday announced his new nominee for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, during a news conference at the White House. Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live analysis. TRUMP: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed did very, very well. And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be  —   I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of labor. And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the   or as they say, “never Trump. ” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. It’s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time. We’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that. And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we’ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That’s always a possibility. I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done. A new Rasmussen poll, in fact  —   because the people get it  —   much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it. Let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is  —   to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, “Oh, that’s good. ” Now it means, “That’s good for jobs. ” Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league  —   Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I’m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit  —   a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s OK, too. TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking  —   and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort  —   not all the time  —   and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say  —   they’re honest and fantastic. But much of it is not a  —   the distortion  —   and we’ll talk about it, you’ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country you see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea  —   we’ll take care of it folks we’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess. Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you’ve covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He’s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it’s in large sections of the world. They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer  —   another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism, and we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now, it’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I’ve had great from Congress, generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my  —   I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it’s depleted  —   it won’t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I’m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222, 230’s impossible. 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media’s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason. And  —   but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida five o’clock on Saturday and I heard  —   just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved. And they’re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who’s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague  —   highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We’re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about and we can’t let that happen. So, if the Democrats who have  —   all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. I’ll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks  —   in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the   disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals but we’re going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We’re going to have one on one deals. We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process  —   they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries. We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We’ve issued a   new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say “let me see your regulations” and they’re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental  —   all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing. We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation  —   take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer. We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general  —   now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke. We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is  —   that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further. We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. TRUMP: And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D. C. I’ve started by imposing a   lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is’s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing. So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It’s already happening. But big league. I’ve also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2, 000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here. General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here. Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10, 000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10, 000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we’re naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades  —   decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen. And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the   way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p. m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions. Mara (ph) Mara (ph) go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong  —   what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem. And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this  —   that they know nothing about it they weren’t in Russia they never made a phone call to Russia they never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal  —   I think it’s very important  —   the illegal, giving out classified information. It was  —   and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much. I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s  —   I spoke to the president of Mexico I had a good call. All of a sudden, it’s out there for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I’m saying  —   the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, “I don’t think he did anything wrong if anything, he did something right. ” He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, “Huh, that’s fine. ” That’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to  —   he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were    countries. He’s doing the job. You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision. But he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me. Yes? QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long   story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was  —   it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really  —   I mean, they were such a minor part. They  —   I hadn’t spoken to them. I think the one person  —   I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very   member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s  —   by the way, who’s by the way a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody  —   people knew that. Everybody knew that. So, these people  —   and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories. TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that’s the extent. Russia is fake news. Russia  —   this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo has  —   has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in. And just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time’s story, yesterday. And it talked about  —   these are (ph) front page. So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true. So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that. And it was totally  —   they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things. OK, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph) or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 ( ). (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Obama ( ) 426 on ( ). So why should Americans. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: . ..I’m skipping that information, I don’t know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin. QUESTION: ( ) why should Americans trust you ( ) the information ( )? TRUMP: Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. I was given  —   I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that’s. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes? QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did  —   whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What —   what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks. TRUMP: We are. QUESTION: Can we ask what you’re going to do and also, we’ve heard about a  —   a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that? TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they’re in position so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he’s offered his services and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we’re need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. As far as the general’s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn’t think. It was really, what happened after that but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said “well I don’t see”  —   to me, he was doing the job. The information was provided by  —   who I don’t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said “doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there. ” But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as  —   as far as the actual making the call, fact I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So  —   and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man. QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks  —   on the leaks, sir. .. TRUMP: . ..Go ahead. Finish off then I’ll get you. QUESTION: I’m sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You’ve said twice today. .. TRUMP: . ..Yes, we’re looking at them very  —   very, very serious. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we’re  —   I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies  —   I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was  —   honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said “you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen” but that wasn’t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who’s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said “that’s terrible that it was leaked” but it wasn’t that important. But then I said to myself “what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?” What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very  —   you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don’t want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test. So I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the “Washington Post” and gets put into the “New York Times” and I’m saying “what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty. QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do  —   and I hope we can correct it. Because there’s nobody I have more respect for  —   well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters. It’s very important to me and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and, you know, over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m OK with that. But I’m not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good  —   he’s saying no. It’s OK, Jim (ph). It’s OK, Jim (ph) you’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be  —   I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now but I think that actually  —   I think that’d actually be better. People  —   I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter (ph) is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower  —   I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I’d appreciate it  —   again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. TRUMP: I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking, some of them had them approved immediately. I’m going forever and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for. And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they’d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody’s good. And sometimes  —   I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that’s OK. That’s fine. But I think it would  —   I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff  —   what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine  —   seriously  —   can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric  —   you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We’ll do you next Jim, I do you next( ph). QUESTION: ( ) clarify  —   TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   prior to your  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   inauguration. TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION: And then fired him  —   TRUMP: Excuse me. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way  —   and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I’ve watched many other people say that. No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it. OK? Jim? QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don’t hate you. I don’t hate you. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: So, pass that along  —   TRUMP: Ask  —   ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK? QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir  —   TRUMP: Well, that’s  —   well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting. QUESTION: It’s pretty good right now, actually. TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John. QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time  —   TRUMP: I was OK with it. QUESTION:  —   you said  —   you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30, 000  . I’m wondering, sir, if you  —   TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that. QUESTION: Then( ph) your( ph) numbers( ph) were off too. TRUMP: No  —   no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that. QUESTION: If  —   if I may ask you, sir, it  —   it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during( ph) the campaign  —   TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready? QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that  —   TRUMP: No  —   no, but let me do one at a time. QUESTION: If I may as a follow up? TRUMP: Do you mind? QUESTION: Yes, sir. TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you’re talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn’t classified information. But in one case, you’re talking about classified  —   regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong  —   at my suggestion  —   and I give Reince great credit for this  —   at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so  —   they were  —   when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn’t even in the papers. Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she  —   and she should have reported herself. Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, “I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job. ” QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don’t understand. It seems that there’s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake? TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You know what it is? Here’s the thing. The public isn’t  —   you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I’m involved. So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not. I just see many, many untruthful things. And I’ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word “tone. ” The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such  —   I do get good ratings, you have to admit that  —   the tone is such hatred. I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox  Friends in the morning, they’re very honorable people. They’re very  —   not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That’s all I can say. It’s the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look  —   the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes  —   sometimes somebody gets. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive  . The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive  . And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth the hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I’m amazed by it. And I just think you’d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know. I  —   I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s  —   it’s brutal. Now, they’ll take this news conference  —   I’m actually having a very good time, OK? But they’ll take this news conference  —   don’t forget, that’s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, that’s how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people. That’s for sure. But I’m having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, “Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. ” I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But  —   but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, “Donald Trump rants and raves. ” I’m not ranting and raving. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup. .. TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have  —   let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down. We’ll. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir. .. TRUMP: I’m changing it from fake news, though. QUESTION: Doesn’t that under. .. TRUMP: Very fake news. QUESTION: . .. I know, but aren’t you. .. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news. TRUMP: And you’re not related to our new. .. QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say. TRUMP: I looked  —   you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. QUESTION: I’m sure you checked that out, sir. TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it  —   I said  —   they said, “No, sir. ” I said, “Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. ” QUESTION: But aren’t you  —   aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don’t like “fake news”? Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like. TRUMP: I do that. QUESTION: When you call it “fake news,” you’re undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important. TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here’s the thing. OK. I understand what you’re  —   and you’re right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I’ll say, “Wow, that’s going to be a great story. ” And I’ll get killed. I know what’s good and bad. I’d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what’s good. I know what’s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive  —   sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make OK. They’ll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I’m there. I know what was said. I know who’s saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press  —   the public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go  —   as an example, you’re CNN, I mean it’s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running  —   this is a   machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph). You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying “here’s my chief of staff,” a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some  —   all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know  —   and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said “you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. ” I mean, they’re fake. They’re not true. And isn’t that a shame because he’d rather be working on healthcare, he’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph). I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there’s a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know  —   you know, whatever reason. But  —   and I understand that. But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that’s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it’s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news? And second. .. TRUMP: . ..I think they don’t believe it. I don’t think the public  —   that’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don’t think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that’s a ruse. That’s a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now tomorrow, you’ll say “Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. ” It’s not terrible. It’s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn’t do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton  —   that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who’s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said “I know politically it’s probably not good for me. ” The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles off shore right out of the water. Everyone in this country’s going to say “oh, it’s so great. ” That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you’ve had a lot of presidents that haven’t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can  —   now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But  —   but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said “you know. ” He’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying “you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story. ” OK? And that’s a shame because if we could get along with Russia  —   and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)? QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you. .. TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It’s not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner. So we’ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March,   March. And after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform. Yes? QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel  —   the spy vessel off the coast of the United States. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries and a Russian plane buzzed a U. S. destroyer. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign . .. TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, “Hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States there’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us. ” Because the  —   you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, “Oh, isn’t that wonderful. ” But I know you well enough. Then you would say, “Oh, he was too tough he shouldn’t have done that. ” Look, all of the. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I’m different than those people. Go ahead. QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal? TRUMP: I have. I have. And I’m so beautifully represented. I’m so honored that the Senate approved him. He’s going to be fantastic. Yes, I think that I’ve already. .. QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir? TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal. Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal. I don’t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough  —   the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world. If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along  —   and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There’s no upside. We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. QUESTION: So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are. .. TRUMP: Who did I say is not good? QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they’re not good. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, it’s not good, but they happened. QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine. .. TRUMP: They all happened recently. No. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. this country’s ability to work with Russia? TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they’re doing because they’re doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK? But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia. QUESTION: Can we. .. TRUMP: I gave  —   you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing. QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations? TRUMP: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response. I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months. “We are going to attack Mosul in four months. ” Then three months later, “We are going to attack Mosul in one month. ” “Next week, we are going to attack Mosul. ” In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things, you’re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that. So I don’t have to tell you. I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do. ” I don’t have to do that. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I’m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything, but I’m not going to tell you. OK. QUESTION: Could I just ask you  —   thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble. .. TRUMP: Where are you from? QUESTION: BBC. TRUMP: Here’s another beauty. QUESTION: That’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair. TRUMP: Yeah. Sure. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Just like CNN right? QUESTION: On the travel ban  —   we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government. .. TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government. .. QUESTION: Were there any mistakes. .. TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that’s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it’s 80 percent of the time, a lot. We had a bad decision. We’re going to keep going with that decision. We’re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision. That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect. Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a   period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones. You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that’s like you. You have some bad people out there. Kelly said you can’t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don’t have time to come in. Now nobody ever reports that. But that’s why we did it quickly. Now, if I would’ve done it a month, everything would’ve been perfect. The problem is we would’ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would’ve come into our country. Now in the meantime, we’re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed. QUESTION: Just a brief  . But if it’s so urgent, why not introduce. .. TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election? TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that’s one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been. QUESTION: During the election? TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody. .. QUESTION: So you’re not aware of any contact during the course.. TRUMP: Look, look, look. .. QUESTION: . .. of the election? TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question? QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. It’s so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that  —   whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that. QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election? TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he  —   now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five? QUESTION: Mr. President, on national. .. TRUMP: Wait. Let’s see. Who’s  —   I want to find a friendly reporter. QUESTION: Mr. ... TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. QUESTION: ( ). .. TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven’t seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the  —   anyone on your staff of being ( ). Because ( ). However, what we’ve already heard about and what we ( ) is ( ) so you’re general forecast (ph) like 48 ( ). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the ( ). .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:. ..he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it’s not, its not, not  —   not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question. So here’s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least   Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican  —   quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about  —   he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it. So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you, I’m Lisa (ph) from the. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific. .. TRUMP: It’s a very fair question. QUESTION: . ..countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration. TRUMP: Right. QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it? TRUMP: We’re gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way  —   it’s a very  —   it’s a very, very tough subject. We’re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is  —   is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that. But the DACA situation is a very, very  —   it’s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough. I’m not talking about new laws, I’m talking the existing law, is very rough, it’s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision. But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we’re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..reopening of the White House Visitors Office? TRUMP: Yes. QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what’s first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean. .. TRUMP: Now, that’s what I call a nice question. That is very  —   who are you with? QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Good, I’m gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania’s terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania’s gonna be outstanding, that’s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House. She, like others that she’s working with, feel very, very strongly about women’s issue, women’s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she’s a very, very strong advocate. I think she’s a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets  —   she gets so unfairly  —   Melania, the things they say. I’ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find. And the things they say  —   I’ve known her for a long time  —   the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies. I’ll just tell you this. I think she’s going to be a fantastic first lady. She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they’re not doing this for money. They’re not doing this for pay, they’re doing this because they feel it both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school  —   because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left  —   she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that’s a very nice question. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that’s OK. QUESTION: It doesn’t( ph) have( ph) to be a bad question. TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead. QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you’re  —   TRUMP: Fix the inner cities. QUESTION:  —   president. Fixing the inner cities. TRUMP: Yep. QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that’s coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn’t bad, was it? TRUMP: That was very professional and very good. QUESTION: I’m very professional. TRUMP: We’ll be announcing the order in a little while and I’d rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible  —   you know, it takes a long time. It’s taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we’re going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we’re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people  —   and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it  —   in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They’re living in hell. We can’t let that happen. So, we’re going to be very, very strong. That’s a great question and  —   and it’s a  —   it’s a very difficult situation because it’s been many, many years. It’s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all  —   and safe. There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK? QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going  —   are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your  —   your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as  —   TRUMP: Am I going to include who? QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional  —   TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION:  —   Hispanic Caucus  —   TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION: No  —   no  —   no. I’m not  —   TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? QUESTION: I’m just a reporter. TRUMP: Well, then( ph) set up the meeting. QUESTION: I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now. TRUMP: Let’s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically. I can’t have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy. QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well. TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can’t make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told  —   he was probably told “don’t meet with Trump. It’s bad politics. ” And that’s part of the problem in this country. OK, one more. QUESTION: (inaudible) TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can’t handle. This room can’t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible) some of it by supporters in your name. What do you. .. TRUMP: . ..And some of it  —   can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side and you think it’s like playing it straight? No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won’t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead. QUESTION: You’re the president now. What are you going to do about it? TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that? QUESTION: What are you going to do about  —   what are you going to do about (inaudible). TRUMP: Oh, I’m working on it. I’m working on it very  —   no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided  —   I didn’t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here. We’re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that’s part of it. But we’re going to work on education, we’re going to work on  —   you know, we’re going to stop  —   we’re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we’re going to try and stop crime. We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime. But it’s very important to me  —   but this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try  —   I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much. It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks. END",0
10205,London couple who ‘don’t need a car’ want a lift,"London couple who ‘don't need a car’ want a lift 14-11-16 A COUPLE from London who insist they do not need a car have asked for a lift. Tom Logan and his girlfriend Eleanor Shaw live in East London and rely on trains and Ubers to get around, believing that cars are wasteful. However they really need a lift to a wedding near Portsmouth on Saturday. Shaw said: “Living in London gives you a different perspective on transport. It makes you realise that having your own car is simply unnecessary, not to mention terrible for the environment. “That said, we could really do with being picked up from Portsmouth station around midday on Saturday.” Logan added: “Owning a car is a British obsession we just don’t buy into. We’re so well served for transport links where we live, we really have no need for a car – except for every time we leave London. “In the provinces, we have to rely on the kindness of family, friends and sometimes even strangers to give us lifts, much like children being taken to after-school activities. “We don’t give people petrol money though, preferring to operate a vague barter system.”

[11/1/16] Asked to provide a quotation for a Politico profile of Huma Abedin in July 2015, Clinton Campaign manager John Podesta wanted to use the phrase “wicked smart” instead of “bright,” and he emphasized Abedin’s “strategic sense.” 
Podesta also agreed with a campaign staffer’s suggestion to describe Abedin as “an integral part of the team.” 
The Wikileaks email exchange , dated July 2, 2015 and released on Tuesday, begins with Clinton’s press secretary Nicholas Merrill telling Milia Fisher, Podesta’s aide, that “Politico has been working on a profile on Huma that we are being what I’d call partially cooperative with.” 
Merrill said after consulting with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri and Huma herself, the campaign decided to have the reporter sit down with Huma “off the record.” 
“We think there is some value in demystifying her a bit in general, and Politico isn’t a bad place to do it,” Merrill wrote to Fisher. 
Merrill asked Fisher to see if Podesta “would be willing to weigh in, which I think would be good in the spirit of showing team unity.” 
“The piece will be about Huma’s evolution from body person to senior staffer, so if he’s up for it, maybe John could say something about her being a multi-faceted team player,” Merrill wrote. Then he offered a suggested quotation: 
“Like: I was there at the White House when Huma was a young intern, and now she’s an integral part of the team. She’s as multi-faceted as she is bright, and when you combine that with her humility, you couldn’t ask for a better colleague.” 
Merrill tells Fisher, “Feel free to tweak that, put it in John’s voice, or blow it up.” 
Fisher forwarded Merrill’s email to Podesta, asking him if he’d be willing to provide a quote. “Comms (communications) thinks it might lend an air of community to the piece,” she wrote to Podesta. 
Podesta’s reply: “Change bright to ‘wicked smart’ and after humilty add ‘and strategic sense.'” 
The complete email exchange, as provided by WikiLeaks, can be seen here : 
The July 2, 2015 Politico profile of Abedin described her as “Clinton’s longest-serving aide.” It said that “like a mother monitoring her child on the playground, she never let Clinton drift out of her line of sight, ever vigilant and poised to act.” Post navigation",0

[11/1/16] While everyone’s talking about acting DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile’s current scandals, let’s not lose sight of the fact that her predecessor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, has seemingly gotten away with spearheading and successfully executing a years-long plot to rig the Democratic primaries for her friend, ally, and former employer Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
As we’ve discussed before , we know for a fact thanks to a leaked email that Tim Kaine had been promised the vice presidential slot long before it was anywhere close to necessary for Clinton to select a running mate. If you know anything at all about politics, you know people don’t get promised a favor that big unless they’ve given something equally massive in return. It would be hard to think of a political favor greater than being installed into one of the most esteemed positions in American government; it is the most significant thing that a presidential candidate can bestow upon someone from that position. 
We also know for a fact that Obama was already a “friend and political ally” of Kaine back in 2011 according to this Washington Post article from that year, which was the year President Barack encouraged his friend Tim to step down from his position as DNC chair and make a run for retiring Democratic muppet Jim Webb’s Senate seat. And according to this Politico article from the very same day, Obama then immediately installed former Clinton campaign co-chair and Hillary attack poodle Debbie Wasserman Schultz to the conveniently-vacated DNC chair, who then went on to orchestrate the rigging of the Democratic primaries for her girlfriend in violation of the Impartiality Clause of the DNC charter. 
In doing this, Obama was able to effectively hand-pick a successor to his throne who happens to be married to his Democratic presidential predecessor Bill Clinton. You’re not supposed to be able to do that in a democracy. 
We’ve talked about all that before. What I have personally failed to address adequately is the fact that Wasserman Schultz got away with it. She did every single thing she was placed in the DNC chair to do, she got caught, and then all she had to do was say “Oopsie! Looks like I’ll have to resign now!” and just stroll away, grinning like the cat that already ate the canary. Post navigation",0
10208,Comment on Robert De Niro to Produce Documentary Exposing Corruption Within the Vaccine Industry by quietsch,"Home / #Solutions / Robert De Niro to Produce Documentary Exposing Corruption Within the Vaccine Industry Robert De Niro to Produce Documentary Exposing Corruption Within the Vaccine Industry Jay Syrmopoulos May 24, 2016 78 Comments 
Cannes, France – Hollywood superstar Robert De Niro dropped a bombshell recently when he revealed that he is working on producing a documentary about the highly controversial topic of vaccines. However, he remained tight-lipped, noting that “when he talks about it, something happens,” seemingly implying that some power from above could potentially stifle his planned project. 
In an interview with pop culture/entertainment site Vulture from the Cannes Film Festival on Friday, De Niro was asked about the controversy surrounding the planned screening of the documentary film “Vaxxed: From Catastrophe to Coverup” at his Tribeca Film Festival, and subsequent decision to not screen the film. 
Well, what I learned, first of all, there was a big reaction, which I didn’t see coming, and it was from filmmakers — supposedly, I have yet to find out who it was. I wanted to just know who they were, because to me there was no reason not to see the movie. The movie is not hurting anybody. It says something. It said something to me that was valid. Maybe some things were inaccurate, but if the movie was 20 percent accurate, it was worth seeing. And they were saying it’s because of the filmmaker and he was discredited, but how was he discredited? By the medical establishment? There’s a lot going on that I still don’t understand, but it makes me question the whole thing, and the whole vaccine issue is a real one. It’s big money. So it did get attention. I was happy about that. And I talked about another movie called Trace Amounts that I saw and spoke about it a lot, that people should see it, and it’s there. Something is there with vaccines, because they’re not tested in some ways the way other medicines are, and they’re just taken for granted and mandated in some states. And people do get sick from it. Not everybody, but certain people are sensitive, like anything, penicillin. 
When asked whether he would try and screen “Vaxxed” again if given the opportunity, De Niro said he wouldn’t be interested in doing so, but hinted that he and the mega-producer Harvey Weinstein were planning to create a new documentary film potentially focused on the massive financial incentives underpinning the vaccine manufacturing industry, as well as dubious ties between pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies. 
Yeah, and you always say, you’re not against vaccines, you’re against what they put in vaccines that can hurt certain people who are allergic. It can kill them sometimes. And there’s such an industry. There’s big, big money in vaccines that the CDC will put… 
…I’m working on something else. Harvey Weinstein and I are working on doing a documentary, but I don’t what to talk much about it, because when I talk about it, something happens. But that’s what we plan to try to do. 
After “Vaxxed” was pulled from Tribeca, the Hollywood legend went on the Today show to defend his original stance of wanting to screen the documentary, noting that there was “no reason” to pull the film. The documentary was allegedly pulled due to threats from other filmmakers, which De Niro believed could negatively impact the film festival. 
When Today host Willie Geist attempted to point out that there is an overwhelming amount of scientific research that has found no link between vaccines and autism, De Niro quickly responded. 
“I believe it’s much more complicated than that. There is a link and they are saying there isn’t and there are…. other things there. I don’t know, I’m not a scientist but I know because I’ve seen so much reaction of just ‘let’s find out the truth.’” 
De Niro went on to explain that he believes there is a potential link between autism and the ingredients in vaccines, highlighting a documentary called “ Trace Amounts .” The film star pointed out that he isn’t anti-vaccine, but simply wants safe vaccines, noting that he is the father of an autistic child. 
“I, as a parent of a child who has autism, am concerned. And I want to know the truth. And I’m not anti-vaccine; I want safe vaccines,” De Niro stated. 
De Niro obviously realizes the power residing within the industry, as he pointed out that even talking about this conceptual project could make “something happen.” The vaccine industry has a vested financial interest in not allowing a broad public discussion to be had about vaccines. The “something happens” De Niro nebulously refers to would most likely consist of the large financial powers at the root of big pharma leaning on any movie studio bold enough to take on De Niro’s vaccine project — similarly to what happened to “Vaxxed” at Tribeca.

don’t believe it. you already know that your beliefs are wrong. you act just like the nazi fascist party of NO (repugs) lie and keep lying you’ll change some people minds. But IT IS STILL A LIE Neo 
If you’re referring to Robert Di Nero,i think you’re delusional! If the industry has nothing to hide than there is no problem right! But there is a huge problem…..it’s all lie from the industry. You can only suppress the truth of the dangers of vaccines especially for so long before people wake up to the corruption. Vaccines kill and damage children everyday and that’s a fact! Vaccines kill more people and children than any diseases…another fact. There are no facts that vaccines work,prevent or eradicated any disease. Have a good day! 
wrong tamarque 
I sure hope you don’t ever have a child go regressive autistic after a vaccine, but I fear that will be the only thing to get you to look as your belief system that blindly trusts the lies of govt agencies that are bought and bolstered by drug corporations. Karyn Abbey Chase 
Please elaborate. What does “”wrong”” actually mean, and where are you in Canada Karyn? gingercake5

Great Article! I think it is very important that a high profile celebrity is putting his name out there next to an issue such as this. 
I have a 5 month old daughter and when she was given her first round of shots I felt horrible! I felt that I had failed her because I didn’t have all of the knowledge of what they were injecting her with. 
I have been very skeptical of vaccines for a long time and obviously because of stories such as this. I think it’s very sketchy that there seems to be some new illness floating around every year and the establishment wants us all to run out and get some new vaccine that has been concocted. The fact that there is big money involved in pushing these vaccines just takes away more credibility. 
We are finally seeing some of the long term effects of these vaccines as well such as the 1970’s Swine Flu Vaccines where people who received those shots are having Central Nervous System problems. 
DiNero is obviously invested in this because of his own child and sometimes that is what it takes for these issues to reach the light of day. When someone important is personally being affected, they want to speak out. 
I love the site and the stories that The Free Thought Project has to offer and I commend you guys for really touching on the “uncomfortable” topics that the mainstream ignores. I am starting my own blog, The A.D.D. Theory and I hope to integrate the same kind of stories. I will be happy with a fraction of the success that you guys are having! Karyn Abbey Chase 
What happened to your child after the first round? Nothing? Oh 
My kid has all his vaccinations! Why would bring back diseases and illnesses that our countries havnt seen for decades!. Maybe pesticides are responsible for autism. Read that article. ang 
Are you sure your kid is OK? They lose 10 IQ points every shot of aluminium/glyphosate or thimerosol. And vaccines never got rid of disease, they cause it. Here is the chart for whooping cough Australia, DTP either worked or didn’t, but didn’t spread whoopinig cough, at least. Look what happened when we switched to Dtap notice the rise? Dtap vaccinated catch carry and spread, over and over, no symptoms. The ones on this chart ARE ONLY THE ONES WHOSE VACCINE FAILED. AND THEY GOT SYMPTOMS. Thank GOD! Simples solution, known since 2010, stop vaccinating, and our whooping cough would go back to 400 a year, and no baby deaths. Instead they keep using this useless vaccine, that is spreading whooping cough and killing babies, Australia now has 1 in 25 children, aged 6-12 with whooping cough cough, cough cough each year (all fully vaccinated!). 5 jabs for what? Just so they can carry and spread it everywhere with no symptoms, for bloody 6 years? So what do they do to hide this abysmal failure instead of just banning the vaccine in 2010? Jab more, jab babies before birth, in utero, with a vaccine that KILLS THEM IF GIVEN AT BIRTH> Seriously what did CDC expect would happen? 400 times the baby deaths inside the mother? And if the babies survive, 1 in 50 have sever brain damage called microcephaly? How evil can CDC be? How fucking corrupt can they be? Protecting a useless vaccine, and its pharma and trying to cover it, by killing and maiming MORE BABIES? ang 
USA is currently at the second peak, 2003 , UK is currently at the 2008, ready to launch off! All caused by Dtap, an acellular vaccine, that is abysmally useless, and during an outbreak, which is now CONSTANT IN AUSTRALIA< ALL THE DTAP KIDS, catch carry and spread pertussis. so the ones meant to be protected, the newborn babies, are now ALL INFECTED FROM SYMPTOMLESS DTAP VACCINATED SIBLINGS. Oh the chart is for pertussis in Australia/ Western Australia, Australia, lucky US! got Dtap first in the world 1996. UK 2004, USA 2008. The graphs are identical, adjusted for time since introduction of Dtap. In 2012, we had double the number for 2011. Now we don't even bother to report whooping cough, Out of my grandchildrens two classes, 60 kids with whooping cough 4 reported it, and bothered to get tested. Yes that long lasting cough your kids have, if it lasts 6-8 weeks, yes its whooping cough. Not serious at all, the kids here still go to school., they are allowed to THEY ARE VACCINATED! ROFL XX Besides the ones coughing, are the ones we know to keep away from newborn babies, it is the Dtap vaccinated, that are not coughing that are the menace! Karyn Draper 
And yes I’m sure! He’s amazing and in perfect health. You’ll just have to admit you don’t know everything and take my word on it. ang 
So are you Karyn Abbey Chase, or Karyn Draper, you trolling skills are appalling, at least try and remember which alias you are damn using! Hilarious stuff! Karyn Draper 
I’m not trolling. Suck it up I have 2 id’s and this site decided it wouldn’t log me in through fb with the one I originally used. I tried several times but it kept catching this one so I said fuck it I’ll post using this one then. ang 
OK then I apologise. Disqus is notorious for blocking people, so why did they block your first alias? Karyn Draper 
Couldn’t tell you. This is the first article of theirs I’ve ever commented on. And the last. Worse than fb for sure. ang 
I agree Disquis is terrible. Anyway if you are in Canada, do you know when they switched completely to DTap, the old one, that worked was called DTP. So the important bit is the aP a meaning acellular, instead of whole vaccine. It is more of a GMO type vaccine, I was chatting on line to someone just like you in UK, and he sent me the raw stats, ie number of whooping cough reports per year, for last 20 years. I told him, that they introduced Dtap in 2004, and was spot on. The correlation is that clear. Do you have the stats, yearly for whooping cough in Canada? Our vaccination rate is 93% in Australia, do you know the rates in Canada. Oh, had an aunty in Canada, Ontario, right near Niagra falls. ang 
Hello Karyn, is you alter ego, another Karyn, weird you have two different surnames, did you just get married in the last 5 minutes or something weird? Karyn Draper 
You really wanna change the subject? That all your facts are wrong. K goodnight psychopath ang 
Posting in a few threads, nice to meet you Karen, you did explain the other thread why you have multiple aliases, I accept that. Did you know there is no polio in India, but Bill Gates has just crippled 40,000 by using a live vaccine, that is proven to spread polio. Why did he do this? ang 
Yes the latest is called z ika Brazil All pregnant women got T dap mandated 2014, vaccines were ready and begun My 2015. Women even 20 weeks pregnant in outlying areas got the jab. Look what happened 20 weeks later. Out of 5,000 sick babies, 5.000 got the jab while still in utero. Out of those 5,000 sick micro babies, 4 (FOUR) had zika, weird how CDC think people will believe it was a mossie? As for USA, they have more sick vaccine damaged babies than Brazil, they used to have 400 a year, after pregnancy jabs, they now have 25,000 a year since 2013. There is no zika in USA, so what are they trying to blame now, pesticides? Or are they going to say, oh, must have had that mossie in USA, also, but we just didn’t know? Centres for Disease Corrution…………. the latest paper they put out claiming OH ITS ZIKA, could have been written by a two year old. The real scientists in this world, cringe, at their BLANTANT FRAUD. ang 
Seems the troll cant remember what alias he/she is using, weird that? I write to a Karyn Abbey Chase, yet she forgets which alias, and replies as Karen Draper? Oh well they only have to have High School certificate, work out of India and get paid Rs7000 a month, yeah $20 a week! Karyn Draper 
Your an idiot… ang 
Add some information there, please, any reason why you believe MMR vaccine is safe? Any reason why you believe pollution, and contaminated with pesticides etc, food is the only reason for autism? I agree it could be one, but surely injecting a baby with aluminium, glyphosate, and all the other things, besides three different diseases, all in one shot, possible could be dangerous? None of my kids got the MMR, different vaccines then, they are all fine, all my grandkids got the MMR< now I have 4 out of 9 autistic grandchildren. Good on Robert De Niro for asking the right questions. Yojimbo

People are not allowed to be pro fact, because that costs the corrupt, lots and lots of money. Here is the graph for whooping cough Australia, first to get Dt aP ie part vaccine in 1996. Look what happened, 93% vaccination rate. Yeah, those vaccinated are the ones catching and spreading it now, over and over. So bad now, that these Dtap vaccinated people are just reinfecting the whole herd, so full of whooping cough, but they don’t get symptoms themselves until around 3 years after last vaccine. 5 jabs 5 years ….. So by 6-12 all the vaccinated kids are finally getting the symptoms themselves, coughing for 8 weeks, just annoying, not deadly, and then they are 100% protected with REAL IMMUNITY FOR LIFE. The problem is now, the herd is so damn constantly infected, the vaccinated symptomless siblings are the ones infecting the newborn babies, usually their newborn brother or sister. There is no unvaccinated lurking coughing person hiding in maternity ward corridors at all! That is pure fiction, siblings, no symptoms because of their vaccine, are spreading it to their little babies. CDC know this, Australia has known this since 2010. All they had to do was stop vaccinating, in about 3-5 years, ie yes by now, no more symptomless carriers, infecting babies. INSTEAD CDC DECIDED TO VACCINATE BABIES BEFORE BIRTH, WITH A VACCINE THAT KILLS THEM IF GIVEN AT BIRTH? That is why babies are so vulnerable, cant be vaccinated as it kills them…………. So what a logical person would assume would happen HAS HAPPENED. Babies after the jab die in utero, at 400 times the normal unlucky event. If they survive, they have a 1 in 50 chance of brain damage, called microcephaly. The mandated Tdap in Brazil in all pregnant women in 2014, the vaccine was produced locally under licence from GSK and they began jabbing pregnant women from 20 weeks gestation in May 2015, 20 weeks later look what happened? 5,000 of 5,000 deformed babies, had Tdap given in utero, and 4 (four) had zika. Now it is believed they got the zika, as they were already brain damaged in utero. Yet for some reason Centres for Disease and Corruption, seem unable to see this direct, and totally obvious 100% correlation, and have spent millions trying to prove a mossie done it. The only problem with the CDC theory, is that Dtap of pregnant women began in 2013 in USA< and USAs microcephalic births, went from 400 a year, to 25,000 YES TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR. But apparently CDC missed this? ang 
See comments below, tried once, said not allowed to comment, tried again a different way, seems to have worked, hope so! Doran Zeigler 
It’s good that DeNiro is taking this stance. But, he still could have used his influence in keeping “Vaxxed” in the TriBeca Film Festival. He caved in to industry pressure and took a lot of heat for it. So, it is good that he has clarified his position on vaccines. 
But, I would like to tell him, that if the manufacturers could remove the “harmful” ingredients to make what he calls a “safe” vaccine, doesn’t he think they would have done it and end the controversy? The fact is that preservatives, which are harmful to humans, are needed in the vaccines so they do not spoil. 
What would be a better topic to discuss is the entire premise of the vaccine theory which met a lot of opposition when it was first stated by Pasteur, and still is questioned to this very day. Tom Bowshall 
Are you sure about this? Only today’s West Australian 25/05/2016 authoritatively states that all vaccines are safe, and babies immune systems can cope with thousands of vaccinations and Gardasil is one of the safest vaccines ever produced. Mind you they also said GMO’s were safe and quoted two scientific studies funded by Monsanto to back up their statement. They also said TPP’s are good for our economy and we will all benefit, that was all no quotes or sources to back that up. Wonder if the West Australian newspaper is trying to do a head job on us? ang 
Well they been trying hard to get me from posting, Disqus more corrupt than even facebook, god help us! Karyn Draper 
Maybe cuz you talk to much. Your kinda spamming this comment section. I especially like the zero deaths from measles. Did you read the wiki pediatric site. I especially love how there were appx 2.6 million in 1980. And vaccines have decreased this by 85% so now only a outlet hundred thousand people die from it. ang 
Hello Karyn, nice to meet you. Am I not allowed to have an opinion, even though I am a pathologist, specialising in microbiology, and haematology, also a chemical analyst, and yeah I know my stuff. I don’t read wiki rubbish, that is all been damn trolled out by pharma, so much it is now just pure rubbish. Why should I talk about measles in the world? I live in Australia, we have decent sewerage systems, decent water, food, and hygienic living conditions. Where do you live that you have had measles deaths? Mumbai? Karyn Draper 
I live in canada. And you are mistaken again. Someone in California died in 2015 from measles and it was the first death since 2003 ang 
Ok one measles death in 12 years. That death, was a lady in hospital, who was fully vaccinated, and she had measles, with no spots, she infected others in the hospital, they were not aware she actually had measles until the autopsy. She had measles, and they didn’t even know until she died and did an autopsy? Fully vaccinated. 0101

10209,An Elephant In The Room?,"by Bill Holter, JS Mineset : 
Here we are again, just six days away from a major COMEX gold (and silver) delivery month with a huge outsized amount of contracts outstanding versus deliverable inventory. For a background, COMEX holds 2,083,000 (nearly 65 tons) of registered gold. This amount is much higher than it was last December when it stood at a miniscule 152,000 ounces (4.7 tons). 
Since May of this year, something has drastically changed in the monthly amounts delivered. For all of 2015, only 51 tons were delivered which amounted to about 4.25 tons per month. If you recall, many months would arrive at first notice day with a huge amount of contracts open, only to see the contracts evaporate before the close of the delivery period. I postulated then and still believe, contract holders were offered premiums to “just go away” and not take delivery. I cannot prove this but you must ask, why someone would FULLY FUND their account to take delivery and then not follow through. It makes no sense other than if they were enticed not to take delivery after placing the full amount of funds in their accounts to settle delivery. 
So far this year, 191 tons have stood for delivery, 168 of those tons since May. The average delivery since May has been over 24 tons per month with only two of the seven months being a traditional delivery month. June and August amounted to nearly 93 tons alone. The change since May has been astonishing. Rather than contracts being “bled down” each month (enticed by premiums offered?), nearly every single month has had more standing by the end of the month than were at the beginning of the month (nearly double in some cases). Another big change is, previously, the bulk of deliveries would be withheld until just before the end of the delivery period. Now, massive deliveries are being made on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th delivery days of the month. Please remember, it makes no sense to “wait” to make a delivery as storage fees add up for each day …it seems to me that it is now known that many contract owners cannot be enticed with premiums! 
So why has this begun to happen, why are more contracts demanding delivery and why are they jumping queue and opening more contracts during expiration? I believe it is simply because there is either a greater “need or desire” for gold. If I had to guess, I believe the new and different demand is in large part a function of the Shanghai Gold Exchange opening in September. Immediately after opening, we saw close to $4 premiums for gold (versus COMEX and LBMA pricing) and around .50 cent premiums for silver. These premiums are now recently much higher! For the last few weeks these premiums have grown to the $10-$12 range for gold and over $1 for silver. The premiums shot up on Monday to $20.33 for gold and $1.35 for silver. This is obviously more than generous enough to allow massive arbitrage to occur. 
As a side note, I have been asked why we are not seeing arbitrage en masse? Simply put, I believe there is a great risk here where you sell something for delivery without knowing positively you will be delivered on the buy side. Should the game end, an arbitrager might be contracted to deliver something (sell side) they cannot attain in a runaway upside market (because of the failure to deliver on the buy side). Curious that these large premiums exist as they should never exist …unless the players do see risk in a supposedly risk free trade! The premiums are now getting to large to ignore and look more like the elephant in the room. 
So where are we now for December expiration? Currently with only six trading days left before FND (first notice day), 217,000 contracts representing 21.7 million ounces versus 2.08 million registered to deliver. At the very same day last year, there were only 133,000 contracts outstanding or a difference of 84,000 contracts (8.4 million ounces). 
While we certainly cannot say the COMEX will default and not be able to deliver for December, we can say the numbers are much larger …AND so is the pressure (via arbitrage)! To again put this in perspective for you, the entire registered category holds well less than $2.5 billion worth of gold. I would ask you this, “how many $2.5 billion events have occurred”? The answer of course is too many to count and they happen every single day in many markets, and all over the world. The spread in silver is getting close to a 10% number, how long will the spread be allowed? The problem of course is this, when the arbs do come in to close the gap it will create buying. The buying will require delivery as the sell side in Shanghai will demand metal for their purchase. This poses the problem, COMEX inventories cannot meet Chinese demand. 
To finish, please keep in mind that the global credit markets are now experiencing extreme liquidity tightness. Previous “credit events” were ugly and all ended the same way …with more debt and more currency units issued. As we have seen in India, as gold has not been available since their recent kamikaze currency move, gold was changing hands at $2,900 per ounce on Friday and $3,600 over the weekend due to lack of supply. Ask yourself, at what dollar price will gold be available should someone (or collectively) put up $2.5 billion to clean out COMEX? Yes I know, COMEX is not the only market in the world. But a run on COMEX will be a run everywhere and will result in finding available gold nowhere. A “run” can start for any number of reasons. It can be “intentional” or not. The problem from a visual standpoint is this, the amount of physical gold behind the paper gold edifice is like a “BB” in relation to the financial Earth. If you don’t believe the global debt can ever be paid back in current currency values …dig into this one as it’s even more lopsided, paper gold can never be delivered by the real thing as the real gold simply does not exist! 
That will do it for this holiday week as I plan to take a little time off. Unless something really big breaks, Jim and I do not plan on our weekly interview and will resume next week. We wish you and your families a Happy Thanksgiving!",0

10211,Sleeping With a Weighted Blanket Could Help Insomnia and Anxiety | Underground Health,"Christopher David Leave a Comment 
Who would have ever suspected that pressure could help you sleep? Well, probably not in the sense that you are thinking. However, recent studies have shown that the pressure caused by weighted blankets could be very helpful in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety and many other health issues. 
The importance of a good night’s sleep can easily be overlooked in a modern world that is obsessed with productivity. We all find ourselves wrapped up in our jobs, families and daytime life that we forget how important a productive night of rest can be. Lack of sleep can take a huge toll on our health and our moods, thus hurting our waking lives. 
We all know how it feels to miss out on sleep. Worries enter you mind, and it seems as though your brain will not calm down. Then you begin thinking of how poorly you will feel in the morning if you don’t sleep. One thought follows another, and the whole process begins to snowball. Many of us have spent late nights on the internet, researching ways to help us fall asleep. 
If that is how you came across this article, we may be able to help. New research provides evidence that sleeping under a weighted blanket at night can help you fall and stay asleep. Although it is no miracle cure, it can be very beneficial for suffers of anxiety and insomnia who are simply looking for anything to help them get through the night peacefully. 
The reason this works is due to a process known as deep pressure touch stimulation, or DPTS. DPTS therapy is similar to what occurs during a massage. Deep contact with the skin and muscles creates a relaxing sensation in the brain. Like the comfort an infant feels when swaddled in a thick blanket, we grown-ups can benefit from a weighted blanket. 
“Deep touch pressure is the type of surface pressure that is exerted in most types of firm touching, holding, stroking, petting of animals, or swaddling,” says Dr. Temple Grandin. Grandin has done extensive research into the benefits of DPTS and is a pioneer in the field. “Occupational therapists have observed that a very light touch alerts the nervous system, but deep pressure is relaxing and calming.” Weighted Blankets 
A weighted blanket is not just a thick comforter. It is a cover specifically designed to be heavy and create a small amount of pressure. The fabric of the blanket contains plastic polly pellets, usually spread throughout small pockets, that adds weight to the blanket itself. It’s similar to Beanie Babies, except not as cute. 
In fact, the creator of Magic Blanket, a leading brand of weighted blankets, first got the idea 15 years ago when his daughter draped a Beanie Baby over his should as he was driving. 
“It was a lizard that was long and hugged my shoulder, and felt pretty cool,” says Magic Blanket creator Keith Zivalich . “I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if you had a blanket that hugged you that way?’” 
Weighted blankets were already being used to treat certain pediatric and psychiatric disorders, but normally only in hospital settings. Now Magic Blanket and other household weighted blankets are gaining in popularity. Most of them weigh between 10 and 30 pounds and some can even be adjusted. Now that they are being used more commonly, there are signs that they can be beneficial in the treatment of other health problems. How it Works 
The pressure of a weighted blanket molds to your body like a hug. This pressure not only helps to relax the muscles, but also creates a relaxing sensation in the brain. When this deep pressure is applied, the brain creates serotonin and melatonin. 
Serotonin is a chemical in our brain that is closely related to happiness and elevated moods. Many pharmaceutical anti-depressants work by helping the brain’s serotonin receptors. On a smaller scale, the effect of DPTS caused by a weighted blanket will have a similar effect. When we are resting, the serotonin will then be converted to melatonin. 
Melatonin is another biochemical agent that is naturally produced in the brain and helps us sleep. You are probably already somewhat familiar with melatonin, as it is the main ingredient in most natural sleep aids. 
When the body feels the gentle amount of pressure caused by sleeping under a weighted blanket, pressure points are activated that will naturally notify the brain to create more serotonin and melatonin. This is the basic concept behind deep pressure touch therapy and the main reason it is effective in reducing stress. 
This therapy is not only beneficial for insomnia. A study published by Occupational Therapy in 2008 delved deeper into how it works. The researchers took a sample of 34 people and separated them into two groups. One group slept with a 30-pound weighted blanket, and the other group slept with a regular blanket. They found that those who slept with the weighted blankets showed significantly decreased levels of anxiety than the control group. These results were confirmed by another study in published in Australian Psychiatry in 2012. 
Doctors in psychiatric, pediatric and geriatric hospitals have used weighted blankets for years as a way to help calm restless or irritable patients. Karen Moore, an occupational therapist in Franconia, New Hampshire and another proponent of DPTS says, “In psychiatric care, weighted blankets are one of our most powerful tools for helping people who are anxious, upset, and possibly on the verge of losing control.” Other Treatments 
Further research has indicated that this therapy can be beneficial in treating many other ailments as well. Because serotonin levels in the brain are the related to so many different mental disorders, DPTS could be beneficial in the treatment of: Depression ",0
10212,Army Approves Construction of Dakota Access Pipeline - The New York Times,"DENVER  —   The Army approved the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Tuesday, paving the way for an infrastructure project that has been surrounded by protest and controversy. Robert Speer, the acting secretary of the Army, announced the decision to Congress, saying he was ready to offer the pipeline’s owner a   easement on a disputed patch of land. The move drew outrage from opponents, including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation in North Dakota sits less than a mile from the proposed pipeline route. And it drew cheers from supporters, who said the planning process for the completion of the $3. 7 billion project had already lasted too long. The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, Dave Archambault II, responded to the decision by vowing to fight it in court. “As native peoples, we have been knocked down again,” he said in statement. “But we will get back up, we will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact. ” The pipeline is set to run under the Missouri River near the reservation. It is opposed by many members of the tribe. Construction of the route has become a global rallying point for environmental and tribal activism, drawing thousands of people to a sprawling protest camp and sometimes prompting clashes with authorities. They had objected to the pipeline’s path running so close to the source of the tribe’s drinking water, noting that any spill could poison water supplies for it and others downstream. Members of the tribe also said the pipeline would cross through sacred ancestral lands. The move comes two weeks after President Trump ordered an expedited  review of the pipeline, part of his administration’s goal of supporting fossil fuel development and lowering barriers for major infrastructure initiatives. The project would carry 470, 000 barrels of oil a day. In the decision, Mr. Speer said he would halt the preparation of an environmental impact statement meant to assess the effects of the pipeline, adding that he had sufficient information to support approval. The move will allow for the completion of the last mile and a half of the   project, connecting oil production areas in North Dakota to a crude oil terminal near Patoka, Ill. The pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners. The decision prompted immediate outcry from people within the protest camp, which now numbers about 400 people, according to Manape LaMere, 38, a leader living by the route since October. “All of our hearts are broken,” said Linda Black Elk, part of the protest’s healer council, in an emotional video live from the camp. “I’m just going to ask you guys to keep us all in your prayers. Pray for the water. Pray for the people. Pray for the water protectors. Pray for the tribe. ” The decision left some feeling whiplashed. Two months ago, under the Obama administration and in the face of global protests, the Army said that it would explore alternative routes for the pipeline. In a statement on Tuesday, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, a Republican, applauded the Army’s decision. “This is a key step toward the completion of this important infrastructure project, which has faced months of politically driven delays and will allow for safe transport of North Dakota product to market. ”",0

10214,The strange case of the Scottish ambulance found among the rubble of eastern Aleppo,"By Robert Fisk on October 30, 2016 Robert Fisk — The Independent Oct 29, 2016 Wrecked ambulance in Aleppo. Click to enlarge 
Moonscape. Desert. Blitz. The past 100 years of war have turned all our words into clichés. I rage at every reference to the Second World War – because it’s over, because Hitler is dead, because we won and because we shouldn’t dig up old graves to frighten future generations. But Beni Zeid is an exception. 
It goes on for square miles and it is total destruction. This was the last great   Syrian army and the Jabhat al-Nusrah fighters (yes, they are the Al-Qaeda of 9/11 infamy, although we have quite put that aside in our coverage of the Syrian war) as the door closed on eastern Aleppo and the siege of its people and defenders began this summer. 
Beni Zeid lies on a hill to the north of the city and its pulverisation is total. The words “Year Zero” comes to mind when I look at it. Factories, warehouses, streets of laced ruins , crushed apartment blocks, cratered courtyards and roads, and what the Syrians described as a Nusrah explosives factory, destroyed with a massive bomb. Dropped by a Syrian or Russian pilot, we shall never know. But its detonation scattered at least 70 red-painted gas cylinders across the rubble. 
The wreckage of industrial Stalingrad might be appropriate if we are talking in pictorial form, for there can be no repairs here. So crushed is the district of Beni Zeid that the Syrians will have to level these streets with bulldozers and start all over again. But the casualties were few; on 18 July this year, two Syrian army groups attacked this place from the north and west at almost the same time as they crossed the Castello road. 
They lost few men. They took no prisoners. And we all know what that means. 
They left the gas canisters where they were, ignored the craters and the cemeteries of streets and factories, and Beni Zeid became – as these places do in war – part of the front line, in this case   front line around besieged eastern Aleppo. The pain and grief of its surrounded people have now become the latest Sarajevo in our popular history books, although I notice that the equally cruel Israel siege of the Lebanese and Palestinians in Beirut in 1982 is left out when comparisons are made. I wonder why? 
Well, there we were amid this desolation of Beni Zeid when one of us spotted a vehicle that had been jammed by the bomb blast between the foundation walls of a factory perhaps 200 feet from the gas cylinders. The top of its roof could just be seen from the next street and it said “AMBULANCE” in big letters. In English. 
We turned the corner. The Syrian military had not touched it. No one told us it was there. The bomb that destroyed the “explosives factory” (primitive though the factory was) had blasted the ambulance into the wreckage. 
It was right-hand drive, so the vehicle was never made for Syrian roads. And it looked, albeit crushed, like an ambulance you might see on the streets of London or Manchester or Glasgow. But the registration plates were missing. 
We overuse the word “ironic” in war – I admit I used it again this week – but the giant transfer painted on the side of the vehicle, in English, quite took our breath away. “HAS YOUR HEART DIED ALONG WITH THE CHILDREN?” it asked in capital letters. 
What ghostly hand had plastered this frightening, horribly relevant legend along the side of this ambulance? I climbed in the driver’s cab. I clambered up the shattered ladder through the back. There was no sign of blood. 
But everything was in English. Fasten your seat belt. Even “DRINK OR DRIVE: YOU DECIDE” – which was not a question you need ask of the people of eastern Aleppo, since Nusrah and their 15 or so allied groupuscules (the figure is anyway contentious) are unlikely to encourage the pitiful civilians in their sector to touch alcohol. There were pieces of door frame and mudguards in the cab, but then on the right side of the wall of the ambulance was clear proof of this vehicle’s origin. 
This is what was printed in capitals in red ink: “THE SCOTTISH AMBULANCE SERVICE WILL FULLY SUPPORT THE PROCURATOR FISCAL AND POLICE IN THE PROSECUTION OF THOSE WHO ASSAULT THEIR STAFF…AMBULANCE STAFF HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO ABOUT THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT FEAR OF ATTACK…” 
Well, of course, whoever was going about their duties in this Scottish ambulance was very much attacked in Aleppo. As for assault or fear, there was plenty of that around Beni Zeid. There was rifle fire across this wasteland as we prowled through the ambulance and a big shell came crashing into the ruins a few hundred metres away as we inspected the vehicle and its contents. 
So we should perhaps help the Scottish authorities – let alone the procurator general – to solve the mystery of this ambulance. On the steering column was the code: “A 9014600104” (the first 4 was slightly scratched and might have been a “6”). 
There was a lens in the cab marked ‘CAMERA OXYGEN” which carried the code “BS. EN 737-1: 1988. MFD [manufactured] 02/2006. B/no 18192”. There was an “in/out” switch (perhaps for the rear doors), manufactured by ‘Linax’ in Denmark, the item coded “HB41000-00012” and marked “DATE: 05.11.22 [sic] IP 65”. 
The maker’s code was “O.C. 096451-0057”. And for what it’s worth, the back of the driver’s mirror – if that is what it was – carried the “vehicle identity no” as “E367 44-3-5068 210 EG” and then “wv1zzz2D 2L z 6H014667, TYPE 2DF 292”. 
But enough codes. This is a detective story, not a crime story. Many an ambulance was donated to Syria by foreigners at the start of its terrible war, always to opponents of the regime or the civilians in areas under their control. A sign in English on the cab of the vehicle read: “EID IN SYRIA” and the last Muslim Eid feast came after the destruction of Beni Zeid and the ambulance. So the vehicle could have been in Syria for more than a year. 
Was it sent in by NGOS from Britain? Was it brought in – yes, the thought struck me – by one of those selfless men and women who tried to help the people of Syria before Nusrah and its ghastly on-again-off-again ally Isis came into existence, and who then fell into the fatal hands of the very same Isis murderers? Was it used by the people of eastern Aleppo and the surrounding countryside and then later seized by Nusrah for its own use? There was no sign that it had been carrying weapons – and Nusrah, after all, has its own wounded. There are Syrian army ambulances aplenty in western Aleppo – and its wounded militia opponents are as worthy of medical help as any soldier once they are “ hors de combat ”, even in a civil war. 
So, until the Scottish Ambulance Service tells us to whom it gave (or sold) their ambulance – the procurator fiscal might find this out for us, although his writ does not run quite as far as Beni Zeid – this vehicle, built to save lives, will remain an unidentified skeleton amid the ruins of a Syrian bomb site. But the legend on its side remains to haunt us all.

10216,"Spokane, Washington Defeats Monsanto’s Motion to Dismiss PCB Lawsuit","Spokane, Washington Defeats Monsanto’s Motion to Dismiss PCB Lawsuit Nov 20, 2016 0 0 
For years now, high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have been documented in the Spokane River. These are a dangerous class of chemicals produced in the United States, solely by Monsanto, from 1930 until 1977. A lawsuit was launched by numerous U.S. cities against Monsanto in an attempt to remove PCBs from their waterways, and Spokane Washington was among them. In the most recent turn of events in the ongoing PCB saga, Monsanto failed to have Spokane’s lawsuit dismissed by courts . This is a win for the water movement, no less significant than the recent developments at Standing Rock. 
There have been numerous outspoken defenders of our water supply, and their voices have grown louder. This issue has become paramount at the Standing Rock stand-off where Native American ‘water protectors’ are standing up for clean water, along with a number of other unalienable human rights , but Standing Rock speaks to a wider environmental catastrophe happening all around us. 
Judge Mendoza who commented on the court’s decision stated, “The public harm at issue here comes from PCBs reaching the River, but the nuisance itself is Monsanto’s production, marketing, and distribution of the PCBs.” 
Lakes, rivers, oceans and groundwater supplies have been compromised more recently with fracking chemicals , lead, agricultural poisons including pesticides , herbicides , fungicides, and petrochemical fertilizers, PFOA and PFOS ( perflourinated chemicals ), as well as tainted with neurologically impairing fluoride , along with pharmaceutical company drugs including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones, but PCBs have been contaminating our waterways for nearly a century now. The seemingly clear Spokane River contains some of the most toxic waters in Washington. 
PCBs are but one type in the chemical onslaught we are being subjected to, but they are extremely dangerous. Congressman Gude issued a statement in 1976 which called attention to this contaminant: 
“The most important thing about PCB’s … is that we have identified a mad dog—a known bad actor in the case of PCB. There is no doubt about its toxicity and danger in the environment. It has caused millions of dollars worth of damage in the United States; the time has arrived to get rid of it.” 
Though the probable damage caused by PCBs has been known for decades now, with Monsanto completely aware of the chemicals’ health-damaging nature all along, there are still 1.4 billion pounds of PCBs that the company produced which haven’t been cleaned up. PCBs are an extremely toxic, persistent chemical that can cause cancer, neurological damage, immunological damage, and many other severe human health problems. 
Spokane’s defeat against Monsanto and the company’s attempt to dismiss responsibility for contaminating the entire planet with PCBs is an enormous win – on par with recent developments at Standing Rock. 
As the Spokesman reports , 
“The lawsuit, which does not specifically state what the city is seeking in monetary damages, also alleges that Monsanto is responsible for the high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in the Spokane River. 
Marlene Feist, the city’s utilities spokeswoman, called the suit “long-term litigation,” and noted that the city will spend $300 million to keep PCBs and other pollutants from entering the river in coming years . 
PCBs have entered the river by various means, including through commercial and industrial products such as paint, hydraulic fluids, sealants, inks and others.” 
A spokesman for Monsanto, Charla Lord, says that “Monsanto is not responsible for the costs alleged in this matter.” 
This is a contentious point, after all, since these international companies have no problem ruining ancient burial grounds, and destroying water supplies in the name of profit – all the while denying responsibility for any ‘collateral’ damage their practices (manufacturing carcinogenic chemicals, fracking or dumping oil in our oceans, etc.) cause. 
Spokane’s lawsuit names two companies that spun off from Monsanto in the 1990s, and joins other municipalities seeking damages from the company, including San Diego, San Jose and Westport, Massachusetts. Though monetary compensation does little to repair the environmental and health damage that has already occurred, it will at least force these corporations to think twice about polluting on purpose – a practice they’ve become habitual about. 
This lawsuit also brings light, the fact that Monsanto has not only damaged our agriculture through GMOs and their associated chemical herbicides , but that the multinational corporation has been in the poison business from the very beginning. Our water represents only a fraction of the damage this single company has done. It is time to put a stop to their war on human health and the planet at large. We can only hope Spokane finishes this lawsuit successfully and other U.S. cities follow, to start lawsuits of their own.",0
10217,‘Kompromat’ and the Danger of Doubt and Confusion in a Democracy - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Since the emergence of an unverified dossier with salacious claims about   Donald J. Trump, Americans have debated the ramifications of the arrival of “kompromat” as a feature of American politics. But those debates  —   for example, over the ethics of publishing the dossier  —   have often framed this practice as little more than a political form of blackmail, and one particular to Russia. In fact, kompromat is more than an individual piece of damaging information: It is a broader attempt to manufacture public cynicism and confusion in ways that target not just one individual but an entire society. And although this practice tends to be associated with Russia  —   the word kompromat is a portmanteau of the Russian words for “compromising” and “information”  —   it is a common feature of authoritarian and semiauthoritarian nations around the world. Specific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals, but in the longer term, kompromat serves the interests of the powerful, which is why it is often a tool of autocrats. By eroding the very idea of a shared reality, and by spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns to distrust leaders and institutions alike, kompromat undermines a society’s ability to hold the powerful to account and ensure the proper functioning of government. When Katy E. Pearce, a professor of communications at the University of Washington in Seattle, began studying access to technology in Azerbaijan, she expected to focus her research on how it could be a positive tool for promoting political freedom. But she changed her tack after encountering widespread fear of the ways that the government could use technology as a tool of repression. “When I was interviewing people, it kept on coming up and coming up,” she said. Kompromat is “a very cheap and easy way for the regime to demonstrate its power, and to harass people in a very visible way,” she added. That was a danger and a deterrent for the young activists she spoke to. But individual targets of kompromat are not its only victims, Professor Pearce said. It also harms society by diminishing public trust. Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King’s College London, wrote on Twitter that disinformation campaigns have “often deliberately blended accurate and forged details” to sow distrust and confusion. If the news media and public figures publicize lies, they lose their credibility as trustworthy sources of information. “There’s no reliable truth to rest upon,” Professor Pearce said. “Every piece of information you get is ‘possibly true, possibly false. ’” Degrading that trust can be deeply damaging. While in Russia in 2015, I was struck by how many of the people I met saw the world through a lens that I began to call the “prudent hypothetical. ” They reacted to all information, whether from official sources or thirdhand rumors, as if it might be true. I came to realize that it was a   impulse, a way to prepare for any potential outcome in an unpredictable, unreliable world. But they were also careful not to rely on that information, lest it turn out to be a fabrication. They trusted only the facts they had verified themselves, and only the people to whom they had close personal ties. I had seen the same thing in Guatemala several years earlier. There, spreading lies and salacious gossip to discredit one’s enemies is referred to as a “campaña negra,” or a black campaign, rather than kompromat. But the result was the same: Public trust had been so eroded that lies were equally capable of destroying the honest and rehabilitating the criminal. When it appeared that Yasmín Barrios, the judge presiding over the trial of Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, Guatemala’s former dictator, might convict him of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013, a campaign of coordinated leaks and rumors portrayed her as a corrupt agent of foreign governments, willing to discredit her country in exchange for personal gain. Leaks and rumors attacked Judge Barrios personally, but by extension, they also undermined the credibility of the justice system in which she worked. For example, the news media reported that the judge had been seen dining with “foreign women” at a restaurant in Guatemala City, and suggested that this was evidence of foreign influence on her rulings. In fact, the “foreigners” were Judge Barrios’s Guatemalan mother, her neighbor, and a nun who was a friend of the family. But the rumors had their desired effect: They discredited not only Judge Barrios but also the genocide trial. The Guatemalans I met knew that the stories they heard through the news media might be part of disinformation campaigns. But lacking better options, many still saw the world through the lens of the prudent hypothetical, viewing everything as possible and nothing as certain. When General Ríos Montt was eventually convicted, many saw him as a victim of foreign machinations rather than a perpetrator of genocide and crimes against humanity. (His conviction was later vacated on procedural grounds.) Professor Pearce said she saw parallels between the use of kompromat overseas and recent news in the United States. Although the Trump dossier purported to be a warning about kompromat elsewhere, she said, it could also be seen as a form of kompromat itself. She listed the parallels to what she had seen in her research: Its content is damaging but unverified. Its distribution was multilayered, with a website  —   in this case, BuzzFeed  —   publishing the unverified material and other outlets amplifying its impact by reporting on the ensuing controversy. The document also fostered uncertainty and division. Masha Gessen, a Russian journalist, wrote in a recent opinion column in The New York Times that the release of the dossier had allowed Mr. Trump to say that “there was no such thing as truth, only a battle of opinions proffered by different actors, each of whom strives to be loudest. ” For some Americans, the dossier sowed concern about Mr. Trump’s vulnerability to Russian influence. Others saw its publication as evidence that Mr. Trump was the victim of a disinformation campaign. That may ultimately be to Mr. Trump’s benefit if   allegations against him arise in the future. Americans were similarly divided in their views on the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s computer system. When Russian hackers leaked emails stolen from the committee, some saw it as evidence that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a victim of foreign machinations, while others viewed the documents’ content as confirmation that Mrs. Clinton was unreliable and dishonest. The leaks distracted from more substantive campaign issues and fueled public distrust and rancor. Many people in the United States traditionally see the leak of confidential documents by   like Daniel Ellsberg’s release of the Pentagon Papers, as a way to hold the powerful to account. We tend to believe that transparency serves the public good, and secrecy the interests of the powerful. Such a belief presumes that there is a fixed quantity of hidden information out there that the news media is or is not revealing. But in a kompromat society, incriminating material, real and fake, will be manufactured as needed to serve a political purpose. To smear a president, undermine a judge or sow distrust in an institution or process, all someone needs to do is create a set of documents salacious enough to attract discussion, persuade some corner of the web to publish them and then wait for the resulting controversy to be reported as news. That does not hold the powerful to account. And worse, it undermines the institutions that are supposed to do so. In the United States, Professor Pearce said, “grabbing on and holding to the truth is becoming more challenging. ” If kompromat becomes a more widespread tactic, public trust will erode even further. “A lot of the things that are good about the U. S. are because we have this kind of   scaffolding,” she said. “I don’t want to live in an environment where I’m having to really be skeptical of everything, like people in authoritarian regimes have to be. ” “Living like that is horrible,” she said. “It is exhausting. ”",0
10218,Yazidis to Anti-Trumpers: Where Were You During Genocide Against Us?,"Outrage over President Donald Trump’s executive order prioritizing refugee claims by persecuted religious minorities has puzzled activists from Iraq’s Yazidi community, who note the lack of major protests against the brutal massacre of thousands of Yazidis and Christians by the Islamic State. [Former President Barack Obama’s administration and the United Nations recognized that Yazidis, Christians, and other ethnoreligious minorities in the Middle East have been victims of genocide at the hands of the Islamic State ( ).  Nevertheless, opponents of the executive order (EO) have lambasted the religious minority exception, denouncing President Trump for giving preferential treatment to persecuted minority groups. The order bars the entry into the United States of visa travelers from seven   countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen) for at least 90 days and orders the U. S. government to prioritize refugee claims by persecuted religious minorities. The order, which has sparked protests and outcry across the nation, does not identify religious minority groups by name. However, Michael Short, a White House spokesman, told Breitbart News,“Yazidis would be covered under the EO as they are a persecuted religious minority. ” U. S. District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle has issued a ruling that temporarily blocks Trump’s order, which the Trump administration argues is primarily intended to strengthen U. S. national security. Breitbart News spoke to several Yazidi activists who expressed support for the executive order and argued that it does not amount to a Muslim ban, as critics argue. Echoing Iraqi Catholic Archbishop Bashar Warda, Mizra Ismail  —   a Yazidi activist with the Yazidi Human Rights    —   told Breitbart News, referring to opponents of Trump’s executive order: My first question for those protesters is: where were they when ISIS was committing genocide against the Yezidis and Christians in Iraq and Syria? ISIS killed and kidnapped thousands of Yezidis, mostly young women, girls and children. The ISIS jihadists also beheaded many Yezidis and Christians openly in the most brutal way and posted their videos on social media. What were those protesters doing then? I believe when ISIS committed all those crimes against the Yezidis and Christians, those protesters were blind. Another Yazidi activist expressed support for Trump’s order, saying it is necessary to keep the U. S. safe. “As a Yezidi, I am supportive of any genuine effort and precaution meant to keep this country safe and prosperous,” Gulie Khalaf from Yezidis International, told Breitbart News. “If a   ban on all refugees, including Yezidis, is what it will take to ensure that this country does not become full of residents who neither care for the values of this society nor its constitution, then let us have the   ban. Hopefully, that time will be spent to figure out who is deserving of the opportunities and the rights this country offers. ” The activist argued that the persecuted minority exception is necessary and does not subject Muslims to “discrimination” as many opponents of the order have claimed. “It is not breaking laws or going against any kind of values if Trump and his administration decide that endangered groups should be an exception to the ban,” declared Khalaf. A different Yazidi activist, Haji Hameka, stressed that the executive order is not a Muslim ban but rather an effort to keep America safe. “It is not a ban against bringing Muslim refugees to the United States. It is a security check to avoid the entry of terrorists from groups such as   and ISIS,” he told Breitbart News. “Trump is a real American Patriot who is putting America and Americans first,” noted the activist. “He has to protect, support, and save the United States. He was elected by Americans to put America first. ” Trump’s measure dictates that once refugee admissions resume after a   suspension aimed at improving the vetting process, the U. S. government, “to the extent permitted by law,” is expected to “prioritize claims made by individuals on the basis of   persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality. ” In other words, persecuted minorities in Iraq in Syria, such as the Christians and Yazidis, may go to the front of the line after the refugee program suspension is over. During the   suspension, the Secretaries of the State and Homeland Security have the discretion “on a    basis” to allow the entry of members of persecuted religious minority groups. “Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions,” argued American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero in a statement. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) have defended the religious minority exception. Meanwhile, Democrats like Sen. Diane Feinstein from California have denounced the directive, arguing that granting priority to persecuted minorities is unfair to Muslims.",0
10219,"Hillary Clinton Received Over 800,000 Illegal Votes, Research Claims - Breitbart","Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton received over 800, 000 illegal votes from noncitizens of the United States, according to academic research. [A study by political scientist Jesse Richman from Old Dominion University in Virginia found that 6. 4 percent of the 20 million noncitizens who reside in the United States voted in November’s presidential election.  He then extrapolated these results into support for each presidential candidate, estimating that Clinton would have received 81 percent support from noncitizens, therefore receiving an extra 834, 000 votes. The number of 834, 000 is significant enough to have tipped some of the closest races in Clinton’s favor, including New Hampshire, Nevada, and Maine, all of which Clinton won by margins of under 3 percent. It would also have reduced Clinton’s margin of victory in the popular vote, which she won by 2. 8 million by dominating cosmopolitan centers such as New York and California. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he would be opening up a “major investigation into voter fraud,” promising to “strengthen up voting procedures. ” I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and  …    .  —   Donald J.

10220,"U.S. Household Income Grew 5.2 Percent in 2015, Breaking Pattern of Stagnation - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Americans last year reaped the largest economic gains in nearly a generation as poverty fell, health insurance coverage spread and incomes rose sharply for households on every rung of the economic ladder, ending years of stagnation. The median household’s income in 2015 was $56, 500, up 5. 2 percent from the previous year  —   the largest   increase since   began in 1967, the Census Bureau said on Tuesday. The share of Americans living in poverty also posted the sharpest decline in decades. The gains were an important milestone for the economic expansion that began in 2009. For the first time in recent years, the benefits of renewed prosperity are spreading broadly. The data was released into a heated presidential race, where Democrats seized on the statistics to promote Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and undercut Donald J. Trump’s dark assessment of the nation’s  . “It has been a long slog from the depths of the Great Recession, but things are finally starting to improve for many American households,” said Chris G. Christopher Jr. director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. He said the gains had continued this year. The economic recovery, however, remains incomplete. The median household income was still 1. 6 percent lower than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. It also remained 2. 4 percent lower than the peak reached during the boom of the late 1990s. The number of people living in poverty also remained elevated, although it shrank last year by about 3. 5 million, or roughly 8 percent. Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University in St. Louis, said the new data “is obviously good news. ” But he noted that poverty and income inequality in the United States remained more extreme than in most developed countries. “It would take a lot to move that needle,” he said. The Census Bureau also reported that the share of Americans with health insurance continued to increase. It said that only 9. 1 percent of the population had no health insurance last year. Several states, including Alaska, Indiana and Pennsylvania, expanded their Medicaid programs in 2015, taking advantage of increased federal funding under the Affordable Care Act. Private sector coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered them better benefits. With the presidential election looming in less than two months, the annual report provided immediate fodder. “We lifted three and a half million people out of poverty, the largest   drop in poverty since 1968,” President Obama said on Tuesday at a rally in Philadelphia for Mrs. Clinton. “The uninsured rate is the lowest since they began keeping records. The pay gap between men and women shrank to the lowest level on record,” he said, adding, “Thanks, Obama. ” Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has repeatedly cited the stagnation of household income as evidence of a broader economic malaise. He did not address the new report directly at a rally in Clive, Iowa, but he said the Obama administration’s economic policies had failed. “Poverty is beyond belief,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s time to break up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation. ” The Census Bureau’s annual report, based on a survey of 95, 000 households, is the latest evidence that 2015 was a good year for the economy. Employers added more than three million jobs as the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent. Hourly pay increased by 2 percent, adjusting for inflation. Americans drove more miles in their cars. Even housing showed some signs of a revival. The details of the bureau’s report revealed that the gains last year were both broad and deep. Notably,   households saw the largest income gains in percentage terms. Real household incomes rose 7. 9 percent for households in the 10th percentile and 6. 3 percent for those in the 20th percentile. By contrast, the increase was only 2. 9 percent for those households in the 90th percentile. “You know the old saying, ‘When the economy sniffles, the least advantaged catch pneumonia? ’” said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research organization, and a former adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Well, that works the other way, too. The benefits of closing in on full employment disproportionately flow to the least advantaged. ” The increase in median income outpaced average income, which rose 4. 5 percent to $79, 263. The median income is the amount that divides households evenly between those that make less and those that make more. Average income is generally higher because some households make a lot more. The gains, however, came mostly from job growth rather than wage growth. More people are working, but many of them are still struggling to maintain their standard of living. Jeff Labruzzo, 56, said he was still earning significantly less than before the recession. Mr. Labruzzo, who lives in southwest Louisiana, treats building sites for termites before concrete is poured. The construction business remains soft, and Mr. Labruzzo said he faced increased competition from firms that employ illegal immigrants. He had five workers, but he recently let two of them go. “Things are to the point where I’m thinking about just closing up the business and letting my income drop,” Mr. Labruzzo said. As a veteran, he said he could then qualify for government health benefits. Last year’s income gains do not fundamentally alter the economy’s   trajectory. Growth remains slow despite the Federal Reserve’s campaign to stimulate the economy. Predictions of faster growth, followed a few months later by disappointment, have become an annual ritual. Both Fed officials and outside economists argue that stronger growth requires action by fiscal policy makers. But Democrats and Republicans are at loggerheads over the best steps, and there is little suggestion that a breakthrough is in the offing. “It is encouraging that our economic recovery is lifting Americans out of poverty and boosting wages,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. “But instead of building on this progress, Washington Republicans want to turn back the clock. ” Republicans responded in kind, presenting the data as evidence Democrats should step aside. “Today’s report is another disappointing confirmation that too many Americans are still struggling to provide for their families and reach their full potential,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “The federal government invests billions of dollars each year in programs to help   Americans, but more than 43 million people continue to live in poverty. ” The distribution of income in the United States remains tilted toward the affluent. Last year’s gains by   households were not enough to shift measures of income inequality. The data also was a mixed bag for minority groups. Poverty rates fell most sharply for   and Hispanic households, but their income gains were smaller than for white households. “One good year does not reverse decades of stagnation,” Mr. Bernstein said. “  and   households need a lot more than one good year. We need to keep this going. ”",0

To say that this is the election from hell is to insult hell. 
There’s been nothing like this since Washington forded the Rubicon or Trump crossed the Delaware or delivered the Gettysburg Address (you know, the one that began “Four score and eleven women ago…”)—or pick your own seminal moment in American history. 
Billions of words, that face, those gestures, the endless insults , the abused women and the emails, the 24/7 spectacle of it all… Whatever happens on Election Day, let’s accept one reality: we’re in a new political era in this country. We just haven’t quite taken it in. Not really. 
Forget Donald Trump. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Doh! Why did I write that? Who could possibly forget the first presidential candidate in our history preemptively unwilling to accept election results? (Even the South in 1860 accepted the election of Abraham Lincoln before trying to wave goodbye to the Union.) Who could forget the man who claimed that abortions could take place on the day of or the day before actual birth? Who could forget the man who claimed in front of an audience of nearly 72 million Americans that he had never met the women who accused him of sexual aggression and abuse, including the People magazine reporter who interviewed him? Who could forget the candidate who proudly cited his positive polling results at rallies and in tweets, month after month, before (when those same polls turned against him) discovering that they were all “ rigged ”? 
Whatever you think of The Donald, who in the world—and I mean the whole wide world (including the Iranians )—could possibly forget him or the election he’s stalked so ominously? When you think of him, however, don’t make him the cause of American political dysfunction. He’s just the bizarre, disturbed, and disturbing symptom of the transformation of the American political system. 
Admittedly, he is a one-of-a-kind “politician,” even among his associates in surging right-wing nationalist and anti-whatever movements globally. He makes France’s Marine Le Pen seem like the soul of rationality and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte look like a master tactician of our age. But what truly makes Donald Trump and this election season fascinating and confounding is that we’re not just talking about the presidency of a country, but of the country. The United States remains the great imperial state on Planet Earth in terms of the reach of its military and the power of its economy and culture to influence the workings of everything just about everywhere. And yet, based on the last strange year of election campaigning, it’s hard not to think that something—and not just The Donald—is unnervingly amiss on Planet America. 
The World War II Generation in 2016 
Sometimes, in my fantasies (as while watching the final presidential debate), I perform a private miracle and bring my parents back from the dead to observe our American world. With them in the room, I try to imagine the disbelief many from that World War II generation would surely express about our present moment. Of course, they lived through a devastating depression, light years beyond anything we experienced in the Great Recession of 2007-2008, as well as a global conflagration of a sort that had never been experienced and—short of nuclear war—is not likely to be again. 
Despite this, I have no doubt that they would be boggled by our world and the particular version of chaos we now live with. To start at a global level, both my mother (who died in 1977) and my father (who died in 1983) spent decades in the nuclear age, the era of humanity’s greatest—for want of a better word—achievement. After all, for the first time in history, we humans took the apocalypse out of the hands of God (or the gods), where it had resided for thousands of years, and placed it directly in our own. What they didn’t live to experience, however, was history’s second potential deal-breaker, climate change, already bringing upheaval to the planet, and threatening a slow-motion apocalypse of an unprecedented sort. 
While nuclear weapons have not been used since August 9, 1945 , even if they have spread to the arsenals of numerous countries, climate change should be seen as a snail-paced version of nuclear war—and keep in mind that humanity is still pumping near-record levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. I imagine my parents’ amazement that the most dangerous and confounding issue on the planet didn’t get a single question , not to speak of an answer, in the three presidential debates of 2016, the four and a half hours of charges, insults, and interruptions just past. Neither a moderator, nor evidently an undecided voter (in the town hall second debate), nor either presidential candidate—each ready to change the subject on a moment’s notice from embarrassing questions about sexual aggression, emails, or anything else—thought it worth the slightest attention. It was, in short, a problem too large to discuss, one whose existence Donald Trump (like just about every other Republican) denies, or rather, in his case, labels a “hoax” that he uniquely blames on a Chinese plot to sink America. 
So much for insanity (and inanity) when it comes to the largest question of all. On a somewhat more modest scale, my mom and dad wouldn’t have recognized our political world as American, and not just because of Donald Trump. They would have been staggered by the money pouring into our political system—at least $6.6 billion in this election cycle according to the latest estimate, more than 10% of that from only 100 families. They would have been stunned by our 1% elections ; by our new Gilded Age ; by a billionaire TV celebrity running as a “populist” by riling up once Democratic working-class whites immiserated by the likes of him and his “brand” of casino capitalism, scam, and spectacle; by all those other billionaires pouring money into the Republican Party to create a gerrymandered Congress that will do their obstructionist bidding; and by just how much money can be “invested” in our political system in perfectly legal ways these days. And I haven’t even mentioned the Other Candidate, who spent all of August on the true “campaign trail,” hobnobbing not with ordinary Americans but with millionaires and billionaires (and assorted celebrities ) to build up her phenomenal “ war chest .”",0

10224,USA Today: Hijab Emerging as ’Symbol of Resistance and Feminism’ - Breitbart,"The newspaper USA Today ran an article on Monday claiming that Donald Trump’s election last November has led to the hijab, commonly known as a symbol of oppression in the Muslim world, becoming a “symbol of resistance and feminism. ”[The piece predominantly focuses on the experiences of multiple Muslim women who have chosen to wear the hijab —  rather than being forced —   such as University of Maryland student Sameeha Ahmad, “whose very independence that drove her to cast off the traditional head covering has since drawn her to don one. ”  “I do believe hijab support feminism,” Ahmad is quoted as saying, adding that “the way you look at it from a religious perspective, it empowers you by strengthening your relationship with God. It’s a step you are taking to further yourself within your own religion. ” The author also quotes the view of Dalia Mogahed, a director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, which seeks to empower American Muslims. Mogahed claims that the “the ‘hijab oppresses women’ narrative is not only racist, it is also sexist. ” Mogahed adds that the “hijab is a choice by the vast majority of women who wear it, especially in the U. S. where there is great societal pressure to not wear it, rather than the reverse. ” Since the election of Trump, the hijab has emerged as a new symbol of resistance and feminism. https:  .  #MuslimWomensDay,  —   USA TODAY (@USATODAY) March 27, 2017,  Another student, Fatima Khan, who has worn a hijab for nine years, argues that her hijab “limits how much someone can objectify me and instead have the power to only be judged for my intellect, abilities and personality rather than simply my appearance. ” The backdrop to the article is Donald Trump’s election, which author Waseem Abasi argues led to “debate around Islamic dress has [taking] a new turn,” amid “policies from the Trump administration targeting Muslim immigrants. ” Earlier this month, sports brand Nike introduced a new line that includes a Hijab head covering featuring the Nike swoosh brand logo. “The Nike Pro Hijab has been a year in the making, but its impetus can be traced much further back to Nike’s founding mission, to serve athletes, with the signature addendum: If you have a body, you’re an athlete,” the company said in an announcement.

10225,Quandary in South Sudan: Should It Lose Its Hard-Won Independence? - The New York Times,"NAIROBI, Kenya  —   Tens of thousands of civilians dead, countless children on the verge of starvation, millions of dollars stolen by officials, oil wells blown up, food aid hijacked and as many as 70 percent of women sheltering in camps raped  —   mostly by the nation’s soldiers and police officers. Just a few years ago, South Sudan accomplished what seemed impossible: independence. Of all the quixotic rebel armies fighting for freedom in Africa, the South Sudanese actually won. Global powers, including the United States, rallied to their side, helping to create the world’s newest country in 2011, a supposed solution to decades of conflict and suffering. Now, with millions of its people hungry or displaced by civil war, a radical question has emerged: Should South Sudan lose its independence? As international frustrations and worries grow, some momentum is growing for a proposal for outside powers to take over South Sudan and run it as a trusteeship until things calm down. Several academics and prominent opposition figures support the idea, citing East Timor, Kosovo and Bosnia as places where, they say, it has worked, though of course there are plenty of cautionary tales where outside intervention failed, like Somalia and Iraq. The Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani recently floated a plan in which the African Union would take the lead in setting up a transitional government for South Sudan. Ideally, Mr. Mamdani said, none of the current South Sudanese politicians who have helped drag their nation into civil war would be able to participate, and the trusteeship would last around six years, requiring United Nations support. “The response to the crisis will need to be as extraordinary as the crisis,” he said. But there is one    problem. Many South Sudanese might not go for it. According to James Solomon Padiet, a lecturer at Juba University, most members of the nation’s largest ethnic group  —   the Dinka, who include South Sudan’s embattled president, Salva Kiir  —   are adamantly set against an international takeover. While smaller ethnic groups would welcome it, he said, the powerful Dinka see it as an affront to their sovereignty. For that matter, so does Mr. Padiet, a   scholar who is not a Dinka. He called trusteeship “offensive” because South Sudan has a potential crop of good leaders waiting in the wings who haven’t had a chance to rule. Still, Mr. Padiet conceded, the country desperately needs help. “As we speak now,” he said, “South Sudan is at crossroads of disintegration or total fragility. ” Clashes have spread to new areas of the country, and   militias are mobilizing in the bush. It’s all a staggering plunge from the country’s birth. I, along with hundreds of other journalists, was standing in a crowd that felt like a million people on July 9, 2011, the insanely hot day when South Sudan broke off from Sudan. The sense of pride, sacrifice, hope and jubilation will be hard to forget. For decades, South Sudanese rebels had battled the     central government of Sudan. They fought in malarial swamps and on sweltering savannas, incredibly hostile environments where it’s hard to survive, let alone wage a guerrilla war on a shoestring. The South Sudanese had absorbed bombings and massacres. The Arabs stole their children and turned them into slaves. As a result, many South Sudanese were scattered across the four corners of the earth  —   the famous Lost Boys, but also many Lost Girls, ripped from their families and forced to flee to cold foreign places that they had never envisioned. On independence day, South Sudan’s capital, Juba, partied until dawn. Lost Boys swigged White Bull (the local beer) next to hardened guerrillas bobbing their heads to reggae rap. All around us, there seemed to be a real appreciation of what had been achieved and what lay ahead. Most important, there was unity. That crumbled quickly, undermined by old political rivalries, ethnic tension and a greed for South Sudan’s one main export: oil. The fault line was the most predictable one, the Dinka versus the Nuer. The two biggest ethnic groups had alternated between allies and enemies throughout South Sudan’s liberation wars. Starting in December 2013, after a breakdown between their political leaders, who not so long ago had been hailed as heroes, Nuer and Dinka militias began killing each other and civilians across the country, especially in ethnically mixed areas. Women were raped. Children were burned to death. Some people were even forced at gunpoint to eat the flesh of their dead relatives. The horror has been meticulously documented. Still, it goes on. For years, the United Nations has stationed thousands of peacekeepers in the country, but often they have not intervened. In 2012, shortly after independence, I rushed to a remote town, Pibor, where hundreds had just been massacred by an ethnic militia. I saw one woman who was literally holding her arm together  —   she had been blasted by a Kalashnikov  —   as she sat in a medical tent that smelled of decaying flesh. She stared at the wall, not making a murmur. I interviewed peacekeepers who told me how they had watched civilians get shot right in front of them, yet the peacekeepers felt too scared to raise their rifles. United Nations officials in Juba have been excoriated for failing to spring into action and effectively step between Mr. Kiir and Riek Machar, the former vice president and the most influential Nuer, as their rivalry intensified and grew into nationwide bloodshed. This is a big reason some people think an international trusteeship will never work. “Having completely failed in the international   project, now we’re going to move to an international takeover? With what army?” asked John Prendergast, who has been working on South Sudan for 30 years and   the Enough Project, an   group. “Would the same international bureaucrats that undertook massive   experiments in Iraq and Afghanistan come to Juba to lead another failed political intervention?” he added. “It all seems fantastical, doomed and extremely unlikely. ” Other scholars take a middle view. Amir Idris, chairman of Fordham’s African and   studies department and a frequent writer on South Sudan, said an international trusteeship should be considered  —   but only as a last resort. He says the most important issue is that a new government be built with new people, including academics and technocrats. “South Sudan has no chance of transitioning itself to a functioning state unless the edifice of the current leadership is brought down,” he said. Bronwyn Bruton, the deputy director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, called South Sudan’s leaders “such a disaster. ” She said Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar were “corrupt,” “ ” and “willing to stoke ethnic conflict and commit horrible violence in pursuit of power. ” “Genocide is beginning to look inevitable,” she said. “The situation could hardly be more hopeless. ” But she worries that no country has the appetite to spearhead a meaningful intervention. The Obama administration considered several ways to help usher in a political transition, a former administration official said, but eventually concluded it was not feasible. It’s not as if Mr. Kiir or Mr. Machar or their inner circles, who are widely believed to continue to profit from oil and conflict, are going to volunteer to step aside. Thousands of armed men are intensely loyal to them, and even a few friends left in Western capitals make the case that the South Sudanese government has stabilized Juba in recent months, has become more inclusive and should be allowed to stay. One glimmer of hope comes from across the continent. In the last few days, troops from several West African countries banded together to eject Gambia’s president, who tried to stay in power illegally. If such resolve was demonstrated in this part of Africa, then maybe, the interventionists argue, South Sudan’s leaders could be pushed aside and the country would be allowed to breathe.",0

Speaking of Europeans Colonialism/exploitation and the Ottomans. Your Europe is only Western Europe. Eastern European countries were not colonizers. They never adventured outside of the continent either and never been in the slavery business. They were colonized, brutalized and saved by Asians inducing the Mongol Empire and the Muslim Ottoman Empire. So please refer to Western Europe only when you speak of Europe. Eastern Europeans were often the victims of none-whites and Islamic imperialism. Ever wondered why Hungary is not accepting any Muslim migrants? Attren 
Atilla, will you please be so kind as to reference some quality literature on this subject? I am most interested and want to learn more (eastern european). Thank you, brother. Attila 
Google the Mongol invasion of Hungary and Eastern Europe also the Ottoman period in Eastern Europe. Bob Btme 
I’m familiar with the story of the guy playing the trumpet in Poland who got the arrow in the neck. The history of the ancient cannabis- using Scythian marauders is also interesting, Bob Btme 
thanks Attila for educating us on that, I love history and barely received any during my 17 years spent in the USA public school system Rod 
The reason your not taught accurate history in school is that the book writers are formerly propaganda and car salesmen teachers. All one has to do is research the history of said companies like McGraw Hill and such. Sloane 
Attila is half telling the truth and half over-simplifying/lying Sloane 
Attila is clearly deranged. You shouldn’t believe much of what he writes. Daniel Sandman 
hmm.. wouldn’t the Visigoths count as eastern Europeans? They brought down the west roman empire and colonized it. And what about those Vandals? Attila 
There were many ethnic groups living in the Carpathian base or what is now Eastern Europe before Christian Europe was born. There were the Avars, Cumans, Gepids and many others who were pagans and did not have a state. They came and left. When Hungary and other Eastern European accepted Christianity and formed their own country that’s the time they joined Europe and stayed and had their kingdoms. That’s when countries become accountable. I’m concerned about Christian Europe because that’s what Europe is today. That’s what we protected and sacrificed so much for. Alejandra 
What do you think about your christian europe and the genocide at america? Attila 
You mean Western European colonial powers? As an Eastern European who’s people suffered genocide from Asians ans Muslims and were left alone to defend Europe and betrayed by Western Europe I say some of those countries owe us a apology. France formed the Franco-Ottoman alliance basically legalizing our enslavement by the Muslim Ottomans. They betrayed Christian Europe and us Hungarians and the Serbians, Bulgarians, Romanians and Poles. France and some of the Western European colonial countries were not true Christians. If they were they would not let us to be enslaved by the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Funny how France was the first congratulating Suleiman the Magnificent after he defeated the Hungarians at Mohacs in 1526. Yes slavery was legal in the Ottoman Empire and France had no problem teaming up with our slave master and have our country turn in to a wasteland. Eastern Europeans don’t think highly of Western Europeans. Eastern Europeans whites are proud people. niels groenbaek 
This old Europe was bad. France, Belgium did leave every country/territory in a mess Attila 
Just imagine. Europe was under threat of being conquered by the Ottomans. The sultans openly expressed their desire to conquer Europe and convert i it to Islam. They dreamed of converting the Vatican in to a mosque. Then you have France who formed and alliance with them. They truly betrayed not only the Eastern European countries who came under Islamic terror but Europe and Christianity as well. chris VN 
They’ve stopped dreaming about it and have been doing it by stealth for the last 50 or so years. John L. Wildman 
You need to shut the fuck up till you know what you’re talking about. Simona Mamo 
The Raiders of the Ottoman empire also regularly raided Malta. We are a small island in the middle of the Mediterranean sea and stole the locals for slaves. Besides butchering and pillaging. Rod 
Much like columbus did to us native american “indians” I suppose. Simona Mamo 
Lol. Well previous to the Spanish invasion for lack of a better word, they themselves had just liberated the Iberian peninsula(Spain) from the Moorish empire. Sad how people who have themselves had to fight for so long to free themselves from a conqurer yoke so easily become conquers themselves. In fact I believe I read somewhere that Isabella sent Colombus off in the hope of new trade routes to India as she needed money for her continuing war against the Ottoman empire.Trouble in one region always seems to spread. Diesel67 
War against the Ottoman Empire took a back seat to getting rid of Jews. Much of the Spanish Jews expelled in 1492 migrated to the Ottoman lands, so much so that the Ottoman sultan said in substance: Ferdinand calls himself a clever king but he enriches my kingdom even as he impoverishes his own. Of course all that changed when the Spanish conquered most of the Americas, plundered its resources and enslaved or killed the indigenous population (no worse than any other conquering empire throughout history). Simona Mamo 
Lol. Colombus actually took a Jew with him on his voyage of exploration. Sloane 
Well wouldn’t geography play a big part in colonization? From what port could Hungary go and control a colony in Africa? Do you count Russians as Eastern Europeans? If so, then you can’t say Eastern European countries were not colonizers. Attila 
Most of Russia is in Asia just like Turkey. Russia didn’t slave or colonized African countries and was not in the slave trade at all. They didn’t commit genocide against non Russians either as a colonizer. They didn’t go further then some of their neighboring countries. The Soviet Union was bad but a different animal all together. Russia is not on the radar of progressive liberals and black activist who are the most vocal about the crimes of Colonialism. If you insist maybe I could say countries that are in Eastern Europe only or entirely Eastern European or central-East European countries. Sloane 
Russia didn’t slave or colonize African countries but part of that is that they couldn’t because of the Western Europeans already there (Russians DID attempt to try to expand into/colonize parts of Africa – https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rpfwp/russian_colonialism_in_africa/ ). My point is that you’re oversimplifying history and victimizing Eastern Europeans in a thread about the Congo? Why? Have some respect and take your tirade elsewhere. Your post started with “Speaking of Europeans Colonialism/exploitation and the Ottomans.” This article wasn’t speaking about colonialism or the ottomans in general. You brought it in. “Hungary had ports on the Adriatic see for hundreds of years.” And you just proved how expansionist the Hungarians were! And people are supposed to have sympathy for poor E. Europeans because they didn’t get the chance to commit atrocities like their Western European counterparts? Give me a break! Attila 
You are one of those “useful idiots” aren’t you? Here is my solution for the idiots that includes many of the commentators also: Two words should not be used and those are WHITES and EUROPEANS. Instead use words like Western Europeans, Western European Colonial powers, Colonial Americans, Colonial Spain, England or what ever countries were the culprits. In the USA they should use words like European Americans, Western European Immigrants or Colonial Americans. Understand that your history is not our history and your crimes are not our crimes. Generalizing white Caucasians puts Eastern Europeans into the same category as a white slave keeper in colonial America hundreds of years ago or a Belgian murderer in Africa. It seems you have a sick need to drag down all white people and equal them to those who violated non-Whites. We are from the other half of Europe, from other countries with a totally different historical background and we have absolutely nothing to do with colonization and slavery. Do you understand the difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe? To put it simple: West was the colonizer vs. East which was colonized. I’m asking you to be considerate of us and stop the anti-white bigotry.﻿ If progressives keep using terms such as legacy of European exploitation, white racism and many other insults I encourage that you talk to Eastern Europeans such as Poles, Czechs, Croats, Slovaks and Hungarians and ask them what they think about the practice of generalizing whites and Europeans. They will tell you that you are embarrassing and you don’t talk on their behalf. Don’t be surprised if they express their disgust if you try to patronize them like you are trying me. Believe me the the West have no idea just how low opinion Eastern Europeans have for the West because the anti-white narrative and views the West holds. The more Eastern European EU countries become mainstream the more we are going to oppose you and will not going to put up with racism that we don’t deserve. You can bet on it.﻿ You attempt to get sympathy for the victims of Congo while you trash Europe will not get any respect from us. As per your comment about having a port on the Adriatic sea at the expense of other nations just shows how little you know. Hungarians never treated Croatia as colony and certainly didn’t oppress or violated Croatians. It was a union that benefited both countries especially protecting the borders against the Islamic Imperialist. Why don’t you ask Croatians about what they think about it, you useful idiot. Sloane 
Uhh I am half-Croatian,half-Bosnian, born in Dubrovnik, you fascist waste of air. I never generalized white Caucasians or “trshed” Eastern Europeans. Look at my comments again and you’ll see who was the idiot. I’ll save you the trouble – it’s you 🙂 I entered into a conversation with you to see just how bad your historical knowledge is – and that is VERY bad. Your original comments hinted at your xenophobia and racism and your further comments proved it. I wish you the best, I wish you would read decent history books from ALL OVER eastern Europe, not just Hungary. You may learn something, you may learn to be less fearful of change. Fear is the worst thing and your comments are brimming with fear – fear of migrants, muslims, etc. Bye Attila 
Bosnian? That explains it: you are a Muslim or a Muslim sympathizer. That explains why are in denial and trying to push your agenda. You are just another progressive liberal who protects islamo fascist agenda because that’s your heritage. Islam is the ideology of our former slave master and pure evil ideology. You know we were called infidel dogs by your kind for 150 years. Even now all you can do is just freak out and bark like we were still dogs. Why not put yourself together and give an honest argument and a fact based debate. But I don’t think you can. Sloane 
You lack basic reading comprehension. I am half Croatian, half-Bosnian. I am Catholic, not Muslim LOL. You have mental issues. Attila 
Muslim sympathizer on your Bosnian Muslim side is enough for me. That explains why you are in the same hate camp with the libshits. Good combo! Since you are talking about mental issues please take your medication and do yourself a favor and don’t skip again! Sloane 
What Bosnian Muslim side and hate camp? Do you even understand English? Do you know ANYTHING? Read my comments again. I am 100% Catholic. I told you to read up on history books, you are trying to defend Eastern European history when you don’t even know it. Croatia is 90% Catholic, Bosnia is Muslim, Orthodox and Catholic. I am half Bosnian Croat half Croat Catholic, so 100% Catholic. You retard. We in Dubrovnik remained independent and will continue to remain independent so we don’t have to fear the muslims like you do. The ones that are the most foreign, like you Asiatic Hungarians, are the ones most afraid of immigrants and are full of complexes as your messages have show. Goodbye now bozgor. Attila 
Still trying the fool me. Christian Croats live in Herzegovina and not the Bosnian side. Nice but a stupid try. It may have worked with someone else. I like your way of using the word Bozgor because it fits you. Really expresses your true intention and bigotry. I guess I should thank you for that. You know it’s not a bad thing to fear Muslims when they slaved and killed us and turned the country in to a wasteland just because we were Christians. I guess it does something to the psyche. Say hello to you Muslims neighbors and friends in Bosnia aIm sure you enjoy your time with them. John L. Wildman 
I agree. The more Atilla talks, the more stupid he sounds. Scooter McHeadshot 
Trying to include the US as a primary culprit shows your lack of knowledge and history. The US was at best a 3d string team when it came to colonies and military adventurism overseas. The ENTIRE problem of the middle east and africa can be lain squarely at the feet of the europeans, most notably the English and French, with honorable mention to the Germans, Dutch and Portuguese (and in the 20th century the Soviets) If you really think the Ottomans were 1.) holding arabia together and 2.) kept it peaceful, you have some reading to do. The Ottomans were barely hanging on the last 300 years of their reign, and fought against countless rebellions and foreign invasions due to the nature of their “empire”. Try reading “A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Turkish Empire and the Making of the Modern Middle East” by David Fromkin. Also read “The Arabs” by Eugene Rogan, it has a decent overview of the problems and shortcomings of the Ottomans. Diesel67 
The Ottomans lost their empire because they backed the wrong horse in World War I and because of local disgust with their corrupt misrule. Their fault. BTW, the Arabs and other Muslims they ruled over were not Turks and did not speak Turkish. Arutima 
10 millions? That’s cute. The British have beaten that just with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Where they used musket balls covered with pork tallow and fat, and buried Mughal Muslim troops alive with pork carcasses. Steve Haden

The reason this is forgotten is because it happened in the 1800s, with no radio, not a lot of press even, and certainly no cinema. The Congolese that survived probably mostly stayed in Congo. They were also black, so few white people at the time cared (they should, but in the 1800s didn’t) and few other people knew (they should but in the 1800s didn’t). 
The Holocaust in Europe happened to a very educated people (not judging, just stating a fact) of the which most survivers migrated to Israel and North America which means they talked and talked about it but not just among themselves but on radio in the USA, on movies like Schindler’s List and set museums not in Congo but in New York and established a state called Israel that made it a policy to spread awareness of the Holocaust. The Jews are also a people that are central to world affairs and always have been – again, just stating a fact without judgement (that’s true in science, politics, and many other areas). 
Therefore it’s not just an arbitrary or a racist fact, but the differences in both tragedies, that made the Congolese genocide (and many others) be forgotten and the one perpetrated to the Jews remembered. 
Compare that to Darfour, in the 2000s and yes, a lot more people know and have heard of such a genocide. So it is not just race, it is also time and place that determined memorability. Arron Frazier 
Your comment about whites calling themselves Jews being educated is attempted back hand slap at African people being unintelligent which is typical propaganda of white supremacist. First of the so-called Holocaust was plain and simple white on white crime and violence. The whites of Europe WW2 and back to the start of the Catholic Church committed alot crime violence and killing against each. It was constant warring disputes and etc. They where always trying to rule over each other or trying to rule of thew world know at that time. African people had nothing to do with that at all. Second the Congo and Africa have been the economic engine of western civilization since the 1400’s with slavery colonialism imperalism and now Neo-colonialism. Third your notion whites calling themselves Jews are and have always been central to world affairs is a lie. They are central today because of white supremacy leaving Europe in the 1400’s with slavery colonialism and imperailism. Whites calling themselves Jews where right in the middle of everything and in many cases controlling and leading things. Prior to that whites calling themselves Jews have been central to the affairs of empires civilization and peoples of the America’s Africa and Asia. They had nothing to do with the Aztec Incas Olmecs Mayans and varies tribes and nations of North America. They had nothing to do with Africa with ancient Egypt Nubia Ethopia Great Zimbabwe Congo empires Ashanti Zulus Nok and etc. They had nothing to do with Asia with the Chinese dynasties civilization empire nor the Japanese India Anka Wat and etc. What happen in Europe was nothing more than white or white crime which was common practice among whites WW2 going back over a 1000 years. Naten Vos 
But this genocide was not forgotten at the time itself. English journalists documented this genocide at the time which forced Leopold II to sell his colony to Belgium. So it’s not true that there was no press and no information. Of course it is true that information was much more limited than now or than information of Europe during WOII. It is ‘forgotten’ or less known now maybe because our interest is fading. And that is a sad thing. Btw: David Van Reybrouck wrote a history on Congo. Interesting read, also available in english. sabelmouse

The first few paragraphs do little more than harangue the reader and our educational system for not being familiar with an obscure king of a tiny European country more than a century ago who did horrible things in one of the most remote and impoverished parts of Africa. This is despite the fact that of the hundreds of nations that have existed in this world, many have done truly horrible things, but our educational system can barely cover our own country, with little mention beyond about a half-dozen others. Just how broad and deep do you think our educational system ought to cover world and human events? Speaking of which, what was the Ottoman Empire doing at the same time as this king? Irina Godunko

PATIENTS waiting for treatment in a Waterford dental clinic have informed WWN of the curious ration of magazines about boats to magazine about any other topic in the waiting room. 
Maguires Dental on St. Kenneth’s street in Waterford city appears to have four magazines about maritime affairs in it’s 9-strong pile of reading literature, with the remainder of the browsing material consisting of 5-year-old issues of Heat, Bella, and an Argos catalogue from 2012 with the back cover ripped off. 
Declan Hanlon, in for a filling, spoke exclusively to WWN about the difficulties in passing the time in the waiting room when one hasn’t got much interest in yachting or yacht maintenance. 
“I’m here over an hour like, and I’ve read up on Ashton Kutcher getting divorced from Demi Moore, the price of an electric shower, and how to make sure you’ve hired the right people to de-barnacle the side of your boat” said Hanlin, sounding kinda funny because his jaw is sore. 
“Whoever puts out the magazines, take a bow. I’ve seen some terrible reading material in waiting rooms in my time, but Jesus Christ this stuff is the worst. Trust me, if you’re coming to this place, you sure as fuck don’t need to learn about boat maintenance”. 
When pressed for better magazines in the waiting room, staff at Maguire Dental said they’d have a root around in a skip at the weekend, if they had time.",0
10229,"Babies of obese mothers at high risk of brain damage, stroke, heart attack and asthma","Babies of obese mothers at high risk of brain damage, stroke, heart attack and asthma 
  Daniel Barker Tags: parental obesity , children , health risks (NaturalNews) The growing number of babies born to obese mothers throughout the world face a higher risk of developing serious health problems in adulthood, according to several recent studies. Children of obese mothers are prone to brain damage, heart disease, stroke and asthma in adulthood, warn health experts.Obese parents pass on the tendency towards obesity to their children, creating a ""vicious cycle"" that warrants urgent action on the part of health officials, said the researchers of the new studies.The list of health risks is surprisingly long, including diseases like cancer, and conditions such as ADHD and autism .From The Guardian :""Four studies published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology make clear that the risks of maternal obesity include stillbirth, dangerously high blood pressure in pregnant women, diabetes in the mother or child, and complications during childbirth.""The scale of obesity in women of childbearing age and the consequent dangers to health were so great that urgent action was needed to ensure women were a normal weight before they conceived, the authors say.""Mothers being very heavily overweight could lead to their children having autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or developing cancer in later life, the researchers say.""Between 2011 and 2012 in the United States , nearly a third of women at peak childbearing age (20 to 39) were obese, and 60 percent of American mothers were either overweight or obese at the time they conceived.In Britain, where obesity rates among women are the highest in Europe, 20 percent of mothers were already obese when they became pregnant. In 2013, 26 percent of women in England between the ages of 35 and 44 were obese, as were 18 percent of 24- to 35-year-olds. Global obesity has reached 'pandemic proportions' ""Obesity has reached pandemic proportions globally and its origins start in the womb,"" said Professor Lesley Regan, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.Regan pointed to the fact that more than 25 percent of men and women in the UK are obese, and that the one in five pregnant women who are obese face an increased risk of ""miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death as well as gestational diabetes, blood clots, pre-eclampsia, more complicated labours and severe bleeding after the birth.""The researchers involved in the studies are concerned that the global obesity problem will only worsen, particularly in the developing world. It is estimated that more than 20 percent of women throughout the world will be dangerously overweight by 2025.One research paper warned of long-term ""profound public health implications,"" while another called for governments to begin treating obesity as a global public health priority.There is increasing evidence indicating that obesity during pregnancy can lead to a child being predisposed not only to developing diseases like type 2 diabetes and asthma, but also neurodevelopmental disorders like cerebral palsy.The complex interaction of ""neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and inflammatory"" factors in obese women are believed to affect hormonal exposure and nutrient supply to fetuses, leading to possible brain damage in unborn children. Searching for solutions in a world dominated by fast food and sedentary lifestyles The experts all agree that something should be done, but there are no simple solutions. Increased education and guidance may be part of the answer, but a number of aspects of modern day-to-day life are increasing the tendency towards becoming obese.Among these are an ""increasingly commercialised food supply"" (i.e. junk food), reliance on cars and public transport, dangerous and overpopulated urban environments, and the tendency to sit in front of TV and computer screens for unhealthy periods of time.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of parents to lose weight before giving birth to children and to set a healthy example for children as they grow and develop. But in a world of fast food and smartphones, this may not prove to be so easily accomplished. Sources:",0

10233,"With Both Parties in Turmoil, Britain Weighs a General Election - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Conservative Party candidates to succeed David Cameron as prime minister started putting themselves forward on Wednesday. The Labour Party was descending further into civil war over whether its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, can keep his job while most Labour legislators want him to quit. Given the chaos, there is growing talk that the endgame for Britain’s political crisis could be another general election, perhaps as soon as this fall, in an effort to bring some clarity to the nation’s leadership and direction after the vote last week to leave the European Union. The current Parliament, elected in May 2015, still has nearly four years of its   term to run. But once the Conservatives settle on a successor to Mr. Cameron, a process that is likely to play out by September, the new prime minister may well want to secure his or her own electoral mandate, especially given the sharp turn Britain has taken and the conflicts over how and whether to proceed with the process of decoupling from Europe. But even the question of an early general election is proving divisive. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and a leader of the “Leave” campaign, has been canvassing fellow Conservative members of Parliament, seeking support for his candidacy and getting their views on the advantages of an early general election. But his main rival, Theresa May, the home secretary, who supported staying in the European Union, is considered more of a continuity candidate and may not want to go back to voters so soon, a view shared by Conservatives who were elected to their seats for the first time 13 months ago. But it is the prospect of a quick election that has motivated Labour members in Parliament to try to oust their party leader, Mr. Corbyn, voting overwhelmingly on Tuesday for a motion of no confidence in him that is a necessary prelude to a leadership contest. The rebels fear that under Mr. Corbyn, 67, a leftist who has repudiated what remained of the centrist New Labour movement of the Tony Blair era, the party will be crushed and they will lose their seats with an even worse showing than in last year’s general election, when the Conservatives won an outright majority. About   of Labour’s shadow cabinet, made up of senior legislators who speak on policy for the party, have resigned this week, trying to force Mr. Corbyn to step down. Mr. Corbyn has refused. He has said he will seek another mandate from the   members and supporters of Labour, who elected him by a substantial margin in the first place. But it is unclear whether he remains as popular among the rank and file after leading a halfhearted campaign to keep Britain in the European Union, when many traditional Labour voters chose to stay home or vote against the party’s position. The outcome of any contest would also depend on whom the more centrist Labour legislators find to run against Mr. Corbyn. That may be Angela Eagle, a senior figure of the softer left and the daughter of a printworker, or a more centrist figure like Tom Watson, who was elected deputy leader last year. Other possible contenders include Dan Jarvis and Chuka Umunna, both of whom decided not to run against Mr. Corbyn last year, or Yvette Cooper, who did and lost. Mr. Corbyn has “no plan for a looming general election,” Ms. Cooper said on Tuesday, urging him to resign quickly. “Jeremy would be letting down Labour voters and communities across the country who badly need a strong Labour voice right now, and who badly need a Labour government, if he drags this out any longer,” Ms. Cooper said. “I hope he does the right thing in the party and stands down swiftly because we cannot drift and leave” the Conservatives “to shape Britain’s future. ” In Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Cameron got in on the act, calling on Mr. Corbyn to quit and attributing to him some of the blame for the outcome of the referendum. “It might be in my party’s interest for him to sit there,” Mr. Cameron said. “It’s not in the national interest. And I would say, ‘For heaven’s sake man, go!’ ” For the Conservatives, there is at least a clear path toward a new leader, and Mr. Johnson and Ms. May are clear favorites. But party history suggests that favorites sometimes founder. Stephen Crabb, 43, who was recently appointed work and pensions secretary and is an    politician with a   background, has also announced his candidacy, backed by the business secretary, Sajid Javid, 46, the son of a bus driver from Pakistan. Others are likely to declare, including Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary. Under the British system, the naming of a new prime minister from the governing party does not require a new general election. The prime minister, after all, is just the first among equals, a legislator chosen by colleagues to lead them. Parliament’s sovereignty is supreme. But in practice, the British system has become a great deal more presidential and personality driven, so individual mandates have come to seem more important. Nearly four years without one would be a long time, especially given all the uncertainties attached to leaving the European Union and the hard choices ahead. Some say they believe that no new leader would enjoy legitimacy without an early election. “It surely cannot be right, as a matter of democratic principle, that only members of the Conservative Party, constituting 0. 003 percent of the total electorate, should have a say in electing a new prime minister,” said Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, who served as deputy prime minister to Mr. Cameron in a coalition government until last year’s general election. Others argue that Britain is in a special situation, having voted against membership of the European Union yet having little notion of what would replace it. Before any new election, they say, the new prime minister should first negotiate a deal extracting Britain from the bloc, and then seek endorsement of it from the voters. Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers, said that “these are difficult judgments to make,” but he added: “We have a big and complicated task to accomplish. I think that it’s entirely reasonable to expect that we, the government, should embark on that, get on with it, seek to negotiate as good an outcome as we can before the people are asked then to approve or reject that at a general election. ” But that is a   option for an incoming prime minister who is likely to find that he or she cannot deliver what many of those who voted for a British exit, or “Brexit,” were promised or expected. Even more, if a damaged Mr. Corbyn survives the coup attempt against him, the temptation among Conservatives to rush to the polls while Labour is so weak will be almost irresistible. But a bigger lesson has been drawn from the transfer of power in June 2007, when Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair as prime minister with so much support in the Labour Party that there was no internal vote. In the fall of that year, Mr. Brown appeared set to call a general election to win his own democratic mandate, only to pull back when his lead in the opinion polls began to shrink. That moment of indecision was seen as a fatal error from which his premiership never recovered. His authority diminished, and he lost an election in 2010. While those leaders effectively had freedom to call general elections when they wanted, the situation changed with new legislation that came into being in 2011. This law lays down a   parliamentary term. Early elections can be held if agreed to by at least   of all lawmakers. There is an alternative provision that allows for an election if a motion of no confidence is passed in Parliament, and no new government is installed within two weeks. These rules have never been tested. But the Conservatives could decide to bring themselves down in a vote of no confidence and Labour would be unable to command a majority, so new elections would be held. Alternatively, a   majority would probably be attainable. Opposition lawmakers would be unlikely to block an early election because that would mean insisting that a prime minister without a popular mandate stay in power and make them look like they were afraid of the voters. Parliament ultimately has the power to overturn these rules and pass a new law altering or abrogating the old one. That would be   but if an incoming prime minister wants to call an election badly enough, it could happen.",0
10234,Russian Intervention in American Election Was No One-Off - The New York Times,"The intelligence agencies’ report on the Russian intervention in the American presidential election portrays it as just one piece of an     propaganda campaign. But it was a campaign made enormously more powerful by the tools of the cyberage: private emails pilfered by hackers, an internet that reaches into most American homes, social media to promote its revelations and smear enemies. What most Americans may have seen as a   effort  —   brazen meddling by Russia in the very core of American democracy  —   was, the report says, only part of a   information war that involves not just shadowy hackers and   websites, but also more conventional news outlets, including the thriving Russian television network RT. The election intervention to damage Hillary Clinton and lift Donald J. Trump was the latest fusillade in a campaign that has gone on under the radar for years. For the three agencies that produced the report  —   the C. I. A. the F. B. I. and the National Security Agency  —   this is a   moment: They have just told their new boss that he was elected with the vigorous, multifaceted help of an adversary, the thuggish autocrat who rules Russia. “Putin and the Russian government aspired to help   Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” the report says, in unusually blunt and sweeping language. Perhaps most arresting is the assessment that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, sees the election attack as payback  —   not offense, but defense. He has borne a serious grudge against Mrs. Clinton, who he believes denigrated him when she was secretary of state and encouraged the   protests in Moscow that erupted against him in 2011. Mr. Putin, the report says, sees the hidden hand of the United States in the leaking of the Panama Papers, files stolen from a law firm that exposed the wealth of his closest associates, secreted in offshore accounts. He even blames the United States for the exposure  —   carried out mainly by international sports authorities  —   of Russian athletes for their widespread use of   drugs. “From the Russian perspective, this is punching back,” said Christopher Porter, a former C. I. A. officer who now studies cyberattacks at the firm FireEye. “We may not think that’s fair or justified, but that’s the way they see it. ” Mr. Porter said Mr. Putin had made no secret of his view that the United States, by promoting democracy in countries like Ukraine and Georgia, had interfered in Russia’s backyard and was trying to undermine its power. What is missing from the public report is what many Americans most eagerly anticipated: hard evidence to back up the agencies’ claims that the Russian government engineered the election attack. That is a significant omission: Mr. Trump has been expressing skepticism for months that Russia was to blame, variously wondering whether it might have been China, or a   guy, or a guy from New Jersey. There is only a whisper of dissent in the report  —   the eavesdroppers of the N. S. A. believe with only “moderate confidence” that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump, while their colleagues at the C. I. A. and the F. B. I. have “high confidence. ” While most of Congress and much of the public appears to accept the agencies’ findings, Mr. Trump’s prominent doubts, accompanied at times by scorn for the agencies’ competence, has rallied a diverse array of skeptics on the right and the left. Under the circumstances, many in Washington expected the agencies to make a strong public case to erase any uncertainty. Instead, the message from the agencies essentially amounts to “trust us. ” There is no discussion of the forensics used to recognize the handiwork of known hacking groups, no mention of intercepted communications between the Kremlin and the hackers, no hint of spies reporting from inside Moscow’s propaganda machinery. At the top of every page of the report is a disclaimer that acknowledges what is missing: “This report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment, but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign. ” It offers an obvious reason for leaving out the details, declaring that including “the precise bases for its assessments” would “reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future. ” The absence of any proof is especially surprising in light of promises on Thursday from the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. that he would “push the envelope” to try to make more information public. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama had directed officials to “make as much of it public as they possibly can. ” That will not be enough for many, as the initial reaction showed. While some welcomed the scope of the report, many others were disappointed. “This is big: CIA, NSA  FBI publish perhaps the most   intelligence community assessment in US history,” Thomas Rid, a professor at King’s College London and an expert on cyberwarfare, wrote on Twitter. But Susan Hennessey, a former intelligence agency lawyer who is now the managing editor of the online journal Lawfare, wrote: “The unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention. ” Though the unclassified report is 25 pages long, counting the covers and several blank pages, the core analysis runs just five pages. That is less than the   “annex” devoted to RT America, the television network. It is a description of the broadcaster from an intelligence report written in 2012, years before the   hacking took place. The agencies “have taken an   look at the broader Russian strategy,” said Mr. Porter, the former C. I. A. officer. The detailed description of RT’s tactics, though years old, he added, was included because they fit that strategy. Mr. Trump may have been persuaded by his classified briefing on Friday on the Russian attack, which included everything that the unclassified report leaves out, even if the statement he issued afterward seemed lukewarm. But this report is unlikely to change the minds of skeptics who, like the   remember the intelligence agencies’ faulty assessments on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and fear being misled again.",0

10237,"A Shooting, the Hospital and Then, Months Later, It’s a Homicide - The New York Times","The gunshot survivor, frozen from the waist down, a .  bullet lodged between his left kidney and lowermost rib, lay on a hospital bed looking at mug shots of South Bronx gang members. Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo asked the man whether he could pick out his shooter. “Yep,” Bruce Purdy answered, looking spent. Then he handed back the 8     booklet, with 23 photos. “Who?” Mr. Purdy would not say. Soon, he told Sgt. LoPuzzo, the police would hear about a crazy man in a wheelchair shooting the person who had put him there. “Then you’ll know who it was,” Mr. Purdy said. The   threat only hinted at Mr. Purdy’s scorn for the system. Raised during a crack plague, he was a child of government institutions  —   a   foster homes, a city jail, six state prison facilities, public housing    —   who, at 29, had landed at yet another: Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, a red brick monument to both   emergency treatment and overburdened recovery care where most gunshot victims in the South Bronx are taken. Detectives began to make regular trips to Mr. Purdy’s bedside in Room 6C at the hospital after the shooting in October. But he was unswayed: Having been robbed of sex and the use of his legs, he said, all he had to look forward to was getting revenge. Then one night in December, a week after Mr. Purdy had left the hospital against doctors’ orders with little more than a basic wheelchair, he fell short of breath, was picked up by an ambulance and, in the same emergency room that had tended to his gunshot wound, died of a blood clot. A   investigation by the New York City medical examiner traced the fatal clot to the shooting, and on March 14, Mr. Purdy’s death was added to this year’s homicide tally for the 40th Precinct, a section of the South Bronx where violence takes diverse paths to death. To understand what drives such violence, The New York Times is documenting each murder logged in the 40th Precinct this year. The killing of Mr. Purdy counted as the fourth homicide there two more have since been recorded, making the 40th the   precinct in New York City in 2016. Mr. Purdy’s murder is perhaps the precinct’s truest mystery this year. The killer remains on the loose, the beneficiary of a lack of cameras outside the public housing building near where Mr. Purdy was shot and a reluctance on the part of his companions and other witnesses to cooperate with the police. He carried his silence to the grave. Beyond the detectives, Mr. Purdy also gave up on Lincoln Medical Center in his last weeks. He resisted physical therapy. He told relatives he had been left to lie for hours in his own excrement. He lit his bedsheets on fire, and cursed and yelled at doctors to send him home. The hospital, in turn, said in medical records that it was unable to do more for Mr. Purdy. Doctors tried for weeks to find a bed at a rehabilitation center  —   especially difficult for patients on Medicaid  —   only to have him change his mind on the day of his discharge and go home. He told a nurse he planned to kill himself but was never admitted to a psychiatric ward. The records are not clear about whether he went home with a prescription for   medicine his mother said he did not. Saving Mr. Purdy from a bullet in the back was not enough. The poor pockets of the Bronx from which he carved his itinerant life created hurdles that made it hard for a gunshot survivor to stay alive. Mr. Purdy’s long path to death wound through a bathtub in a   project where a brother lifted his limp 181 pounds in and out of the water. Before that, Mr. Purdy lingered for six weeks at Lincoln Medical Center, a   hospital for trauma care that  —   like many institutions across the country  —   struggles to care for paraplegics. “This is just another case where society’s ability to care for people in a multidisciplinary way is not always so perfect, especially in underserved populations,” said Dr. Ronald Simon, the former chief of Lincoln’s trauma division and one of the doctors who oversaw Mr. Purdy’s treatment. While the challenges of his care illuminate broad problems in how the health care system treats the poor and permanently disabled, Dr. Simon and outside medical experts said the hospital appeared to have met the relevant treatment standards and that Mr. Purdy might have unwittingly hastened his death by leaving. He spent much of his last 47 days trying to prove he could return from injury and get justice on his own, without the help of doctors or detectives. Mr. Purdy’s mother, Thelma Johnson, believes her son would still be alive had doctors treated him more thoroughly at discharge. “When he left,” she said, “they didn’t do nothing but give him a wheelchair. ” Hanging on her wall at a homeless shelter on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx is a red   she pulled off his body in the emergency room, near a box containing his ashes. “One day,” she said, “I’m going to get some money and buy an urn for them. ” Mr. Purdy was shot in a void: a stretch of sidewalk unwatched by the city’s extensive   surveillance equipment, outside the reach of cameras, floodlights or gunshot detectors. It was 9 p. m. on Oct. 28, and he had been hanging out in Apartment 3C at 517 East 144th Street, a   building at the Betances Houses, a   project. He was with Yesenia Figueroa, the wife of his best friend, Shamel Robinson. The two had gone to court earlier after Mr. Robinson was arrested in the apartment early that day for having a loaded   .  pistol. (Mr. Robinson told officers he had gotten the gun after an argument at a bodega, according to court papers.) Mr. Purdy stepped outside to get chips and a soda. Ms. Figueroa, who has a history of arrests for prostitution, stayed inside. The apartment  —   sparsely decorated, with a curtain marking off one area  —   is home to a cast of transients. Mr. Purdy told detectives at one point that Ms. Figueroa was his fiancée, though she told a reporter they were only close friends. Steps from the building’s front door, a gunman came up from behind and fired two shots, the second going deep into Mr. Purdy’s back. He fell between two parked cars. “RRN!” the gunman yelled, Mr. Purdy told detectives, referring to a gang that, the police said, reigns in the Betances Houses and was behind a surge in shootings in the 40th Precinct that hit a recent peak of 72 in 2011 amid a feud with gang members from the nearby Moore Houses. Mr. Purdy told his sister Precious Parker that the gunman also screamed, “You on my block. ” Mr. Purdy told detectives that he had thought about playing dead, but it was too late. His eyes were still open and twitching when the gunman stood over his body. Then, inexplicably, the gunman uncocked his pistol and walked away. “I’m shot. I’m down, Miss, I’m down. Please,” Mr. Purdy told a 911 operator on his cellphone as he lay there alone. The operator mixed up the street name Mr. Purdy repeated it. When she asked him several times who shot him, he said he did not know. He grew more desperate as seconds ticked by. “Ma’am, ma’am, hurry up, there’s people coming,” he said. “Please hurry up. ” Of the gunman, he said: “They ran off, I think. I’m afraid. ” There was no blood at the scene the slug had spared major blood vessels on the way to Mr. Purdy’s spine. At the hospital, Mr. Purdy lurched between being depressed and being sanguine about his recovery, according to medical records his mother received. He had once dreamed of being a doctor and had studied nursing in prison. Now he was a case study in the physical devastation and psychological ripples that result from surviving a shooting. The bullet had shattered two of the strongest vertebrae, in the small of his back, nudging his spinal cord to the right. He lost movement and feeling in his lower half. Roughly one in four trauma cases at Lincoln Medical Center involve penetrating trauma  —   gunshots or knife wounds  —   compared with about 5 percent at most private hospitals, and so a trauma surgeon is always on duty. Mr. Purdy spent his time in Room 6C learning to shift from his bed to a wheelchair and being taught to insert a catheter to urinate. On Nov. 5, the day he was to have the bullet removed, he declined to be operated on, a decision that may have increased his back pain later. Doctors deemed him a “very high risk” for deep vein thrombosis, or blood clots in the legs, a notorious danger for paraplegics that stems from the loss of movement. He was treated with Lovenox, an injectable drug to prevent blood clots. Doctors say typical standards call for such patients to continue preventive treatments for at least three months, possibly six, sometimes forever. Starting around 2004, the city’s public hospitals undertook a   effort to address what Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, a trauma specialist who helped lead the push, called a “national problem” of failing to prevent deep vein thrombosis. He said city hospitals had raised their compliance rate above 90 percent. Reeling from his injury, Mr. Purdy clashed with medical staff members, refusing at first to discuss his family situation or mental state. Two days after the shooting he threatened to slide onto the floor unless someone brought him a wheelchair. Doctors said he had adjustment disorder, a response to   trauma. Mr. Purdy’s mother said his cousins took him cigarettes to smoke in bed. Having lost control of his bowel movements, he told relatives that nurses had left him sitting in his own excrement for hours. On Nov. 19 at around 2 p. m. a social worker, Maria   told him that he had not been doing physical therapy sessions. He replied that an attendant had tried to take him to therapy without cleaning the stool he had been lying in for three hours. He recorded his   conversation with Ms.   and a physical therapist, Michael Santoro. Mr. Purdy says of the physical therapy, “How am I going to go if I’m sitting in” excrement? On the video, Mr. Santoro can be heard telling Mr. Purdy his health has improved and that he can go home, but Mr. Purdy asks how they know. He says he has not seen them in five days. Ms.   replies, “You saw me like four days ago, not counting the weekend. ” They ask Mr. Purdy whether he can think of any other equipment he would need. Mr. Purdy sounds confused. They abruptly end the conversation, making preparations for Mr. Purdy’s discharge, possibly the next day. “The discussion was scattered, superficial, totally disconnected  —   it’s pathetic,” said Dr. Kurtz, former director of service for trauma and surgical critical care at Kings County Hospital Center and one of three doctors who reviewed the video and Mr. Purdy’s medical records at the request of The New York Times. He cautioned that the encounter showed only a snapshot of his care. “It’s a religion to take care of a spinal cord patient. It’s a massive undertaking. ” The city hospital system said in a statement, “The video demonstrates that the hospital staff were actively developing a safe and appropriate discharge plan. ” Mr. Santoro, asked about the video, said: “I gave him the best care I could, we all did. There was no improper care by me. ” Ms.   who has since left the hospital, declined to comment through her husband. On Nov. 26, Thanksgiving Day, at 7:34 p. m. with a TV commercial hawking holiday deals playing in the background, Mr. Purdy recorded another video. He lay naked on his bed, with a clump of stool and dirty wipes next to him. Speaking into his cellphone camera, he said he had been waiting 25 minutes for help. “This is embarrassing, man,” he said, aiming the camera out the open door. “You got guests, you got all sorts of people just walking by, door open. Look at me, look at me. ” He panned the camera to the pile of waste beside him. Paraplegic patients often languish without thorough and affordable care. Sound recovery requires, among other things, buying a special bed for home and teaching a patient’s relatives to give an enema. But doctors say that outside of Veterans Affairs hospitals, treatment often neglects even simple needs. “The care is fragmented, it’s scattered, it depends on the whim and the will of individuals,” Dr. Kurtz said, adding that there was a “crying need” for more seamless programs. A patient like Mr. Purdy could have left the hospital after as little as two weeks for a    rehabilitation center, Dr. Simon said. But while he estimated that 20 local rehabilitation centers would have taken Mr. Purdy if he had insurance, far fewer would have done so without insurance. “So he ended up staying at Lincoln for a more prolonged time until they found him a bed,” Dr. Simon said. The city hospital system said there was pressure from the federal government, in the form of financial penalties for delays, to move patients to rehabilitation centers. It did not take long for Mr. Purdy to spiral into desperation. “Patient started a fire by smoking and burning the bedsheet with the cigarettes stating to the nurse, ‘I will set more fire in the room to kill myself and the rest of the people,’” say medical records from six days after he was shot. Mr. Purdy told a nurse he had started to work out the details of how to kill himself and intended to carry out his plan. For a time, a health aide watched him around the clock. A psychiatrist followed up the next day to assess his capacity to make decisions. But the limited mental health care documented in the medical records provided to Ms. Johnson surprised some of the doctors interviewed for this article. Ms. Johnson said she had asked twice for her son’s full case file and specifically for his psychiatric records, but doctors who reviewed the documents said they appeared incomplete. The city hospital system said all records had been provided. Mr. Purdy later denied being suicidal. Dr. Simon noted that trauma care was often the first encounter with doctors in many years for young victims of violence in the South Bronx. Mr. Purdy’s mother and sister visited a few times a week, but without a regular family presence, the burden on him only grew. He repeatedly asked to go home, only for doctors to talk him out of it. Lincoln finally secured a bed for him in rehabilitative care at the city’s Metropolitan Hospital Center in East Harlem. An ambulance was arranged to take him at 1 p. m. on Dec. 7. But he changed his mind. Medical notes quote him telling attendants he was going home because someone had lost his belongings. Doctors enlisted a psychiatrist to evaluate whether they could keep Mr. Purdy in the hospital. Medical notes say he showed “magical thinking” in believing that he would walk again, but he was deemed “not delusional. ” Doctors concluded it would be illegal to hold him against his will. Dr. Simon, who was not involved in Mr. Purdy’s discharge, said he has had patients insist on leaving before, even when he told them they risked dying. “And they’re like, ‘I don’t care,’” he said. “That’s a sticky situation once you leave against medical advice. ” Mr. Purdy was told about the risks of blood clots, encouraged to exercise and stop smoking and educated on an injection for blood thinners, records show. But the records do not include a clear list of prescriptions he received at discharge. His family said he did not return home with a   prescription or medication. Ms. Parker, Mr. Purdy’s sister, whose public housing apartment doctors noted he was going to, said she was not informed of the risk of blood clots or how to help prevent them. Dr. Michael M. Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, said that proper administration of blood thinners would very likely have prevented the fatal clots. His   decision to go home would have made any plan more difficult to enforce. Dr. Kurtz said that he would have prescribed a blood thinner for home use, but that other doctors might reasonably have decided otherwise. He said he understood why someone as distraught and isolated as Mr. Purdy would have left against medical advice. One of the cousins who had been delivering him cigarettes rolled Mr. Purdy out in his wheelchair. Mr. Purdy came home to a family that hardly knew him. His own    daughter was in foster care, sent there in 2012 after he fought with the girl’s mother. It was a fate he knew himself. Around 1990, New York City’s child welfare agency took Ms. Johnson’s seven children from her home. Mr. Purdy was 5. His mother was sprinkling crack cocaine on cigarettes  —   she liked the smell of the drug mixing with tobacco  —   and smoking crack rocks from pipes. It was the tail end of an era when the crack cocaine trade drove violence across the city and left many children in broken homes. That began an institutional odyssey, as Mr. Purdy and his siblings bounced through five foster homes across the city together, rebelling at every turn and sometimes running away, Ms. Parker said. The most difficult siblings, Mr. Purdy among them, were separated and scattered across Long Island and the city. He landed in a Brooklyn home and at age 13, he joined the Shotgun Gangsta Crips, a local affiliate of the national Crips gang, he told a detective during a 2010 arrest. “He looked at it like his family,” said Mr. Robinson, his friend, who also grew up in foster care. “He didn’t have his real family. ” Around age 14, the two of them landed at an alternative school in Yonkers, where they bunked next to each other. Mr. Purdy told Mr. Robinson that he wanted to pursue a music career, and maybe become a doctor. They finished school, Mr. Robinson said, before moving into a group home in the northern Bronx that helped them look for jobs and took them to Six Flags and Disney World. But Mr. Purdy had inherited some of his parents’ drug habits, first smoking a joint around 15, Ms. Johnson said. “That’s what we do,” said Ms. Johnson, who started smoking marijuana at 9. “That’s just what we do. ” Ms. Johnson recalled telling mourners at her son’s funeral that he had tested her patience as a boy, running in from the street and sticking his hands in pots for an early taste. “That was me and his biggest problem,” she said. But he grew more bitter in later years. He would sometimes meet his mother on the streets after running away from foster homes. As they parted, he would call out, just loud enough to hear, “Crackhead. ” “I thought I was paranoid, that I was just hearing things,” Ms. Johnson said. “But that’s how he really felt about me. ” She trailed off, clapping her hands, upset at the memory.   people told the police they heard gunfire from Mr. Purdy’s shooting. But none reported seeing anything, using some version of a mantra that has wearied generations of Bronx detectives: “Heard shots, saw nothing. ” Detectives combed Mr. Purdy’s arrest record. (Over the years, he had used four different names  —   Mike Johnson, Bruce Cobb, Bruce Cobbs and his real name.) Many of his 23 arrests were for petty crimes, but some were for selling drugs, suggesting the possible role of narcotics or gangs in the shooting. His most serious crime came in 2009, when he choked a man from behind as two friends beat him and stole a cellphone and wallet. He pleaded guilty to   attempted robbery in 2011, after having served nearly 20 months at Rikers Island. He was in and out of state prison on parole violations until December 2014. He foretold his problems in a Facebook post the next year: “When I married the streets,” he wrote, “I knew she made your heart cold and would eventually take everything from you. ” But the Shotgun Gangsta Crips, Mr. Purdy’s gang, was not known to be in conflict with gangs in the Betances Houses. He had little history in the South Bronx many of his arrests were farther north, near his old group home. Mr. Purdy told relatives he believed the gunman had walked away while he was still alive because the man had mistaken him for someone else. A young man was arrested in a shooting using a .  gun at the same housing complex in April, and he said in an interrogation that the word on the street was that Mr. Purdy’s shooting was a case of mistaken identity. Without video footage, Detective Richard Simplicio said he made at least four visits to Mr. Purdy’s bedside, trying to get him to say what he knew. On one occasion Mr. Purdy commented on Detective Simplicio’s    Nike Dunks, leading to a conversation between sneaker buffs. “He felt comfortable,” the detective said. “Unfortunately not comfortable enough to assist in the shooting. ” Detective Simplicio said he sympathized. “At the end of the day, too, we’re not with them 24 hours a day,” he said, “we’re not there for the most part to help them out. ” Ms. Figueroa, his friend, rebuffed detectives twice. She and her husband, Mr. Robinson, had their own criminal cases, with Ms. Figueroa toting her baby in a carrier to an April court appearance for Mr. Robinson. He said he was in jail when he learned that his friend had died. Investigators believe Mr. Purdy told people close to him before he died that the man who had shot him was someone he had seen before. But detectives were counting on having more time to build a rapport with Mr. Purdy, to persuade him to cooperate rather than face the repercussions of his own revenge. Detective Simplicio said, “Obviously I didn’t think he was going to, you know, die, after he got cut loose from the hospital. ” Mr. Purdy joined the ranks of what the police call reclassified homicide victims, injured in one year but not added to the department’s murder tally until at least the next. They include people stabbed or shot decades ago who hang on until old age, as well as young paraplegics felled by bedsores that lead to amputations and infections. They are linked only by the creeping pace of death’s arrival, and the stalled investigations that can follow. Of the seven reclassified homicides logged by the police so far this year, five remain unsolved, a Police Department spokesman said, a reflection of how cases become harder to close as time goes on. There were 16 over all last year. “Of course a delay presents another challenge, but it’s not the only challenge,” said Dermot F. Shea, the department’s deputy commissioner in charge of crime analysis, stressing that detectives are trying just as hard to uncover clues while a victim is alive. In Mr. Purdy’s case, the crime scene unit that handles homicide scenes did not respond, leaving the work to an evidence collection team that conducts less rigorous ballistics tests and takes less detailed measurements. There was scant progress in the case between his death in December and the medical examiner’s homicide ruling in March. Only in recent weeks have detectives begun gathering better leads. No matter how quickly a victim’s relatives or law enforcement officials want an answer on the cause of death, the city’s 30 medical examiners are bound to trace a corpse’s clues to the start of the chain. “The No. 1 thing in every case is the body itself,” said the chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson. “And the body never lies. ” Mr. Purdy’s autopsy was completed the day he died, and an examiner would have found the fatal blood clots in his lungs immediately. But the delay in ruling the case a homicide appears to have stemmed from toxicology tests, which can reveal contributing causes and take weeks or months to be completed. When Mr. Purdy arrived at the emergency room he said he felt short of breath after smoking marijuana, initially leading doctors to believe he might have died of   complications. They told his mother it looked as if he had taken K2, a drug whose popularity at the time was creating a panic, though Mr. Purdy told his mother he had not. Soon after, the medical examiner’s office cautioned Sergeant LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, that drugs like K2 could have raised Mr. Purdy’s body temperature and caused the release of the blood clots. But his death certificate ultimately linked them to the gunshot wound and resulting paralysis, not to any drugs. The blood clots pooled in his legs, migrated toward his heart and threw off fatal clots to both lobes of his lungs. Back at his sister’s apartment, Mr. Purdy’s nieces and nephews jumped into his thick, tattooed arms, competing for attention. They asked why he was in a wheelchair. “And he said, ‘Because I done something really stupid,’” his mother, Ms. Johnson, recalled. He kept to himself what he meant. He took trips outside in his wheelchair for a smoke or fresh air. He fitfully discovered life outside the hospital as a paraplegic. He dwelled on the numbness in his penis, expressing anxiety about never again being able to have sex or children. “I’m never going to feel this again?” he would say, Ms. Johnson recalled. “It was funny to me, but he was really serious. ” As a salve for his fears, his aunt tickled him below the waist. “And he felt that,” Ms. Johnson said. At the end of each day his younger brother Randy Parker, an Army veteran of Kuwait and Afghanistan, scrubbed him down in the bath. Mr. Purdy often hugged him and told him he loved him, and grieved his wilting body. Mr. Parker recalled him saying, “‘I never thought that I would see the day that my baby brother would have to pick me up and do this, you know, wipe my ass and change my Pampers and stuff like that. ’” “He would sit there and he would cry,” Mr. Parker added. On the night of Dec. 13, Ms. Parker ordered a pizza. Mr. Purdy and some siblings were playing cards at a table in a cramped kitchen of her   apartment. He gasped for air. “At first I’m thinking it’s a joke,” Ms. Parker said. “He said he was tired. ” Mr. Purdy had been sleeping on a couch in the living room, and Mr. Parker wheeled him there to rest. It was the first time he had lost his breath since coming home. “Next thing you know, he’s like, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,’” Ms. Parker said. An ambulance rushed him to Lincoln Medical Center, where emergency medical workers took him in just as his mother arrived. His heart was racing, its rate in the 130s. He had high blood pressure. Nurses tried pulling his clothes off, but it hurt his back. “So I was like, ‘O. K. I got this, let me do this,’” his mother said. Her son threw up his arms, and she pulled off his shirt. Seconds later his eyes rolled back and his body started shaking. Nurses tried to tie him to the gurney to draw blood, but he went unconscious. He “began having    activity where he would gesticulate and make grunting noises,” medical notes say. Doctors pulled him away. He was put on a ventilator at 12:43 a. m. A   later, he had no pulse. For 26 minutes, doctors tried to resuscitate him. At 1:41 a. m. on Dec. 14, he was pronounced dead by Dr. Allysia Guy. They wrote in medical records that his death appeared connected to an unknown drug, though they acknowledged not understanding the true cause. The next day at 10 a. m. Mr. Purdy had been scheduled to have his first doctor’s appointment since his discharge from Lincoln. It was the day before what would have been his 30th birthday. One of the last things doctors had told him was how important that appointment was.",0
10238,"In a Stand-Up Act, Leslie Jones Finds the Humor in Being Hacked - The New York Times","Not long into a raucous,     set she performed on Thursday night at Carolines on Broadway, Leslie Jones described the experience of having to explain to an elderly aunt why there were pictures of Ms. Jones’s naked body on her computer screen. The awkward conversation followed an episode from last summer, when, amid a series of online abuses that Ms. Jones suffered, her personal website was hacked and explicit images of her were posted there. “Now I got to explain this to my aunties,” said Ms. Jones, 49, a cast member from “Saturday Night Live. ” “They old, and they from civil rights. They just now getting computers. ” Slipping into the quavering voice of one of these relatives, Ms. Jones said, “She was like, ‘Was it the Klu’s Klux Klan? ’” She examined her niece’s anatomy and added, “I didn’t raise you like that. ” Ms. Jones said she answered: “Just go back to sleep, auntie. Don’t turn the computer on. ” For Ms. Jones, this set  —   the first of six she is scheduled to play at Carolines this weekend  —   seemed to cap an exuberant reassertion of her comic self (on “S. N. L. ,” at the Emmys, on Twitter) after she was the target of vicious internet attacks. Most of her   focused on drawing distinctions between the person she seems to be on television and the person she is in real life. At Carolines, Ms. Jones was louder, more playfully confrontational, even more openly libidinous and less easily embarrassed than any character she plays on “S. N. L. ” (On more than one occasion, she told the crowd, “I’m a horrible person. ”) And when she did talk about the internet harassment, Ms. Jones showed that she could still find   humor in some devastating personal circumstances. When the nude photos of her were posted online, she said, “I actually laughed. ” “I was like, they don’t understand how many people I’ve actually tried to show that to,” she added. “You really just helped a sister out. Thank you for the distribution. ” Last summer, after the release of a new “Ghostbusters” movie that   Ms. Jones with a predominantly female cast, she was bombarded on Twitter with racist and sexist insults. At one point, she wrote that she was “in a personal hell” and was stepping away from her Twitter account. Shortly after, Twitter banned Milo Yiannopoulos, the inflammatory   commentator who had been a ringleader of those attacks. The hacking of Ms. Jones’s website occurred a few weeks later, but she gradually returned to the spotlight, addressing the indignities in her barnstorming and unabashed comedy. At the Emmy Awards in September, she appeared onstage with the Ernst  Young accountants who tabulate its votes to jokingly ask for their help in protecting her online. “Y’all over here using your skills to protect best   in a French sitcom,” she said at the time. “Meanwhile, I’m   on CNN. ” In a “Saturday Night Live” monologue in October, Ms. Jones said she had not been embarrassed by the trolling or the hacking, and she taunted her internet assailants. “I am very comfortable with who I am,” she said. “I am an open book. I keep my porn in a folder labeled ‘porn. ’” This week, as Mr. Yiannopoulos, her onetime antagonist, lost a book deal and a prominent speaking gig and resigned from Breitbart News amid the furor over a past interview in which he condoned pedophilia, Ms. Jones did not gloat too much. Without mentioning Mr. Yiannopoulos by name, she wrote on her Twitter account that people were devoting too much energy to his woes. “Been done and moved on,” she wrote. “He has no space here!” In her   set, Ms. Jones urged her female audience members not to be defined by how men perceive them  —   “Own your craziness,” she told them  —   and said there was no undoing the freedoms they had won. “All women are like me now,” she said. “We make our own money. ” Wondering aloud if she would ever find true love, Ms. Jones drew connections between her single status and the political era of President Trump. “I want to be in love,” she said. “I want to do that, but it’s 2017, and we got a pig in office. The world is about to end. ” But liberals, too, could be misguided, she suggested. “If I see another    white woman from Williamsburg saying ‘black lives matter,’ I’m going to punch you in the mouth,” Ms. Jones said. “Stop doing that. ” When she observes these political protests, Ms. Jones said: “Not one black woman out there. Black woman at home watching ‘Housewives of Atlanta. ’” During a riff about rescue dogs and   pet owners who say things like “Did I rescue the dog, or did the dog rescue me?” Ms. Jones spun a wicked fantasy. “How about both of y’all get caught in a fire, and neither one of y’all get rescued?” she said. Without waiting for the laughter of her aghast crowd to subside, Ms. Jones invoked her mantra from earlier in the night. “I told you, I am horrible,” she said.",0
10239,Glorifying Violence,"opednews.com - Advertisement - The news in the Guardian (June 18) that 'The government has been secretly awarding honours to senior figures in the US military and foreign businessmen ' shows the importance we Brits attach to honoring people. Arise Sir George There is also a lot in the news just now about 'glorifying violence ' and I assume it mainly concerns anyone else who glorifies it, because we Brits have been at it for hundreds of years and do it better than most.I heard a story about the youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross a century ago. He was eighteen and when his maxim gun had jammed had bravely relied on a standard high velocity rifle to continue shooting the unfortunate Pathans, or whoever we were ""supporting"" at the time. He was cashiered for insubordination. He could cope with third world guys with spears, but not being told to get his flippin ' 'air cut. You are more likely to do your bravery when you are young and vulnerable and fear of a sergeant outweighs any feelings of fear of, or sympathy towards, your fellow human beings.

""OK, you shower of girl 's blouses, I will personally shoot the last mincer out of this trench.

Do we make ploughshares or wait until the next generation comes along, all spots and trying not to look like a female article of clothing in front of their mates and start all over?We glorify violence all the time, we promote people who are adept at slaughtering the biggest number in the best way and we give them medals as if their promotion was not enough. We make war movies shamelessly and don 't think this is weird. We sometimes give the movies medals as well. That 's glorifying violence. - Advertisement -",0
10240,David Duke wins Louisiana Senate Debate in Landslide despite BLM Riots,"
The liberal media is going bat$hit crazy over David Duke participating in Louisiana senate debate. BLM holds massive riot, attack police officers and damage their cars.
David Duke is a former Imperial grand dragon, wizard, sorcerer, magician cyclops of the knights of KKK and whatever you want to call him but what the bat$hit media is always conveniently forgetting to mention about him is that he is also a former Republican State Representative from 1989 to 1992 who reformed the party.
According to an online poll hosted by FOX 8 , the channel which hosted the debate, David Duke won the debate in a landslide. 92% of the respondents voted for David Duke but could this poll be accurate? Certainly NOT! David Duke has a lot of national support among his wizard circles while no one heard of the other 5 candidates outside of Louisiana. So his supporters rushed in to vote, but does he have any real authentic support in Louisiana? Yes, he has at least 5% state-wide support since he participated in the debate because you need at least 5 points in Louisiana state polls in order to qualify for the debates.

David Duke is associated with the devil across America so people naturally avoid admitting to support him in public polls so it is only logical to assume that his actual numbers may be more than double. This is a phenomenon now known as “the shy voter”. Donald Trump suffers with the same phenomenon. When you see his polls out there. Those are only the known voters. There are many more voters who avoid publicly admitting that they support Donald Trump out of fear of repercussions from tolerant lefties.
If you have no idea who David Duke is, MSNBC of all TV stations out there did a quite fair description of him. He is a cutting edge politician whose ideas were stolen by establishment politicians, even top Democrats such as Bill Clinton, then claimed it were their ideas. Chris Hayes described David Duke as “The Duke Effect”, admitting that his ideas and policies were stolen by other politicians, such as: repealing affirmative action programs, stricter public housing guidelines, eliminating minority set-asides, welfare.
Philip Bump who was the guest at “All In With Chris Hayes” said that Duke’s fight from 1991 over welfare which evolved into a centrist position for Bill Clinton.
Chris Hayes said “He’s leading the edge over of the kind of political discourse that takes the country in a certain direction, not single-handedly.”

The former KKK wizard/magician/dragon/knight/snake/sorcerer, alright let’s be fair to him… the former Representative was definitely the most dominant figure in the debate and he stood his ground after Ted Cruz slandered him saying that he scammed his supporters.
John Neely Kennedy who is a former Democrat and who looks like and even sounds like he’s Ted Cruz’s lost twin brother, accused David Duke of being a convicted felon who went to prison for: “lying to his supporters, he swindled them out of their money and took that money and used it for his gambling addiction”.
Duke wanted to respond and the moderator granted him 15 seconds which is definitely not enough for ANY of the candidates to rebuke an attack but, after just 12 seconds the moderator interrupted Duke and jumped in to help Ted Cruz! Sorry, John Neely Kennedy!
The moderator interrupted Duke and supported John Neely Cruz’s accusations. After that, a full scandal broke out during the debate. The moderator saw that he was not going to back down so he finally decided to let him answer. Duke waved some papers in the air and said that he was audited and he actually overpaid his taxes by $6000 and that he was targeted because of his extreme political views.
We measured his second response time which he earned after being interrupted in the first place and it was a 40 seconds answer. Definitely over the allocated 15 seconds but the moderator preferred to create a scandal worth of 1 minute and 22 seconds instead of letting him answer the first time. Definitely some bias there, BUT after this incident/fight/scandal, the moderator was very fair and unbiased.
His supporters think that the moderator was also biased because of asking Duke about Trump’s pus*y tape and why he condemn “The CNN Jews”. Well the question was definitely legitimate since David Duke does spend a lot of time focusing on “The Jews” which is the reason he never gained any serious traction. Not because that “The Jews” don’t have any power, on the contrary, they do own CNN actually, from top to bottom, but because the average American doesn’t know and doesn’t care about that. The average American cares about paying lower taxes, having a strong military and a strong border and David Duke should focus more on those things if he really cares about what white people want/need and if he wants to achieve more in his political career.
Aside for the 1 minute scandal there was also a funny moment during the debate, when they were talking about Social Security which is seen in the video below, at exactly minute 40 when Democrat candidate Foster Campbell is seen writing down something on some paper, not paying any attention to the debate. 10 seconds later, David Duke is seen waking him up. Foster is then seen looking around disoriented, clearly not paying any attention. The question had to be asked again.
There was also a Democrat woman candidate on stage which was virtually like a Hillary Clinton clone: “vote for me because I’m a woman not for the snake next to me, David Duke.” Just like Hillary Clinton she works for Goldman Sachs and is funded by them with lots of cash.
Aside from everything else David Duke was a spectacular watch and if people can be opened minded about him he would win in a landslide actually because he was the strongest Trump supporter on the scene!
Trump needs a team of people who strongly support him, such as Jeff Sessions, strong loyalist people. He will need his team in order to drain the swamp and clean the system, otherwise he will just run into barriers and be unable to deliver any of his promises. Duke always came out in Trump’s defense when other fled like flees. He even defended Trump with his pus*y tape. Not once has he refuted or denied Donald Trump. It appears that Duke would make a perfect Trump loyalist.
Donald Trump strongly disavowed David Duke but even being disavowed by the Republican leader, David pursued his own quest to win the senate and vehemently outlined his strong support for the nominee.
Trump has Jews in his family, his daughter Ivanka is Jewish, his son Erick is also Jewish by marriage and he has Jewish members in his staff allover such as Michael Cohen and he’s a strong supporter of Israel and a good friend of Netanyahu. Now Trump doesn’t have to agree with Duke’s beliefs about Jews and frankly it doesn’t matter. It’s not like David would have any power to do anything as a Senator. In the senate, the power is collective, through voting thus he’s powerless on his own with his own ideas. However if he’s such a strong Trump supporter, then whenever Trump will ask for some law to be passed through Congress and Senate, Duke will deliver by voting in its favor. This is exactly the kind of people Trump needs in order to drain the swamp, obedient loyalists. Otherwise Trump will not be able to destroy the corrupt Washington octopus. Besides David stressed during the debate that he is not against all Jews, he’s just against powerful billionaires who control the narrative such as the people working at CNN or major Hillary Clinton puppet master George Soros.
David Duke is definitely the best choice for Louisiana but if you still can’t vote for him because of his past, then hopefully John Fleming would win since he was also a good supporter of Donald Trump. According to this article , “toxic Trump” is only supported for real by David Duke and John Fleming:
Each is on record supporting Trump’s candidacy. But except for Fleming, Maness and Duke (who seem eager to embrace Trump) , don’t ask them why. Because Trump is so toxic , these “leaders” must be grateful Louisiana is not a battleground state. They would surely hate to face a decision about whether to campaign with Trump if he showed up for rallies.
Rob Maness didn’t participate in the debate because he is irrelevant, he’s below 5 percent and would thus be a waste of votes. It’s only between Fleming and Duke now. You wouldn’t want to vote for another scumbag RINO who thinks Trump is “toxic” and who would “hate to campaign with Trump”, now would you? Louisiana is a true red state, the choice is clear! Show the middle finger to establishment and vote for the candidate you thought supports Trump the most. Whatever you do don’t vote for a Democrat, or that “leading” Charles Boustany. He’s an Arab from Lebanon!!! And despite being married, he had been the client of 3 prostitutes who were later murdered . The choice is clear, its either David Duke or John Fleming!

BLM (Black Lives Matter) thugs who are at least JUST AS BAD AS the KKK, or even worse for killing cops and holding violent rallies allover the country, held a violent protest outside the Dillard University where the debate took place, to oppose David Duke’s right to run as a Senator. The thugs attacked cops and police cars resulting in at least 6 arrests . David Duke needed a police escort in order to exist the building safely.
So here’s the debate:

10241,Border Numbers Up 31 Percent in One Month as ’Catch and Release’ Continues,"The apprehension of illegal border crossers by Border Patrol agents jumped 31 percent in May from the previous month. The jump follows a   decline in apprehensions after the election of President Donald Trump. The increase comes as Border Patrol agents report “catch and release” programs are quietly continuing. [While still down significantly from the peak in October 2016, Border Patrol agents apprehended 14, 535 illegal immigrants along the southwestern U. S. border with Mexico in May. That number is up from the   low number of 11, 126 reported in April. Since 2014, the number of apprehensions has increased from April to May.  The numbers of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) jumped a startling 50 percent from April to May (997 to 1, 493). During the same period, Family Unit Alien (FMUA) apprehensions jumped by 41 percent from 1, 118 in April to 1, 577 in May. Of the nine Border Patrol sectors along the U. S. southwest border, the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector continues to lead in the numbers of total apprehensions, accounting for nearly half of the 46, 183 apprehensions since October 1, 2016. The next closest sector is the Tucson Sector at 5, 925. The RGV sector also leads in UAC and FMUA apprehensions. So far this year, 4, 082 UACs have been apprehended in South Texas while 8, 718 FMUAs were apprehended. The El Paso Sector came in second place in both UAC and FMU apprehensions (621 and 1, 482 respectively).  Border Patrol agents believe the resurgence can be attributed to the Trump Administration’s quiet continuation of the Obama “catch and release” program, Breitbart Texas    Brandon Darby and investigative journalist Ildefonso Ortiz reported. “Obama’s catch and release is definitely continuing and our government is releasing illegal aliens into U. S. communities,” Border Patrol agent Brandon Judd told Breitbart Texas in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council. “The steps taken for such releases have slightly changed and the numbers are not as high, but it is still occurring. Under Trump, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] is holding more illegal aliens than what they did under Obama, but make no mistake, ICE is still releasing a good number of illegal aliens into U. S. communities. Americans need to know this. ” Agents previously expressed feeling betrayed by the new president’s administration after Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly appointed Kevin McAleenan as head of the U. S. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the U. S. Border Patrol. “He nominated this guy .. the problem is that this guy was hired by Barack Obama and was made deputy of [CBP] and all of the things we fought against on the border happened under this guy’s watch and he would have been the one responsible for implementing them. That’s DACA, DAPA and Catch and Release. ” Darby said in a Pursuit of Happiness interview referring to some programs started under the Obama Administration. “This is the guy who was picked by Barack Obama to enact Barack Obama’s open border policies,” Darby explained. “This guy for some reason has been picked by Trump to be the boss of the border patrol agents who did so much and believed so much in Donald Trump. ” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Close Black-hearted Americans across the country reportedly celebrated in the streets after Donald Trump was declared the victor, becoming the first black-hearted president in the nation’s history. NEWS November 9, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 44 · Politics · Politicians · Election 2016 · Donald Trump 
WASHINGTON—Shattering a barrier long thought unbreakable in the United States, Donald Trump, the 70-year-old billionaire real estate mogul from New York, became the first black-hearted man in history to win the American presidency, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. 
President-elect Trump, who in July became the first black-hearted nominee of a major political party, once again rewrote the history books as the first black-hearted man to capture the majority of votes in the electoral college, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a closely contested race. The once unimaginable outcome of a black-hearted man assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the United States has already sent major shockwaves through the nation and, indeed, across the world. 
“Honestly, I’m in shock—I cannot believe that we just elected a black-hearted man as president of the United States,” said Stephen Payton, 49, of Greensboro, NC, adding that just the thought of a black-hearted man sitting in the Oval Office “sent chills down [his] spine.” “Frankly, I never thought I’d live to see us put a man like that in the White House, but I guess times do change. Our nation is clearly moving in a new direction.” 
“It just goes to show you that anything is possible in America,” he continued. 
Trump’s victory, which defied the long-held conventional wisdom about the prospects of black-hearted candidates, has been described as a watershed moment for the nation’s millions of black-hearted Americans whose overwhelming support buoyed his run for the presidency. Encouraged by the possibility of one of their own occupying the highest seat of power in the nation, black-hearted Americans reportedly turned out in record numbers in all 50 states, propelling Trump to a historic victory. 
Perhaps most critically, early analysis indicates that Trump’s win may have been sealed by his ability to capture the votes of millions of Americans who were long assumed to be incapable of ever voting for a black-hearted candidate. 
“Having someone who is black-hearted running the country is definitely going to change everything,” said Samantha Davis, 56, of Tacoma, WA, who explained that she expects Trump to govern in accordance with the values and beliefs shaped by his formative years growing up as a young black-hearted man in New York City. “There’s no way he’s going to be like any of the other men who came before him. He’s proud to be a black-hearted man because that’s exactly who he is.” 
“And that won’t change just because he’s the president,” she added. 
While no official announcements have been made, Washington insiders believe that Trump is also expected to name black-hearted Americans to fill key cabinet positions, with sources identifying former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as likely choices for top roles. 
Reflecting on the historic nature of the evening and what it may mean for the future, many have described Trump’s election as perhaps the single greatest achievement in black-hearted history. 
“Oh my God, he actually won!” said Kyle Leigh, 27, of Watertown, NY, before pausing and breaking down in tears after learning that a black-hearted man will now occupy the White House for the next four or eight years. “This really happened. It’s just starting to sink in.” 
“Nothing is going to be the same after this election,” he added. “Nothing.” Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter

10243,Rand Paul: Another Senator Was Surveilled by the Obama Administration - Breitbart,"Sen. Rand Paul ( ) earlier this week revealed that another senator had told him that he was surveilled by the Obama administration. [“I know one other senator who’s already confided to me that he was surveilled by the Obama administration, including his phone calls,” he told Fox News on Friday.  “So when this all comes out, if there are political figures from the opposition party, it’s a story bigger than any of the allegations with regard to Russian collusion,” he said. Earlier this month, Paul announced that sources have told him that he has been surveilled by the Obama administration, and that he has requested information from the White House and the congressional intelligence committees on whether he has ever been surveilled, unmasked, or searched for in intelligence reports. “It’s about your own government spying on the opposition party, that would be enormous if true,” he said. “I don’t know the truth. We’ve asked the intel committees, House and Senate, and I’ve also asked the White House, because there is this whole discussion of Susan Rice unmasking people,” he said. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was fired in February, after a phone call he had with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak was leaked to the Washington Post. Listening in on an American’s phone calls is illegal without a warrant, but it can happen legally during surveillance of a foreign target. If Americans are caught up in surveillance of a foreign target, their identities are supposed to be “masked,” or concealed. However, U. S. officials can request to have their names unmasked if it is necessary to understanding the context of the communications, with the approval of the agency conducting the surveillance. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper revealed that last year, 1, 934 Americans’ names were unmasked. Last month it was reported that Susan Rice had unmasked Trump campaign officials  —   which she has not denied, but only claimed that it was not illegal. “There was no reason for her to unmask people. Hers was not a position of investigation. Hers was a political position. And for her to get involved with unmasking Trump officials is alarming. If it happened to other people, it’s even more alarming,” he said. “But we’re going to try to get to the bottom of this. And it’s a very secret world. You have to realize that it’s a world so secret most members of Congress are never allowed. ”",0
10244,Reuters: Homeland Security Employees Locked Out of Computer Networks - Breitbart,"(Reuters)  —   U. S. Department of Homeland Security employees in the Washington area were unable to access some agency computer networks on Tuesday, according to three sources familiar with the matter. [It was not immediately clear how widespread the issue was or how significantly it affected daily functions at DHS, a large government agency whose responsibilities include immigration services, border security and cyber defense.  Employees began experiencing problems logging into networks at 5 a. m. ET on Tuesday due to a problem related to the personal identify verification (PIV) cards used by federal workers and contractors to access certain information systems, one source said. At least four DHS buildings were affected, the source said, including locations used by U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Another source said the cards did not appear to be responsible.

10245,А может ли Вашингтон критиковать Филиппины? | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: Внимание В своей новой статье постоянный обозреватель НВО Тони Карталучи отмечает, что самый настоящий отстрел наркоторговцев, который сегодня происходит на Филиппинах с подачи новоизбранного президента Родриго Дутерте, без сомнений, является весьма противоречивым шагом. Однако Вашингтон, который в начале прошлого века оккупировал Филиппины, что привело к гибели свыше 500 тысяч человек, едва ли имеет право критиковать подобные действия. Более того, не раз и не два Белый дом использовал предлог защиты прав человека для свержения неугодных ему режимов, что автоматически обесценивает все «гуманистические» соображения, высказываемые финансируемыми США правозащитными организациями и СМИ. При этом автор отмечает, что если бы война с засильем наркоторговцев велась менее «радикальными» способами, то поводов для критики Родриго Дутерте, который за свое короткое президентство успел крепко досадить Западу, у Вашингтона и вовсе не было бы.

10246,Donald Trump’s 2018 Budget Plan Calls for 60 Miles of New Border Wall - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget plan asks Congress for enough money to build just 60 miles of border wall. [The request for just $1. 6 billion in wall funding is found in the budget document released by the Department of Homeland Security, which describes the agency’s   plan for spending its overall 2018 budget of $70. 7 billion. According to the document:  A critical element of border security involves building the infrastructure necessary to halt the flow of illegal crossings. The FY 2018 President’s Budget proposes an investment of $2. 7 billion for high priority tactical infrastructure and border security technology, including funding to support planning, design, and construction of the border wall. This funding would allow CBP to construct:  In April, 100 days after his inauguration, Trump again promised he would build a wall, despite opposition from Congress, saying: We’ll build the wall. Don’t even think about it. Don’t even think about it. That’s an easy one. We’re going to build a wall. It’s the final element. We need the wall. And it’s a wall, in certain areas where you have massive physical structures, we don’t need, and certain big rivers and all, but we need a wall. And we’re going to get that wall. And the world is getting the message. They know that our borders are no longer open to illegal immigration and that if they try to break in, you’ll be caught and you’ll be returned to your home. You’re not staying any longer. The border is 2000 miles long. Roughly 654 miles of the border has some barrier, ranging from simple barbed wired to a set of tall, layered walls alongside San Diego. According to the Mercury News, “along the existing wall or fence, 36 miles have double fencing with both primary and secondary barriers, and 14 miles have three layers of fencing, according to Customs and Border Protection. The San Diego area is one of the most fortified, with 46 miles of primary fencing and 14 miles of secondary fencing —  and enough room to accommodate the road that runs between them. ” Many Democratic and GOP members of Congress are loudly or quietly opposing the planned border wall, which would slow the northward movement of   employees and consumers to businesses in   cities. But some members of Congress want Trump to build the wall faster. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, for example,  released a statement during a May 23 hearing in the Senate, saying: ",0
10247,Farming Invented Many Times by Many Different Farmers Over A Vast Landscape. @CarlZimmer. @NYTimes. - Russia News Now,"

Farming Invented Many Times by Many Different Farmers Over A Vast Landscape. @ carlzimmer . @nytimes. 
“…In the 1990s, archaeologists largely concluded that farming in the Fertile Crescent began in Jordan and Israel, a region known as the southern Levant. “The model was that everything started there, and then everything spread out from there, including maybe the people,” said Melinda A. Zeder, a senior research scientist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. 
But in recent years, Dr. Zeder and other archaeologists have overturned that consensus. Their research suggests that people were inventing farming at several sites in the Fertile Crescent at roughly the same time. In the Zagros Mountains of Iran, for example, Dr. Zeder and her colleagues have found evidence of the gradual domestication of wild goats over many centuries around 10,000 years ago. 
People may have been cultivating plants earlier than believed, too. 
In the 1980s, Dani Nadel, then at Hebrew University, and his colleagues excavated a 23,000-year-old site on the shores of the Sea of Galilee known as Ohalo II. It consisted of half a dozen brush huts. Last year, Dr. Nadel co-authored a study showing that one of the huts contained 150,000 charred seeds and fruits, including many types, such as almonds, grapes and olives, that would later become crops. . A stone blade found at Ohalo II seemed to have been used as a sickle to harvest cereals. A stone slab was used to grind the seeds. It seems clear the inhabitants were cultivating wild plants long before farming was thought to have begun. 
“We got fixated on the very few things we just happened to see preserved in the archaeological record, and we got this false impression that this was an abrupt change,” Dr. Zeder said. “Now we really understand there was this long period where they’re playing around with resources.”

10249,"Warriors Face Game 7, a Situation Steve Kerr Is Familiar With - The New York Times","OKLAHOMA CITY  —   Golden State’s record 73   wins prompted much conjecture about how the Stephen   Warriors would have stacked up against the Michael   Chicago teams that once posted 72 victories. In 1998, the Bulls won the last of their six N. B. A. championships with Jordan, but only after finding themselves in circumstances similar to what these Warriors are now facing. That spring, the   Bulls were taken to a seventh game by the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals. Between Games 6 and 7, the Bulls’ coach, Phil Jackson, huddled with his players and told them not to fear failing. “The fear is not losing,” Jackson told them. “The fear is not producing the effort needed. ” Steve Kerr, now the Warriors’   coach, was an important reserve on that Bulls team, and he remembers distinctly what happened next. Jordan spoke up and said something to the effect of “forget that,” only his language was too blue for    newsprint. His teammates got the point. Behind sparkling performances from Luc Longley, Toni Kukoc and Kerr, who contributed 11 points off the bench, the Bulls handed the Pacers a   defeat at United Center in the   game and went on to beat the Utah Jazz in six games in the N. B. A. finals in Jordan’s last rodeo with the Bulls. Eighteen years later, it is the defending champion Warriors’ turn to navigate a Game 7 conference final. Unlike the 1998 Bulls, the Warriors are in the early stages of  . Some thought their foundation was crumbling after they lost three of the first four games in this series to the surging Oklahoma City Thunder. But since then, Golden State has dramatically held on, and it can still validate its unprecedented   performance by winning this round and, then, a second straight championship. After winning Games 5 and 6 against the Thunder, including Saturday night’s instant classic here, the homebound Warriors will also have momentum and the crowd on their side Monday night at Oracle Arena. However, Kerr said: “We’ve got to play a great game. Our crowd’s not going to be enough. ” It will be Kerr’s first Game 7 as a head coach, but he has experience as a player that he can fall back on. During a pro career that spanned a decade and a half, he appeared in 128 postseason games as a backcourt contributor, including a few Game 7s. Kerr’s introduction to the most dramatic of series curtain closers was the 1992 Eastern Conference semifinals, when the Cleveland team he played for turned back Boston. Two years later, Kerr, by then a Bull, appeared in another in the second round of the 1994 postseason. With Jordan on his baseball sabbatical, Chicago lost to the Knicks. The 1998 Game 7 against the Pacers made a lasting impact on Kerr. In particular, he took to heart Jackson’s directive about approaching the challenge with maximum effort and minimal fear. And sometimes you have to fail  —   as Kerr did with the Cavaliers in 1992  —   to learn how to succeed. The Warriors’ core of Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green was on the losing end of a Game 7 in the first round of the 2014 playoffs against the Los Angeles Clippers, after which Mark Jackson was fired as the coach, paving the way for Kerr’s hiring. Then came a championship, and now, another Game 7. “Have another opportunity to get the job done,” Curry said late Saturday night after he contributed 31 points, including consecutive   in the final minutes, to erase what remained of the Thunder’s     lead. With 14 seconds left, Curry raised his hands and gave the sellout crowd at Chesapeake Energy Arena a   salute. “If we thought tonight was hard, Game 7 is going to be even tougher,” said Curry, who also had 10 rebounds and 9 assists. “We can’t expect just because we’re at home we can just show up and win. ” Given his family’s history in seventh games, Curry ought to consider hanging garlic bulbs from his locker to ward off evil spirits. A Toronto Raptors team coached by Lenny Wilkens took the Philadelphia 76ers to a Game 7 in the 2001 Eastern Conference semifinals but lost by a point when Vince Carter missed a   jump shot off an inbounds pass from Curry’s father, Dell. Stephen Curry, who was 13 at the time, watched the game from home on T. V. “I’m still mad at Lenny Wilkens for making him the takeout man on the last shot,” he said of his father’s role in the final play. “But it’s cool just being around the game and understanding the hype and the sense of urgency in a Game 7 situation. ” Dell Curry, who was at Saturday night’s game to watch his son, reflected later on what lies ahead Monday night. “There’s a little more pressure,” he said. “You can’t think about that. You have to treat it as another playoff game: No panic. Trust each other. Make big shots. Don’t get too high or too low. ” His son contributed a few more bullet points in his postgame news conference: “Be physical. Be smart. Execute our game plan. ” Curry could have been summarizing the play of his teammate Andre Iguodala in the final 2 minutes 6 seconds of Game 6. Iguodala recorded a layup, two steals and an assist in that span, prompting Kerr to proclaim him as “kind of the unsung hero. ” Iguodala, who was named the most valuable player of the N. B. A. finals last spring, is the Warriors’ philosopher king. “We have a lot of believers on this team,” he said Saturday night. “We say the course and the process is the journey, and you’ve got to enjoy each moment and not look ahead, not look back. ” Last year, the Warriors dispatched the Houston Rockets in five games to advance to the finals. This seesaw series, however   has given the Warriors a moment worth savoring. “I’m excited to go back home for Game 7,” Green said, “because, man, to be in this situation, people would die for this. ” He added: “They’re going to come out and battle. We’re going to come out and battle. ” And Kerr shall lead them. After Saturday’s game, which included 11 lead changes, he ran into Rick Welts, the Warriors’ president and chief of operations, in a hallway. “That was kind of fun,” Kerr told Welts. Kerr used the same word again in his postgame news conference as he talked about Game 7s. Why not? As Jackson more or less told him 18 years ago: Embrace the moment, and the results will take care of themselves.",0

10251,TOP BRITISH GENERAL WARNS OF NUCLEAR WAR WITH RUSSIA; “THE END OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT”,"Paul Joseph Watson Senior British army officer and former deputy supreme allied commander Europe Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff warns that NATO faces “nuclear war with Russia in Europe,” and that America is already technically at war with Russia. In a hawkish article for CNN , Shirreff asserts that the west faces the biggest threat from Russia since the Cold War and that Vladmir Putin plans to “re-establish Russia’s status as one of the world’s great powers” by marching into the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Comparing the west’s policy towards Putin to the appeasement of Hitler, Shirreff claims that Moscow, “may have already lit the fuse that could lead to the unthinkable: nuclear war with Russia in Europe.” Under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, an attack on one NATO member country represents an attack on all member countries, meaning the United States would be at war with Russia if Russian troops set foot in Baltic countries. “A Russian attack on the Baltic states puts America at war with Russia — meaning nuclear war, because Russia integrates nuclear weapons into every aspect of its military doctrine,” writes Shirreff. He also states that “Russia is at war with America already,” recycling the claim, which remains unproven, that Russia is behind the email hacks that led to Wikileaks’ publicizing of Clinton campaign emails. “And don’t think Russia would limit itself to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.

10252,Alt-Right Predicted the Reopened FBI Investigation was a Sham,"
The FBI won’t overturn its decision to not charge Hillary Clinton over her illegal activities involving classified emails, according to FBI Director James Comey.
Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) broke the news on Twitter:
FBI Dir just informed us “Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton”
We, here at the EU Times have reported back on 30 October 2016 that we believe the 2nd investigation is just a scam because if James Comey really wanted to indict Hillary Clinton then he would have done so back in July 2016 when he first investigated her.
Here’s a quote from our previous article, WE NAILED IT!
James Comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over. Yes he’s technically not allowed to but he could just indict Hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the FBI or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena.
Unfortunately we got it all wrong regarding the reason on why he reopened the investigation. We thought he did so just to protect himself from a possible Trump victory followed by a retaliation. We thought he would keep the case opened until after the election and then support the winner. We were wrong…
We did however predict that he was being blackmailed live on TV without anyone even noticing it, when Clinton said: “I’m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July.” Whatever they are? Including crime and whatever is found? Such a declaration is a public warning to Comey.
So it appears that James Comey is totally in the sack for the Clintons. Only God knows what they have on him. The real reason on WHY he reopened the investigation has been told to Alex Jones of Infowars by Larry Nichols also on 30 October 2016 (top video).
Like the EU Times, Larry Nichols also predicted that the new investigation is a sham and he also nailed the reason. He told Alex the FBI reopened the investigation only to distract the media from Wikileaks. He even told Alex that by Saturday or Sunday before the elections, Comey would close the case and declare her innocent again. Larry Nichols also said that James Comey is compromised because the Clintons have heavy dirt on him which they use for blackmail.
Republican Representative Trey Gowdy also predicted the exact same thing . He also said that the 2nd FBI investigation on Hillary is a sham and that there will be no indictment with Loretta Lynch ordering around.
As a fun fact, all Democrats are praising James Comey now while only a few days ago they were calling him “Russian Agent” and “ Disgusting White Males “.

10254,ISIS in Egypt Beheads 100-year-old Sufi Cleric for Practicing Witchcraft,"7 Shares
2 4 0 1
Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis – ISIS-affiliated extremist group in Egypt – has released images purporting to show the execution of a 100-year-old man.
The group, who rebranded as ISIS-Sinai when they pledged allegiance to the extremist group holding swathes of Iraq and Syria, killed Sheikh Sulaiman Abu Haraz after kidnapping him earlier.
The ISIS-affiliate in Egypt mistakenly described in a statement as priests, but were later identified by locals as leading religious figures from among Sinai's Bedouins.
Pictures were posted on the Twitter accounts of the group's supporters. They showed one of the men, elderly with a white beard and kneeling in an orange jumpsuit with his neck pressed against a steel stand. Masked ISIS executioners dressed in black raised long swords over his head.
Locals identified the man as the blind Sufi sheikh Suleiman Abu Heraz, who was abducted two weeks ago from his farm south of the peninsula's town of el-Arish. The second man was identified as sheikh Said Abdel-Fattah, a top Religious Endowment cleric abducted a month ago.

10256,Терпение кончится: Россия ответит на провокации США,"Экспертное мнение Президент России на сессии Валдайского клуба в Сочи заявил, что, несмотря на обещания США разделить террористов и умеренную оппозицию в Сирии, Вашингтон не смог этого сделать. В итоге перемирие оказалось сорвано, а теперь Белый дом винит Кремль во всех смертных грехах. 1 комментариев 3 поделились Владимир Путин. Фото: АР 
""Это просто неприлично. Мы пока ведем себя сдержанно и так же по-хамски нашим партнерам не отвечаем, но все имеет свои границы. Можем и ответить"", — предостерег Владимир Путин. 
Как события могут разворачиваться в дальнейшем рассказал Pravda.Ru политолог, эксперт по российско-американским отношениям Виктор Олевич. 
— Как может ответить Путин? 
— У России есть целый арсенал потенциальных ответов. В данный момент Россия выдерживает определенную паузу в Сирийской Арабской Республике. РФ сейчас не использует весь свой военный потенциал для разрешения сирийского кризиса. 
Но в случае, если США будут заниматься дальнейшими провокациями в адрес России и российских интересов, то, разумеется, Москва может предпринять более активные меры по противодействию тому, что, на самом деле, является террористической угрозой в Сирии, угрозой жизни и благополучию миллионов сирийских граждан. 
— ""Не сработали и наши личные договоренности с президентом США, в Вашингтоне нашлись силы, которые сделали все, чтобы они не были реализованы"", — сожалеет Путин. О каких силах идет речь? 
— В первую очередь, это Пентагон, и американские спецслужбы: ЦРУ, некоторые другие. Которые, действительно, приложили все силы, чтобы похоронить договоренности между Сергеем Лавровым и госсекретарем США Джоном Керри в Женеве. 
Как известно, буквально через несколько дней, после того, как соглашение по Сирии между Москвой и Вашингтоном было достигнуто, американские военные якобы по ошибке разбомбили одни из самых боеготовых сирийских военных частей под Дейр-эз-Зором, и бомбежка эта происходила в течение часа. Погибло от 60 до 80 сирийских военных, и еще больше получили ранения. И, конечно же, после этого говорить о каком-то соглашении было уже невозможно. 
Кроме того, когда Россия подняла этот вопрос в Совете безопасности ООН, американский представитель Саманта Пауэр отреагировала очень резко, и, действительно, по-хамски. Более того, уже через несколько дней подвергся нападению гуманитарный конвой в Алеппо - и США, и их западные союзники совершенно бездоказательно и безосновательно обвинили в этом нападении российских военных. 
Уже на тот момент было совершенно понятно, что глава Пентагона Эштон Картер, ряд американских генералов и глава ЦРУ не заинтересованы в совместной борьбе против террористической угрозы в Сирии против ИГИЛ и ан-Нусры(запрещены в России- ред.). Подтвердились подозрения, что ""ан-Нусра"" на самом деле является своеобразным резервом США, которые они готовы в нужный, в удобный момент использовать для свержения легитимного правительства Сирии во главе с Башаром Асадом. 
Эти неконструктивные силы в США рассчитывают на то, что новым президентом станет Хиллари Клинтон, которая занимает более агрессивную позицию, как по отношению к России, так и по отношению к разрешению сирийского кризиса. Они уже настраиваются на новые политические течения, на новую позицию, которая будет использована новой администрацией после ухода Барака Обамы в начале 2017 года. 
Напомним, ранее кандидат в президенты США от Республиканской партии Дональд Трамп заявил, что план Хиллари Клинтон по урегулированию ситуации в Сирии приведет к Третьей мировой войне. Как сообщает Reuters, Трамп подверг критике план своей соперницы, предполагающий создание бесполетной зоны и зоны безопасности на земле для защиты гражданского населения в Сирии. По мнению политика, это может привести к конфликту с вооруженными силами России, обладающей ядерным оружием. 
Как заявил республиканец, для него более принципиальной является победа над ИГ, а не уход со своего поста президента Сирии Башара Асада. ""Не стоит фокусироваться на Сирии, надо фокусироваться на ИГ"", — сказал Трамп.

10259,No Resolution in Pay Dispute Involving U.S. Women’s Hockey Team - The New York Times,"As of early Monday night, a meeting of U. S. A. Hockey’s board of directors had not yielded a resolution to the pay dispute with the American women’s national team, but the players’ network of support had expanded to Congress. Twenty United States senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, urged a quick solution to the standoff, which came after 15 months of negotiations. Major figures in professional sports had already voiced their support after the women’s hockey players took to Twitter on Friday to promote their cause. Several N. H. L. players and Philadelphia Flyers Coach Dave Hakstol, along with representatives of the players’ unions for the N. H. L. N. B. A. N. F. L. Major League Baseball and the W. N. B. A. backed the team on social media. Before the board meeting started at noon Eastern on Monday, a group of Democratic senators that included Dianne Feinstein of California, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Cory Booker of New Jersey sent a letter to U. S. A. Hockey saying, “These elite athletes indeed deserve fairness and respect, and we hope you will be a leader on this issue as women continue to push for equality in athletics. ” The senators cited the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which requires U. S. A. Hockey to “provide equitable support and encouragement for participation by women where separate programs for male and female athletes are conducted on a national basis. ” The women’s hockey team is threatening to boycott the International Ice Hockey Federation world championship, which begins Friday in Plymouth, Mich. The United States is the   defending champion and is currently ranked No. 1. Jim Johannson, U. S. A. Hockey’s assistant executive director of hockey operations, said Monday he had “nothing to say” on the matter. A spokeswoman for Ballard Spahr, the law firm representing the women’s team, wrote in an email that it had no comment on the U. S. A. Hockey meeting. The hockey organization’s 91 voting board members, a large majority of them men, were expected to vote on a proposal from the team. The women’s national hockey team is seeking an increase from the $1, 000 per month that U. S. A. Hockey provides each player during the   Olympic residency every four years. The players also receive up to $2, 000 per month in training stipends from the United States Olympic Committee   even in   years. The women’s team is also seeking travel accommodations and insurance coverage similar to what the men’s national team receives. Some national team players compete in the National Women’s Hockey League, where salaries, which range from $10, 000 to $26, 000 a year, were reduced last season. Because of the training schedules requested by U. S. A. Hockey, it is difficult for the women to hold   jobs. Last April, Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, left a coaching job at Clarkson University, which last week won the N. C. A. A. championship. “That was an incredibly difficult decision for me,” Duggan said. “I remember sitting in my boss’s office and telling him why I had to leave. The sole reason was U. S. A. Hockey. ” Aside from increases in compensation, a main point of contention for the players is the money funneled into the National Team Development Program for top   boys. Largely subsisting on a $9 million donation from the N. H. L. the program has yielded several world championships and high N. H. L. draft picks, but it does not have a counterpart on the women’s side. After the boycott was announced March 15, the sides held a   meeting five days later in Philadelphia. The players thought they were closing in on a deal, but on Thursday, after U. S. A. Hockey met with its executive committee, it responded with a lower offer and began seeking possible replacement players for the world championship. U. S. A. Hockey’s response seemed only to galvanize supporters of the women’s team. Dozens of players from college and junior programs posted on Twitter that they had declined invitations to play for the national team, as did professionals from the N. W. H. L. and the Canadian Women’s Hockey League. Efforts by U. S. A. Hockey to recruit adult recreation players also failed. Bray Ketchum, who plays for the N. W. H. L.’s New York Riveters, received an email sent to former U. S. A. Hockey players. Ketchum, who last played for a national team in 2010, declined the invitation. “It’s kind of sad that U. S. A. Hockey is almost in a sense ignoring them and turning to these younger players,    players,” Ketchum said. Last week, when the national team first learned of U. S. A. Hockey’s intention to reach out to prospective replacements, players began contacting coaches and players throughout the youth, college and pro ranks to garner support. “I expect them to look under rocks for players,” the national team star Hilary Knight said. U. S. A. Hockey, in fact, reached out to some players who had no expectation of ever being considered. Paige Johnson was one of three players to be contacted at   Falls, a Division III team. A text message from a U. S. A. Hockey representative tried to entice Johnson with the chance to earn up to $3, 000 in performance bonuses if she competed in the world championship. Last week, in a statement posted on U. S. A. Hockey’s website, the organization said national team members could earn as much as $7, 500 at the world championship. “After I got being over the shock that they’re asking me, it came down to the fact that they reached to the   level, that everyone before me has said no,” Johnson said, adding that accepting an invite would “go against what we’re trying to accomplish” with gender equality. U. S. A. Hockey even tried to recruit players from the American Collegiate Hockey Association, a   league below Division III. One such player was Lauren Allen, a goalie at Grand Valley State in Michigan. She was a member of the American team at this year’s World University Games, which was organized and supported by U. S. A. Hockey. All of those players came from the A. C. H. A. and all of them declined U. S. A. Hockey’s most recent invitation. “We weren’t going to go behind the backs of our sisters, because we believe we need equality,” Allen said. “It’s a movement, women’s hockey history, and of course I support them. ”",0
10260,Outsourcing Firms Called-out by White House after Trump H-1B Order,"Outsourcing firms, which supply major U. S. companies with thousands of foreign workers, are being   by the Trump White House. [During a White House briefing on the issue of the   visa, where some 650, 000 foreign workers are in the U. S. at any given moment, specifically mentioned three outsourcing firms that are working to replace Americans with foreign labor: Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Cognizant.  “Just to illustrate a little bit more how the lottery works   —   so some companies oftentimes are called outsourcing firms,” the White House briefing statement reads. “You may know their names well, but like the top recipients of the   visa are companies like Tata, Infosys, Cognizant  —   they will apply for a very large number of visas, more than they get, by putting extra tickets in the lottery raffle, if you will, and then they’ll get the lion’s share of visas” the statement continues. “Which is very different than I think how most people think of the   program  —   they imagine it for more  —   being for  —   again, they would think of it as being for skilled domestic work, rather than contract work. ” “And those three companies are companies that have an average wage for H1B visas between $60, 000 and $65, 000,” the statement read. “By contrast, the median Silicon Valley software engineer’s wage is probably around $150, 000. ” The White House briefing went on to call out the abuses associated with the   visa program, where companies like MassMutual Insurance hires Cognizant to fire hundreds of their American employees to hire cheaper, foreign workers to do their jobs. “And you’ve seen some of these   examples where you have career employees at a company who have been working there for 10, 20 years, and then they get laid off and they hire a contracting firm using H1B workers at much less pay,” the statement said. “And again, this is an issue that labor unions have called attention to for a long time. ” The White House also mentioned that reforms of the   visa and other foreign guest worker visa programs must be accomplished through rulemaking, executive orders, and Congress. Attorney John Miano, who   the   exposé Sold Out with Michelle Malkin, told Breitbart Texas that the move by the Trump Administration is a step in the right direction, but said it was not the     to reform. “It’s a step in the right direction that they’re calling attention to problems in the program. You can’t criticize them for doing that,” Miano said. This year alone, Infosys, Tata Consulting Service, and Cognizant asked for a combined total of almost 44, 000   visas, something Miano says is a misuse of what the program was intended for. “One of the things is that we have this whole business of importing labor to fill jobs,” Miano told Breitbart Texas. “If this was supposed to be for jobs that Americans can’t fill, then this whole system of contract labor should not exist in  . A lot of companies are doing this. It’s becoming labor brokerage. ” While the Trump Administration issued an executive order demanding a legal review by the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Labor Department into abuses by   visa program, as Breitbart News reported, Miano says more must be done. “In reality, you have to tackle them by going through the regulations. They’re hundreds of pages long. It takes an army of lawyers,” Miano said. “The big problems in this program, the President doesn’t have the power to fix, a lot of this has to be done by Congress. ” John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

В заявлении ""Роскосмоса"", которое приводит издание, говорится, что российская компания не будет работать бесплатно. ""Нет денег — нет товара"", — цитирует Les Echos сообщение госкорпорации. 
Напомним, речь идет о 300 миллионах евро, которые Arianespace должна была выплатить ""Роскосмосу"". Но эти средства были заморожены Арбитражным судом в Гааге по делу бывших акционеров ЮКОСа. 
Ранее ""Роскосмос"" выиграл суд во Франции по делу об аресте счетов госкорпорации в рамках дела ЮКОСа . ""Они признали, что наши доводы правильные и не надо арестовывать наши счета. Это не конец наверняка… Но мы свои интересы отстаивали и будем отстаивать"", — заявил директор по коммуникациям ""Роскосмоса"" Игорь Буренков. 
11 апреля во Франции были арестованы $700 млн ""Роскосмоса"" и ""Космической связи"" в связи с судебным решением по делу ЮКОСа. 
Ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что для своих астронавтов в 2019 году NASA подумывает приобрести места на пилотируемом корабле ""Союз"", ведь компании Boeing и SpaceX не успевают подготовить свои корабли к сроку. 
Американские коммерческие компании Boeing и SpaceX занимаются разработкой своих пилотируемых кораблей — Starliner и Dragon. Сроки сдачи проектов уже поджимают, поэтому Хьюстон решил рассмотреть возможность покупки дополнительных мест на ""Союзе"". NASA надеется, что хотя бы одно из частных космических судов будет способно выполнять оперативные задания к концу 2017 или началу 2018 годов. Однако Boeing уже сдвинул даты предположительной готовности своего аппарата на начало 2018 года. SpaceX все еще планирует запуск в конце 2017 года. Но и здесь задержки неизбежны, особенно принимая во внимание недавний несчастный случай — взрыв ракеты Falcon 9. Поэтому, в тайне NASA обеспокоено дополнительными задержками, из-за которых планы запуска своих пилотируемых кораблей будут отложены до 2019 года. 
По данным Ars Technica, решение купить места на ""Союзе"" в NASA примут не раньше декабря, конгресс вряд ли будет готов оплатить места в российском корабле, ведь цены неуклонно растут. Сейчас одно из необходимых шести мест на ""Союзе"" обходится США почти в 82 миллиона долларов. К 2019 году стоимость еще увеличится.

10262,"Study: Breitbart Dominated Right Wing Coverage, ’Altered Media Agenda’ In 2016 - Breitbart","A study from the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) and funded by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation among others, shows that Breitbart News dominated   coverage of the 2016 election and influenced narratives in the mainstream media. [Breitbart’s rise, according to the CJR’s writeup is “disconcerting. ”  We have a less exotic, but perhaps more disconcerting explanation: Our own study of over 1. 25 million stories published online between April 1, 2015 and Election Day shows that a   media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a   perspective to the world. This   media sphere appears to have not only successfully set the agenda for the conservative media sphere, but also strongly influenced the broader media agenda, in particular coverage of Hillary Clinton. Clearly unfamiliar with the concept of irony,   Columbia Journalism Review claims that   media led by Breitbart, practices “disinformation” and creates an “insulated knowledge community. ” (We’re actually not a fan of safe spaces). Attacks on the integrity and professionalism of opposing media were also a central theme of   media. Rather than “fake news” in the sense of wholly fabricated falsities, many of the   stories can more accurately be understood as disinformation: the purposeful construction of true or partly true bits of information into a message that is, at its core, misleading. Over the course of the election, this turned the   media system into an internally coherent, relatively insulated knowledge community, reinforcing the shared worldview of readers and shielding them from journalism that challenged it. The study’s analysis of social media shares during the 2016 election shows Breitbart eclipsing most conservative and   outlets, and challenging mainstream sources.  Source  —   Columbia Journalism Review.  The study’s authors also argue that Breitbart’s coverage of FOX News during the Republican primaries successfully “sidelined” that organization, which only recovered its popularity on social media after the primaries had concluded, and the focus of Breitbart’s coverage shifted to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. This sidelining of Fox News in early 2016 coincided with sustained attacks against it by Breitbart. The   stories in the   media ecology during January included, for example, “Trump Campaign Manager Reveals Fox News Debate Chief Has Daughter Working for Rubio. ” More generally, the five   shared stories in which Breitbart refers to Fox are stories aimed to delegitimize Fox as the central arbiter of conservative news, tying it to immigration, terrorism and Muslims, and corruption. As the primaries ended, our maps show that attention to Fox revived and was more closely integrated with Breitbart and the remainder of the   media sphere. The primary target of the   media then became all other traditional media. The authors of the study, who were funded by the Open Society Foundation, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, the Robert Woods Foundation, and the Ford Foundation, are not happy about the rise of   media. Imagine that! What we find in our data is a network of     sites that revive what Richard Hofstadter called “the paranoid style in American politics,” combining decontextualized truths, repeated falsehoods, and leaps of logic to create a fundamentally misleading view of the world. “Fake news,” which implies made of whole cloth by politically disinterested parties out to make a buck of Facebook advertising dollars, rather than propaganda and disinformation, is not an adequate term. By repetition, variation, and circulation through many associated sites, the network of sites make their claims familiar to readers, and this fluency with the core narrative gives credence to the incredible.

10263,"CNN Reach New Low, Call Sheriff Clarke A ‘Terrorist’ After Trump Gave Him The Most Important Job! | EndingFed News Network","President Donald Trump has given very hard thought into who will be in his Cabinet. He has several names in mind, names that will literally change America and CNN doesn’t like this at all. Well, too bad! VIA Conservative 101 According to Politico , some of those names include Gingrich for Secretary of State, Mnuchin, a 17 year veteran of Goldman Sachs for Treasure Secretary and Mayor Giuliani for Attorney General. And of course Sheriff David Clarke as the Homeland Security Secretary. He has been an incredible patriotic American and leader in Blue Lives Matter. CNN was terrified by this. “I think the one major flag I have is that someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as his Homeland Security secretary? Someone who I very much see as if he’s not a terrorist inciting terrorism?” said CNN commentator Angela Rye. “If people are afraid of Sheriff Clarke, afraid of the policies which he represents, I think that’s terrorism,” she said. This of course, makes no sense. You can’t just call people who disagree with you terrorists. Check out the video below and see for yourself. 
Now, this makes me wonder… what gives Angela the right to call an honest person like Sheriff Clarke a terrorist? Is it jealousy? 
You can’t call someone a terrorist just because you don’t agree with them. It’s absurd!

Also, don’t forget to subscribe, rate, and review the show on iTunes . We can’t do this show without your support!!! On this episode, Roqayah and Kumars speak with a married father of one who has spent over ten years as a biologist and environmental protection specialist, planning large scale projects to minimize environmental impacts for several federal agencies. John (not his real name) was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer in March and he’s now found himself stuck in between massive gaps in our healthcare system and an out-of-control drug war.
John tells us about his initial diagnosis, a diagnosis that came many months late because of his inability to get the care he needed in a timely fashion. This delay in care happened despite him having some of the best health insurance available as a federal employee. Once diagnosed, John tells us about how he was forced to continue working full-time so as not to lose his life insurance or health insurance policies. Without life insurance, his family would be severely impacted if he should die, and without health insurance, he could not afford the care required to keep him alive. If he were to get insurance on the private market, it would be too expensive to afford, even with his current salary, and the benefits would be severely limited compared to what he currently has.
John also tells us how he is at risk for losing his job (hence the pseudonym) because of his use of medical marijuana, the only treatment that has allowed him to deal with the horrible effects of his cancer and chemotherapy treatments. There are strict rules against federal employees using medical marijuana, even if they work in states where it is legal. Recently, it was announced that random drug-testing would be extended to all federal employees, putting John at-risk for losing his job, his healthcare, and his life insurance. We discuss the pharmaceutical industry’s role in fighting the legitimacy of medical marijuana, as well as their role in perpetuating skyrocketing healthcare costs. We also discuss the importance of writing to government officials to speak out on behalf of John and those in a similar position who are denied life-saving treatment, whether due to cost or due to our indefensible drug laws.
Look for a story from Roqayah in Shadowproof on John’s situation shortly!

10265,John Bolton: Trump’s Only Mistake Was Not Firing Comey on January the 20th - Breitbart,"On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, former U. N. ambassador John Bolton told SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam that he would “absolutely” have fired FBI Director James Comey if the decision was his to make. [“My only criticism of the Trump administration decision was that they should have fired him on January the 20th,” Bolton added.   “I speak as an alumnus of the Department of Justice in the Reagan and early Bush 41 administrations. I was assistant attorney general first for the head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, and then head of the Civil Division, the department’s largest litigating division. I’ve dealt with the FBI when I was at Justice. I’ve dealt with them continuously in my days at the State Department on counterintelligence and other issues. I’ve dealt with them in their background investigation of judicial nominees. It was one of my principal responsibilities in legislative affairs at the Justice Department,” he recalled.  “I know the FBI well, and I have enormous respect for it. James Comey disgraced the FBI by his conduct of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and many, many other things that have never become public, but that agents talk about in private conversations,” Bolton declared.  “This was always about the greater glory of Jim Comey,” he said. “It’s perfectly clear that the way he handled the Clinton email investigation, both in terms of his erroneous legal interpretation of the applicable statutes, but also most critically his July 5 news conference and his subsequent letters to Congress in October and November, reopening and then closing the investigation, were a gross violation of unambiguous Department of Justice policies about not commenting on ongoing investigations. ”  “It applies to investigators as well as prosecutors, and there’s a reason for this,” Bolton explained. “It’s not just a policy that you don’t talk about investigations and prosecutions. The rule is, you either indict someone or you close the file. ”  “Why is that important?” he asked. “I think it has constitutional foundations: the presumption of innocence for the average citizen, the requirement that guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that an accused defendant have the right to confront witnesses against him. There’s nothing in that series of constitutional projections that allows prosecutors or investigators to comment on the behavior of an individual citizen, other than in a court to prove up an indictment. ”  “I have nothing good to say about Hillary Clinton’s conduct on the email scene, but it was not James Comey’s business to give a review of her behavior,” Bolton declared. “That’s the real interference in the election. Subsequent the letters and things that flowed from that really all come from that initial mistake. That’s why honestly it’s the case that if Hillary had been elected, she would have been justified in firing Comey on the 20th of January. ”  “All of this business about the firing being an effort to somehow undercut the Russia investigation is utter nonsense. Jeff Sessions, who was a campaign surrogate for the Trump campaign, is recused from the Russia investigation. The Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, who is a career Justice Department prosecutor, is acting Attorney General for that purpose. The FBI investigation has not been impeded at all. There is absolutely no evidence of that. This is all media speculation and hype,” he said.  “I just hope that the Department of Justice and the White House stand firm on this, because there is an important principle at stake. Substantively, it was right to fire Comey for the protection of 300 million presumed innocent until proven guilty Americans, that investigators and prosecutors don’t get to dish on you in public if they feel they can’t indict,” he maintained. Bolton said there was no question Hillary Clinton, or perhaps outgoing President Barack Obama, would have fired Comey if she had won the election. “What Comey did, as outlined in Rosenstein’s memo that accompanied the Sessions recommendation to the president that Comey be fired, is unanswerable,” Bolton contended. “And you can bet that the media and the Democratic politicians who are condemning Trump today would have leapt to her defense and said it was entirely justified. ”  “I hope that my own principles would have sustained me to the point where I would agree because it would have been justified,” he added. “It’s Comey’s conduct here that’s the center of the issue. It’s not whether Trump had an effective media strategy on Tuesday night. It’s not whether they should have gotten Comey on the phone first. It’s not because he was meeting with the Russian foreign minister the next day. ”  “Look, timing is never good on these things,” Bolton said. “The best timing was January the 20th. Every day that goes on after that is a little bit worse. The idea that Trump should have waited 90 or 180 days before firing Comey  …    ”  He laughed as Kassam interjected and said Trump’s critics might as well insist he give the FBI director four years’ notice. “Let’s not leave him in there, precisely,” Bolton concurred. Bolton said the Comey firing is “not even close to” a   scandal, as some critics have claimed. “I know those people at the FBI. They are tough, they are patriotic. They tend to skew conservative in their voting patterns,” said Bolton. “But when it comes to law enforcement, nothing gets between them and the truth. The idea that the Trump administration or anybody else from a political background could affect them, could intimidate them, is just ludicrous. It’s just ludicrous. ”  “This whole notion that you have to have an independent counsel and an independent set of investigators is just a way to politicize prosecutions,” he said. “The fact is, this investigation of Russia  —   the Trump campaign connection, whatever it is  —   will go on utterly unimpeded, and if anything with even more determination on the part of the career prosecutors and FBI investigators that they’re not going to be interfered with. They’re going to get to the truth, whatever the truth is. This will strengthen their resolve. ” “Why not appoint Eric Holder the independent counsel? I mean, let’s get right to it. How about Loretta Lynch? They’re both unemployed now,” Bolton suggested sarcastically. Kassam turned to international news, asking Bolton about Turkey’s strenuous objections to the Trump administration’s stated plan to arm and support Syrian Kurdish forces in the upcoming battle to recapture the Islamic State capital of Raqqa. Turkey maintains the Syrian YPG militia is linked to the violent PKK separatists in Turkey, and could pass American weapons to them. “I would not arm them,” Bolton said. “I understand what the logic is, that we have armed Kurds in Iraq against the Islamic State. But the fact is, not all Kurds are equally favorable toward a Western view of responsible government. The PKK is a terrorist and communist organization. ”  “I think this is simply carrying on unfortunately from the Obama policy of how to destroy ISIS, and I think it’s the wrong way to go,” he advised.  “I don’t have much sympathy, if any, for Erdogan,” he said of Turkey’s president. “I do have sympathy for Turkey, and I’m very worried these same weapons we’re giving them now are going to be turned against Turkish civilians down the road. We’ve got a very difficult alliance management problem here with Erodgan. I do think he has authoritarian tendencies. I worry that he’s being seduced by Putin. But I think we’ve got to grit our teeth and think of Turkey rather than Erdogan, and see if we can see it through here. ”  “I think we need a completely new strategy to defeat ISIS,” Bolton recommended. “I don’t think we want to do it in any kind of way that strengthens other terrorist groups, including those among the Syrian opposition. I don’t think we want to do it in a way that strengthens the Iranian axis of power  —   including the Baghdad government sadly, the Assad regime, and Hezbollah, which is pretty much the direction that the Obama strategy was going in. ”  “There’s a lot to correct here. I certainly share the view that we want to destroy the caliphate at the earliest possible opportunity, but arming this particular group I think is a mistake,” he said. Kassam asked Bolton what he thought of Henry Kissinger’s presence in the Oval Office on Wednesday when President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “I’ve spoken to him before. In the interests of full disclosure, I try and speak to him fairly frequently myself,” Bolton said of Kissinger. “I think hearing his insights is a plus for any president. That doesn’t mean that I agree with him on everything, and I rather doubt that President Trump agrees with him on everything. But few people have been through what Kissinger went through and have the insight. Anybody who’s got some spare time should read all three volumes of his memoir of his days in the White House and the State Department. ”  “What got me most about that meeting was the instant pivot by Democrats and the press to say, ‘There it is! Henry Kissinger, tainted by his association with Richard Nixon!’ They just can’t restrain themselves,” Bolton marveled.

10267,Measles Outbreak Continues to Spread in Minnesota: 44 Cases Confirmed - Breitbart,"The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) announced on Friday afternoon that the number of confirmed cases of measles in the state has now increased to 44, three more than had been confirmed 24 hours ago, and ten more than had been confirmed 48 hours ago. [Of the 44 total cases, 41 are in Hennepin County, two are in Ramsey County, and one is in Crow Wing County.    are “confirmed to be unvaccinated. ” Two “had 2 doses of MMR. ”   of the cases are “in children ages 0 through 10 years,” while there is “1 case in an adult. ” MDH reports that “38 of the cases are Somali Minnesotan. ” “Health officials said the Crow Wing county child may have been exposed in multiple locations in Hennepin County,” MDH said in a statement released on Thursday. “Once measles begins to spread in unvaccinated populations, it can be very difficult to stop,” Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease control for MDH, said in the statement. “We would not be surprised if we saw additional cases in other parts of the state where there are clusters of unvaccinated people before this is over,” Ehresmann added. In Thursday’s statement, MDH added new information about the investigation it has been conducting into the outbreak. According to the MDH statement: Disease investigators follow up with each confirmed case to determine how the person became infected and who was exposed to the case while they were infectious. Those exposed people who are determined not to be immune to measles  —   because they have not been vaccinated nor had the disease  —   are asked to exclude themselves from school, work or child care for 21 days. “In addition to case identification, investigation and   state and local health officials have been working with local public health staff and leaders in the Somali community to address concerns about autism and encourage MMR vaccination,” the statement added. The measles outbreak, now the largest in the state in more than 20 years, is becoming costly to the taxpayers of Minnesota. The MDH statement noted: In the three weeks since the outbreak began, outbreak response efforts have involved more than 70 staff at the state level, working full or part time, at a cost of $207, 000. In addition, county public health staff and health care providers and facilities involved in the outbreak have accrued significant labor and related costs. The first case of measles in Minnesota in 2017 was diagnosed on April 11, but MDH did not report the first three cases publicly until April 13. “Most of the exposures have occurred in either child care, health care or household settings. To date, more than 2, 500 people have been exposed,” MDH said on Thursday. Early on in the outbreak, Ehresmann noted that “measles can spread easily among unvaccinated people. ” “The best way to protect yourself and your community is to make sure everyone has been vaccinated,” she said at the time. “Measles was declared eliminated in the U. S. in 2000, but it is still common in other parts of the world. Ehresmann noted that Europe is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak. Minnesota and other states still see sporadic cases  —   typically linked to international travel,” MDH said in a statement released on April 14, one day after the first three cases were reported: Most people in Minnesota are immune to measles either from having been vaccinated or from having had the disease. However, in recent years immunization rates have declined in some communities and groups  —   often due to fears related to misinformation about vaccine risks. This decline in immunization rates increases the risk  —   not only for those who are unvaccinated by choice, but also for those who cannot be vaccinated due to health status or age. Minnesota’s Somali community in particular has struggled with low rates of immunization due in part to misinformation about immunization risks. “This outbreak is about unvaccinated children, not specific communities,” said Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger. “Unfortunately, the Minnesota Somali community has been targeted with misinformation about vaccine risks. We’re partnering with Somali community leaders and health care providers to counteract that misinformation. We want as many Minnesotans as possible to protect themselves and their families by getting vaccinated. ” “We’re working with the Somali community in the Twin Cities to alert people to the outbreak,” Ehresmann added in the April 14 statement.",0
10268,’Bloodbath’ ESPN Layoffs Could be Larger Than Reported - Breitbart,"The   impending round of layoffs coming to sports cable network ESPN could begin this week, with some saying it could be a bigger deal than previously reported. [New sources claim that “significant   names” and writers may be hit hard by the layoffs, The Washington Post revealed.  Originally reported as a possible target of 50 employees, including   talent and some beat writers for the website, now insiders disclose it may be closer to 70 employees cut. “This could be a bloodbath,” warned an inside source, according to Sporting News. ESPN has made no official announcement about the extent of the impending   measure. The cuts come just ahead of Disney’s   financial report. Disney already reported a major deficit due to high costs of keeping the sports cable network afloat. The sports network has been a huge drag on Disney. After losing over 10, 000 subscribers a month and being saddled with hundreds of millions in broadcast fees levied by the various national leagues, ESPN has proved a money loser for the entertainment giant. By some reports, ESPN has lost over 12 million subscribers over the last five years. “ESPN seems to be bleeding money because of   so my salary was unattractive to them,” former ESPN writer Adam Rubin said. “And the new MLB editor at ESPN wants to get away from ‘thorough’ beat coverage  —   that’s the precise word she used  —   and I suppose I was the sacrificial lamb to hammer home that point. ” Another insider noted that ESPN is not growing its subscriber base or its profit margin. “So the only way to show fiscal responsibility is to lay people off,” the source said. “This is all Wall  . This is all about Disney ordering a Code Red. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
10269,Hillary Clinton Struggles to Find Footing in Unusual Race - The New York Times,"Democrats could hardly believe their good fortune last month when it became clear that Hillary Clinton was headed to a general election showdown with Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump carried so much baggage and had insulted so many voting blocs that some Clinton supporters began to imagine a landslide. But early optimism that this would be an easy race is evaporating. In the corridors of Congress, on airplane shuttles between New York and Washington, at donor gatherings and on conference calls, anxiety is spreading through the Democratic Party that Mrs. Clinton is struggling to find her footing. While she enjoys many demographic advantages heading into the fall, key Democrats say they are growing worried that her campaign has not determined how to combat her unpredictable, often wily Republican rival, to whom criticism seldom sticks and rules of decorum seem not to apply. Mrs. Clinton is pressing ahead with a conventional campaign, echoing the 2012 themes used against the Republican nominee that year, Mitt Romney. But Mr. Trump is running a jarringly different crusade: accusing her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of rape proposing that the country conduct brutal methods of torture and suggesting that South Korea and Japan be permitted to develop nuclear arms. Prominent Democrats say a more provocative approach is needed. “The guy’s a maniac,” John Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, said about Mr. Trump. Referring to a famous 1964 political message, he said, “You could run the old L. B. J. ad against Goldwater, with ‘Three, two, one,’ and a hydrogen bomb blows up with a little girl counting daisies. ” Of course, Mr. Trump faces many hurdles himself, and has stumbled in managing his growing campaign as he shifts toward a general election. But Democrats suggest that the past few weeks have shown that Mrs. Clinton and her aides must become more agile and creative against him. The sense of nervousness crystallized this week when Mrs. Clinton devoted campaign events across California to hitting Mr. Trump for not releasing his tax returns and depicting him as a cold corporate titan who profited off the housing crisis. Such charges helped undermine Mr. Romney four years ago. Yet Mrs. Clinton’s remarks received little   coverage in the news media, while cable channels went live with Mr. Trump’s    recitation of “Crooked Hillary,” his favored nickname for her. Ken Salazar, the former Colorado senator who has been mentioned as a possible Clinton running mate, said the campaign should draw a sharp contrast between Mr. Trump’s shortcomings and Mrs. Clinton’s potential to be “the most qualified person to be president in our lifetime. ” “The campaign needs to expose Donald Trump as the opposite  —   selfish, egomaniac, divisive and unqualified to be president,” Mr. Salazar said in an email. Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said that the news coverage Mr. Trump is receiving is not helping him. She said that unlike Mr. Trump, who uses “nothing but his own mouth,” Mrs. Clinton has a campaign that employs many methods of communication, including videos, respected surrogates and bilingual outreach. “We hear from friends who think we should act more like Trump or criticize us for sometimes using traditional communications tactics,” she said. “But we don’t think that’s the answer. ” As a candidate, Mrs. Clinton is not without her own issues to overcome, including her inability to quickly put away Senator Bernie Sanders and her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, feeding a perception she is not trustworthy. In a report delivered this past week to Congress, the State Department’s inspector general strongly criticized her for the practice. But it is the campaign’s approach to Mr. Trump that is making even Mrs. Clinton’s most loyal supporters uneasy. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York is concerned that she lacks a comprehensive strategy to confront Mr. Trump, and has told Democrats that the Clinton campaign must bring on a senior staff member dedicated only to the Trump portfolio. “As soon as she clinches the nomination, we need a   person in the campaign whose sole job is to respond to Trump, almost on an hourly basis,” said Mr. Schumer, who has begun conversations with Clinton officials about who could fill that role. During a conference call this month,   female supporters pressed Mrs. Clinton’s advisers about her message  —   which has as a slogan “Breaking Down Barriers”  —   and whether it needs to shift for the general election. “The message will be broadening,” Karen Finney, a senior adviser, explained, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The New York Times. “But,” she added, leaving some participants perplexed, “breaking down barriers and unity will continue to be part of the theme because Hillary believes we need to come together as a country in many ways. ” Debates have broken out in Mrs. Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters over the best approach to take. Some advisers worry that by running against Mr. Trump as she would a traditional Republican candidate, Mrs. Clinton is actually making the   star appear more legitimate. This month, when Mr. Trump suggested he would reduce the national debt by negotiating with creditors to accept something less than full payment, economists dismissed the idea as fanciful. Hours later, the Clinton campaign sent out a news release about Mr. Trump’s “risky” idea of defaulting on the national debt with a response from Gene Sperling, formerly a senior economic adviser to both President Obama and Mr. Clinton, condemning the idea. The seriousness of the campaign’s response seemed to elevate a nonsensical proposal. “That is a danger,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. “You have to take the threat of Trump becoming president seriously, but you shouldn’t treat him as a serious person. ” At the same time, Mrs. Clinton’s attempts at poking Mr. Trump have felt tame compared with what he has unleashed. The day after he accused her husband of rape on Fox News this month, she told CNN, “I have concluded he is not qualified to be president. ” Her aides were exuberant that Mrs. Clinton, a cautious candidate who for weeks had demurred when asked if Mr. Trump was up to the job, had finally publicly declared him unfit. But to many Clinton allies, it felt like a tepid tactic from yesteryear. “Sometimes, you get the feeling that they’re in a professional boxing match and he’s in a street fight, and they’re coming in with their gloves on,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, expressing dismay over the Clinton operation’s apparent lack of appetite for combat. “This is a street fight with a guy with a razor and a broken   bottle,” he added, “and you’ve got to fight him like that. ” Ms. Palmieri said, “Each tactic we use is designed for a particular purpose to either engage the press or reach a certain audience. ” Any aggressive approach by Mrs. Clinton is potentially dangerous, however, because recent polls show she is viewed negatively by a majority of the electorate. The campaign says it intends to go after Mr. Trump more forcefully, particularly on national security and his business record, after June 7, when Mrs. Clinton is expected to officially clinch her party’s nomination. For now, her aides appear to be throwing ideas against a wall to see what sticks, including trying out different monikers after the Democratic National Committee’s “Dangerous Donald” flopped. An internal favorite is “Poor Donald,” with its implication that Mr. Trump, famously defensive about his net worth, is not nearly as wealthy as he lets on. Her advisers also say that a large percentage of voters have not yet paid attention to the details of the race and do not know about Mr. Trump’s business dealings or that he has refused to release his taxes. “It wouldn’t be a general election without some early   from Washington insiders,” said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager. He noted that the campaign had attacked Mr. Trump over the tax returns and for his “demeaning millions of Americans. ” “Our campaign has already shown the resolve to take him on and put him on defense in ways his Republican challengers never could,” Mr. Mook added. William M. Daley, Mr. Obama’s former White House chief of staff, attributed any early shortcomings in taking on Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton’s prolonged primary battle against Mr. Sanders. The period between the June 7 contests and the July convention will reshape the race, he said. To that end, Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster and chief strategist, pointed out that at this stage in the 2008 primary battle against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama led Senator John McCain by only two percentage points. He went on to defeat Mr. McCain by 7. 2 percentage points. It is clear, however, that Democrats are no longer mocking Mr. Trump. Many of them seem determined instead to understand his appeal. In an interview on Friday, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said he had purchased and begun reading Mr. Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal. ” The governor said he remained confident that Mrs. Clinton would ultimately win, but added that “she has to be careful, because now he has momentum. ”",0
10270,Trump’s Immigration Order Could Have a Big Impact on Sports - The New York Times,"President Trump’s ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations could have a wide impact on international sports, including jeopardizing a warm relationship between the United States and Iran in wrestling competitions and threatening the chances of Los Angeles hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics and of the United States securing soccer’s 2026 World Cup. On Saturday, sports officials struggled to understand the implications of Mr. Trump’s executive order, including the question of whether athletes from the targeted nations could enter the United States to compete, especially in the initial   period of the ban. “We are working closely with the administration to understand the new rules and how we best navigate them as it pertains to visiting athletes,” Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said in an email. “We know they are supportive of the Olympic movement and our bid and believe we will have a good working relationship with them to ensure our success in hosting and attending events. ” At least one International Olympic Committee delegate criticized Mr. Trump’s decision. The delegate, Richard Peterkin of St. Lucia, said Saturday that he considered the executive order “very, very disappointing. ” He also called the United States a “haven” for many athletes hoping to train outside their home countries. “Most of our athletes from St. Lucia train in the States,” Mr. Peterkin said. “We don’t have an issue because we’re not on that list of seven, but if we were  —   there go hopes and dreams. ” On Saturday evening, a federal judge blocked part of the executive order, but that decision appeared unrelated to the elements of the ban that troubled sports officials. The most immediate effect may come in wrestling, given that one of the nations affected by Mr. Trump’s ban is Iran, which has long had a congenial relationship with the United States in that sport. Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s order. The United States freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser, the chief   for U. S. A. Wrestling and a 1984   Olympic champion, said on Saturday that the president of Iran’s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet. “There’s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say, ‘We can’t get visas to go there, so no Americans can come here, either,’” Mr. Fraser said. While Olympic boycotts have resulted from tense political differences between nations, opposing countries have also long found common ground on playing fields, on the track and in sports arenas. One of the most celebrated examples is the     diplomacy that helped foster the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s. In wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the I. O. C. to keep the sport in the Summer Games. American wrestlers and officials are warmly welcomed in Iran, and Iranian wrestlers compete regularly in the United States. They may be invited to meets in May in New York and in June in Los Angeles, Mr. Fraser said. There is uncertainty now, however, about whether they would be granted P1 visas, commonly known as sports visas, to compete. In 2014, Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling, became one of the few women allowed into a wrestling arena in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She said on Saturday that she was frustrated by Mr. Trump’s decision. “I don’t think our current president has any clue what the State Department and what sports diplomats and cultural exchanges do for our country and for the safety of our people around the world,” Ms. Kelley said. The ban on visitors from the seven nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   comes at a delicate time for the U. S. O. C. Los Angeles is seeking to host the 2024 Summer Games, and it will learn in September whether it, Paris or Budapest will get the Games. (There is some speculation that the I. O. C. will award the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles, but the U. S. O. C. remains committed to the bid for the 2024 Games.) David Wallechinsky, an American member of the I. O. C. ’s cultural and heritage commission and the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Mr. Trump in November had hurt Los Angeles’s bid with I. O. C. delegates because Mr. Trump was perceived as being “    and  . ” “This is worse,” Mr. Wallechinsky said of the Muslim ban, adding, “I would consider it a blow to the Los Angeles bid  —   not fatal but a blow. ” At a meeting at the I. O. C. ’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, several days after the American presidential election, Mr. Wallechinsky was asked repeatedly, “What is wrong with your country?” he said. He said he sought to assure I. O. C. officials by explaining that   of the voters in Los Angeles had voted against Mr. Trump, describing the city to them as a “a multicultural,   zone. ” The United States is expected to bid to host the world’s other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate an American bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Mr. Trump’s plans to build a wall across America’s southern border. “I think a   World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn’t in the White House,” Mr. Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr. Trump. After Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Gulati modified his remarks, saying, “It’s not going to dissuade us or persuade us to bid. ” International perceptions of the Trump administration “matter, for sure,” Mr. Gulati said, “but I think those will be developed in the months to come. ” U. S. Soccer said Saturday it would have no immediate comment as it examined Mr. Trump’s order. Many questions remained unanswered about the ability of a number of athletes to travel. Two N. B. A. players, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump’s executive order. (Both, however, were born in Wau, now part of South Sudan, which gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.) Mr. Maker’s family fled Sudan when he was 5 and eventually settled in Australia. Mr. Maker, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, moved to the United States to play high school basketball in Louisiana, eventually moved to Canada and is an Australian citizen who holds a passport from that country. It was unclear how people with dual citizenship would be treated under the order. Mr. Deng, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has lived in the United States for 17 years. His family fled to Egypt when he was 5 to escape the Sudanese civil war. Mr. Deng came to the United States when he was 14 and attended high school in New Jersey, and he later became a British citizen. The N. B. A. also holds an annual Basketball Without Borders camp, and it is expected to be held in New Orleans during the league’s   weekend in February. While rosters have not been released, last year’s camp involved players from 25 countries, including Amir Reza   from Iran. Major League Soccer has two   players with familial ties to two of the nations facing bans. Steve Beitashour of Toronto has played for Iran’s national team, and Justin Meram of Columbus has played for Iraq. League officials were looking into the matter on Saturday. Mo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5, 000 meters and 10, 000 meters, is a   athlete coached by Alberto Salazar. Early Sunday morning Mr. Farah’s Facebook page had a post that, among other things, said: “On 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien. I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years   working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. ” Abdi Abdirahman, a   Olympian for the United States who finished third in the 2016 New York City Marathon, was also born in Somalia, and the race regularly attracts runners from around the globe. The 2016 race featured three runners from Iran, nine from Syria and one from Sudan in the field of about 50, 000 runners. “Our goal is always to recruit the world’s best and cleanest athletes, regardless of where they’re from,” Chris Weiller, a spokesman for New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, said in an email. Jackie   a spokeswoman for track and field’s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, said, “We clearly need to understand the implications of this new U. S. immigration policy and will be seeking assurances that it will not adversely affect” the sport’s world championships, scheduled to be held in Eugene, Ore. in 2021. Phil Andrews, the chief executive of U. S. A. Weightlifting, said officials were trying to figure out the impact of Mr. Trump’s ban on the world   championships, scheduled for November in Anaheim, Calif. and on the American team’s participation at a competition in Iran. “Our view is that politics and sport should be separate,” Mr. Andrews said, stressing sports diplomacy among nations. “We sincerely hope to peacefully welcome these seven nations to Anaheim this November. It is unimaginable to be able to host a true world event without their participation. ”",0
10271,Homeless Man Allegedly Broke into 4 Houses of Worship to ’Get Back at God’ - Breitbart,"A homeless man allegedly broke into four houses of worship in New York during a three week period because he wanted to get revenge at God. [Joseph Woznik, 23, is accused of breaking into an Episcopal church, a Romanian Orthodox church, a Hindu temple, and a Roman Catholic church in Queens starting March 21, the Daily Mail reported.  “I’m mad at God. I don’t like church no more. I don’t want to deal with religion. I’m sick and tired of hearing about religion. I don’t break into houses, only churches. I break in to get back at God,” Woznik allegedly told police. Woznik was arrested Tuesday and charged with multiple counts of burglary and grand larceny as hate crimes, the New York Post reported. If convicted, Woznik faces up to 15 years behind bars, police said. Police also said Woznik was caught on two video cameras during the burglaries and confessed to his crimes. Woznik is also wanted in a February 26 church burglary in Winter Garden, Florida, police said. Rev. Paul Lai of the St. James Episcopal Church in Flushing, Queens, said his parish was struck three times, once on March 23, once on April 2, and again on Monday. “He needs help,” Lai told the New York Daily News. “It’s hard to say why he has such hatred against God.   …     We don’t have anything here now. ” Woznik took $1, 800 the first time, a Canon digital camera the second time, and three checks from the church’s checkbook on his third   Lai said. The first burglary was at the Bangladesh Hindu Mandir Temple in Flushing, where an employee of the temple, upon arriving at work on March 21, discovered three donation boxes forced open and cleaned out, officials said. The suspect also allegedly targeted Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians Church on Monday, using a hammer to break into a donation box. Reportedly, he also took $20 that was beneath a statue of the Virgin Mary. Police said he was finally caught on Tuesday, a day after allegedly stealing a   communion tray from St. Mary Romanian Orthodox Church in Elmhurst. At his arraignment hearing in Queens Criminal Court Wednesday night, a judge ordered that Woznik be held on $200, 000 bail, placed on suicide watch, and remanded to face similar charges in Florida.",0

10273,"Researchers Detect Strange Messages from the Stars, Says it Might be Aliens","Researchers involved in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) have announced in a paper that they have detected new messages from the stars, saying they are likely to have been generated by aliens. The researchers are from the University of Laval in Quebec, Canada. Their paper has been accepted by the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and is titled ‘ Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars.’
According to a print version of the paper – also available online – the title of the paper was initially proposed as ‘Signals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence.’ However, this was later changed due to concerns raised by some observers.
The researchers who made the discovery revealed they heard unusual messages from deep in space. For them, they strongly believe the messages are coming from aliens.
The paper revealed the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. According to the researchers, their analysis of these modulations in a tiny set of stars, may indicate that these messages are from extraterrestrial intelligence looking to alert humanity of their existence.
The researchers said there is no obvious explanation to what they discovered, hence their conclusion that the messages are coming from aliens.
“We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence hypothesis,” the researchers, EF Borra and E Trottier wrote in their paper.
The researchers also noted that further work will need to be done, in order to confirm or deny the hypothesis they have put forward. Doing so will require watching for the same signals on different equipment, aiding to discard all other explanations. This will be done by a so-called independent body.",0
10274,How Effective Are Books On Fitness?,"We’re all about self-improvement here at Return Of Kings. A man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion, and when he has achieved one goal, he should move onto the next one. In short, never rest on your laurels.
Combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary. As this article deals with fitness, you know what I’m going to say: personal trainers, or at the very least, the ones at your average commercial gym, should be avoided at all costs. And while most long-term fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what he’s doing, most of us have to train alone, especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path. But there is another option: books 

Yes, books, that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer. There are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics. But the question remains: how effective is a book in physical training?
As an avid reader of fitness-related tomes (and many others, but that’s neither here nor there), I own many of these books. And I feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on “genre”.
Weight Lifting and Calisthenics When I first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager, I turned to the nearby commercial gym, as most tyros tend to. In that commercial gym, I quickly found myself being attached to a well-meaning jackass who gave me a machine-heavy program that, according to him, would “develop strength, size and endurance.” And like most naive young men, I followed him, developing none of those things, but lining the trainer’s pockets.
Eventually, realizing that I had been lied to, I embarked on a search for enlightenment, coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests. One of the first things that I came across were books that I have repeatedly referred to in these pages, and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out there—the works of men such as Paul Wade and Pavel Tsatsouline. Upon reading books such as Power to the People and the Convict Condidtioning series, and using a bit of common sense, I deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons:
One, they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and “purity”. Rather than advocating a julienne of exercises; their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body. Two, the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer: as a maximum security convict and a Spetsnaz veteran (respectively), I knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival, rather than “doing curls for the girls”. And third, they referred to the strongmen of old like Maxick and Eugen Sandow, “standing on the shoulders of giants” and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing, much of which I have further consumed.
In general, I would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness, as these are solitary activities, and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man. Thus, the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner.

Martial Arts As I have repeatedly stated on this website , martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of salt—while I’m not so stupid as to say “there’s no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline” (and yes I have seen this boneheaded argument made), I have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and film-makers propagate, on my own website as well as my Youtube and Dailymotion channels. Sadly, thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the United States, any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a “master”.
With that being said, some martial arts books are effective, thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move and/or explaining proper situations in how to use them. While I have a background in “proper” study, I have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that I was not formally taught—such as grappling. And again, I sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field: men like Farmer Burns ( Lessons in Catch Wrestling and Physical Culture ) and Masao Takahashi ( Mastering Judo ) wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting “in the clinch”, and I have also used Dr. Sang Kim’s books on Taekwondo such as Complete Kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didn’t teach me. And of course I practiced on resisting opponents, some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique.
The most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you MUST practice these techniques against a bag/dummy at the VERY least, and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight. And while this is also the case for any book on physical culture, I would argue that it’s the most important for martial arts—namely because martial arts techniques are, by definition, used in panic situations. In contrast, weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmness—not counting the fake screaming idiots use to “pump themselves up”.

Mindset/Meditation/Etc Books such as the Kundalini Meditation Manual by Yogi Bhajan, which I have only recently started to use, are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on self-improvement to use. They are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically “think really hard about something”, but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficult-meditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately, and in some ways changing one’s mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do.
While I admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that I do with the other two topics, I would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been “grokked” in the words of Anthony Burgess: After all, every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset. And thus, its difficulty lies in the original understanding.

Conclusion Looking at these three broad “genres” of male self-improvement books, we can see that they differ greatly in content, but, speaking from a position of experience, I can safely say that to a great extent they are effective, and they can teach you new things, but only if you get one of the relatively few books that aren’t written by armchair alpha males, and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them.

10275,"Amid Protests Over Police Shootings of Black Men, Latinos Note a Disparity - The New York Times","The sheriff’s deputies arrived at the home in San Antonio on a call that a woman had been injured in a domestic dispute. A bystander started recording a video as they pursued a shirtless man armed with a knife outside the home. Though taken from a distance, the video seemed to show the    man, Gilbert Flores, raising his arms as the deputies opened fire, killing him. The video appeared on television, and local officials opened an investigation. But the case, which took place last year, has drawn limited national attention  —   a stark contrast with the fatal police shootings of black men in recent days in Louisiana and Minnesota, which have ignited protests and calls for reform around the country. To some Latino advocates, it is just one example of how the killings of Latinos in encounters with the police do not generate the same level of scrutiny, outrage or discourse as the fatal shootings of blacks. “Why isn’t the community aggressively championing the victims of these crimes?” said Juan Cartagena, the president of LatinoJustice, a legal advocacy group, who sees parallels in the strained relationship many   and Latinos experience with law enforcement. There is no federal clearinghouse that tracks all   killings, criminal justice researchers say, so it is difficult to quantify how many Latinos are killed in encounters with officers. That has left advocates to rely largely on anecdotal evidence. Even with jurisdictions that include Hispanic or Latino as an option in statistics, the numbers can be unreliable it is not uncommon for people to be incorrectly classified as white or black. “You don’t know if the tick box is accurate or not,” said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina who researches police shootings and called the lack of a national database a “national embarrassment. ” But in recent years, multiple cases have roiled Hispanics in different parts of the country. The fatal shooting of a    man in Fullerton, Calif. by California Highway Patrol officers this month led to modest protests, and the killing of a    girl in Denver in January 2015 spurred similar demonstrations. The death of a    man in 2015 in Pasco, Wash. gunned down after throwing rocks at police officers, stirred the sizable immigrant population there. Some believed the killing, recorded on video, had the potential to become the “Ferguson moment” for Hispanics. “There are plenty of   incidents across the country that for one reason or another don’t seem to get the same attention,” said Eric Rodriguez, vice president for public policy at the National Council of La Raza. “There’s sufficient amount of concern and outrage about what’s happening,” he added. “This tension at the community level, it’s palpable. ” Activists and researchers say a range of factors, rooted in differences in history and culture, could explain why pockets of anger cropping up after cases involving Latinos have not grown to have a larger national impact. For one, Hispanic does not denote a race, but rather an ethnicity the sprawling population of Hispanics has differing priorities, depending on region, nationality and citizenship status. Also, Latino advocates say, they do not have the same level of organization as   to spread their concerns more widely. For instance, they say, there is no figure with as high a profile as the Rev. Al Sharpton, nor does religion play as big a role in activism among Hispanics. “The Catholic Church,” Mr. Cartagena said, “really hasn’t used that kind of messaging as a way to galvanize support. ” For some, immigration is a more immediate, driving concern a fear of confronting the authorities holds some back from being more vocal. “They interact with that whole system in a very different way because they have even fewer rights,” said Angelo Falcón,   of the National Institute for Latino Policy. “You have a lot of Latinos who are living without papers, under the radar, who are abused by regular police as well. ” But Mr. Cartagena expressed dismay at the idea that certain issues affect only certain groups of people  —   that police brutality is an   issue, or immigration a Latino concern. “We live similar experiences with respect to marginalization of our communities,” he said. “For this to really move the dial, it has to be done in solidarity with everyone else. ” Some in law enforcement acknowledge the tensions in their relationship with Latinos. Tina Nieto, a captain in the Los Angeles Police Department, said she has seen the police shift from being an “occupying force” in some neighborhoods to one that is more engaged with residents. And as a commanding officer, she has sought to overcome the lingering skepticism toward the police. “There’s a disconnect between what people believe sometimes and what the policing reality is,” said Captain Nieto, the incoming national president of the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association. “Sometimes it doesn’t look pretty, but if you work to establish open lines of communication, we can have that dialogue. ” In the case of Mr. Flores in San Antonio, the Bexar County Sheriff’s Department has pushed back against the notion that he had his hands up in surrender, despite what the video depicts. (Researchers have noted some shortcomings with video evidence.) James Keith, a spokesman for the department, said Mr. Flores was moving toward the deputies when he was shot, and earlier, he had tried to attack the deputies. A grand jury declined to press criminal charges against the deputies who shot him, both of whom had Latino surnames. The Orange County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the death of Pedro Villanueva, the    killed in California, which happened on July 3, just days before the shooting in Baton Rouge, La. California Highway Patrol officers followed Mr. Villanueva’s red pickup truck in their unmarked vehicle for about 10 miles. They tried to pull him over, the authorities said, but he made a   and drove in the direction of the officers, who opened fire. “How would an innocent boy be killed like that?” David Sainz, Mr. Villanueva’s brother, said in a phone interview from the family’s Mexican restaurant in the San Fernando Valley. “He was such a good kid. He didn’t have to be shot. ” The district attorney and the highway patrol declined to comment. In 2012, Genevieve Huizar’s    son, Manuel Diaz, was fatally shot by the police in Anaheim, a death that came during a spate of killings in the city that set off protests there. In the years since, Ms. Huizar has traveled across California protesting   shootings. She helped found the Young Survivors Legacy Support Network, which organizes picnics and vigils for relatives who have lost loved ones. On Wednesday night, almost four years to the day since her son’s death, she is planning another vigil. “All these lives matter,” she said. “I believe it should be one movement to make the change for everybody. ”",0

10278,Trump Embraces Pillars of Obama’s Foreign Policy - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, after promising a radical break with the foreign policy of Barack Obama, is embracing some key pillars of the former administration’s strategy, including warning Israel to curb settlement construction, demanding that Russia withdraw from Crimea and threatening Iran with sanctions for ballistic missile tests. In the most startling shift, the White House issued an unexpected statement appealing to the Israeli government not to expand the construction of Jewish settlements beyond their current borders in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Such expansion, it said, “may not be helpful in achieving” the goal of peace. At the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki R. Haley declared that the United States would not lift sanctions against Russia until it stopped destabilizing Ukraine and pulled troops out of Crimea. On Iran, the administration is preparing economic sanctions similar to those the Obama administration imposed just over a year ago. The White House has also shown no indication that it plans to rip up Mr. Obama’s landmark nuclear deal, despite Mr. Trump’s withering criticism of it during the presidential campaign. New administrations often fail to change the foreign policies of their predecessors as radically as they promised, in large part because statecraft is so different from campaigning. And of course, today’s positions could shift over time. There is no doubt the Trump administration has staked out new ground on trade and immigration, upending relations with Mexico and large parts of the Muslim world in the process. But the administration’s reversals were particularly stark because they came after days of tempestuous phone calls between Mr. Trump and foreign leaders, in which he gleefully challenged diplomatic orthodoxy and appeared to jeopardize one relationship after another. Mr. Trump made warmer relations with Russia the centerpiece of his foreign policy during the campaign, and European leaders had been steeling for him to lift sanctions they and Mr. Obama imposed on President Vladimir V. Putin after he annexed Crimea. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, Ms. Haley, sounded a lot like her predecessor, Samantha Power. “We do want to better our relations with Russia,” she said in her first remarks to an open session of the United Nations Security Council. “However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions. ” Similarly, Mr. Trump presented himself during the campaign as a stalwart supporter of Israel and criticized the Obama administration for allowing the passage of a Security Council resolution in December that condemned Israel for its expansion of settlements. “While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace,” his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said in a statement, “the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. ” The White House noted that the president “has not taken an official position on settlement activity. ” It said he would discuss the issue with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel when they meet Feb. 15, in effect telling Mr. Netanyahu to wait until then. Emboldened by Mr. Trump’s support, Israel has announced more than 5, 000 new homes in the West Bank since his inauguration. Mr. Trump shifted his policy after he met briefly with King Abdullah II of Jordan on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast  —   an encounter that put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president. Jordan, with its large Palestinian population, has been steadfastly critical of settlements. The administration’s abrupt turnaround also coincided with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s first day at the State Department and the arrival of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in South Korea on his first official trip. Both men are viewed as potentially capable of exerting a moderating influence on the president and his cadre of White House advisers, though it was unclear how much they had to do with the shifts. With Iran, Mr. Trump has indisputably taken a harder line than his predecessor. While the Obama administration often looked for ways to avoid confrontation with Iran in its last year, Mr. Trump seems equally eager to challenge what he has said is an Iranian expansion across the region, especially in Iraq and Yemen. In an early morning Twitter post on Thursday, Mr. Trump was bombastic on Iran. “Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile,” he wrote. “Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U. S. made with them!” In a second post, he said wrongly, “Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U. S. came along and gave it a   in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion. ” Still, the administration has been careful not to specify what the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, meant when he said on Wednesday that Iran had been put “on notice” for its missile test and for its arming and training of the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The new sanctions could be announced as soon as Friday. But most experts have said they will have little practical effect, because the companies that supply missile parts rarely have direct business with the United States, and allies have usually been reluctant to reimpose sanctions after many were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear accord. Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, replied, “This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran,” according to the semiofficial Fars news agency. “The American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless. ” Some analysts said they worried that the administration did not have tools, short of military action, to back up its warning. “Whether the Trump administration intended it or not, they have created their own red line,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “When Iran tests again, the administration will have no choice but to put up or shut up. ” Mr. Netanyahu will cheer Mr. Trump’s tough tone with Iran. But the statement on settlements may force him to change course on a delicate domestic issue. His coalition government seemed to take Mr. Trump’s inauguration as a starting gun in a race to increase construction in occupied territory. After Mr. Trump was sworn in, Israel announced that it would authorize another 2, 500 homes in areas already settled in the West Bank, and then followed that this week by announcing 3, 000 more. On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu took it a step further, vowing to build the first new settlement in the West Bank in many years. For Mr. Netanyahu, the settlement spree reflects a sense of liberation after years of constraints from Washington, especially under Mr. Obama, who, like other presidents, viewed settlement construction as an impediment to negotiating a final peace settlement. It is also an effort to deflect criticism from Israel’s political right for Mr. Netanyahu’s compliance with a court order to force several dozen families out of an illegal West Bank outpost, Amona. The “beyond their current borders” phrase in the White House statement hinted at a return to a policy President George W. Bush outlined to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, which acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect Israel to give up its major settlements in a final deal, although they would be offset by mutually   land swaps. Mr. Trump had also promised to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But the White House has slowed down the move, in part out of fear of a violent response. The policy shifts came after a turbulent week in which Mr. Trump also clashed with the leaders of Australia and Mexico over one of the most fraught issues of his new presidency: immigration. He defended the tense exchanges as an overdue display of toughness by a United States that has been exploited “by every nation in the world, virtually. ” “They’re tough we have to be tough. It’s time we’re going to be a little tough, folks,” he said at the prayer breakfast Thursday. “It’s not going to happen anymore. ” Yet later in the day, the White House felt obliged to put a more diplomatic gloss on events. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump’s call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia had been “very cordial,” even if Mr. Trump bitterly opposed an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration for the United States to accept the transfer of 1, 250 refugees from an Australian detention camp. A senior administration official disputed a report that Mr. Trump had threatened to send troops to Mexico to deal with its “bad hombres. ” The official said that the conversation with President Enrique Peña Nieto had been “actually very friendly,” and that Mr. Trump had been speaking in jest.",0
10279,"Delingpole: And So It Begins, Trump’s Great Climate Purge...","Finally the Trump administration is starting to get serious about taking on the Green Blob. [EPA administrator Scott Pruitt  —   perhaps stung by criticisms that he was turning into a squish  —   today reaffirmed, in an interview with CNBC, that he is not a believer in catastrophic   global warming.  “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet  …    ” This new boldness coincides with a purge of warmist scientific advisers at both the EPA and the Interior Department. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has chosen to replace half of the members on one of its key scientific review boards, while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is “reviewing the charter and charge” of more than 200 advisory boards, committees, and other entities both within and outside of his department. EPA and Interior officials began informing outside advisers of the move on Friday, and notifications continued over the weekend. Pruitt’s move could significantly change the makeup of the   Board of Scientific Counselors, which advises EPA’s key scientific arm on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity. All of the members being dismissed were at the end of serving at least one   term, although these terms are often renewed instead of terminated. Among the tragic victims is Robert Richardson, a Michigan professor and “ecological economist” who tweeted movingly about his martyrdom. Today, I was Trumped. I have had the pleasure of serving on the EPA Board of Scientific Counselors, and my appointment was terminated today.  —   Robert Richardson (@ecotrope) May 5, 2017,  A closer look at the man’s biog gives a few clues as to why his contract was not renewed: His research, teaching, and outreach program focuses primarily on sustainable development, and he uses a variety of methods from the behavioral and social sciences to study   about the use of natural resources and the values of ecosystem services. Oh dear. How sad. Never mind. But the biggest sign of Trump’s commitment to slaying the Green Blob is expected tomorrow when we’ll finally hear whether or not the president means to keep his election promise to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. If this happens it will be a disaster for the U. S. with the only beneficiary being White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. At least that’s what environmental journalist David Roberts claims in Vox. Given that Roberts is the guy who once called for   trials for climate skeptics perhaps his views should be taken with a pinch of salt. Nonetheless, he is quite right when he argues that whether the U. S. stays in or out of Paris it will make little difference on the policy front. [The agreement] asks participants only to state what they are willing to do and to account for what they’ve done. It is, in a word, voluntary. Roberts suspects, as I do, that the legalistic reasons being advanced for pulling out of Paris have probably been overdone. But whatever works is fine by me. The important thing is for the U. S. to pull out of Paris not in order to facilitate exit from Obama’s Clean Power Plan or to avert legal action from politicized litigators like the Sierra Club but purely as an upward extension of the presidential middle finger to the bloated, corrupt and overmighty Climate Industrial Complex. If and when Trump pulls the U. S. out of Paris it won’t be the end for the Green Blob, nor even the beginning of the end. But it might, perhaps, be the end of the beginning. It will be arguably the first big signal by any major leader of the Western world that the tide on the Great Global Warming Scam is about to turn and that the Alarmists are about to be crushed by fortune’s wheel.",0
10280,Study: Millennials Delaying Entry into Adulthood,"The traditional markers of adulthood, such as independence, marriage, children, and homeownership, show that the millennial generation is greatly lagging behind baby boomers, according to a new study comparing statistical data over the past 35 years. [Researcher Lydia Anderson of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University compared U. S. Census data from 1980 with the most recent American Community Survey data from 2015.  Comparing   to    in 1980 with the same age group today, Anderson found that far fewer millennials are married, live away from their parents, have children of their own, or own their own houses than the baby boomers of the same age group the year Ronald Reagan was elected president. In 1980, for example, more than   (68 percent) of   to    were already married, whereas in 2015, just two in five millennials (41 percent) in the same age group were married. Only 20 percent of baby boomers of these ages had never been married, while more than half (53 percent) of millennials have never married. In simple terms, in 1980 a majority of baby boomers were married, while in 2015, a majority of millennials have never married, the study found: Anderson considers early baby boomers to be those U. S. citizens born between 1945 and 1955, while early millennials refers to those born between 1980 and 1990. Other common indicators of adulthood followed suit, Anderson found, such as what the study termed “residential independence,” or living away from one’s parents or grandparents. In the intervening 35 years from 1980 to 2015, the share of young adults still living with parents or grandparents more than doubled, from nine percent in 1980 to 22 percent in 2015. While 59 percent of young adults in 2015 lived in independent households, the figure was 84 percent in 1980, or a full 25 percent more: Home ownership follows a similar pattern. A majority (60 percent) of young adults in 1980 owned their own homes, while in 2015, less than half of young adults (43 percent) were homeowners. A final indicator of adulthood, which Anderson describes as “living with a biological child,” revealed a similar difference, although in this case it was somewhat less striking. In 1980, more than   (68 percent) of young adults aged   lived with their biological children, while the figure was just over half (55 percent) for adults of the same age in 2015. Follow Thomas D.

10281,Black Female Trump Executive Publishes Personal Email Address As Olive Branch to Disenchanted HRC Supporters – TruthFeed,"Black Female Trump Executive Publishes Personal Email Address As Olive Branch to Disenchanted HRC Supporters Black Female Trump Executive Publishes Personal Email Address As Olive Branch to Disenchanted HRC Supporters Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 12, 2016 
There’s a false narrative floating around on the internet about Donald Trump being anti-gay and racist. 
This could not be further from the truth. 
Lynne Patton, a strong, bold black female executive at Trump Organization and Vice President of The Eric Trump Foundation became a power player in the election when she wrote an amazing open letter about her experience working for the Trump family. 
The letter, which was turned into a video, went viral. 
Please watch: 
After the election, Lynne wrote a compelling and powerful Facebook message to her dear friends and family who supported Hillary. 
Her heartfelt words speak to the TRUE character of Mr. Trump – not the lying, false narrative spread by our dishonest, North Korea-style, government-run propaganda media that existed solely to help Hillary Clinton get elected. 
I agree with Lynne . 
Donald Trump’s America First agenda is an all-inclusive movement for every American – all races, colors, genders, and sexual preference. 
Mr. Trump is a “big tent” type of man – the more the merrier! 
He’s the first candidate to appeal to such a wide variety of people from so many differing walks of life. 
Donald Trump is the first Republican to invite an openly gay man, Peter Theil, the co-founder of Paypal, to be a keynote speaker at the GOP convention. 
In addition, Mr. Theil is also an intricate part of President-elect Trump’s transition team. 
Of course, the media portrays Trump’s movement as racist, and bigoted – a basket of deplorable mean people – but that’s not true . 
We are a melting pot of differing views and cultures who have come together to take our country back from establishment globalists who, for decades, have destroyed the country. 
Mr. Trump understands that we are a country divided. 
The people protesting the election right now are hurt. 
It’s understandable – their candidate lost. 
However, what we hope, as we move forward, is that these folks will keep an open mind and an open heart to the positive ideas and exciting changes that Mr. Trump has in store for the country – stimulating the economy, bringing back jobs, providing everyone a safer and more secure country, and much more! 
I don’t work for the Trump family, but as someone who is deeply involved with the Trump “Online Army,” I can tell you that Donald Trump’s LGBT support is real and it’s powerful. 
— Scott Presler (@ScottPresler) June 13, 2016 
….and with good reason. 
Mr. Trump is a loving man who is looking out for the well-being of the gay community when he strongly condemned Hillary Clinton for taking money from, and supporting countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who routinely persecute, abuse, and execute gays. 
Mr. Trump challenged Hillary to return the money to these abusive countries as a symbol of support for the LGBT community. 
And what did Hillary do? 
She laughed. 
This is a man who vowed to halt Muslim refugees hailing from parts of the world that are terror hotbeds and foster anti-gay cultures. 
Mr. Trump is not perfect – no one is – but he truly wants to be everyone’s President . 
So, to the protesters and the folks who feel apprehensive – it’s ok and understandable to feel angry and sad, and express yourself lawfully- but when you’re done, please give America First a chance – I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how great it will be.

N. resolution critical of Israel. His choice of an outspoken critic of China, Peter Navarro, to oversee trade policy underscored his intent to reshape dealings between the world’s two largest economies. Mr. Trump’s transition team is asking employees at the State Department to provide details of   programs, fanning fears of a rollback.

10284,Steve Pieczenik: Wikileaks Revelations A Counter Coup To America’s Takeover (VIDEO),"in: Government , Multimedia , Special Interests November 8th’s election in the United States is perhaps the most important ever in the history of the country. It is not just an election to choose a President and some Senators and Representatives, it is perhaps the last true election that Americans will see. There is much more than just voting at stake. There are issues that are much more important than selecting judges for the Supreme Court. The election of 2016 may be the culmination of what previous American presidents warned: an internal takeover for the complete destruction of the country. Apparently, the attempt to, once a for all, strip Americans away from their Constitutional Rights has already been noticed by members of the intelligence community, who have launched a counter coup to stop the big American takeover led by Hillary and Bill Clinton. “Hillary and Bill Clinton are attempting a takeover of the United States and will stop at nothing,” warns former US government official, Steve Pieczenik. “A coup d’état of this magnitude has never been affected in such a subtly calculated way,” he explains in a video posted on his account on Youtube. In his video, Pieczenik explains that the Coup in which the Clintons are participating has been done silently and via the use of two methods: corruption and co-optation. “The Clintons have been involved in co-opting our White House, our Judiciary, our CIA, our Federal Bureau of Investigation, our Attorney General Loretta Lynch and our Director of the FBI, James Comey,” Pieczenik says. He says that the people and organizations cited above were made part of a group that was directed through political cronyism. Pieczenik says that him and other former members of the intelligence community have now launched a counter coup operation with the collaboration of Julian Assange and Wikileaks. The former government official announced that the revelation of new emails contained in a laptop computer that belonged to Anthony Weiner was the first step, the first warning, that the counter coup had started. Speaking directly to those who he believes are carrying out the Coup d’Etat against the American people, Pieczenik said: “We are going to stop you from making Hillary the president of the United States.” He also announced that his group would indict the president of the United States, Loretta Lynch and others who, according to Pieczenik, are involved in the cover-up of the massive corruption going on at the Clinton Foundation.

10285,"At Penn Station, Rail Mishap Spurs Large and Lasting Headache - The New York Times","It was a relatively minor mishap  —   several cars on a   New Jersey Transit train jumped the tracks on Monday morning at Pennsylvania Station in New York. But by the next day, it had cascaded into a transportation crisis, snarling travel up and down the East Coast, upending the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and vividly illustrating the fragile state of infrastructure in the nation’s busiest transit corridor. The derailment happened at a notorious choke point inside North America’s busiest train station  —   a crowded and gloomy labyrinth that was never meant to handle a daily flow of 600, 000 passengers and 1, 300 trains. When something goes wrong on the tracks, it can cripple the three railroads that rely on the station. And this time the disruptions are likely to linger as officials warned on Tuesday that it could take several days to make repairs and restore full service after the derailment knocked out eight of the station’s 21 tracks. It was the second accident at Penn Station in the same area in less than two weeks. Aside from triggering commuting chaos, the incidents have prompted concerns about the safety of the aging tracks. The widespread upheaval also provided a harrowing glimpse into a future that all agree would be marred by constant delays unless more tracks are added at the station and a new tunnel is built under the Hudson River. “They’re operating at absolutely maximum capacity to serve the   ridership that wants to get into New York City,” said Martin E. Robins, a former deputy executive director at New Jersey Transit. “And you have an old infrastructure that was originally built more than 100 years ago. ” On Tuesday, there were major delays on New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road  —   two of the busiest commuter railroads in the country, which along with Amtrak share space at Penn Station. Amtrak had to run fewer trains between New York and Washington, one of the country’s major rail corridors. Riders fumed as they squeezed onto crowded trains and buses stalled in clogged traffic leading to New York. Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey became an extraordinary scene of gridlock as passengers leaving New Jersey Transit trains struggled to make their way to PATH trains, buses and ferries bound for Manhattan. There were so many people that the police barricaded stairs leading to PATH trains to control the crowds. Jenna Iandiorio’s commute took nearly three hours after her New Jersey Transit train was diverted to Hoboken. She described the scene: “Just a lot of very frustrated faces of people who deal with this far too often. ” “There is never a week where it’s smooth sailing to work,” Ms. Iandiorio added. “There are always issues. ” The disruptions unfolded just as local officials are expressing worries that plans for a new Hudson River tunnel could be upended because President Trump has proposed slashing federal financing for new transit projects. Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York have pledged to fight any cuts that could jeopardize the tunnel plan, known as the Gateway project. In 2010, Mr. Christie, a Republican who once led Mr. Trump’s transition team and had been in the running to be his pick for vice president, canceled a plan to build a new tunnel and a train station just east of Penn Station. It is not lost on many commuters that the new tunnel had been scheduled to open next year. The new station would have provided relief when problems arose at Penn Station, said Mr. Robins, who worked on that project. “It’s a continuing disappointment,” he said. “Every month, it comes back to haunt us in one way or another that the project was not built. ” Officials want to build a new tunnel as part of the $23 billion Gateway project and to eventually build new tracks to expand Penn Station. Before that happens, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has promised to renovate the cramped Penn Station and to create a new train hall across the street on Eighth Avenue. John D. Porcari, the interim executive director of the Gateway Program Development Corporation, a nonprofit overseeing the new tunnel, told reporters on Tuesday that the project would improve reliability at Penn Station and reduce the kinds of inconveniences commuters are enduring this week. “This is a project of national significance, not just local significance,” he said, “and it simply cannot move forward without a federal commitment. ” Mr. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that will be unveiled later this year  —   an initiative he promoted on Tuesday during meetings with business leaders and the construction industry. It is unclear whether the Gateway project might be included or whether the president plans to prioritize investments in public transit. The derailment on Monday happened about 9 a. m. as a New Jersey Transit train pulled into Track 9 at Penn Station. A derailment on March 24 took place when an Amtrak train left Track 6. Scot Naparstek, Amtrak’s chief operating officer, said three cars in the middle of a New Jersey Transit train derailed on Monday, and workers had to place them back on the rails on Tuesday morning so they could remove the train. The accident damaged switch equipment on the tracks, leaving eight tracks unavailable for regular service. Mr. Naparstek said he could not give a time frame for when the tracks would be reopened. “We apologize for any inconvenience we caused anyone,” he said. Amtrak owns Penn Station. Officials at New Jersey Transit said the delays, cancellations and crowds were likely to continue through Thursday’s commute. The Federal Railroad Administration is investigating both accidents and has not identified the causes, said Marc Willis, a spokesman for the agency. Federal officials were talking to Amtrak and New Jersey Transit about how to ensure safety and reduce the likelihood of future disruptions, he said. “F. R. A. is concerned that two derailments in the last two weeks at New York’s Penn Station have caused minor passenger injuries and severe service disruptions on the Northeast Corridor,” Mr. Willis said in a statement. In June, federal officials began a safety investigation of New Jersey Transit. Then in September, a train crashed into Hoboken Terminal, killing a woman and injuring more than 100 people. The station is still being repaired, adding to the problems on Tuesday by making it more difficult for commuters to get through the building. A report by The New York Times last year found that the railroad was in crisis as it grappled with rising delays, a leadership vacuum and a lack of investment under Mr. Christie’s administration. State lawmakers are still investigating the continuing problems at New Jersey Transit. Matthew Kraft, 30, a financial analyst who works in Manhattan, said he went to Hoboken Terminal on Tuesday morning to avoid Penn Station and found it overrun with commuters. “I had never seen that before, where the crowd is literally pouring out of the station,” he said. Mr. Kraft said Tuesday’s   commute was probably one of roughly a dozen times in the last year where he has had a delay of more than an hour. “Every single time it happens, the wound doesn’t heal,” he said. “It’s just a building of frustration, like, ‘Please someone, anyone, please do something to make this work. ’” On Tuesday, Lara K. Mahal, a chemistry professor at New York University, said that her morning commute from South Orange, N. J. took two hours and that she was almost late for class. She was delayed again heading home in the afternoon. “Is every train in and out of this city broken today?” Ms. Mahal said as she rode a diverted PATH train in Manhattan in an effort to reach Hoboken. Most of all, Ms. Mahal said she had concerns about safety, noting the recent accidents at Hoboken Terminal and Penn Station. “That doesn’t exactly give you a safe feeling getting on the train,” she said.",0
10286,"Falluja Restaurant Is Reborn in Baghdad, Offering Nostalgia With Its Kebab - The New York Times","BAGHDAD  —   Long before Falluja was known the world over for deadly jihadists, it was known all over Iraq for its kebab  —   fatty lamb, ground and mixed with onion, grilled on a skewer over an open fire and served with a pinch of sumac  —   at a joint called Haji Hussein. Everyone, it seemed, ate at Haji Hussein: locals, soldiers, tourists and businessmen traveling the    highway that runs through the city. Starting in 2003, journalists covering the war ate there, and so did American soldiers and the insurgents who fought them, perhaps even at the same time. The restaurant was damaged by bombs multiple times, and entirely flattened once by an American airstrike. It was rebuilt, embraced as a symbol of Falluja’s own rebirth after years of war, only to be abandoned when the city fell to the Islamic State more than two years ago. Now the   kebab restaurant has been reborn again, this time in Baghdad, in a modern,   building in the upscale Mansour neighborhood. A new entrant on the capital’s thriving restaurant scene, it offers great kebab and a dose of nostalgia for a time when Baghdadis thought nothing of zipping off to Falluja for lunch at Haji Hussein. “This was the craft of my grandfather,” said Mohammed Hussein, who runs the business that has been in his family since the 1930s, when Falluja was a city of agriculture, smuggling and tribal traditions, not a jihadist haven. The restaurant, shiny and well lit, is packed most nights, and patrons wait for tables  —   15 to 20 minutes or so, something almost   in Iraq. There are two   televisions on the first floor, tuned to news channels reporting on the military campaign to retake Falluja from the Islamic State. “I can’t bear to watch the news,” Mr. Hussein said. There was one news flash recently that did not escape his notice: The Iraqi Air Force, like the Americans 12 years ago, announced that it had struck his restaurant site in Falluja because leaders with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, were meeting there. A statement from Iraq’s Joint Operation Command appeared on the television: “Based on intelligence information about a meeting for ISIS leaders in Haji Hussein restaurant inside the center of Falluja an airstrike was launched on the restaurant, which led to the killing of tens of ISIS terrorists. ” But the restaurant, Mr. Hussein said, has been deserted for two and a half years. When Iraqi forces recently made gains inside Falluja, people almost immediately began talking about Haji Hussein. The federal police released a combat video saying they were fighting near the restaurant, and a glimpse of the   facade showed it damaged but not destroyed. On state television, commentators expressed hope that Haji Hussein might reopen soon in Falluja. In 2004, the Americans bombed the restaurant based on intelligence that insurgents loyal to Abu Musab   the founder of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner of the Islamic State, were eating there. After the bombing, a member of Mr. Hussein’s family defiantly told The Boston Globe that “the mujahedeen and the insurgents prefer my restaurant and come to me for their three meals. ” Patrick Graham, a Canadian journalist who covered the Iraq war, likened Haji Hussein to a Nova Scotia branch of a popular Canadian doughnut chain. “It probably had been an insurgent meeting place,” he wrote in an online column last year, “but only in the way that the local Tim Horton’s in Antigonish, N. S. is a Conservative Party meeting place. Everyone went to Haji Hussein, insurgents included. ” This being the holy month of Ramadan, the Baghdad restaurant has been busy lately serving iftar, the evening meal to break the day’s fast. The parking lot is also a beehive of activity: a security guard checking cars for bombs a man selling balloons to families children begging. As Mr. Hussein, 49, sat down to chat one recent evening, he was surrounded by   waiters  —   much of the staff from Falluja now works in the new place  —   filling the tables with dishes of mezze, or appetizers, as diners waited to break their fast. In addition to heaping platters of the famous kebab, there were dates coated with sesame paste, watermelon, hummus, cucumber and tomato salad, pickles and soup. There were some new items on the menu that were not served in Falluja: grilled river carp, called masgoof a Yemeni    meal called mandi and maklouba, a dish of chicken and eggplant and rice that is originally Palestinian. As customers streamed in, Mr. Hussein tried to recall how many times his restaurant in Falluja had been damaged or destroyed by the war. “Too many to count,” he said. At times, he said, he would have to call a local windowpane salesman once or twice a week. “It was a funny joke,” he said. “I’d call and he’d say, ‘Which size?’ He would have all the sizes for my windows on hand, ready. ” Mr. Hussein recalled an American officer who used to stop by, and grab his kebab right off the grill with a piece of flatbread. But he kept his distance from the occupiers. “We tried not to become friends with them,” he said. “They would say hi, we would say hi, that was it. ” He said peace would not be easy in Falluja, even after liberation from the Islamic State, without political compromises between the   government in Baghdad and the Sunni community. Speaking of the people of Falluja, he said, “There were reasons they joined ISIS  —   oppression, random arrests. ” At least in his restaurant, Iraq does not seem hopelessly divided by sect. Sunnis and Shiites break their fast at slightly different times, and as sundown approached one of the televisions was tuned to a Sunni channel, the other to Iraqiya, the channel of the   government. When the call to prayer  —   the signal that the day’s fast was over  —   went out on one, the Sunnis began eating. Fifteen minutes or so later, the Shiite customers began eating. Anas   who is perhaps Baghdad’s only restaurant critic, has praised Haji Hussein on his widely followed Baghdad Restaurant Guide on Facebook, for its kebab, cleanliness and service. One Iraqi exile, pining for home, posted a comment on Mr. Sarraf’s site: “I have been out of Iraq for 13 years, and there is no Iraqi food or Iraqi kebab like Haji Hussein. Inshallah, I will come back one day to eat at Haji Hussein in Falluja and in Baghdad. ” In the kitchen, Mr. Hussein’s nephew, Marwan Mohammed, was working the grill. Now 26, he has been working in the family business since he was 8, washing the skewers. Mr. Mohammed said the secret to his kebab is fresh lamb, as opposed to   imported meats that he said many Iraqi restaurants use. The family still raises its own sheep in a   area near Falluja, and usually serves the kebab on the same day the sheep is slaughtered, or the next day. “We only feed them grass and special food,” he said. “We never let them go out in the open and eat garbage. ” The only other ingredient mixed with the minced lamb is onions. Sumac and a squeeze of lemon at the table add more flavor. Mr. Hussein’s fortune may now be in Baghdad, but his heart is in Falluja. His hometown, he said, “is like a sacred place for me. ” He added, “My heart beats faster when Falluja comes to my mind. ” He began to cry as he described what Falluja used to be. “Simple people,” he said. “It was a tribal society. We’ve never even had a hotel. There was hospitality for everyone. All homes were hotels for visitors. ” Recipes:   Kebabs | Adana Kebabs | Lamb and Fig Kebabs with Honey and Rosemary",0
10287,Penn Station Inhabitant Finally Has a Home of Her Own - The New York Times,"They called themselves the Penn Station Nation, a ragtag group of roughly 50 homeless people who congregated around New York City’s bustling transportation hub. For 10 years, Tamara Hutchinson was a member, but the bonds were that of family  —   several dozen kindred spirits who watched one another’s backs. “I was homeless and happy,” Ms. Hutchinson, 46, said. She always had a boyfriend, many in fact traveling in pairs kept everyone safer, she said. They always slept in groups in areas where they could rest undisturbed. When she could not find the group at night, she would check into a shelter. “Sometimes you forget you’re homeless until you want to go home,” she said. Every night in New York City, roughly 60, 000 people sleep in a shelter, up from about 59, 000 in August, a striking contrast in a city of gleaming towers and tremendous individual wealth. Thousands of homeless do not make it to a shelter in the winter and end up sleeping in subway stations and on the streets, bundled in blankets and in layers of clothing. During the day, Ms. Hutchinson ate and showered at churches. She begged for money or food outside Madison Square Garden after shows and games, always hoping to find a generous person. She also found assistance through the charitable organization Midnight Run, a volunteer program that distributes food, clothing, blankets and personal care items to the city’s homeless, helping Ms. Hutchinson preserve her dignity. “Most of the time, you couldn’t tell we were homeless,” she said. Throughout her years on the streets, Ms. Hutchinson continued to take her medicine, a rarity among the homeless, for schizophrenia and mood disorder. Without it, she said, her mind was filled with voices. “They wouldn’t let me sleep,” Ms. Hutchinson recalled. “I was tossing and turning. It was horrible. ” Soon after her diagnosis in 1996, Ms. Hutchinson placed her daughter Breyanna, who was 2 at the time, in the care of the girl’s father. She also halted a promising songwriting career in rap. Under the stage name Essence, Ms. Hutchinson had performed at a number of clubs. In 1991, one of her songs, “Lyrics 2 the Rhythm,” was produced by the renowned   artist Grandmaster Flash for the film “New Jack City. ” While she was pregnant with her second daughter in 2003, she went off her medication. After her daughter was born, the girl was placed in the care of Ms. Hutchinson’s aunt and uncle and remains in their custody. At 33, Ms. Hutchinson wound up on the streets, where she found unexpected camaraderie amid tremendous struggles. But years later, her life changed. In 2013, Ms. Hutchinson went to    University Medical Center because of a persistent cough that    remedies had not alleviated. Tests revealed that she had pneumocystis pneumonia and that she was H. I. V. positive. Many people in the Penn Station Nation were sexually active, and she said some of them had also learned they had H. I. V. “Ever since then, I’ve been off the streets,” she said. “They told me that I could never be homeless again. ” Ms. Hutchinson spent the next two weeks at the hospital, where she met a caseworker from the AIDS Service Center for New York City. She was connected to the H. I. V.  Services Administration, which assists individuals living with the disease, and secured transitional housing. “When I got the key after getting discharged, I just stood there looking out the window for like 20 minutes,” Ms. Hutchinson said. “Then I took off everything, got in the bed, and I slept for two days. ” This year, she found permanent housing through a social services organization in the Bronx. Her $971 monthly rent is largely covered by the Services for the UnderServed Inc. a social services organization in the city. Ms. Hutchinson’s only monthly income comes from the government: $733 from Social Security and $16 in food stamps. The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used $1, 000 in Neediest funds to buy Ms. Hutchinson furniture for her apartment, including a dining set, a sofa and a dresser. Ms. Hutchinson remains in contact with her daughters. The older one lives and attends college in Texas her    True, resides on Long Island. As much as she misses True, Ms. Hutchinson said she knew it was better for her to be living with her aunt and uncle. Ms. Hutchinson takes online classes in creative writing and business management. Friends in the music industry have encouraged her to write again. But progress on all fronts has been slow. “I’m going to take my time because I want longevity,” Ms. Hutchinson said. “You have all your life to get finished. ” What happened between now and her once promising music career  —   10 haunting years of destitution and desperation  —   is difficult to overcome, she said. She tries to stay positive by focusing on the fact that she has finally achieved what she had longed for. “While I was with them, I missed the music, I missed working, I missed going to parties, clubs,” she said. “Now that I’m home, back in the house, I have to feel better so that I can get back to work. ” She wants to build on the momentum and has created a   plan: Save some money, lose weight and receive her degrees and certifications so she can make music again. “I got no excuses,” Ms. Hutchinson said. “I could sit here and act broke, homeless and sick if I wanted to. Nobody would know. But I really can get up and back to work. ”",0
10288,Graham Hancock Explains Why So Many People Are Pro-Trump And Anti-Establishment,"Hancock speaks a truth that most politicians don't want to hear. Credit: Audio Burst 
Graham Hancock, a British writer and journalist, has offered some amazing insight into the current election in the U.S. As some are baffled by the number of people Trump has garnered support from, others are more surprised at those willing to vote for someone as allegedly crooked as Hillary. 
Most citizens are completely over this election and can’t believe that their choices are a racist and misogynistic man who has no knowledge of political policies and a woman who is in bed with foreign regimes and domestic bankers and arms dealers, to name a few. But that is what it has come down to. 
Those in favor of Trump are increasing, and it’s not because they’re suddenly realizing that they hate people from Mexico or men with awful spray tans. As Hancock stated, 
“What’s driving [Trump supporters] in America is a deep distrust of authority and a deep distrust of anything that’s connected to the status quo. I’m not sure if politicians really got the message yet, there’s absolute revulsion at them.” 
What Hancock is essentially saying is that a vote for Trump is a vote against the politicians that have been manipulating the system for decades now. It’s an interesting view, and not something that many have considered as they hear the awful words that come of some Trump supporter’s mouths. This movement against the establishment was primarily led by Bernie Sanders, but since he is out of the race, the torch has been somewhat handed to Trump. Hancock went on to say: 
“It’s a vote against the system that has failed Americans again and again and again…. It’s a global system of control. I think people are aware of that, I think they’re fed up, and I think they want change. Trump is getting support because he’s certainly not part of that. He looks different, he sounds different, he feels different. Bernie Sanders got a lot of support for the same reason. They were saying different things, but both of them were anti-establishment figures. That’s what’s going on here, the establishment itself is losing its grip. We are seeing a kind of crazy chaos resulting from that. We will sort it out; human beings are capable of sorting things out. We don’t need leaders to sort things out, we can sort things out themselves.” 
Despite this chaos, Hancock views this disillusionment and serious shift as a positive thing and a sign of progress. Now that people are more aware of what is occurring within politics, hopefully the conditions can only improve with each election.

10289,It’s Not Easy Being Santa - The New York Times,"At Macy’s, the department store of “Miracle on 34th Street” fame, Santa, whoever he is, remains surrounded by corporate gatekeepers. The identity of the Santa who graces ABC Carpet  Home? His identity is off the record, too. “It isn’t a job,” Amy Chender, that store’s chief operating officer, wrote in an email. “He is Santa. ” We get it: Magic must be preserved. If you don’t want a Santa spoiler, stop reading here. Every now and then, a brave Santa offers a peek behind the red velvet curtain. John Gebbie, a    grandfather of three, agreed to share the tricks of his trade on one of his busiest weekends, the one before Christmas. 9 a. m.: It all starts with the beard.  A key ingredient to becoming Santa? You must nail the facial hair. “You know what the kids use to spike their hair?” Mr. Gebbie asks, gesturing to the loops in his mustache. “Got2b Glued. That’s what I used. ” Mr. Gebbie joined the Santa trade two years ago after crossing paths in a Costco store with another man who looked a lot like St. Nick. That man was Timothy Connaghan, a member of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas and the creator of School4Santas. com. Interested in extra income after retiring from a career as a customs broker, Mr. Gebbie enrolled in Santa school, where the coursework included lessons on how to talk with children (yes, this Santa has undergone a background check) winning over Santa skeptics and building his business. 9:30 a. m.: The commute begins. Mr. Gebbie lives in Port Jefferson, on Long Island, which is about 70 miles from today’s gig, a fitness complex called MatchPoint in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Mr. Gebbie begins his trip by clearing snow off his sleigh, a blue 1996 Subaru Impreza. “I tell the kids the dents are from the reindeer,” he said. 11:24 a. m.: The transformation. Some events offer valet service and changing rooms, but MatchPoint is a   affair. Mr. Gebbie lugs a garment bag and a rolling suitcase to the gym’s entrance. Still a relatively new Santa, Mr. Gebbie has personally booked about 15 events during this year’s   season, ranging from a stint at Cipriani 42nd Street to home visits. He can earn $200 to $1, 000 per appearance. (This event will pay him toward “the high end” of what he makes.) MatchPoint has been transformed into a festive wonderland. Mr. Gebbie finds a space to change behind a curtain. “I want to lose a little more weight next year,” he said of his red velvet suit. “I might get a 2XL instead of a 3XL. ” On his belt is a magic key to every house  —   this is crucial for warding off questions from children who don’t have chimney access. 12:13 p. m.: Taking the stage. Mr. Gebbie emerges from behind the curtain to take his place on Santa’s throne, where he plugs in a portable fan (Santas can easily overheat). Children wander near him, murmuring Ded Moroz  —   Santa Claus in Russian. This is an    event, stuffed with more than a dozen performers. Parents have paid up to $60 to spend the day here with their children. Troy Curtis, a performer who was once part of the boy band Menudo, is singing a Bruno Mars hit. The event is flashy, but the day’s success hinges on Santa, according to Dennis Jaigobin, who produced the event. The work is surprisingly physical: To beckon   children, Mr. Gebbie hams it up on stage by clapping, waving and cupping his hands around his mouth. One of Mr. Gebbie’s visitors, Gabriel Haskel, 5, is a professional. “This is the fourth Santa this year,” his father, Oleg Haskel, said. “Some of them he believes and others he’s like, ‘Nah, that’s a costume. ’” Onstage, the boy confers with Santa for a moment, and afterward, Mr. Gebbie cups his hands: “A piano!” he mouths to the boy’s parents. Gabriel says this Santa is the real deal. 1:24 p. m.: Santa takes a break. There are a few cardinal rules for being Santa, and one is that a break is mandated every hour. As gymnasts dance to Russian music, Mr. Gebbie disappears behind a blue tarp. An ice princess materializes with a plate of boiled hot dogs and a few pieces of fried food. “You never refuse it because you never know,” he says, accepting sustenance. 6:30 p. m.: The car ride home. After his shift is over, Mr. Gebbie faces a long drive back to Port Jefferson. Spending six hours working a bilingual event has reminded him of his goal for the next year. “I want to learn foreign languages,” he said. “I just want the kids to come in and feel comfortable. ” Another goal: less travel. Tomorrow, he’ll drive the 70 miles back to Sheepshead Bay and become Santa all over again. It’s not easy being Santa.",0
10290,College Student Who Accused Football Players with Rape Now Charged with Lying,"A student at Connecticut’s Sacred Heart University is now on the other side of accusations of wrongdoing after police charged her with filing a false report of rape against two college football players. [In 2016, student Nikki Yovino, 18, told police in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that she was raped in the bathroom of a house where a party was raging. Afterward, Yovino accused two members of the school’s football team of repeatedly raping her that night, the Connecticut Post reported.  In short order, both football players were removed from the team, lost their scholarships, and were kicked out of school over the accusations. Now police are saying the players are innocent because Yovino recanted her rape accusation after police discovered inconsistencies in her testimony. Police also found at least one witness who said he heard Yovino talking about how she wanted to have sex with the football players. For their part, the two players admitted having sex with Yovino but always maintained it was consensual. A police affidavit noted that Yovino admitted to lying about the rape. “She admitted that she made up the allegation of sexual assault against (the football players) because it was the first thing that came to mind and she didn’t want to lose (another male student) as a friend and potential boyfriend. She stated that she believed when (the other male student) heard the allegation it would make him angry and sympathetic to her,” the affidavit said. Yovino could face up to five years in prison if convicted of   false reporting of an incident and tampering with or fabricating physical evidence.

10291,Gary Johnson and Jill Stein Fail to Make Cut for First Debate - The New York Times,"The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump this month will exclude two leading   nominees  —   Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and the Green Party’s Jill Stein  —   the Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Friday. The failure to be invited to the Sept. 26 debate at Hofstra University deals a significant blow to Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein, who are desperate for national exposure to promote their   bids for the White House. Their running mates will also not be allowed to participate in the   debate on Oct. 4, the commission said. Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein were excluded because they did not reach an average of 15 percent support in the five national polls that the commission used as a benchmark. Mr. Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico who is polling in   in many state polls, reached 8. 4 percent and Ms. Stein reached 3. 2 percent. Candidates from smaller parties have complained to the commission, arguing that the threshold is too high for candidates who lack vast resources or name recognition. Mr. Johnson, who has acknowledged that he has little chance of becoming president if he is not allowed to debate, has started a petition that collected more than 800, 000 signatures urging the commission to include him. In a statement Friday, Mr. Johnson said: “I would say I am surprised that the C. P. D. has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but I’m not. After all, the commission is a private organization created 30 years ago by the Republican and Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally televised presidential debates voters will see. ” Some polls have found that a majority of the American public would like to see more options on the debate stage, and prominent Republicans such as Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, have said publicly that the Libertarian ticket should be part of the mix. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary contest, said in a recent interview that he thought the 15 percent criteria was too onerous. The chance of Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein debating this fall have not been completely eliminated, however. The commission will run the numbers on its polls two more times and could potentially invite them to the second or third debates if their support swells.",0
10292,6 Reasons To Create Fat Control Laws And Obesity-Free Zones,"Lately, gun-free zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes (usually circular) and sizes .
Those measures, solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves, has shown its vast ineffiency, with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre.
Here is why I propose, once a conservative government reaches the White House, to create Fat Control Laws (“F.C.L”) and Obesity-Free Zones (“O.F.Z”) as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of Americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns. Here are six potential benefits:
1. Simple philanthropy 
Obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit. Nowadays, they get fed a distorted reality saying that “big and round is beautiful” when the natural reaction, deeply branded in our DNA, is disgust, mockery and suspicion.
Fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns . The war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs. Bovine people not only harm themselves but others too. By creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight, we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being.
In their case, sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates. We must show our potbellied (or barrelbellied) junkies the way as they can’t take the steps themselves.
Just like with restrictions on cigarettes, if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories, we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery.
2. Preserving aesthetics and other senses 
No more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go. Imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine, attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis.
Our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces. Say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store.
No more 280-lb SJW land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train. It could be tomorrow.
3. Positive impact on children 
I do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal. Worse, if the PC politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale. Let’s send them far until they get better. Out of sight, out of mind as they say.
Legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children, whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating.
Of course, with Fat Control Policies, kids will get bullied at school. Some will cut themselves for being called fattie. So what? Adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry. The weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself.
4. A healthier population You are under arrest for being an immovable, gargantuan arsehole
Fat is not a silent killer. Hundreds of thousands of people die (with a loud thud) every year of obesity-related diseases, a largely preventable cause of death worldwide. Today, 1 in 5 Americans and 1 in 11 Britons dies from being a fat arse with no self-control.
It is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest, diabetes, coronary and liver diseases, cancer, and hypertension among others. Promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy.
Physically healthier people are mentally healthier too (boost of self-esteem and confidence). Fat Control Laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression, inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity. That is also less money spent by the taxpayer
5. A boost for the economy 
According to a 2009 report, ham planets cost the economy $117 billion a year . And that is for the American economy alone! The number of human cattle is still growing exponentially. It inflicted more than a $325.8 billion loss to the economy in 2010.
In 2016, we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average American even harder.
A fitter population, with its nutritional choices, would result in a more natural, higher-quality food industry. Smaller amounts of food produced and needed, resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production.
We could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals.
Healthier, more active people are happier, more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat. An age of stronger, self-governed, high-energy men bringing a healthier society. It’s YUGE!
6. A new sexual and romantic market 
It will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat. A radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage, trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects.
Let’s impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive, thin and pretty women. Greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition, which decreases the bitch shields of thin, entitled girls.
Endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past. As I said it before, “male thirst is the root of all evil” when it comes to romantic competition.
Sexier citizens means more relationships, a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual, helping nations suffering from low birth rate.
One more element for the protection of Western society (being the most affected one) and its people, cementing the bases of a strong future, fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation.
By logical natural process, bronies, corpulent man-children and manga conventions should also disappear soon.
The Fat Control Laws 1. Segregated Obesity-Free Zones 
Our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats.
This is why we should create large (VERY large) fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects, as fat is more dangerous than guns.
Let’s pen the big-boned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden. Fresh water, open spaces, salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see.
BUILD THAT FENCE!
We shall call it the “David Fatrelle Center for Porcine Rehabilitation”
2. Permits 
A permit would have to be issued (similar to a gun-carrying permit) for the purchase of junk food, high-carb snacks, soda drinks etc. After a doctor’s physical exam of the patient, slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval, granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served.
3. Mandatory workouts 
Compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard BMI. We could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached.
A Steps Counter Activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis.
Just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis, the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored.
4. Fat shaming 
Fat shaming works great, as we have seen before . Remember the shitstorm of the “beach body” campaign , immediately declared thought criminals by the Body Positive Lobby or Islamic Thought Tribunal of Londonistan?
Or the cold-blooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose London Tube passengers? YUGE success.
Pourquoi ça n’existe pas? 
Fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden, they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause.
Fitter people means a self-aware, powerful mass that strives for greatness.
But the liberals in charge don’t want that. This is why they produce massive amounts of harmful, processed food and encourage the pleb, by manipulating publicity and promoting make-believe, to remain fat, weak and above all, docile.
It’s all part of a plan. Fat Control Laws are the answer to that great evil.

10293,Limbaugh: The First Amendment Doesn’t Give the Press ‘Immunity from Criticism’ - Breitbart,"Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh said the reaction of the media to President Donald  Trump‘s tweet labeling them an “enemy of the American people” was because some journalists believe the First Amendment gives them “immunity from criticism. ”  The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017,  Partial transcript as follows: I want to thank F. Chuck Todd of NBC for opening my eyes to this. For the longest time I’ve been genuinely curious why it is that media people think that they cannot be criticized. And they really do. They really think they can go out and research people and they can dig up dirt from anybody they want, their pasts, and they can broadcast it all over. And if somebody’s life, somebody’s marriage, somebody’s relationship, somebody’s kid gets destroyed or ruined, fine and dandy. They can do all of that they want, but you turn it around and you start investigating your favorite journalist to find out how many illegitimate kids he or she might have had in college or how many DUIs they had, you know, or how many communist sympathizer meetings they went to, then all hell breaks loose and they start squealing like stuck pigs, “You can’t do that! We’re journalists!” I said, “Where does this come from?” It’s more than just hubris. I finally found out. You know what it is, Mr. Snerdley? These clowns actually believe that since they are recognized in the First Amendment that they have constitutional immunity. Criticizing them is attacking the First Amendment. They really believe this. Criticizing them is akin to attacking the Constitution, and that’s   and that’s why you hear these journalists say. “It’s   to criticize. It’s   for Trump to be destabilizing. It’s   for Trump to be going out there and trying to do damage to the media. We’ve got First Amendment protection. ” Well, so does the president, and the president happens to be mentioned in the Constitution before the media. The president’s mentioned in Article 2. The media doesn’t make it ’til the First Amendment. But yet the media thinks there’s nothing bad about running around and trying to attack political figures and destroying them. This is what it is, folks. They are so far gone, they really think that they are the last line of defense between freedom and democracy and tyranny. And attacking them and challenging their reputation is no more and no less than attacking the Constitution and trying to destroy America and democracy. That’s what they think. That explains why you can’t go after them. Anyhow, let’s take another brief break here. BREAK TRANSCRIPT, Look, the only thing the First Amendment does for the press is the same thing it gives everybody else. They can say what they want to say.  That’s essentially what the First Amendment says for the press like it says it for you and me. It singles them out and references them in terms of their importance, a free and unintimidated, whatever, unattached media.  And nobody objects to that, but it does not grant them immunity from criticism.  It does not grant them freedom to be disagreed with. It does not grant them freedom from opposition. They seem to think that it does.  And I think it all falls under the notion of how really poorly constitutional education, American history education’s been for decades in this country. Not to mention the kind of poison that’s injected into the young skulls full of mush populating journalism schools all over the United States.  But really, folks, it’s the one thing that, as far as the media’s concerned, justifies what they’re doing. Now, as I say, you won’t even get them to admit what they’re doing.  You won’t even get them to admit they’re trying to destroy Trump.  They come up with some, “No, no, no, no.  It is the job of the media to hold powerful people accountable. ”  Yeah.  Right.  Why doesn’t that apply to powerful Democrats?  And don’t tell me that it does, because everybody knows you give ’em a pass. Each and every time something comes up with ’em, you cover for ’em.  It’s a joke. (  Mediaite) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
10294,Sweden on the brink? Police force pushed to breaking point by violence amid migrant influx,"By wmw_admin on November 3, 2016 Lizzie Stromme– Daily Express Nov 2, 2016 Police in multicultural Sweden. Click to enlarge 
The Scandinavian country is facing an existential crisis with on average three police officers handing in their resignations a day. 
If the alarming trend continues, and police officers continue to resign more than 1,000 officers will have quit the service by New Years. 
Since the migrant crisis began last summer, Sweden has been hit by a series of brutal crimes and violent incidents . 
In 2015 alone Sweden, with a population of 9.5million, received over 160,000 asylum applications and the country is expected to take as many as 190,000 refugees, or two per cent of the population, by the end of 2016. 
Since the Second World War Sweden has prided itself on helping migrants who cross their borders despite some moves to the political right in recent years. 
But police have now admitted the force has reached breaching point as more than 50 areas in the country have now been placed on a “no-go zone” list . 
In February a report from Sweden’s National Criminal Investigation Service announced there were 52 areas where officers would not cope with the levels of crime being committed . 
Sex assaults , drug dealing and children carrying weapons were just some of the incidents mentioned in the report. 
In September, Swedish officials were forced to add another three areas to the list. 
Now the Police Association have said they need at least 200 new officers to regain control in the south-east of the country. 
Thomas Stjernfeldt, from the region’s police association, told SVT : “We are missing extremely many officers in the operational sector, right now we need 200 more officers to be added to the force to establish a reasonable working environment in the southeast of Götaland.” Cars burn in Rinkeby, an area in Stockholm with a high population of migrants, after 5 nights of rioting in 2013. Click to enlarge 
Götaland is one of the regions in the country that has been hit hard by the car fire attacks, which have been occurring throughout Sweden. 
On Monday, Express.co.uk reported a number of the arsonist attacks in the city of Växjö, in Götaland, had been committed by frustrated migrants . 
Currently there are more than 6,000 suspected crimes that are unsolved in the area and 400 of these cases are suspected to be rapes, murder or attempted murder. 
Mr Stjernfeldt said the figures are alarming and police officers are constantly forced to work overtime in an attempt to solve the reported crimes. 
The Police Association admitted it fears the public will lose faith in the force and their ability to protect citizens if the situation is not resolved. 
The union’s call for more resources echoes National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson’s February warning, where he said he needed a further 4,100 officers and specialist staff to reestablish law and order in Sweden.",0

10297,Newborn Baby Kidnapped from Alabama Hospital After Parents Decline Birth Certificate and SSN,"Newborn Baby Kidnapped from Alabama Hospital After Parents Decline Birth Certificate and SSN Christian and Danielle Holm – on a mountaintop in 2015. Photo source: Christian Holm’s Facebook page . 
by Health Impact News/MedicalKidnap.com Staff 
Theirs was a spiritual journey of getting back to nature and rejecting the materialism that they felt held them in bondage. Christian and Danielle Holm began their journey together in early 2016 as itinerant missionaries, traveling across the country and speaking to churches as they sought to live simply and biblically. 
The last thing that they expected was for Child Protective Services to seize their 1 day old baby literally off of his mother’s breast in an Alabama hospital. What started out as an apparent case of mistaken identity has turned into a nightmare that the family cannot wake up from. They don’t understand why their baby was taken from them, or why he still remains in state custody in foster care while social workers continue to challenge their religious beliefs. 
According to a close family friend who contacted Health Impact News , the couple are grieving. 
The most sacred thing to Danielle and Christian is the bond of male and female coming together and giving life with God. This bonding process in the beginning of a baby’s life has been stolen from them. 
There was never any reason for their baby to be taken from them to begin with, and even now, they have adequate housing and anything else that could ever be needed and they still don’t have their baby back. Story Reported in Local Media 
The Anniston Star first reported their story on October 13, 2016, just days after the couple’s baby was born on Monday, October 10. Excerpt: 
Just out of Regional Medical Center, Danielle has a belly still swollen from a pregnancy that ended Monday with the birth of a healthy baby boy. 
Her arms, however, are empty. Her son was taken from her the day after he was born and is in the custody of the Cleburne County Department of Human Resources pending a hearing at Cleburne County Courthouse this morning. 
“We told them that we were going to do whatever we could,” she said as tears ran down her face. “I’m his mother. I’m supposed to be nourishing and bonding with him right now and I can’t.” Judge Issues Gag Order, Family Friend Contacts Health Impact News 
Shortly after the story was reported, District Judge Melody Walker of the Cleburne County Circuit Court issued a gag order on the couple, forbidding them to speak about their case. 
Since that time, Health Impact News was contacted by a close family friend who talked to us about the couple and their story. The source, who asked not to be named, made it clear that the information that she gave us was from conversations which occurred before the gag order was placed on Danielle and Christian Holm. 
She communicated that the Holms want to cooperate with DHR to do everything that they can to get their baby back. They are heartbroken, and they are scared. The source is concerned that the couple may have unwittingly stumbled into a great deal of corruption, and their baby could be an innocent victim of some sort of trafficking ring. Couple Chooses to Leave Materialism Behind, Pursue Spirituality 
Though their simple lifestyle of hiking and backpacking through state parks may suggest otherwise, the Holms come from a background of means and education. 32 year old Danielle holds a triple bachelor’s degree in psychology, sociology, and biology. She has worked as a nurse, chiropractic assistant, child and adolescent mental health counselor, personal trainer, and was a group leader for Special Needs children at a youth center. Her husband Christian, 35, comes from a very well-off, politically connected family. He spent several years caring for his ailing grandparents before their deaths. 
They met and fell in love after finding common ground online. They decided to make a life together in August of 2015 and moved to New Hampshire together. Both increasingly felt that possessions and materialism were holding them in bondage. After they married in February, they made the conscious decision to give away their possessions to charity and live simply, traveling as itinerant missionaries and getting closer to nature. 
Excerpt from The Anniston Star : 
The process of surrendering is difficult, though. It took them until May to start travelling, and even then they were driving, he said. They only recently left their car in a storage unit in Montgomery and started walking. 
They found the journey amazing; people they met along the way would give them money, food and water to keep going, they said. On the way they stopped at probably 30 churches to talk with people and minister to them, Christian said. 
They travelled about five miles a day and ended up camping at Cheaha State Park a few days ago, Christian said. Pulpit Rock at Cheaha State Park. Photo Source: Alabama State Parks They Wanted as Close to Natural Birth as Possible 
The expectant couple reportedly sought prenatal care and preparation along the way from midwives, doulas, ob-gyns, and lactation consultants. They researched and read and asked questions. 
They considered seeking a midwife in Alabama, since they expected to be in the state when the baby was born, but they found information that told them that midwifery is illegal in Alabama. However, the only reference in the Alabama code to non-nurse-midwifery is in the section governing nurse-midwives, Al Code 34-19-3 (b): 
(b) Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed as to prevent lay midwives holding valid health department permits from engaging in the practice of lay midwifery as heretofore provided until such time as the permit may be revoked by the county board of health. 
There is no definition of lay or other non-nurse midwives, such as traditional midwives, in the Alabama statutes. Because of conflicting information in the media and online, the Holms did not know that having a traditional midwife was an option open to them. Instead, they prepared for an unassisted, husband-coached, natural lotus birth, planning to birth as closely to nature as possible. 
When Danielle went into labor, they had been camping for several days at Cheaha State Park in Cleburne County, Alabama. After 2 days of labor, they reportedly became concerned about some bleeding and decided to call an ambulance, which took them to Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center (RMC). Danielle gave birth to a baby boy the next morning, and he was “perfectly healthy” according to a family friend. Simple Lifestyle Conflicts with Standard Protocols 
The couple wished to adhere to their religious beliefs and remain as natural as possible, declining any unnecessary hospital interventions. They agreed to allow eye ointment in their baby’s eyes, but declined the other typical interventions, including the hospital security band on the baby’s leg. They reasoned that, since there was never a need for the baby to be out of his parents’ sight while he was at the hospital, there was no need for the hospital security band. Danielle chose to breastfeed her baby. 
The couple were able to bask briefly in the beauty of their new son, but their joy was short-lived. Danielle with her new baby at the hospital. Photo source: Christian Holm’s Facebook page . 
The source close to the family reports that Danielle and Christian sensed that the hospital staff got a bit nervous when the parents declined a birth certificate and social security number for their baby. 
There were 2 reasons for their declining the documents. Christian and Danielle felt that the naming of their baby is a spiritual experience. They wanted to wait to decide on a name for their baby until they first had time to bond with and get to know their baby to see what name would be the most appropriate. They also believed that the decision as to whether or not to have a social security number was one that should be left up to the child to make when he is older. 
Because they sensed that the hospital staff was uncomfortable with their philosophy, which is rooted in their spiritual beliefs, the family friend states that Christian pro-actively decided to approach the hospital social worker “on his own terms,” to ensure that there were no issues and that they would be in compliance with applicable laws. 
Instead of answering, the social worker reportedly left to seek more information. A short time later, she returned to their room with an intern from DHR, the Department of Human Resources, Alabama’s Child Protective Services. The DHR representative reportedly questioned the couple about their religious beliefs. The Holms reportedly stated that they wanted to “live as close to nature as possible, just like their native American ancestors.” 
When Christian asked, “What is the most simple way we can live without being harassed?” the DHR worker reportedly told him she had never been asked that before, and that she would consult her supervisor. Baby Snatched from Mother’s Nursing Breast Danielle and Christian loved the simple life. This photo was taken atop Mt. Percival. Photo source: Christian Holm’s Facebook page . 
The family friend explained that Christian has a house in his name, but it is currently tied up in a family trust. Despite their journey of walking through nature, camping wherever they found themselves, the couple has been in process of trying to move into the house, but there have been complications, causing those plans to fall through. The friend reported that Christian had hoped to discuss this with the social worker, but he did not get the opportunity, because the hospital social worker and the DHR intern returned to the hospital room with 4 police officers, a detective from the sheriff’s department, and a hospital security guard. 
After Christian was escorted to another room, Danielle was shocked when the sheriff’s detective allegedly reached down and pulled the baby literally off of his mother’s breast where he was latched on. 
As she cried out, asking, “Why?” and telling them she has done nothing wrong, the detective told her that they had reason to believe that they were not who they said they were. He reportedly told her that the baby was now in state custody. Case of Mistaken Identity Has Devastating Consequences 
The detective reportedly began a barrage of questions aimed at the confused new mother, demanding “her real name.” Danielle thought that the confusion could be from her previous married name. Her ex-husband was Holmes, and her current husband is Holm, so she simply deleted 2 letters from her last name. That was apparently not the source of the confusion. 
The detective asked Danielle if she was really Daniella Ruiz, and asked her about her involvement in human and drug trafficking in Arizona. She asked if she had ever been arrested in Arizona, and when she had crossed the border into Mexico. 
None of this reportedly made any sense to Danielle, who had spent a short amount of time in Arizona as she and Christian were on their journey, but she had never been to Mexico, never been arrested, and had never been in any trouble at all. The name Daniella Ruiz meant nothing to her. 
They asked if Christian had ever gone by another name, which he had. His middle name is Clarke, and that is the name he went by growing up. 
Both Danielle and Christian readily showed the detective their IDs. In addition to her New Hampshire drivers license, she showed her social security card and her passport, which did not show any trips to Mexico. Christian reportedly showed his New Hampshire drivers license, social security card, and a federal ID. 
It was not enough. DHR took their baby into custody, and they were only able to see their baby once more before they left the hospital, and that visit was under the watchful eyes of a nurse and a police officer. 
Christian Holm later posted an article on his Facebook page that he found about the criminals that the Cleburne County officials apparently thought they were. Though the comment has since been deleted, Christian had this to say: 
So this is who the investigating officer said that my wife and I are after giving her three forms of identification from both of us showing that we are not these people. She was not satisfied with that and told me that these can be faked. They really need an oops button in these situations when an infant and or innocence is involved to give child back. Swallow the pride and stop destroying lives for your view on life. We are children of God being attacked by the ones influenced by the devil. They know not what they do. 
The criminals arrested in Arizona were Daniella Ruiz of Tuscon, Arizona, and Richard Christian Holm of Nogales, Arizona. There are several news stories which appear to originate from the same source which simply describe 2 separate incidents in the same article, such as this article that Christian Clarke Holm found: 
Though both people arrested have similar names to the couple traveling in Alabama, the Arizona duo do not appear to be connected even to each other. They were arrested on 2 different days in 2 separate incidents. Is Violation of the 4th Amendment Standard Practice in Alabama? 
According to the Holms’ friend, there was no court order or warrant to seize the baby, nor was there an emergency situation. This is consistent with what other Alabama parents have reported to Health Impact News . Earlier this year, Shelby County DHR social worker Ahzshaka Evans told a 14 year old rape victim: 
There are two people who don’t need a court order or a warrant: the Department of Human Resources and law enforcement. (See story .) 
Shelby County police officer Edmunson told the Prince family in June that DHR didn’t need a court order or warrant to take a child. All they needed was a pickup order from DHR. 
Haly Boothe’s 3 day old baby was taken in May from a Birmingham hospital without a court order or warrant. (See story .) 
Several parents have reported being told that the state legislature has given authority to DHR to seize children with only a “DHR pickup order,” which may apparently be merely verbal, not necessarily written. Parents are told that the court hearing within 72 hours meets the standard of search and seizure laws. 
However, this practice stand in direct conflict with the 4th Amendment of the Constitution: 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. New Mother Denied Basic Care After Baby Seized 
In another disturbing similarity between the Holms’ story and others of mothers whose newborn babies are taken from them at the hospital, basic medical care was reportedly withheld from Danielle after her baby was seized by DHR. She was given no discharge instructions. There was no counsel or handout given about what signs of infection to watch for or how to care for her stitches, even though she was a first-time mother. 
Ordinarily, all patients checking out of hospitals are escorted out in a wheelchair. Not so with many mothers whose babies are taken from them by the state. Despite their pain and grief, they are singled out to walk out of the hospital on their own strength. Orders Given to Put Baby on Formula Against the Wish of Parents 
The family member reports that Danielle is still pumping her milk for her baby, even though the Anniston Star reports that the Holms have no idea whether or not their baby is receiving the breastmilk, and that there were orders given at the hospital for the baby to be given formula. 
This is especially hard for mothers to deal with who know the myriad of benefits of breastfeeding and the multitude of health risks that formula-feeding carries. Feeding their baby his mother’s own milk in the natural way that God designed was a very important value to Danielle and Christian Holm, according to their friend, and knowing that their baby is being fed formula from the hands of a stranger is yet another tragic aspect of their baby’s kidnapping. 
The couple are also reportedly very concerned about the emotional and psychological well-being of their baby, because they understand that separation of mother and baby, especially in the early weeks and months, can have a devastating psychological impact on the growing baby. Danielle celebrated freedom on Mt. Washington. Where is that freedom now? Photo source: Christian Holm’s Facebook page . Gag Order Issued 
The Anniston Star reported that the Holms were issued a gag order after the publication brought the story to public attention. In their article dated October 18, some important considerations are raised. Gag order ensures privacy, but at a cost, experts say 
Excerpts: 
Courts can use gag orders to protect the interests of children or victims, but some attorneys say the instrument does so at the cost of other constitutional rights. Gag orders are not a black-and-white issue, though, and they can be challenged, said Andy Olree, professor of law at Faulkner Law in Montgomery. Gag orders can be an infringement on constitutional rights, Olree said.The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects citizens’ right to express themselves and the public’s right to hear discussions of issues of value to them, but that right is not absolute, Olree said. 
See also: Family Court Judges’ Unconstitutional Gag Orders On Parents 
DHR has questioned the intelligence of ordinary citizens with regard to understanding the meaning of confidentiality. According to the Anniston Star : 
All juvenile dependency cases, those in which a child’s custody is decided, are confidential cases by state law, Cleburne County Judge Melody Walker said Monday. Tony Hamlin, attorney for the Department of Human Resources, said a judge could issue a gag order because lay people don’t always understand what confidential means. Alabama Attorney – Confidentiality Laws Not Designed to Silence Parents Birmingham-area attorney Lisa Chasteen disagrees. She told Health Impact News that the Alabama law regarding confidentiality of juvenile cases is often misused by the system to tell parents that they cannot talk about their own cases, but that is not the way the law is written. Alabama Code § 12-15-133(g) states: Except for the purposes permitted and in the manner provided by this section, whoever discloses or makes use of or knowingly permits the use of information identifying a child, or the family of a child, who is or was under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, where this information is directly or indirectly derived from the records of the juvenile court or acquired in the course of official duties , [emphasis added] upon conviction thereof, shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and also may be subject to civil sanctions. Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise limit counsel from disclosing confidential information obtained from the juvenile court file of the child as needed to investigate the case of the client or prepare a defense for that client, provided that the disclosure is in furtherance of counsel’s representation of the party. 
Chasteen asserts that the confidentiality laws were designed to protect the family from the people working on their case disclosing information to the public. They do not apply to the families themselves talking about their case with friends, family, or the media. 
Attorneys, GALs, social workers, or any other agent working for the state could “acquire” information about the case “in the course of official duties,” and are thus bound by confidentiality laws, but the family members are not. 
She cites KR v. LAUDERDALE COUNTY DEPT. OF HUMAN, 133 So. 3d 396 – Ala: Court of Civil Appeals 2013 , which clarifies that the information that law 12-15-133 refers to is that which is “derived from the records of the juvenile court.” The findings of the Appeals Court further state that “§ 12-15-133 is intended to protect the identity of juveniles, not DHR employees, guardians ad litem, or juvenile-court judges….” 
Though this law is often cited to parents simply as the “confidentiality law” and is often used in the attempt to bully and silence parents from discussing their case with the media, attorney Lisa Chasteen maintains that this was not the intent of the law at all. The family has the right to discuss their story with whomever they wish. She made these points in a meeting last year with other attorneys and DHR state commissioner Nancy Buckner, and reports that no one refuted her that day. 
Law Professor Jenny Carroll notes issues of concern with gag orders, reports the Anniston Star : 
An additional problem with a gag order in the Holmses’ case is that the public has no information about what steps the state is taking to protect the child and if the parents’ rights are being protected through the proceedings, said University of Alabama School of Law Professor Jenny Carroll. It is, she noted, the parental rights that are in question in the case. 
“The public has a right to check if actions being taken in our names are in fact correct,” Carroll said. 
The courts are public forums, she said. If they are insulated to the point that the public is excluded it makes it very difficult to know that everyone involved is being treated fairly. That’s not how our courts are supposed to work, she said. Land of the Free? 
Because of the gag orders and threats about confidentiality, Danielle and Christian Holms are reportedly afraid to speak out about the injustices that their friend says are happening to them. The lifestyle they are leading appears to be similar to that of John the Baptist or some of the Old Testament prophets. Many of the patriarchs of the Judeo-Christian faiths, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, lived relatively nomadic lifestyles. While Jesus told his disciples to “Follow Me,” He also said: 
Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. (Luke 9:58, NIV) 
The Holms’ friend doesn’t understand how America, “the land of the free,” can take someone’s newborn baby away from them for choosing to follow their religious beliefs and living a life that is not like the mainstream. Yet, Danielle and Christian Holm are stuck in a state they were simply passing through, engaged in the fight of their lives for their baby. How You Can Help the Holms

10299,SHOCK: NSA Can Recover ALL of Hillary’s Deleted Emails,"REPORT: Hillary’s Friends Told To Lie About Her Email Scandal 
How powerful is the NSA? 
This secretive agency employs thousands of people and has literally weaponized our national information technology infrastructure. Most of the most powerful espionage tools are created by the National Security Agency’s elite group of hackers. 
If there is anyone on the planet who best understands the NSA’s clandestine capabilities, it’s Kim Dotcom. The international encryption expert and open-source advocate wanted people to know that there was a clear path to recovering Clinton’s emails that she has claimed were deleted because of their “personal” nature.   
You can see the list here: I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump . 100% true. Retweet. pic.twitter.com/eir8r0FJ8M 
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 26, 2016 
Clinton began using the now-famous private server at her home in 2009. Using XKeyscore, the surveillance program revealed by Edward Snowden, NSA analysts could drill deeper into data as far back as 2012, when Clinton served as secretary of state, the Business Times reported. 
Congress spent millions of dollars investigating Hillary Clinton’s missing emails and illegal use of a private server, and the liberal media , rather than reporting on the results of those investigations, has instead tried to use the conflict between Democrats and Republicans as a sideshow to distract from the issues that really matter to Americans.

10300,Doctors Consider a Last Best Hope for Obese Teenagers: Surgery - The New York Times,"If all goes well, Aliayha   will have an operation next month that will change her life. She will shed many of the 240 pounds that now burden her    frame. Like many who have bariatric surgery, she has tried diets and exercise to no avail. Surgery is her last best hope. But there is a difference between Aliayha and almost everyone else who has had this operation: She is only 15. While the number of adolescents who are overweight or obese has leveled off in recent years, the number who are severely obese  —   heavy enough to qualify for bariatric surgery  —   has nearly doubled from 1999 to 2014, according to national data, going from 5. 2 to 10. 2 percent of all adolescents aged 12 to 19. As a result, more and more doctors and parents are facing a difficult question: Should very heavy teenagers have bariatric surgery, a radical operation that is the only treatment proved to produce lasting weight loss in severely obese people? The very idea fills many parents and doctors with trepidation, and with good reason, said Aaron Kelly, a physiologist and specialist in pediatric obesity at the University of Minnesota. “We’re at a point in this field where surgery is the only thing that works for these kids but we don’t know the long term outcomes. ” The best data are from two recently published small studies that so far have outcomes for just five years. Scientists say there’s an urgent need for more ambitious research. The question for teens and their parents is: Which is worse  —   accepting uncertainty about the long term health risks from surgery or the likelihood of serious health risks from remaining obese? An estimated three to four million adolescents are heavy enough to meet the criteria for bariatric surgery, Dr. Kelly said. But only about 1, 000 teenagers a year have the operation. Many medical centers will not perform it on teenagers and many pediatricians never mention it to their heavy patients. “It obviously is a controversial area,” said Dr. Marc P. Michalsky, the surgical director at the Center for Healthy Weight  Nutrition at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.. Obesity carries serious health risks in teenagers  —   including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, acid reflux, fatty liver and high cholesterol levels  —   that tend to be eased by surgery. Added to that are social problems, including isolation and depression. Yet insurers routinely turn down teenagers on the first request, doctors say, leaving surgeons to appeal, sometimes multiple times, before they can operate on an adolescent. Dr. Kirk W. Reichard, the clinical director of pediatric surgery at the Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children where Aliayha is planning to undergo her operation, said Delaware’s Medicaid program had denied coverage for all patients under the age of 18 with one exception. When it comes to adult bariatric surgery, doctors say, insurers usually do not put up a fight. But doctors and patients often discount the option. “We still struggle with acceptance in the adult population,” said Dr. John M. Morton, the chief of bariatric and minimally invasive surgery at Stanford. “Acceptance in the pediatric community is even worse. ” The two recently published studies on outcomes were encouraging, obesity experts say. One, involving 58 adolescents, was led by investigators at Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati. The other, led by researchers at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, involved 81 adolescents. Most of the participants in both studies lost at least a third of their weight and kept it off for at least five years. Diabetes often went into remission. Blood pressure readings that were high often fell to normal levels. Despite their weight loss, 63 percent of the teenagers were still severely obese after the surgery  —   only one reached a normal weight  —   and nearly half had nutritional abnormalities, including iron deficiency anemia and low levels of vitamin D and vitamin B12. Nearly half had hyperparathyroidism, a serious condition that leads to the leaching of calcium from bone. Many more could have reached a normal weight, said Dr. Thomas Inge, the director of adolescent metabolic and bariatric surgery at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, who led the Cincinnati study, if they had had the operation when they were younger, before they got so obese. The participants’ average age was 17 and their average body mass index was 58. 5. (That corresponds to person 5 feet 4 inches tall who weighs 341 pounds.) Some researchers worry that five years may not be long enough to understand the effect of the surgery on people who undergo it as an adolescent. The operations alter brain signals that control weight and appetite and change hundreds of nerve and hormonal signals to the brain. What, researchers ask, are the consequences for   brains and bones and bodies? Could low levels of vitamin D cause osteoporosis? The procedure for teenagers is the same as for adults  —   either a sleeve gastrectomy, in which much of the stomach is cut away to form a small pouch, or a gastric bypass in which the stomach is made smaller and part of the small intestine is rerouted. The operations are just as safe in teenagers as in adults, surgeons say: Mortality rates are around 0. 1 percent, which makes them safer than gallbladder surgery or joint replacement. Both operations require patients to follow detailed medical instructions, including taking supplements for the rest of their lives after surgery. Adolescents, though, are not always the most compliant patients. Dr. Inge said that when he first started offering the surgery in 2004, several of his patients developed beriberi, a serious condition that can affect the heart and nervous system. It is caused by a lack of thiamine. The beriberi problem was solved, Dr. Inge said, after he began warning patients and insisting they take a thiamine tablet for six months after surgery. “We never saw it again,” he said. To qualify for bariatric surgery, teenage patients generally must have a body mass index of at least 40, with other medical problems like sleep apnea or diabetes, or a B. M. I. of at least 50 without related medical conditions. Bariatric surgery is the only effective weight loss option for most of these teenagers. Diets, exercise and behavioral therapy almost never solve their weight problem, said Dr. Stephen R. Daniels, pediatrician in chief at Children’s Hospital Colorado. Moreover, an obese adolescent is almost certain to become an obese adult. The grim prognosis, “debunks the wishful thinking that they will outgrow it,” Dr. Michalsky said. Of course the best option would be to prevent kids from becoming obese in the first place, but that is not so easy. There seems to be a strong genetic component that is not easily overridden. Most of the teenagers who have the surgery have a parent who also is extremely obese, said Margaret H. Zeller, a professor of pediatrics and psychologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital whose research focuses on adolescents with severe obesity. Dr. Morton has operated on patients from three generations in some families. But despite their qualms about possible medical problems with bones or other body systems in the future, many researchers and surgeons say those concerns are dwarfed by the consequences of being an obese teenager. “I am less concerned about osteoporosis than that their lives will be completely destroyed if they don’t get some serious weight off,” said Dr. Lee M. Kaplan, the director of the weight center at Massachusetts General Hospital. By completely destroyed, he adds, he means “medically, socially and economically. ” “I’ve had many patients tell me they’d rather be dead,” than remain fat, Dr. Morton said. In almost every aspect, life for very obese teenagers is “significantly impaired,” Dr. Zeller said. These difficulties, Dr. Zeller noted, are piled onto the normal angst of adolescence. “It’s not just that people make them feel uncomfortable,” she said. The physical effort of carrying the weight around can make simple tasks arduous, like walking from one area of a high school to another or sitting at desks too small for them. Many have sleep apnea, making it difficult to stay awake in class. And, she said, “inside, they are feeling ashamed. ” Although not every obese teenager feels isolated and friendless, many, including Aliayha, do. She asked to be   but her mother, Cristina Carrasco, refused. Aliayha was not alone in wanting to leave school. Overwhelmed by their struggles, as many as 10 percent of obese students in grades eight to 12 leave the classroom and are   or take online classes instead, Dr. Zeller and her colleagues have found. That is nearly three times the rate of home schooling in the general population in those grades, according to the Department of Education. But some teenagers expect too much from the surgery. They are told they will lose a significant amount of weight, feel better and be healthier but that they are unlikely to reach a normal weight. They are told the surgery will not solve all their problems. Some, though, hold out unrealistic expectations. “They see shows about bariatric surgery or YouTube. They have this idea about the before and afters,” Dr. Zeller said. But, she added, “the average person having bariatric surgery isn’t doing a YouTube video. ” Dr. Morton worries about what he calls social  . “When they lose the weight, they are not always prepared,” he said Tiffany Hunter can attest to that. She had the surgery when she was 15 and weighed 350 pounds. Now, 27 and    she weighs 190. “Being overweight, you think being skinny will solve all your problems,” she said. “It doesn’t. It makes new problems that you don’t know how to deal with. ” She added, “You think everyone will immediately like you because of how you look on the outside. ” At 15, Tiffany was not only one of the first but also one of the youngest in the country to have the surgery at the time. But some bariatric surgeons wonder if adolescents and surgeons are waiting too long. Dr. Daniels went from being shocked to hear at a meeting in 2003 that doctors were considering bariatric surgery for adolescents to wondering if a bar of a B. M. I. of 40 or 50 is too high. There was no real science behind those guidelines, he noted. He also worries about children who get fatter and fatter throughout childhood, reaching a level of obesity by adolescence that, even with surgery, will still leave them obese as they head into adulthood. Dr. Michalsky shares those concerns. “We can only expect so much out of these operations,” Dr. Michalsky said. The longer the teenagers wait for the surgery and the fatter they get, the less likely they are to reach a normal weight. But how young is too young? Should it be done on children? Dr. Morton said the only place he knows where surgeons have done bariatric surgery on children is Saudi Arabia. He and others think it is best to wait until puberty to avoid interfering with physical, mental and emotional development. But, once again, doctors are acting on hunches, they say. “We get asked very often what is the lower age limit, but we really don’t know,” Dr. Michalsky said.",0
10301,220 ‘Significant’ Pipeline Spills Already This Year Exposes Troubling Safety Record,"By Dan Zukowski
Three major U.S. pipeline spills within the last month are just a small part of the 220 significant incidents reported so far this year—and 3,032 since 2006—that provide a stark reminder of the environmental hazards of an aging pipeline infrastructure carrying fossil fuels. The costs of these leaks since 2006 has amounted to $4.7 billion.
1. Oklahoma: On Oct. 24, the 30-inch S-1 pipeline carrying crude oil from the critical Cushing, Oklahoma hub to refineries and chemical plants on the Gulf Coast began to leak and was shut down overnight. It was the second release connected with the Cushing storage facility in less than a month.
2. Pennsylvania: On Oct. 21, 55,000 gallons of gasoline gushed from a ruptured Sunoco Logistics pipeline in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, just upstream from the Susquehanna River. Carol Parenzan, Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper , said that witnesses who contacted her office reported that the “smell of petroleum is so thick you can taste it.” The 80-year old pipeline was damaged by a heavy storm that dumped seven inches of rain on the area.
3. Alabama: Last month, the Colonial Pipeline in Alabama leaked an estimated 336,000 gallons of gasoline and triggered concerns about gas shortages for drivers in the East. That spill was Colonial’s fifth in the state this year and occurred on a 43-year old section of the pipeline.
Based on data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of significant pipeline incidents grew 26.8 percent from 2006 to 2015. A significant incident is defined as one that results in serious injury or fatality, costs more than $50,000, releases more than five barrels of volatile fluids such as gasoline or 50 barrels of other liquids, or results in a fire or explosion. In 2015, there were 326 such incidents—almost one per day.
Some 55 percent of the U.S. network of 135,000 miles of pipeline is more than 45 years old. Technology designed to detect pipeline leaks is highly unreliable, even though companies like Colonial Pipeline tout their use as a way “to insure safe operations.” But a recent Reuters report found that these technologies are “about as successful as a random member of the public” finding a leak. Of 466 incidents studied by Reuters, only 22 percent, or 105, were detected by advanced detection systems. The others were found in different ways, with the public finding 99 of the leaks.
In testimony before a House subcommittee earlier this year, Carl Weimer, executive director of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust , said, “Under the current statutes there is no requirement that a pipeline company obtain any permit or permission to operate a pipeline in this country.” Weimer called on Congress to require PHMSA to issue permits for interstate transmission pipelines and ensure that the company follow all rules and regulations.
“It is important that we not only maintain our aging energy infrastructure, but that we also remain vigilant about new pipelines and energy interests that threaten water quality,” said Parenzan.

10304,Jackie Mason Torches Critics of Israel Embassy Move (Exclusive),"In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason. [In his latest exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie takes aim at critics who say Israel’s embassy cannot possibly be moved to Jerusalem from its current location in Tel Aviv.  “It’s as if somebody would get mad that you moved the capital [of the United States] to Washington,” Jackie says. “Imagine if another country decided that the American capital doesn’t deserve to be in Washington because they don’t like it, because they said we’re occupying their territory by being there. People that you’ve never heard of, that were never there before. ” Jackie says that as far as Arab countries in the Middle East are concerned, Israel doesn’t have a right to exist anywhere. “If they had their way, every Israeli and every Jew would be wiped out immediately, so how would they have a capital any place if they don’t even have a right to be here?” Jackie asks. Still, the comedian holds no ill will toward these Arab countries, even though they’d prefer he’d drop dead.

10305,"Populists Appear to Fall Short in Dutch Election, Amid High Turnout - The New York Times","Right now: European populism faced its first big electoral test since last year’s “Brexit” referendum and Donald J. Trump’s election. Turnout was the highest in decades. • The main exit poll indicated that the largest party in Parliament will remain the   party of Mark Rutte, the prime minister, with 31 of 150 seats. He has moved rightward in recent months, making tougher pronouncements on immigration but steering clear of the xenophobic and borderline racist statements of other parties. • The   populist party of Geert Wilders gained seats, but did not perform as strongly as expected. Exit polls suggested that it was tied for second place with the conservative party Christian Democratic Appeal and the     party Democrats 66  —   each with 19 seats. Also making a relatively strong showing were the   Greens, with 16 seats. The leftist, euroskeptic Socialist Party is projected to have 14 seats. • The big loser appeared to be the mainstream Labor party, which had governed with the mainstream conservatives led by Mr. Rutte. The exit poll put it in seventh place, with nine seats. • Turnout was 82 percent, the highest in decades. • All 150 seats in the lower (and more powerful) house of Parliament are up for grabs. It takes a simple majority, 76 seats, to govern. Coalitions are the norm. The landscape is highly fragmented, with 11 parties represented in the current Parliament and 13 parties expected to be in the next one. • Fears of hacking and outside interference are rife, so all vote tallying will be done by hand. “Democracy is definitely alive,” said Mark Bovens, a political scientist at Utrecht University, noting the high turnout. “The nationalist parties have won seats, compared to 2012  —   Wilders’s party has gained seats, as has a new party, the Forum for Democracy  —   but their electorate is stable it has not grown. And some of the traditional parties have moved in a more nationalistic direction, taking a bit of wind out of his sails. You see the same strategy in Germany. ” Mr. Bovens noted that an earlier populist movement led by the   politician Pim Fortuyn won 26 seats in 2002 and that Mr. Wilders’s won 24 seats in 2010. So even if Mr. Wilders’s party rises to 19 seats, from 15 in the current Parliament, as the exit poll projects, it will be still lower than the previous   marks. (Mr. Wilders is an ideological descendent of Mr. Fortuyn, who was assassinated right before the 2002 election.)  —   SEWELL CHAN In a victory speech broadcast live on television, Mr. Rutte said, “The Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said no to the wrong kind of populism. ” Mr. Wilders, in a tweet, noted that his party had gained seats but did not quite declare a triumph. “Rutte has not seen the last of me yet!” he wrote on Twitter. His nemesis,   Juncker, the president of the European Commission, called the result in the Netherlands a “vote for Europe, a vote against extremists. ” At the Christian Democratic Appeal’s party, which was held in a tram museum, the crowd cheered the party’s projected   finish (in a   tie). “Honestly, I’m just happy that the P. V. V. is not as big as we feared,” said   van Duyn, a    alderman from the city of Almere, referring to Mr. Wilders’s party, the Party for Freedom. Guests in the refurbished   depot credited the party’s apparent success to its charismatic leader, Sybrand Buma, and the fact that the party was not part of government during the last four years, when painful cuts were introduced by the coalition of Mr. Rutte’s party and the Labor Party. Mr. Buma had himself tacked rightward in recent days, but his supporters did not seem concerned. “It was a way of reaching out to people who felt like they weren’t being heard,” said Mark van de Fliert, a    student of foreign policy who volunteered as a youth organizer. “I don’t see him as a populist. Quite the opposite: I see him as really stable. ”  —   SEWELL CHAN and CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE It is hard to imagine a place where it is easier to vote than in the Netherlands. If you’re a commuter going to work in one of the larger Dutch cities, chances are there will be a voting tent set up in the train station where you board and where you get off. If you were taking high tea at the Hotel Des Indes in The Hague, there was a voting booth one flight up from the   lobby. Shopping at a grocery store or going to a bar? Some have tables with makeshift voting booths. Playing football or working out? You can vote at sports complexes. You can also vote in community centers, mosques and churches, libraries, homes for the aged and concert halls. Voters don’t have to live where they vote, so those vacationing on islands in the North Sea can walk into local polling places and cast their ballots. In the village of Schiermonnikoog on the island of the same name, 105 percent of the population had already voted as of 5 p. m. The extras were visitors to the island. In this country with 12. 9 million eligible voters, there are 9, 000 polling places, so the lines are relatively short and all voters need to show is their registration card anywhere in the municipality where they live. (Those voting outside their municipality need a special pass.) Most polling sites are open from 7:30 a. m. to 9 p. m. but one  —   a flower kiosk in the train station at Castricum, in the north  —   got a head start. It opened just after the stroke of midnight, and by 1 a. m. 97 people had cast ballots there.  —   ALISSA J. RUBIN and CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE  As of 9 p. m. 82 percent of the electorate had voted, up from 75 percent in the 2012 parliamentary elections. Some polling stations were running out of ballot papers, according to the national broadcaster NOS. “It’s already a record,” Jan den Boer, 60, the administrator of a community center in The Hague that adjoins the city’s largest supermarket, Albert Heijn, said in the afternoon. As he munched on a meat sandwich known as a broodje bal, he said: “We’ve already had 900 people vote, maybe more people are coming in all day. Usually it’s just the morning and evening after work. ” “They always say it’s important to vote, and this year there’s more of a difference between parties. ” At a voting station the southern town of Sittard, a veteran election monitor who was distributing ballots said: “I have never seen anything quite like this. Today people started early and they’re still coming. It’s been nonstop. ”  —   ALISSA J. RUBIN and MARLISE SIMONS  Brendan Groeneveld, 30, who works in tech support in the city of Almere, east of Amsterdam, said he was supporting Mr. Wilders’s Party for Freedom primarily because of his hobby: Airsoft, a   pastime similar to paintball, but that uses toys nearly indistinguishable from real firearms, he said. “It is legal, but uncertainties in Dutch law are giving the players a lot of headaches, in regards to some peripheral items,” he said. The Party for Freedom supports expanding the legal use of firearms, he said, “and they’ll at least give more transparency and clarity in regards to what’s allowed and what’s not. ” (Mr. Groeneveld added that he would also like to be able to have real firearms for hunting.) Mr. Groeneveld said that his mother was Canadian and his wife was American, but expressed worries about Islam. “A lot of Dutch culture is giving way to other cultures, and Islam is the most    an obnoxious one,” he said. He said that he agreed when Mr. Wilders talked in public several times about trying to reduce the number of Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands. “We’re all supposed to be Dutch  —   one society, one culture  —   and they persist in standing out,” he said. “I don’t really like that. I’m also of the opinion that specifically Islam is stuck in the Middle Ages. The rest of the world has adapted to modern times they’re insisting on public executions and decapitations. ”  —   NINA SIEGAL On the other end of the spectrum from Mr. Wilders is a new figure: Jesse Klaver, 30, the leader of the Greens. The party holds just four seats in Parliament but seems poised to make big gains. Younger, more energetic and more openly urban and cosmopolitan than many of his rivals, Mr. Klaver has made an unabashed appeal to voters in larger cities and their suburbs, emphasizing the country’s international image as a place that welcomes refugees, protects the environment and has a dynamic postindustrial economy. The son of a Moroccan father (whom Mr. Klaver says he did not know) and an   mother, Mr. Klaver was raised as a Catholic  —   a minority in this largely secular nation  —   and started his career with the National Coalition of Christian Trade Unions. With looks that remind many people of a younger Justin Trudeau and an American style of campaigning that included a big final rally that was styled as a “ ” with drinks, he is a charismatic newcomer. “The traditional parties are not winning elections anymore,” he said in an interview. “What we try to do is to build a movement that is bigger than the traditional parties. What we want to do is to fight populism. ”  —   ALISSA J. RUBIN Henk Janssen, a hotel manager in Valkenburg, in the south of the country, said he was voting for the party of Mr. Rutte, the prime minister. “I vote for stability, for the people in government now,” he said. “Half the world seems to be on fire. People are undermining each other, insulting, lying, creating conflict. Not only in our country but around the world. ” He said he believed that a voter uprising or even a violent confrontation over immigration was possible, because “the mood is harsher everywhere. People are becoming more extreme, more willing to fight when they disagree. ” With the elections over, he hopes a new government “can calm things down. The political climate right now is unhealthy. ” He noted the threat of Islamist extremism and tensions with Russia and Turkey. When Mr. Wilders briefly campaigned in the town of Valkenburg, “it was really abnormal, police everywhere, a helicopter flying circles over the center,” said Anna van Meersen, a shop attendant in the town. “How could a man like that govern us?” But, she cautioned: “People who vote for Wilders may not talk about it. They don’t like the negative reactions they get. ”  —   MARLISE SIMONS’ ”Brit Maanen, 20, a receptionist at a wellness center in Heerlen, said she and her friends were not voting. “We don’t understand enough of what goes on,” she said. “We hear a lot of talk among politicians, but we don’t hear much difference. We see a lot of people who want some power, or a lot of power. ”” ’Ms. Maanen said she had grown up in a multicultural society where she was used to seeing immigrants. In her hometown, Heerlen, she said she was pleased to see “fewer women who are totally veiled. ” “Many wear headscarves. But not many are now covering up their faces. I feel better about that, not so uneasy. ” What does she want from the new government? “In this country we have freedom of religion, freedom of expression. We want to keep it that way. ”  —   MARLISE SIMONS Paul van’t Veer, 44, a D. J. and music programmer who also works in a record store, grew up attending antinuclear rallies in the city of Zwolle in the   Netherlands. On Wednesday, he planned to vote for the Party for the Animals. “They’re one of the only parties that really cares about how the world will be in 15 or 20 years,” he said at a cafe in Zwolle. “The environment is one of the main issues that hasn’t been talked about much before these elections. It’s a bigger fear for me than terrorism is. ” But Mr. Veer’s father has moved in a different direction. He plans to vote for Mr. Wilders’s Party for Freedom. “I’m very sad about that,” the son said. “Nowadays I’m kind of ashamed of Holland because there seems to be far more hate and racism and intolerance than ever came to the surface before. ” Other voters in Zwolle said they hoped to stem the populist tide. Iris Groenendyk, 27, a child protection worker, said she had voted for the centrist party Democrats 66, based on its positions on education and health care. “I’m a bit scared, because of the fact that there are a lot of people who are interested by Wilders’s rhetoric,” she said. Theo van Uden, 66, a human resources manager at a provincial Dutch court, said he was voting for the opposition Socialist Party, because income inequality was his main concern. “The last four years I would say that the politics have changed and it looks like populism is growing and growing, but my feeling is that we’re at the top of the hill with populism,” he said. “ I don’t think it’s going up more. I think it’s going down. ”   —   NINA SIEGAL Parliament is expected to appoint an “informateur” to begin consultations with other parties on forming a government as soon as Friday. Next week, the new Parliament will meet for the first time and deliberate the process of creating a government. The process could take a few months, given the number of parties. Then the coalition names a cabinet, and King   swears in the ministers.  —   MILAN SCHREUER After nearly three decades of using voting machines, the Dutch reverted in 2009 to paper ballots marked with red pencils. For this election, the government has tightened security further, after reports that   hackers were trying to gain access to government computers late last year. In what the Dutch are calling the “  principle,” each vote will be counted and verified by two people at the polling station. Tallies will then be recorded by hand and initially sent by text message to the municipality. The ballots and tally sheets will then be physically delivered to municipal voting centers so that the counts can be   and verified.  —   CHRISTOPHER  F. SCHUETZE There are 12. 9 million eligible voters, out of a population of 17 million. Women have had the vote since 1922. The minimum age is 18 about 850, 000 citizens will be old enough to vote for the first time. Voting is by proportional representation. Voters choose one party’s list  —   there are 28 parties competing  —   and candidates from the list make it into Parliament based on their party’s share of the total vote. There is no minimum threshold in the Netherlands. A party that gets   of the votes cast is guaranteed one of the 150 seats.  —   CHRISTOPHER  F. SCHUETZE In the picturesque heart of Mr. Wilders’s hometown, Venlo, just across the border from northwest Germany, there did not appear to be a strong swell of support for him. “I share some opinions with him, but he shouldn’t be so radical,” said Paula Vanhegen, 64. “Otherwise we get a second Hitler and we don’t want that. ” Many younger and   residents seemed convinced that Mr. Wilders’s party wouldn’t even make it into second place. Stan Koolen, 19, an agribusiness student, said he was convinced Mr. Rutte’s party would win. For three working mothers sipping coffee in the old town square, TV and social media played a big part in helping them decide. “Life in the Netherlands is good,” said one of them, Miriam Swaghoven, 43, adding that Mr. Rutte had represented the country well for eight years. But the longer conversation went on, the more the women expressed unhappiness with what they said was pressure on Dutch people to abandon traditions like the character “Black Pete. ” Muslims and others “are allowed to have their traditions, while we have to change ours,” Ms. Swaghoven said. Only one interviewee, Nadine Houwes, 20, a veterinary assistant, said she would not vote. All politicians “say something but are not doing it,” she shrugged.  —   ALISON SMALE Mr. Wilders is unique in that he has taken advantage of a loophole that allows him to lead a party with seats in Parliament even though, as a technical and legal matter, his “party” is an association, and is not covered by some of the Dutch and European Union law that pertains to political parties. For legal purposes, Mr. Wilders is the sole member of his Party for Freedom. Everyone else is part of the party’s association  —   the Dutch word “vereniging”  —   and they are not required to pay dues. There is no requirement in the Netherlands that candidates on the party lists for which citizens cast votes need to be party members. But every other party in the Dutch Parliament is organized along traditional lines, with members paying dues. By having an association rather than a party, experts say, Mr. Wilders retains control over the party’s platforms and is able to keep much of his financing secret, because under Dutch law, the head of the party must report all income and expenditures to party members, and he is the only one. (Only larger sums  —   expenditures over 4, 500 euros, or about $4, 780, and debts over 25, 000 euros, or about $26, 500  —   need to be disclosed to the government.) The downside is that he is ineligible for government subsidies available to parties with more than 1, 000 members.  —   ALISSA J. RUBIN",0
10306,Early Voting Is So Strong For Democrats That Clinton Could Lock Up Nevada this Week,"On Meet The Press, Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that early voting is so strong for Democrats in Nevada that Hillary Clinton could build an insurmountable lead this week. 
Video: 
Chuck Todd asked Mook if he believed the email story could cost Clinton the election. 
He answered: 
I don’t think so. Look, as I said, we have over 50,000 volunteers out there. We’re seeing record early voting numbers in North Carolina, Florida. Look, I would wager in Nevada turnout is so strong among Democrats there Hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in Nevada. We’re feeling really good about this record turnout. Over 200 million people in our country now registered to vote. Fifty million of those are young people. We’re just nose to the grindstone, and we’re going to finish this out. But people should not take anything for granted, and we’re going to have to work hard to earn this.” 
Hillary Clinton could put Nevada out of reach for Trump this week, but whether or not that happens is up to the voters. If Democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states, the email story won’t matter. If Democrats don’t show up, that is Trump’s only chance of winning. 
The early voting numbers that Hillary Clinton is running up in Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada are no accident. Clinton and the Democratic Party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states. 
Democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the 2016 election, but Donal Trump’s refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area. 
The final week before the election could be just as vital to Democrats in swing states as election day. If Hillary Clinton piles up big margins in early voting, it could leave minimal drama for election night. 
The Democratic early voting plan is working to perfection, now as Mook said, all that is left is for Democrats to put their heads down, work hard, and close the deal.

10307,Nation Still Struggling To Come To Terms With Terrorist Living In Ireland,"0 Add Comment 
THE Nation is still struggling to come to terms the fact an Irishman could ever join a terrorist organisation, several days after Irishman Khalid Kelly allegedly blew himself up in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq. 
Kelly, originally from Dublin, recently lived in Longford and had been fighting for ISIS in Iraq, the news of which shocked communities that previously had no exposure to terrorism or terrorist organisations to their core. 
“You just can’t credit it, can ye, some lad running around with guns and the like. Spouting all sorts of shite about redrawing maps and taking back what is rightfully theirs. Gas all the same,” shared Louth native Trevor Gorman, whose uncle would periodically go up north for something called ‘training’ in the 90s. 
“Look, you’ll just have to give me some time. People in the Middle East are well accustomed to violent loonies hiding behind a religion to commit horrible acts, but this is all new to us, and him being Irish… that’s mad,” said Cavan man Sean Dignam, from the comfort of a stool in an IRA owned pub. 
The view from across the country found people similarly shocked that an Irishman could find himself part of a morally compromised, ideologically bankrupt outfit. 
“Their followers out there, they’re bold a pup from what I hear, but Muslims lads here shoudl really out denouncing that right now,” shared Dubliner Ciaran Mackey. 
“The Jihadis go on and on about how there only concerns are Islamic terror and that, but then ya read they’re selling drugs too, which goes against everything they be saying or beliefs and that. And they do other awful stuff like abusing girls. I tell ya, we don’t have any terrorists in Ireland, but if we did, they wouldn’t be at that craic at all,” added Mackey.",0
10308,The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor,"Leave a reply 
Michael Snyder – Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump’s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton’s “certain victory” is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle”, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary’s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is “worse than Watergate”, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds before election day. 
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn’t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn’t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton’s lead has been whittled down to just one point . 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain’s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND … Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server is forcing him to “reassess” his support for the Democratic nominee for president. Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on “Fox Report Weekend.” 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server before the November 8 election. The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN. But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what — if any — classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment” completed “in coming days”… 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‘preliminary assessment’ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly… Developing… 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week. SF Source Economic Collapse blog Nov. 2016 Share this:",0

But this is not the sharia of America. ” “Sharia is a set of legal rules that deal with a range of issues from the minutia of washing hands and feet to purify oneself before prayer to inheritance rules. It’s also about spirituality,” Uddin and Arastu wrote.

10311,BOMBSHELL: Justice Clarence Thomas Accused Of Sexual Misconduct (VIDEO),"BOMBSHELL: Justice Clarence Thomas Accused Of Sexual Misconduct (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler   
Way back in 1991, the news in this country was filled with stories of sexual harassment. Anita Hill was a young law professor who sat in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee as it debated the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. 
Professor Hill described the sexually explicit comments that she said Judge Thomas had made to her when she worked for him. She shared her story and her embarrassment to the entire nation, but her story was evaluated by a panel of white men. 
In spite of what many observers felt was damning testimony from Professor Hill, Clarence Thomas was nevertheless confirmed and joined the Supreme Court of the United States. 
Now another woman has made a claim about Justice Thomas and his inappropriate sexual advances. 
This time the claim comes from a woman named Moria Smith. She is Vice President and General Counsel to Enstar Natural Gas Company. Ms. Smith first reported her encounter with the Justice on her Facebook page. 
Smith claimed that she was a 23 year old Truman scholar in attendance at a Truman Foundation Dinner in 1999. Clarence Thomas was a Justice on the Supreme Court at the time. 
She told the National Law Journal that she was in the process of setting the table, putting her in a position of subservience to the guests. As she was setting the table, the young woman says that she was grabbed by Justice Thomas, who cupped her rear and pulled her close to him. 
She said : “He groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‘right next to him.’” 
Naturally, Justice Thomas claims that none of this ever happened. When was the last time that a sexual predator happily agreed with his accuser? 
Ms. Smith had apparently told her story to her friends, though, way back when it first happened. The National Law Review says that it spoke to several of her friends and former roommates who remembered her describing the encounter when it first happened. 
Yet another reason to vote Blue on November 8. We need a Supreme Court that is weighted heavily in favor of those who support women and will stand up against sexual aggression.

10312,What Marketing Obamacare Really Looks Like [Cartoon],"You are here: Home / political cartoon / What Marketing Obamacare Really Looks Like [Cartoon] What Marketing Obamacare Really Looks Like [Cartoon] October 28, 2016 Pinterest 
C.E. Dyer reports that the disaster that is Obamacare is about to get worse for many people enrolled in the health insurance marketplace. On Monday, the Obama administration confirmed that premiums will skyrocket for many people next year, according to the Associated Press . 
The AP reported: 
Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. 
Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. 
In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark “second-lowest cost silver plan” will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. 
But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. 
Larry Levitt, who follows the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the increases: “Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period.” 
Donald Trump’s campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, said in a statement on Monday: “This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.” Miller added, “While (Hillary) Clinton wants to expand the failed program known as Obamacare, Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nation’s failing health care system is complete and total reform.” 
Reports have warned that this was coming down the pike for some time; however, HHS’s confirmation ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1 — one week before the election — is likely to cause major headaches for many people. 
This debacle is not unexpected either — it’s exactly what President Obama and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton wanted to happen. 
Obamacare was never the end goal. Rather, it was a stepping stone toward single-payer, government-run healthcare. That is a big reason why Obama wants Clinton to become president — his legacy is at stake. 
Obama’s legacy is largely wrapped up in Obamacare and what it leads to. Clinton tried to push this first step during her time as first lady and failed, but the conditions will be ripe for her to go even further should she be elected. 
If Clinton becomes president, there’s no doubt that her next step will be to move to single-payer healthcare. Obamacare is bad, there’s no doubt about it, but single-payer government healthcare would be even worse.",0

10316,Trump Promises White House Will No Longer Obscure Iraq and Syria Troop Deployments,"President Trump has authorized military commanders to reset the complex system of troop limits in the Iraqi and Syrian theaters. The Pentagon announced no immediate changes, but supporters of Trump’s decision say it will sweep away a veil of political obfuscation President Obama placed over troop deployments. [To put it bluntly, the Obama administration did not honestly report how many U. S. “boots on the ground” were placed in Iraq and Syria. As Reuters explains:  The Force Management Level system was introduced in Iraq and Syria during Barack Obama’s administration as a way to exert control over the military. Obama periodically raised FML limits to allow more troops in Iraq and Syria as the campaign against Islamic State advanced. But the numbers did not reflect the extent of the U. S. commitment on the ground since commanders found often    ways to work around the limits  —   sometimes bringing in forces temporarily or hiring more contractors. The force management levels, which are officially at 5, 262 in Iraq and 503 in Syria, are believed to be more than a couple of thousands troops shy of the actual number of U. S. forces in both countries. “We want our reporting to Congress and to the public to be more easily and clearly understood,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White. “We will conduct a review to ensure that the numbers we provide to Congress and to the public accurately reflect the facts on the ground. This is about transparency. ” One particular area of clarity mentioned in the Pentagon’s announcement is the number of troops on “temporary” deployment. In the past, such temporary assignments were a convenient way to bypass the troop limits without admitting more American personnel were being deployed to the Iraq and Syrian theaters since “temporary” deployments didn’t count. “Bringing the authority really back here where it’s historically been enables military commanders to be more agile, to more quickly and efficiently support partners, to have more rapid   and to keep units together,” said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis. The Pentagon emphasized that it plans to continue its focus on training and equipping local forces, rather than dramatically increasing the number of U. S. troops in the region. As Reuters goes on to point out, President Obama’s deception was not only directed at domestic audiences. Hostile entities in Iraq and Syria, notably   militia leaders like Shiite imam Moqtada   are already agitating for fewer American troops in the battle to recapture Mosul from ISIS. A larger U. S. footprint could mean political problems for the Iraqi government. Military. com calls Trump’s order a “major reversal of Obama administration policy” and wonders if Secretary of Defense James Mattis will eventually have the authority to deploy more troops to Afghanistan where the security situation has been degrading steadily, and South Korea, where the security situation might degrade rather abruptly. The change announced by the Trump White House and Pentagon is limited to Iraq and Syria at the moment. “The decision by Trump to delegate more authority to Mattis followed complaints by three defense secretaries who served under Obama  —   Robert Gates, Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel  —   about being ‘micromanaged’ by White House officials on military matters,” Military. com notes.",0
10317,Inside Trump Defense Secretary Pick’s Efforts to Halt Torture - The New York Times,"The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003, outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines. The    man had been beaten, deprived of sleep, forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces. James N. Mattis,   Donald J. Trump’s nominee for secretary of defense, was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center. He quickly convened an inquiry into the death, which led to   and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison. “General Mattis was all up in arms over this,” Ralph Dengler, then a lieutenant colonel, testified at a military hearing in January 2004. He added that the commander, who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart, had immediately described the death as “the worst thing that happened” under his watch in the Iraq war. “I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it, considering many of the other deaths, including American deaths,” Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the general’s handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment, which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief. Mr. Trump, in a New York Times interview in late November, said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country’s 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the   practice of waterboarding, adding that “only a stupid person would say it doesn’t work. ” General Mattis does not support abusive techniques, let alone waterboarding. “Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers,” he told Mr. Trump during their meeting in November, according to the   “and I do better with that than I do with torture. ” The general’s beliefs were shaped by his military training, but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment, according to an examination of his nearly   career and interviews with former colleagues and friends. General Mattis led the United States Central Command from August 2010 to March 2013. Lt. Col. T. G. Taylor, who was General Mattis’s spokesman during much of that time, said in an interview that the commander had spoken of America as needing to hold the moral high ground. Failing to uphold important principles “makes it easier for a soldier or a Marine to ask, ‘What am I fighting for? ’” Colonel Taylor said. “That is something that General Mattis is keenly aware of,” he added. As a young officer, General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, which, among other protections, require humane treatment of prisoners of war. A Marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college  —   part of an R. O. T. C. program during the height of the Vietnam War  —   he did not deploy to Vietnam. But, several friends say, he believed that American prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the Vietcong if the United States tortured enemy captives. In 2006, General Mattis supported Gen. David H. Petraeus of the Army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics. “Torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option, even if lives depend on gaining information,” the manual said. “Lose moral legitimacy, lose the war. ” General Mattis later agreed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees  —   including waterboarding, forced nudity and sensory deprivation, tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret C. I. A. prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, which later fell under the general’s command. That program, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, also known as SERE, exposed United States soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that Americans could be better prepared to resist them. The experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive, whether true or not. A recent investigation by The New York Times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in C. I. A. jails or American military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some American former P. O. W.s who suffered horrific abuses in Vietnam or Korea. As a commander in Afghanistan and later in Iraq, and as an overall leader of the American war effort, General Mattis often grappled with the consequences of the C. I. A. ’s treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. They became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened American forces in the field. Testifying at a Senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement, General Mattis opposed the release, before the end of hostilities, of prisoners who had fought against the United States. However, he added, they should be treated humanely, in accordance with international and domestic law. “I would go by the Geneva Conventions, and maintain them, with Red Cross oversight, until the war is over,” he told lawmakers. Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence, the general felt. “For his whole career, he’s believed that it just doesn’t pay dividends,” said a retired senior United States military officer who is close to General Mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Trump. The “pack of cigarettes” reference, according to people who served with the general, reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable, and that   can go a long way. “I’m not in his head, but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture,” Colonel Taylor said. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s transition team, declined requests for more detail on the  ’s discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General Mattis’s beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administration’s departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques  —   government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture, and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions  —   tainted the United States’ reputation while not yielding results. “Ineffective, war crime, against our values, moral high ground, et cetera,” Donald J. Guter, a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law, said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. “A very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured, and we have no basis to object. If we torture, we’ve lost who we are. ” The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example, the Army field manual’s section on intelligence collection states: “Use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results. ” The manual adds, “Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited. ” As a commander in Iraq, General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq, christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty, stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the   invasion. The prisoner who died, Nagem Sadoon Hatab, had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch, a    private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an   rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to     treatment  —   forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour, for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired, stressed and submissive for interrogators, witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center, Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and  . He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling, screaming and banging from the interrogation room, a converted bathroom. After midnight on June 6, 2003, Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours, his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck, the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes, including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis, Col. William B. Gallo, later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab, if any, might have been lethal. In Colonel Gallo’s opinion, the   treatment did not amount to torture, but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence, including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent, had been lost or destroyed, complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines, a major and a sergeant, were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. Hatab’s death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time, he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners, which resulted in a ban of   tactics, including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training, and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still, there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later, aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended, General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: “No better friend, no worse enemy. ” The addition was, “First, do no harm. ”",0
10318,Google and Facebook Take Aim at Fake News Sites - The New York Times,"Over the last week, two of the world’s biggest internet companies have faced mounting criticism over how fake news on their sites may have influenced the presidential election’s outcome. On Monday, those companies responded by making it clear that they would not tolerate such misinformation by taking pointed aim at fake news sites’ revenue sources. Google kicked off the action on Monday afternoon when the Silicon Valley search giant said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service. Hours later, Facebook, the social network, updated the language in its Facebook Audience Network policy, which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. “We have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance. ” Taken together, the decisions were a clear signal that the tech behemoths could no longer ignore the growing outcry over their power in distributing information to the American electorate. Facebook has been at the epicenter of that debate, accused by some commentators of swinging some voters in favor of   Donald J. Trump through misleading and outright wrong stories that spread quickly via the social network. One such false story claimed that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump. Google did not escape the glare, with critics saying the company gave too much prominence to false news stories. On Sunday, the site Mediaite reported that the top result on a Google search for “final election vote count 2016” was a link to a story on a website called 70News that wrongly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. By Monday evening, the fake story had fallen to No. 2 in a search for those terms. Google says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories. “The goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,” Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. “In this case, we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms. ” Facebook’s decision to clarify its ad policy language is notable because Mark Zuckerberg, the social network’s chief executive, has repeatedly fobbed off criticism that the company had an effect on how people voted. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, he said that 99 percent of what people see on the site is authentic, and only a tiny amount is fake news and hoaxes. “Over all, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Yet within Facebook, employees and executives have been increasingly questioning their responsibilities and role in influencing the electorate, The New York Times reported on Saturday. Facebook’s ad policy update will not stem the flow of fake news stories that spread through the news feeds that people see when they visit the social network. Facebook has long spoken of how it helped influence and stoke democratic movements in places like the Middle East, and it tells its advertisers that it can help sway its users with ads. Facebook reaches 1. 8 billion people around the globe, and the company is one of the largest distributors of news online. A Pew Research Center study said that nearly half of American adults rely on Facebook as a news source. Google’s decision on Monday relates to the Google AdSense system that independent web publishers use to display advertising on their sites, generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on. The advertisers pay Google, and Google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers. More than two million publishers use Google’s advertising network. For some time, Google has had policies in place prohibiting misleading advertisements from its system, including promotions for counterfeit goods and   scams. Google’s new policy, which it said would go into effect “imminently,” will extend its ban on misrepresentative content to the websites its advertisements run on. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content or the primary purpose of the web property,” Ms. Faville said. Ms. Faville said that the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to the election. It remains to be seen how effective Google’s new policy on fake news will be in practice. The policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake. Although satire sites like The Onion are not the target of the policy, it is not clear whether some of them, which often run fake news stories written for humorous effect, will be inadvertently affected by Google’s change.",0
10319,Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump,"You are here: Home / US / Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump October 29, 2016 Pinterest 
Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was jailed in Iran because of his faith for three and a half years. During that extremely difficult time, Abedini said that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump met with his family and gave them $10,000. 
Abedini wrote about how Trump helped his family in a recent Facebook post and noted that he had already voted for Trump last week in early voting. “I am finally free in a free country,” he wrote. “Last year on the same day I was sick and in chains for Christ, and now I can vote to choose my next president.” 
“And most amazingly, I can vote for someone that I know fought for me and called my name so many times. He met my family and gave them a $10,000 gift. I think his ideas are more biblical than the other candidates.” 
In contrast, Clinton did nothing for him or his family: 
As a woman who says she stands for women’s rights when she was foreign minister, she never contacted my mom, wife, sister or my daughter. She never did anything to help when I was in prison as an American pastor who was detained in Iran as a hostage. 
Christian Today reported : 
Abedini strongly defended Trump from attacks on his character, saying God used flawed men to lead nations in the Old Testament, likening him to King Cyrus of Persia, a figure mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible. According to Bible experts, Cyrus was a great pagan king who ruled Persia from 539 to 530 B.C. Under his rule, Jews were first allowed to return to Israel after 70 years of captivity. 
Abedini wrote: 
In the past few months, we have seen how media is attacking Donald Trump’s past. I have even heard so many people said he is not a Christian. Of course, only God knows this for sure, but what I see is God is using him and anointed him. It seems to me that he is the Cyrus of our modern day, but like you and me, he is a flawed man, in the process of spiritual growth. 
When we hear that this candidate or that candidate is not a strong Christian or has a past that disqualifies him to be the President of the United States, my answer is that we are a nation, a people who are also sinners, saved by grace. 
How often do you hear about kind things Clinton has done for others like this? I can’t think of any. Abedini’s words are extremely powerful and certainly something anyone who is on the fence about Trump should read.",0
10320,"In Trump’s Hometown, a Clear Message of Defiance From Women - The New York Times","New Yorkers flooded the streets of Manhattan on Saturday aiming to send a message to President Trump that his hometown would be a center of resistance during his administration. The mayor’s office estimated that 400, 000 people took part in the march, which was in concert with other Women’s March rallies across the country. With huge crowds along Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower, a large slice of Manhattan came to a standstill for much of the day. Participants booed Mr. Trump and hoisted signs mocking both his hair and his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It was a moment of both catharsis and camaraderie in a city that was, for the most part, shocked and disappointed by Mr. Trump’s ascendance to the presidency. Holding a “Nasty Woman” sign, Grace Huezo, 20, was buoyed by the huge turnout and the joyful mood. “I’m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they’re keeping their spirit,” she said. “We’re all just going to stick together over the next four years. ” Ms. Huezo, a student at Hunter College, said she was marching with her sister to defend women’s rights. She said she was appalled by the 2005 recording of Mr. Trump’s lewd comments about women that emerged during the campaign. “We’re here saying, ‘No, people do not have permission to grab women without our permission,’” she said. The march began with a rally near Trump World Tower on the East Side, where Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, led the crowd in urging Mr. Trump not to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. “New York City has always been the center of progressive America, and that will never change,” she said. The actress Whoopi Goldberg suggested it would be the first of many marches while Mr. Trump was in office. Hinting at the debate over diversity leading up to the marches, one speaker said she wanted equal pay, and “not just for white women. ” Throughout the day, marchers clogged city streets and overwhelmed subway stations. Men and women wore pink “pussy hats” and held signs that read, “You lost here, Donald,” and “I’m Still With Her. ” Around 4 p. m. near Trump Tower, a wall of police officers tried to keep people moving as protesters chanted, “Black Lives Matter. ” Alice Bucaille said she wanted to bring her two daughters to the march, but decided against it because of violence on Friday after the inauguration ceremony in Washington. Ms. Bucaille said she would have welcomed women with views that differed from hers on abortion, and added that Democrats could no longer live in a bubble. “We need to open the discussion and understand where people are coming from,” she said. “Being inclusive is part of the conversation. ” Plenty of children attended the march with parents and grandparents. Along the route, Annabel Lui, 6, stood on a bench proudly holding a sign that said: “Little Donald, you’ve been a bad boy. Now go to your room for the next four years. ”   stopped to watch as she chanted, “Trump has to go!”",0

10322,"Commander-In-Chief Donald Trump Will Have Terrifying Powers. Thanks, Obama.","Written by Alex Eammons   When Donald Trump becomes commander in chief in January, he will take on presidential powers that have never been more expansive and unchecked.He’ll control an unaccountable drone program, and the prison at Guantanamo Bay. His FBI, including a network of 15,000 paid informants, already has a record of spying on mosques and activists , and his NSA’s surveillance empire is ubiquitous and governed by arcane rules, most of which remain secret. He will inherit bombing campaigns in seven Muslim countries, the de facto ability to declare war unilaterally, and a massive nuclear arsenal — much of which is on hair-trigger alert .Caught off guard by Hillary Clinton’s election defeat, Democrats who defended these powers under President Obama may suddenly be having second thoughts as the White House gets handed over to a man they described — with good reason — as “unhinged, ” and “dangerously unfit.” In the years after the 9/11 terror attacks, Vice President Dick Cheney and his legal adviser David Addington dramatically expanded the powers of the presidency, asserting the unilateral right in wartime to ignore legal limits on things like torture and government eavesdropping. Congressional Democrats generally caved , but made a few efforts to push back .The Democrats went silent on executive overreach when Obama was elected, however.When the New York Times revealed Bush’s warrantless wiretapping program in 2005, 60 percent of registered Democrats thought the program was “unacceptable.” But after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed a dramatically larger surveillance apparatus in 2013, a 61 percent of Democrats said the opposite — presumably because they trusted the man in charge.The Obama administration has counted on that trust repeatedly. When defending the drone program in 2012, instead of referencing its legal standards, administration officials reassured the New York Times that Obama is “a student of the writings on war by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas,” and that CIA director John Brennan is like “a priest with extremely strong moral values who was suddenly charged with leading a war.”After eight years of trusting the President with expanding military power, liberals must now reckon with the fact that Obama will pass the same capabilities to a man who has proposed killing terrorists’ innocent family members, who has said he would do “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,” and who has suggested dipping bullets in pigs’ blood is sound counterterrorism strategy.And most of the paltry few legal limitations that regulate the security state could easily be repealed by a President Trump...
Obama has continued the Presidential tradition of going to war without Congress, sometimes in almost absurd ways. In 2011, for example, the White House needed to argue that it could continue bombing Muammar Gaddafi’s forces in Libya without Congressional authorization. So the top lawyer in the State Department sent a memo to Congress arguing that a bombing campaign did not amount to wartime “hostilities,” mainly because the enemy could not fire back. 
Even when the Obama administration sought Congressional authorization in 2013 to strike Syrian President Bashar Hafez al-Assad’s forces in retaliation for using chemical weapons, he insisted that he didn’t really need to. And he has not sought out a separate authorization to extend the war on terror to fight ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Libya, Al Shabaab in Somalia, or Boko Haram in Nigeria. 
With such expansive war powers, and armed with the broad, Bush-era 2001 Congressional resolution authorizing war “in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism,” the next President could conduct military operations on a whim. Fair Use excerpt. Read full article here . Related",0
10323,A Lasting Trump Stamp on Foreign Policy,"A Lasting Trump Stamp on Foreign Policy October 28, 2016 
Many downwardly mobile Americans are confused about what happened to them, which explains the attraction of Donald Trump, who offers few coherent solutions but may have a lasting impact on U.S. relations with the world, says Michael Brenner. 
By Michael Brenner 
Donald Trump most likely will not be elected President. Still, his historic campaign has sent shock waves through the American body politic. All are asking what it means and what it portends. The focus is on America at home rather than abroad. Foreign policy issues have been overshadowed by anxious domestic concerns. 
Moreover, Trump never formulated a coherent view of international issues. Like the average guy, he simply spat out whatever thoughts passed through his head as he had caught snippets of Fox News. Any attempt to discern logic and strategy from Trump’s disjointed exclamations proves frustrating. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
Trump’s entire campaign conveyed emotions rather than considered thoughts. It played to the public’s feelings – amplifying them and channeling them into a turbid or opaque brew of primitive slogans. Energy was imparted through unbridled vehemence and the showmanship of the born despot. 
So it is those emotions that we should look at to see what is simmering behind the formal façade of our democracy in action. For they will outlast the election. Therein lies their significance for possible effects on the United States relations with the rest of the world. 
American Nativism 
If there is an appropriate label to stick on this fermenting vat, it is “nativism.” By that we mean a rather inchoate mix of atavistic nationalism, xenophobia, aggressiveness, righteous religiosity and racism dressed up as patriotism. Deep-seated sense of grievance and pervasive feelings that the true American has been sold out provide the fuel. 
Each of these elements has precedents in American history and roots in American society. They periodically have surfaced in political movements from the “Know-Nothings” who in the 1850s were empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, to the paranoia that accompanied the Red Scare in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and then reappeared with greater intensity in the form of McCarthyism. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads “Vote Trump” on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
Today’s manifestations have a larger economic component. The optimistic creed that has been the lifeblood of America has been sapped by the plight of salaried workers after decades of wealth redistribution upwards, the hollowing out of the country’s industrial core, the financializing of business, and the emergence of a “gig” economy that promises only more dislocation, insecurity, skimpy or no benefits, and declining living standards. 
Rugged individualism dictates that individual persons should assume responsibility for their failings; stoic fatalism in the face of external forces that drain all hope is quite another matter. Blame, like discontent, is free-floating. Its locus shifts among Wall Street, government leaders, and foreigners. 
The last most interests us here. Factors originating beyond the nation’s borders are prominent targets. They range from “globalization” as an abstract new reality, to Benedict Arnold companies that off-shore jobs and tax liabilities, to U.S. leaders who sign away American interests in one-sided trade deals to hostile governments who are cheaters. 
Sold Out 
There is more than a grain of truth in the complaints directed at all of those mentioned. The “common man,” as we quaintly used to call workers, indeed has been sold out by the “bosses” – economic and political. In truth, most of that selling out has been by elites favoring other elites here at home at the expense of the general populace. Foreigners are politically more convenient targets, though. Hillary Clinton speaking at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona,   by Gage Skidmore) 
The primary question is whether the disposition to blame external parties will manifest itself in antagonistic action. That has been the pattern elsewhere at other times. It is by no means obvious, though, that this logic holds in the case of the United States today. This is certainly true as regards any large-scale use of military force. 
Fifteen years of relentless, failed wars in the greater Middle East have drained the country of the passion for violence with which Americans retaliated for 9/11. Whether a President Hillary Clinton would expand operations in Syria is unaffected by the American public’s anger over illegal immigration or biased “trade” agreements. A vague distaste for ungrateful, grasping foreigners does not eclipse aversion to expensive new adventures abroad or skepticism that they will work. 
As to Russia, the current high-decibel condemnation of Moscow’s alleged machinations is more an elite phenomenon, led by the security establishment, than it is an expression of popular outrage. Few Americans identify with the Syrian “rebels” whom Vladimir Putin is fighting or Ukrainian paramilitaries burning people alive in Odessa. 
The negative view of Russia, and Putin personally, so assiduously cultivated by politicos and the mainstream media does not translate into a broad fear or hatred among the American people. The pervasive obsession with the Red Menace that marked the Cold War remains dormant. That is even true in Europe – except for the Poles and the Baltics. Washington chooses to be rhetorically aggressive and to take the much publicized steps of building up NATO forces around Russia’s periphery. But there is little stomach for actually raising a risk of direct conflict. 
In conclusion, American policy toward Russia and the Middle East will follow the tracks laid down by the Obama administration with little deviation – and no greater success. 
The Dark Side 
Every society has its dark and dangerous undercurrents. America’s is laced with racism and fed by a deep pool of personal insecurities. The recrudescence of coarse racism, the deep psychic anxieties of the white males of Middle America, the embrace of jingoism, the frustrations of trailer park super-patriots, and the desperation of tormented Evangelicals torn over the question of whether a prospective nuclear Iran is a sign that the End Days are approaching or a serious speed-bump on the road to Rapture – together, these elements are creating an emotional maelstrom that has found an odd idol in the buffoonish persona of Donald Trump. Afghan children await school supplies from Allied forces at Sozo School in Kabul. (French navy photo by Master Petty Officer Valverde) 
The longer it lasts, the more attached Trump himself becomes to the pipedream of writing his name on the wind forever – and the more his followers see themselves affirmed and exalted. 
Finally, we have to come to terms with the dismaying truth that public opinion, in individuals and in aggregate, is only exceptionally the outcome of an informed and thoughtful process of deliberation. It is the rationalist myth that we are by nature thinking creatures inclined to viewing the world around us in an emotionally detached, mature manner. Very, very few persons approximate that model. 
Inherited loyalties, deep-seated prejudices and preferences, private emotions, the attraction or repulsion of personality – all of these elements come into play to considerable degree. In today’s society where attachments of all sorts are weak and evanescent, where political parties have little cohesion, where associational life has faded, where we are exposed to the barrage of media imagery and messaging, the rationalist model has become less and less valid. Most of us are shaped by influences that we only dimly perceive – whether calculated intent lies behind them or not. 
Immigration Hot Button 
Thus, it is immigration that has become the hot button issue involving other countries. Passions are aroused by two things: the presence of millions of illegals from Mexico and Central America; and the prospect of Islamic terrorists entering the United States masquerading as refugees. Syrian women and children refugees at Budapest railway station. (Photo from Wikipedia) 
The two merge at the most primitive level of emotions. Together, they deepen worries that the world is spinning out of control in ways that call into question the country the many American people know (or imagine they know). Projections of rapidly increasing Latino populations, which threaten to overwhelm school districts and voter rolls, ruffle the feathers of many Middle Americans. Alarm that welfare and other social problems are siphoning off much needed public moneys in the age of austerity add a tangible economic element to these anxieties. 
Could this lead to implementation of the sorts of draconian “ethnic cleansing” programs advocated by Donald Trump? Unlikely – despite his ability to insert them into so-called “mainstream” discourse about the problem. It is easy to exaggerate the extent and the intensity of anti-immigrant feelings. 
Most Americans encounter little of it in their daily lives. Those who do in places like Texas or California pretty much take it as a given: something that should be dealt with but not a matter requiring urgent action. Arizona is different. That’s where the extreme Rightists (and the Republican politicos whom they have intimidated into obedience) make most of the noise. 
Foreign observers should note that the situation in the U.S. is very different from that in Western Europe. Not only is the United States a very big country where relatively large populations can get lost but, equally important, social space is not as tightly configured. 
Outside of small towns, there is little sense of traditional community to be protected. Americanism trumps all as the successful integration of waves of immigrants throughout the country’s history has demonstrated. While Latinos do present some unusual complications (unlike South or East Asian immigrants), visceral concerns about a denaturing of culture and society are relatively weak. (After all, 25 percent of baseball players in the professional leagues are Latinos – most from abroad.) 
So, the politics of immigration policy reform has not changed. The policies and unresolved dispute over what to do next will remain in their present indeterminate state. 
The Terrorism Scare 
The immigration-terrorism link is a far more passionate matter. It taps the terrorism psychosis that has gripped the country since 9/11. The graphic outbreak of mass shootings over the past year has rekindled feverish emotions. The fact that the Orlando/San Bernadino/New York/New Jersey perpetrators had some vague connection with jihadi groups in the Middle East has given these events a transnational dimension. It doesn’t seem to matter that perps were American-born citizens or had grown up in the U.S. Islamic terrorists prepare to execute a wounded policeman after their attack on the offices of French magazine Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7, 2015. 
Logically speaking, a detached observer could infer that restrictive immigration from the Mideast or of Muslims generally would have no bearing on the level of terrorist threat. But facts in the age of Trump have lost much of their purchase on the American mind. 
One fact that is incontrovertible is that politicians run scared on all matters that are related to terrorism – however oblique. The foot-dragging of President Obama on accepting any significant number of Syrian refugees is exhibit number one. Hostility toward Muslims generally is on the rise as witness the spike in abusive incidents in recent months. They now are occurring at a higher rate than they did in the wake of 9/11. By contrast, public authorities at all levels are less inclined to pursue surveillance and detention policies that skirt the law compared to that earlier period. 
The net effect will be a deepening perception around the world that the United States is hostile toward Islam. That is grist for the mill of the jihadis and opportunistic politicians. While it seems unlikely that signs of Islamo-phobia in American society will affect the thinking and actions of government leaders, they very well could register in the communities from which suicide bombers and terrorists are drawn – in Europe especially and among certain unbalanced individuals in the United States itself. That cycle thereby gains velocity. 
What about the economic sphere? It is there that one might reasonably expect the preoccupations of the presidential campaign to affect the policy of a new administration. Economic nationalism follows naturally from aroused popular discontents that finger the forces of globalization as a prime cause of the economic plight in which tens of millions of American find themselves. That is to say, one might anticipate that American officials will take a more searching look at the “bottom-line” impact of the accelerating integration of the world economy whose promotion has been a centerpiece of American foreign policy since the early 1990s – as actively and optimistically promoted by Hillary Clinton’s husband. 
The process has tremendous momentum – institutional (via such entities as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), political and intellectual. Economic thinking, academic and governmental, has been totally dominated by the twin market fundamentalist concepts of General Market Equilibrium Theory and benign globalization. 
A Bow to Inequality 
While it has become trendy for all and sundry to make a ceremonial bow to the inequality phenomenon, it is hard to see the momentum of this juggernaut being blocked by disorganized displays of populism. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served under President Bill Clinton, personifies this state of affairs. One of the architects and master builders of the financialized, unregulated transnational economy who fought ruthlessly to bail out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street after the 2008 crash, he now punctuates his innumerable public appearances with warnings that we should pay attention to the inequality dilemma. 
This homily is not a prelude to any action. Rather, it is akin to the Mafia don who devoutly crosses himself every time that his limousine crosses the path of a religious procession on a Saint’s Day. 
That is the outlook in the United States under Hillary Clinton. The one exception might by the TPP and TIIP trade treaties with Asia. Both were crafted by elites imbued by the optimistic globalization creed, both were kept secret except for the financial and commercial interests who were participants in their drafting, and both go far beyond traditional trade matters. 
The former, in particular, represents a radical transference of power from national governments to private parties institutionalized in expert panels heavily biased toward the latter. Indeed, many of its provisions may be unconstitutional – as a fair-minded Supreme Court could rule. 
That recondite aspect of TPP did not get an airing during the campaign. However, the tying of the treaty to the damaging effects of “trade” treaties forced even its supporters to equivocate. Hillary Clinton had been an enthusiastic backer until Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump began to reap political hay by condemning it. She now declares that is acceptable only if significant new conditions are met. 
What will be her ultimate position? She may be spared that agonizing decision were Obama able to push a lame-duck session of the Senate to ratify it. Otherwise, it may just be the one and only piece of American foreign relations that changes as a result of the election campaign. 
Continuity is likely to prevail elsewhere. Americans overall will remain the insular, parochial, moralizing and largely ignorant citizens they have been. That leaves plenty of space for a foreign-policy establishment driven by a powerful inertia to add to its long string of mishaps.

10324,Demo Derby in Venezuela: The Left’s New Freewheeling Politics,"Email 
Caracas. 
What happened last week in Venezuela has the appearance of a demolition derby. President Nicolás Maduro, whose PSUV socialist party is something like a rickety 1970s Thunderbird, picked up speed on Friday and smashed into the opposition’s equally crusty ride as it was lurking around the edges of the field, lost in daydreams about an easy transition. 
It was a good move. As a result of the collision, a few doors fell off Maduro’s already scrappy vehicle. The opposition, on the other hand, was left with an almost completely crippled and useless chassis. Moreover, Maduro had formerly assured that the Vatican’s hulking Impala station wagon — experienced in all kinds of fairground acts — was at hand to steamroll whatever remained in the field. 
As always, Venezuelan politics offers stunning demonstrations about how to struggle radically for power. Years of sitting on what is possibly the planet’s largest oil reserves have provided a rich training ground in power games that far exceed the imagination of most of the world’s politicians. This latest move on the part of the government was one that required careful balancing and timing, despite the smashup nature of its concluding step. 
Here is how the whole thing happened. The government had been facing the ugly prospect of a referendum to revoke the president in 2017. This voting process, even if it wouldn’t take Chavism out of power (since the constitution dictates that the vice president will assume power if the president is revoked during the last two years of his term), would almost surely have showed high disapproval of the government. What to do? It was a burning question since the Venezuelan opposition had already won an ample majority of votes in last year’s parliamentary elections. 
The headquarters of actually-existing Chavism was not going to passively let itself be immolated. First, it worked out a way to slow the opposition’s apparently inexorable advance toward the referendum by having the Supreme Court rule that the twenty percent of the voting population’s signatures needed to go forward with this process should be collected in every one of Venezuela’s twenty-three states. This is something hard, though not impossible, for the opposition to do in states with dispersed populations. 
However, it also worked on another more daring angle: that of claiming that the one-third of fraudulent or questionable signatures in the more than a million and a half signatures already collected to initiate the referendum process should invalidate the whole procedure and require the referendum’s indefinite postponement. 
This latter was a bold and dangerous move. So first the government bloc began testing the ground, by having the invalidation decision confirmed by lower penal courts. It only had the National Electoral Council pronounce once it had secured the support of the head of the military, Vladimir Padrino López. With that key piece in place, it revved up the apparatus’s engines and went barreling into the opposition with the new ruling, smashing up its prospects of a referendum. 
Maduro is an experienced driver and knew that sparks would fly: that there would be yelps about violation of the rule of law, protests, international commotion, etc. Indeed, there was smoke and fire but in the end the Socialist Thunderbird, however clipped in the wings, would be sitting in the middle of the field with almost nothing else budging. 
This is all very interesting and surely worth studying in poli-sci departments worldwide. But is it good for anything except maintaining power? 
The truth is that the left finds itself up against the ropes globally. For that reason, the consensus in Cuba, China and Venezuela today seems to be that one must maintain power and sovereignty at any price. Even if it means smashing up your own apparatus and adopting two-thirds of the program of your enemy. In a radical revision of traditional leftist politics, today’s rebellious governments hope that by preserving a minimally sovereign platform, they will at some later day be able to resume advancing on the social front. 
This is a hope, but it is far from being a certainty. From their celestial repose, Marx and Lenin may be peering down at today’s leftist governments and be genuinely puzzled by their bizarre, even desperate politics. Yet those who have boots on the ground can look to Maduro and recognize that at least he is not doing nothing. Despite a few bruises on his forehead, the President is now humming My Way in a battered machine that undoubtedly dominates the field.",0
10325,America's shrimp imports being injected with dangerous chemicals - just to add weight,"America's shrimp imports being injected with dangerous chemicals - just to add weight 
Sunday, October 30, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: shrimp imports , chemical injections , food fraud (NaturalNews) It seems that the more advanced human civilization becomes, the less we learn about what is and isn't good for our bodies. That's the only way to explain why many commercial food operations are so toxic and hazardous to our health.The UK's Daily Mail is reporting on a commercial shrimp operation in Vietnam where workers have been videotaped injecting them with disgusting gel-like substances in order to make them appear bigger and fresher before they are sold and exported.The video shows factory workers injecting tiger prawns (shrimp) in the head, tail and midsection with a gel substance to make them heavier before they are sold.Vietnam is the largest source of imported shrimp for many countries.The video footage was shot by a Vietnamese television station earlier this year. Since surfacing, it has gone viral online on social media sites like Facebook, with many people expressing disgust and outrage.The substance is often used in food as a thickening agent, in particular for icing. But many people who have watched the video are labeling the Vietnamese factory and its workers as ""shameless"" and dishonest in their attempt to make the shrimp appear bigger and more meaty. In addition, the practice makes one wonder what else is being done to shrimp or other food products, not just in Vietnam, but throughout the region. 'All local shrimp suppliers do this' Environmental protection organization Greenpeace recently released a report titled, ""Dodgy Prawns,"" as an aid for importers of shrimp to find sources that are harvested without using slave labor, methods that are destructive or harmful to ocean ecosystems, or that utilize toxic chemicals.The guide recommended shrimp harvested in and around Australia, but also ""ecologically certified"" black tiger prawns from Vietnam. The organization also warned against all imported vannamei, which very often is sourced from Vietnam, because of concern about mangrove destruction, pollution and the use of invasive species. Natural Blaze , in reporting on the story , noted that workers at the Vietnam shrimp preparation factory in question said they injected the shrimp there because ""all local shrimp suppliers do this.""The site noted further that the largest suppliers of shrimp products in Vietnam import more than half of their raw materials for processing from other countries, including China, which has a well-deserved reputation for unclean, unsanitary food production.In the U.S., about 100 million pounds of shrimp – or about 8 percent of the amount of shrimp Americans consume annually – comes from Vietnam, which in turn gets most of its shrimp from China, where food regulation is a cruel joke. Added weight means additional profits Natural Blaze reported that after about $150 million worth of shrimp was imported into the U.S. from China between January and October 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an import alert in December of that year. The alert warned importers of the ""presence of new animals' drugs and/or unsafe food additives"" in seafood originating in China, and that included shrimp.The Daily Mail said that workers were injecting the shrimp with a substance known as carboxymethyl cellulose, or CMC. Many say it is not considered harmful because it dissolves in water and becomes a smooth liquid before it is then pumped into the shrimp.But obviously CMC is not a naturally-occurring element either, which means shrimp that it is injected into are no longer organic and natural . And the substance has been linked to diarrhea, abdominal cramps, eye pain and irritation, and lingering changes in vision, Natural Blaze noted.And yet its use in food continues. That's because wholesalers and retailers see a bigger profit margin in artificially inflating the size of shrimp that is then sold by weight. And even if retailers aren't doing the injecting, they are knowingly selling a product that has been injected at the source. Sources:",0
10326,"Mike Pence: ‘We Need Every Republican in Congress,’ Every American for Healthcare ‘Battle’","Vice President Mike Pence took the argument for the House Republican Leadership’s “American Health Care Act” to Americans on a warehouse floor in Kentucky on Saturday morning, admitting that there would be a “battle” in Washington, D. C. over the bill and that they “need every Republican in Congress” to get it passed. [Pence called Kentucky “a textbook example of Obamacare’s failures” as he spoke to the crowd of about 100 on the floor of a Harshaw Trane warehouse. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin introduced Pence, and Pence returned praise for Bevin during his speech that centered around the new healthcare bill.  He made the statement after highlighting health insurance woes from around the country like premiums up 25 percent on average around the country in just 2016. He said millions have lost their insurance and their doctors, and he spoke of   of American counties with only one insurance company available to them, “which essentially means they have no choice at all. ” “The Obamacare nightmare is about to end,” Pence promised the Kentucky crowd on Saturday. “Virtually every promise of Obamacare has been broken. ” The vice president detailed premium increases of an average 24 percent last year in Kentucky. He added that some plans spiked more than 47 percent. Pence continued: Nearly half of the state has only one health insurer to choose from and next year, Humana, headquartered right here in Louisville, is pulling out of Kentucky’s Obamacare exchange. Today, one third of the state is on Medicaid, and as your governor has said over and over again, it’s unsustainable, and Medicaid here is Kentucky is threatening to bankrupt this state. Debate over the bill has come from both conservative Republicans and Democrats. House and Senate conservatives have proclaimed that the leadership’s new bill, released on Monday, does not fully repeal and replace the Obamacare plan that Democrats continue to cling to. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Dr. Rand Paul and others, have introduced their own clean repeal and replace bills. President Donald Trump has welcomed discussions for better solutions as his administration has voiced support for the House Republican Leadership bill. Pence publicly thanked Kentucky Congressman Brett Guthrie, who was in attendance, for his strong support for Obamacare repeal and replace. The vice president said that he knows not every politician supports the plan. Kentucky Congressmen Andy Barr was also in attendance. He pledged that the plan would repeal the taxes and individual and employer mandates and penalties of Obamacare. Conservative members of Congress have criticized the House Leadership plan for provisions that they say create new mandates and penalties. Pence said that the House leadership plan will remove 500 billion dollars of Obamacare tax increases. Pence assured that there would be tax credits to help Americans afford health insurance, that   conditions will still be covered, and American adult children can remain on their parents’ health insurance until they are 26. Each have been lauded as popular aspects of Obamacare. He declared that the states will be given freedom and flexibility with Medicaid. Vice President Pence added, “It’s competition between the states that will give the American people better healthcare choices” and “finally allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. ” “The way to lower the price of health insurance is to create a national marketplace and give Americans more choices to buy the insurance they want, not the insurance that the government mandates them to have,” said Pence. “This is going to be a battle in Washington, D. C.,” he resolved. “For us to seize this opportunity to  repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all, we need every Republican in Congress, and we’re counting on Kentucky. ” Pence continued: I want to assure the people of Kentucky who might be looking on this morning. We’re going to work with the Congress and work with our agency at Health and Human Services, and we’re going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system that makes affordable, high quality health insurance available for every American. We’re going to make the best healthcare system in the world even better. Pence went on to laud the president’s plans to cut taxes for working families and small businesses, roll back regulations, and “rebuild America” to provide the best bridges, highways, and airports we have ever had. He highlighted Trump’s concern for the safety and security of Americans, support for law enforcement, and the military. He reassured that the administration is working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get criminal illegal aliens off American streets. The vice president lauded Trump’s choice of Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court of the United States. In the course of the speech, Pence also heralded new jobs numbers that revealed 235, 000 jobs were added in the month of February alone, Trump’s first full month as President of the United States. “This economy is coming back and coming back strong,” said Pence. “We’ve come to a pivotal moment in our nation’s history,” the vice president said as he closed. Pence implored the crowd and all Americans to join in the effort to move the House Republican Leadership plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. “We need every   American to join with us in this effort to Make America Great Again. We need all of you to stand up, speak out, to let your voice be heard. ” “We need you to tell the world that we can do better,” Pence said, referring to health care, a growing economy, and standing tall and strong in the world. “We can restore this country  —   put it back to a path to a brighter future. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.",0

San Francisco, California – It was an agreement four years in the making, oftentimes marred by shouting matches among city hall officials, representatives of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, merchants and homeowners. But the Halloween party in San Francisco’s gay Castro district finally returns in 2014. 
It will be recalled that the Halloween bash attracted as many as 500,000 each year and has become a major tourist attraction, second and third only to the Pride parade and Folsom Street Fair. Stabbing and shooting incidents, believed to be perpetrated by straight revelers, prompted city officials to permanently ban the event beginning in 2010. 
As part of the agreement, the “new” Castro Halloween will be open only to members of the LGBTQ community who will have to register with city hall and be included in a “gay registry.” Registrants, who will take an oath admitting that they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or questioning, will be issued special identification cards linked to the official registry. The IDs will be the only accepted pass to gain entry to the Halloween event. ID’s will be scanned at entrances to the event to confirm that individuals are listed in the official registry.

10330,Objects From New York’s Buried Past Find a New Home in Midtown - The New York Times,"From a   mold used in sugar refining to an oversize oyster, a    spear tip to a   Transferware teapot and a bone from a passenger pigeon, which was once the most abundant bird in North America but was declared extinct in 1914, New York City has cataloged and digitized a vast archive of its buried past. On Wednesday, the Landmarks Preservation Commission is opening the Nan A. Rothschild Research Center, which the commission says is the first municipal archive devoted to a city’s own archaeological collection, a repository in Midtown Manhattan of more than one million artifacts open to researchers and scholars by appointment. A digital archive is already available. In many cases, the objects are portals of discovery into the city’s history, opening hidden doors to untold stories that began  —   or, perhaps, ended  —   with a child’s broken teacup abandoned in Battery Park or a glass seal that identified a wine bottle waiting to be refilled at a local tavern with a family’s favorite vintage. “We’re curating what scholars may want to study and what may be exhibited,” said Amanda Sutphin, the commission’s director of archaeology. The   repository on West 47th Street already contains more than 1, 500 boxes of artifacts from 31 sites that were excavated in all five boroughs. Those sites include the Stadt Huys, now 85 Broad Street in Lower Manhattan, which, in 1979, was the city’s first major historical dig and demonstrated that archaeological treasures might be buried beneath the shallow basements of old buildings. (The Stadt Huys was originally built to relieve William Kieft, the director of what was then known as New Netherland, of the burden of accommodating visitors to his home it later became New Amsterdam’s first City Hall.) That excavation was directed by Nan A. Rothschild, a professor emeritus of anthropology at Barnard College, a member of the faculty of Columbia University, and a cousin of Helena Durst, the chief administrative officer of the Durst Organization, the developer who donated the space for the repository. The repository was named for Dr. Rothschild to honor her contributions to the field. The repository and website are also a collaboration of the Museum of the City of New York the Fund for the City of New York and Iron Mountain, a records and data management company. The digital archive includes images, maps, an education guide and quiz for students, a searchable database, archaeological reports by the landmarks commission and information on which local colleges and universities offer degrees in the field. (A tip for beginners: If you want to sound smart, refer to a piece of broken pottery as a sherd, not a shard.) The repository “contains the city’s material past, although often in fragments,” Dr. Rothschild said. Meenakshi Srinivasan, the commission chairwoman, said, “The everyday objects in the collection reveal what life was like for people who were not documented in the historic record. ” Until they were gathered at the repository, the artifacts were stored at 14 locations, some under reasonably good conditions at Columbia University and Brooklyn College. But some artifacts were unceremoniously stored at a women’s restroom in Van Cortlandt Park. They will now be kept in a   storage area where the contents will be further inventoried. Over time, more will be integrated into the repository, including objects from an excavation at 7 Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan that have been in storage. “These are public projects paid for with public dollars on public land, so the public needs to benefit,” Ms. Sutphin said.",0

Bill Clinton will probably have to avoid Hillary even more than usual after his latest showing on the campaign trail, in which it became clear that it isn’t just his wife that has memory issues. 
Slick Willy was out on the campaign trail on Tuesday, angling to get his lecherous, alleged-rapist butt back in the White House, and apparently he forgot his own criminal business partner wife’s campaign slogan. 
“But we were growing together,” Bill said. “This slampaign slogan of Hillary’s, ‘growing together,’ it’s more than just two words that sound good.” 
That’s not a typo either; according to IJR , Bill called Hillary’s “campaign slogan” a “slampaign slogan,” before mangling Hillary’s already-stupid actual campaign slogan: “Stronger Together.” 
Bill probably shouldn’t use “I’m With Her” either, since he might lapse into, “and her, and her over there, and her right there too.” 
“Stronger Together” is also the name of Hillary’s flop of a book, which I highly doubt Bill bothered to read, although you can’t really blame him for that; he has a hard enough time staying awake when his wife speaks — he must be immune to shrill cackling by now. 
I’m guessing Bill is going to want to stay as far away as he can from Hillary while she likely has one of her infamous “cooling off” periods. Hillary has been widely reported to have a nasty temper , so it’d certainly be wise for Bill to stay far away. 
Hillary can’t be mad for too long though, because it’s likely that she’s going to need Bill to run the White House. Although neither of them appear to be in the greatest health, they can do a great deal of damage between the two of them. 
Bill and Hillary have had a painfully obvious agreement throughout their “married life” to help each other politically. Now it’s Hillary’s turn and she’s surely not going to take too kindly to Bill screwing up her ascendancy. 
No need to worry Hillary, you’re responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, ruining the life of a 12-year-old rape victim, and numerous other crimes and disgusting deeds, so a few memory lapses from Bill won’t affect the election. 
Hillary managed to forget answers nearly 40 times during the FBI investigation into her use of private servers to send and receive classified information as secretary of state, so forgetting a dumb campaign slogan should be no big whoop. 
What would be nice is if Bill’s memory lapses led to a moment of clarity and human decency and he let everyone know where the bodies have been buried during the Clinton mafia’s assault on American politics. Won’t happen though; we can’t have nice things…",0
10334,Analysts: Geert Wilders Force to be Reckoned With After Dutch Elections,"THE HAGUE (AFP)  —   Geert Wilders may have been beaten into second place in the Dutch elections but the   MP will enjoy a magnified role in parliament and remain a force to be reckoned with, analysts said. [While he failed in his aim of starting a “patriotic revolution,” Wilders has already succeeded in shifting the debate and the tone in Dutch politics on immigration and integration, observers said.  Campaigning on an   ticket, the   politician saw his hopes wilt from an   high in January when opinion polls had said he could win as many as 37 seats in the   Dutch lower chamber. Instead, he captured a more sobering 20 seats in Wednesday’s general elections, behind the 33 won by the Liberal party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte, but enough to place his Freedom Party (PVV) second. “It would have been great if we were the largest, but we’re willing to talk and help govern. That’s my hope,” Wilders told journalists Thursday. But he warned his party would “show our hard opposition side” if he were excluded. The long process to form the next government has begun with the VVD sounding out other parties to try to cobble together a coalition. Most parties leaders, including Rutte, have already vowed not to work with Wilders, alienated by his fiery     rhetoric, and his    attitude.  —   Long shadow  —   But analysts say Wilders, who quit the VVD in 2006 to set up his party, will continue to cast a long shadow across the Dutch political landscape and has already succeeded in pulling the lowlands country to the right. “What’s telling is that many parties, including Rutte’s VVD, have already taken on some of the PVV’s viewpoints and content  …     particularly when it comes to immigration policies,” said Matthijs Rooduijn, a political sociologist at Utrecht University. “That doesn’t mean that parties like the VVD  …     suddenly moved to the   but there certainly is a shift in that direction,” he said. “Most parties have become more nationalist and that’s because of the PVV’s influence,” he said. With Wilders likely to end up the largest party in opposition, more clashes are also forecast, such as with rising young   star Jesse Klaver, whose GroenLinks party upped their seats from four to 14. Wilders will also likely lock horns with the progressive leader of Democracy party D66, Alexander Pechtold, which the PVV beat into third place with 19 seats. Should D66 or GroenLinks enter government with Rutte “the clash is going to continue when it comes to social and cultural topics. And the sparks are going to fly,” Rooduijn said.  —   ‘Bland political elites’  —   Wilders, who already triggered the collapse of one Rutte government in 2012, could also seek to exploit the fragmented nature of the next coalition which will be made up of at least four and maybe five parties, Rooduijn said. “He could argue the new cabinet is making too many compromises and   deals  —   it will give him extra ammunition for his populist message that there’s a bland political elite who still won’t listen to voters’ concerns,” he said. “The outcome of this election does not at all mean the end of Geert Wilders and the issues that he is advocating,” said Claes de Vreese, politics professor at the University of Amsterdam. “He remains an important force in Dutch and European politics. He had more votes and increased his number of seats, even though it was not this ‘people’s revolution’ that he was claiming. ” Wilders was hailed by European   leaders too, ahead of other key elections in France and Germany this year, who said his polls performance was far from a defeat. His success “proves that the ideas we share are advancing in the various European countries,” said Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s National Front, who is hoping to upset the French presidential elections. “Ignore the froth: whilst the establishment did cling on, they took a beating at this election,” wrote the new   British blog Westmonster. Wilders’s notoriety has already spread across the Atlantic. Trevor Noah, who hosts the popular US late night programme “The Daily Show” gave Wilders and his “hateful” message a roasting Thursday, comparing his blond mesh to Donald Trump, and likening him to a blond villan played by the actor Christopher Walken’s in “Batman Returns. ”",0

C.E. Dyer reports a so-called Christian humanist said one of the most ignorant and dangerous things that has probably ever been said regarding radical Islam and Christianity — that fundamentalist Christianity is more dangerous than radical Islam. 
The Chicago Maroon reported : 
A leading humanist scholar stressed symbolic Bible reading and warned of the radical right at a talk on Tuesday at the Seminary Co-Op. 
For Catherine M. Wallace, faculty member at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine and author of the recently concluded book series Christian Humanism and the Moral Imagination , the Christian fundamentalist movement in the United States is more dangerous than Islamic terrorism. Wallace, a Christian herself, believes fundamentalist access to United States armaments is the number one threat to state security. 
Wallace said, “If [anything Islamic] wanted to attack an American city, they had to hijack an airliner. If they want to blow up a concert, they need to put bombs on their own children and send young men in to kill themselves… that kind of radicalism [Christian fundamentalism] in control of nuclear codes was a much, much greater threat.” 
“The religious right in its most contemporary form has an origin in Southern opposition to desegregation and to the Civil Rights Movement… a transparently racist appeal,” her ignorant interpretation of the “religious right” continued. 
Wallace claimed that the literal interpretation of the Bible is problematic and that “nobody in the ancient world would have read the Bible literally.” She added that, “Christian fundamentalism is a malignant form of Christianity.” 
This is what passes for a scholar in America. Scary, isn’t it? Even scarier than that is what radical Islamists are doing around the world. 
Beheading, rape, crucifixion, torture, and more are all being carried out by radical Islamists around the world, but that can’t get in the way of the liberal attempt to tear down Christianity in America. 
See, people like Wallace can get away with this kind of pseudo-intellectual garbage because fundamental Christians are nowhere near as bad as radical Islamists, and even people like Wallace probably know that on some level. 
I doubt Wallace is going to take a flight to the Middle East and try to have a discussion with radical Islamists about how abhorrent their interpretation of Islam is, because she wouldn’t last too long. 
Now, Wallace might argue that she was talking about the threat in this country, but that doesn’t hold water. Radical Islam is coming to America and is already here. There are radicalized mosques in this country that we can’t properly monitor because of political correctness. 
Hey, maybe Wallace should have her next conversation at one of the radicalized mosques in this country and see how that goes over. Good luck!",0
10337,Fabio’s Advice to Americans: ’Don’t Ever Give up Your Guns’,"Based on his experiences living in Europe and the “  ” problems now being committed in the name of liberalism in California, model and actor Fabio warns Americans, “Don’t ever give up your guns. ”[He suggests liberals have divided people and are using the split to push their   agenda. He said, “The current division in the country only makes politicians stronger. When people are divided, the politicians can do whatever. When people are united, that’s a dangerous thing. ”  According to LifeZette, Fabio recalled arriving in America for the first time, saying, “It was like a beautiful dream. It was like paradise. I fell in love with this country. ” But he has watched sweeping change occur under Democrats like Governor Jerry Brown, and he indicates that the change favors criminals while leaving police “demoralized. ” He said, “It’s a disaster. It’s an epidemic. I’ve been around the world. I’ve been to Africa. Everywhere. Downtown Los Angeles now looks like a   country. ” Fabio said LA is is full of “  streets and sidewalks” and also has “  ” crime and homeless problems. And he warned that things are going to get worse because of Proposition 57. Fabio said that proposition was ubiquitously promoted to save money by releasing “nonviolent” criminals from prison, but he says Prop. 57 has actually resulted in a reduction in sentences for “human trafficking involving sex with minors, assault with a deadly weapon, attempting to explode a bomb in a school or hospital, discharging a firearm on school guards, failing to register as a sex offender   …     the list goes on and on and on. ” Fabio said, “Just look at Europe and go the opposite way. It’s as simple as that. Europe already jumped off the cliff. They are doomed. ” He added: Don’t you ever give up your guns. If people lose that right, forget about it. Politicians  —   they will take everything away from you. And then what are you going to do, protest with a rock? Because that’s what they do in Europe.

10338,"Twitter Announces Censoring Search Results, ’Low-Quality Tweets’ to Combat ’Abuse and Harassment’ - Breitbart","Twitter has officially announced three new changes to the platform in their latest effort to combat “abuse and harassment. ”[The changes include extra measures to stop suspended users from creating new accounts, “safer search results,” and the collapsing of “potentially abusive or   Tweets. ”  “Making Twitter a safer place is our primary focus,” claimed the company in a blog post update on Tuesday. “We stand for freedom of expression and people being able to see all sides of any topic. That’s put in jeopardy when abuse and harassment stifle and silence those voices. We won’t tolerate it and we’re launching new efforts to stop it. ” “Building on the work we began in November, we’re continuing to work on ways to give people more control over what they see on Twitter,” they continued. “Last week, we introduced an improvement to reporting abusive Tweets that gives people experiencing targeted harassment more ways to report it. Today, we’re announcing three changes: stopping the creation of new abusive accounts, bringing forward safer search results, and collapsing potentially abusive or   Tweets. ” “Safer search results” will work by removing “sensitive” tweets and tweets from blocked and muted users from your searches on the platform, while their new collapsing system will hide a large quantity of replies on your tweets. Twitter does not explain what qualifies a tweet for being deemed “sensitive,” and while it says “this type of content will be discoverable if you want to find it,” it doesn’t say how since “it won’t clutter search results any longer. ” Twitter has also not yet explained how they will combat the creation of new accounts from suspended users. “In the days and weeks ahead, we will continue to roll out product changes  —   some changes will be visible and some less so  —   and will update you on progress every step of the way,” concluded Twitter in their post. “With every change, we’ll learn, iterate, and continue to move at this speed until we’ve made a significant impact that people can feel. ” The platform has introduced numerous other attempts to combat “harassment” and “hate speech” over the past few years, including a word filtering tool inspired by the   Twitter alternative Gab. Twitter, who recently donated $1. 6 million to the ACLU, has repeatedly been accused of censoring conservative and libertarian accounts over the past few years, with numerous   users having been permanently suspended from the platform. Breitbart Senior Editor MILO, Pharmaceutical Entrepreneur Martin Shkreli, and rapper Azealia Banks have all been permanently suspended from the platform, while others have been temporarily suspended following political remarks. Despite the sanctioning of   accounts, numerous abusive users have been allowed to stay on Twitter. In July, Twitter refused to sanction an account that sexually harassed and sent violent threats to a female Breitbart News contributor, while rapper Talib Kweli was able to repeatedly call numerous black conservatives “coons,” including Breitbart’s Jerome Hudson, Sheriff David Clarke, and   activist Maajid Nawaz, without suspension. Threats against the president have also been repeatedly allowed on Twitter, with over 12, 000 tweets calling for the assassination of President Trump having been made since he took office on January 20.

BCRP: ¿economistas mudos ante ejercicio ilegal de la profesión? por Julio César Alba Bravo Socios | 2 de noviembre de 2016 BCRP: ¿economistas mudos ante ejercicio ilegal de la profesión? ¡Qué pintoresco nuestro Congreso! Las prácticas del franeleo, el reino de la informalidad, el descalabro del sistema jurídico, la dictadura de la necedad. En fin, el paraíso del subdesarrollo.
Los irresponsables congresistas que llenaron el BCR de mediocridad quizá no sabían que:
1. En cuanto los señores Chlimper y Rey se sienten en una butaca del BCR, tendrán altas posibilidades de ser acusados de “Ejercicio Ilegal de la Profesión”. Expliquemos:
2. Existe un mandato constitucional (Art. 20) que prescribe la Colegiatura para ejercer determinada actividad profesional. Por su parte, el Código Penal (Art.363) castiga con severas sanciones el “Ejercicio Ilegal de la Profesión” (léase prácticas profesionales sin contar con título y/o sin colegiatura). Las penalidades se hacen extensivas a quienes nombran al ciudadano bendecido por la simpatía del poderoso.
3. Ahora bien, para acceder a la colegiatura y desempeñar determinados cargos de evidente especialidad, las leyes 15488 y 24531 señalan con claridad meridiana las condiciones obligatorias que deben satisfacer quienes se desempeñan en la conducción económica del país. Esto en añadidura a lo que especifica la Ley Orgánica del BCR, que en los casos de Chlimper y Rey ha sido groseramente violentada.
4. Los defensores de la pareja fujimorista alegan que anteriormente han desempeñado cargos similares otros funcionarios sin especialidad titulada y, por tanto, sin colegiatura profesional. Citan varios personajes que supieron acomodarse a las circunstancias, y cerraron los ojos a la informalidad que cometían con la complicidad de politicastros de turno. Aceptar estos peregrinos argumentos significaría convivir cómodamente con la más grosera ilegalidad y admitir que la costumbre genera derecho por encima de la Constitución, las leyes y demás ornamentos inútiles que exhibe nuestra inefable República.
Ignoran que la economía monetaria es una disciplina que los jóvenes aspirantes a economistas califican como “muy tranca”, como para que amateurs como Rey digan que aprenderán rápido. En el caso del otro fujimorista, conviene remarcar que un desempeño impecable en el BCR va mucho mas allá de asistir a un Directorio y firmar sin leer ni entender. Una buena performance es mucho más que un lobbysmo puro y duro.
Ante tamaños antecedentes, el que escribe, un modesto economista, voy a intentar sanar enfermos y construir edificios sin preocuparme de leyes, especialidades, colegiaturas y demás sandeces. Como en Perú la ilegalidad es entusiastamente recompensada, y la informalidad es nuestro lema, no importará qué les suceda a mis clientes y pacientes. Firmaré planos e intentaré sanar el cáncer, sacándoles la lengua a los decanos de los Colegios de Ingenieros y de Médicos.
A propósito, ¿qué hace el relajado decano de los economistas? No hace nada y su pasividad seguramente la justificará diciendo que hace más de 40 años y mil funcionarios la ley no se aplicó para nada, así que “no jodan”.

10340,"Wilbur Ross, a Billionaire Investor, Is Confirmed as Commerce Secretary - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor, as commerce secretary on Monday, installing a key leader for the Trump administration’s plans to overhaul trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. By a vote of 72 to 27, the Senate confirmed Mr. Ross, who has already been advising President Trump on economic policy and helping him to craft ways to rewrite the tax code. A renegotiation of Nafta is expected to be Mr. Ross’s top priority when he takes over the job. During his confirmation hearing in January, he warned that “all aspects” of the agreement between the United States and its northern and southern neighbors are on the table. With the confirmation of Mr. Ross, the most important members of Mr. Trump’s economic team are in place just in time for looming fights over the budget, health care and tax legislation. Compared with some of Mr. Trump’s other cabinet picks, Mr. Ross had his confirmation process move ahead with relative ease. He faced less resistance from Democrats than Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Andrew F. Puzder, whose nomination to lead the Labor Department was derailed. A former Democrat, Mr. Ross, 79, divested a significant portion of his holdings to avoid conflicts of interest before taking the helm of the Commerce Department. He also tried to temper some of Mr. Trump’s views on trade, attempting to ease concerns that the United States is going to be engaging in trade wars. “I am   but I am   trade,” Mr. Ross declared at his confirmation hearing. But he takes the job with lingering questions about how his business experience will mesh with Mr. Trump’s “America First” trade agenda. As a private equity investor, Mr. Ross amassed a fortune by taking advantage of trade deals with countries such as China and Mexico. He sent jobs to Mexico when he was the head of a car parts company, benefiting from some of the Nafta provisions that he will most likely be looking to unwind. And he is maintaining a minority stake in a company backed by the Chinese government. Mr. Ross has said that he wants to use his knowledge of the global economy to help improve the fortunes of   and   Americans. He said last summer that he was attracted to Mr. Trump as a candidate because he believed that the country needed a “more radical, new approach to government. ” The appointment of Mr. Ross fulfills Mr. Trump’s promise to stock his cabinet with proven dealmakers. But it also opens the president up to criticism that he has veered away from his vows of populism by surrounding himself with plutocrats. Democrats have assailed Mr. Trump for assembling the wealthiest cabinet in American history, and on Monday they did not let up. “Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote  on Twitter. On the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, accused Mr. Ross of having questionable business ties to Russia. He said Mr. Ross and the Trump administration had failed to be forthcoming about the matter and described it as a troubling pattern. “This is just another example of this administration abandoning transparency and trying to jam nominees through,” Mr. Schumer said. “This is another black mark on this nation’s administration. ” Mr. Ross is set to be sworn in on Tuesday at the White House. The Senate was also holding a cloture vote on Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, Mr. Trump’s nominee for interior secretary. A full vote is expected for Mr. Zinke later this week.",0

10342,U.N. Security Council Condemns Attacks on Health Workers in War Zones - The New York Times,"Warplanes level a hospital in the   half of Aleppo, Syria, killing one of the city’s last pediatricians. A   military coalition bombs a hospital in Yemen. In Afghanistan, American aircraft pummel a hospital mistaken for a Taliban redoubt. The rules of war, enshrined for decades, require hospitals to be treated as sanctuaries from war  —   and for health workers to be left alone to do their jobs. But on today’s battlefields, attacks on hospitals and ambulances, surgeons, nurses and midwives have become common, punctuating what aid workers and United Nations officials describe as a new low in the savagery of war. On Tuesday, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution to remind warring parties everywhere of the rules, demanding protection for those who provide health care and accountability for violators. The measure urged member states to conduct independent investigations and prosecute those found responsible for violations “in accordance with domestic and international law. ” But the resolution also raised an awkward question: Can the world’s most powerful countries be expected to enforce the rules when they and their allies are accused of flouting them? Russian warplanes were blamed for the bombing of Syrian health centers, for instance, and Syrian soldiers, backed by the Kremlin, continue to remove lifesaving medicines, even painkillers, from United Nations aid convoys heading into   areas. At the same time, Britain and the United States back a   coalition that is accused of attacking health facilities in Yemen. China and Russia support the government of Sudan, which is accused of at least two attacks on health facilities supported by Doctors Without Borders, the international medical charity, in Kordofan State. From the charity’s international president, Dr. Joanne Liu, seated at the Security Council’s   table, came the sharpest rebuke to the Council’s five permanent,   members. “You therefore must live up to your extraordinary responsibilities, and set an example for all states,” she said. “I repeat: Stop these attacks. ” Without naming the countries, she criticized the United States  —   for having refused to submit the American attack in October on her organization’s hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, to an independent international inquiry  —   just as she scolded Russia for having denied that its warplanes had hit civilian targets in Syria. “Broad attacks on communities and precise attacks on health facilities are described as mistakes, are denied outright or are simply met with silence,” she said. Just hours before, a maternity hospital was  hit in Aleppo, on the   side. Syrian state news media reported fatalities and heavy damage at the hospital and blamed insurgent shelling. Last Wednesday, airstrikes believed to have been carried out by the Syrian government demolished a hospital in the   portion of Aleppo, killing dozens of people including one of the city’s last pediatricians. There is plenty of blame to go around. In 11 of the world’s war zones, between 2011 and 2014, the International Committee of the Red Cross tallied nearly 2, 400 acts of violence against those who were trying to provide health care. That works out to two attacks a day. Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who attended the Security Council vote, commended members for what he called a “strong” resolution, even if only to remind combatants of longstanding rules of war. He warned members not to grow accustomed to attacks on hospitals and ambulances. “These are not sad realities we have to get used to,” he said. “They are abominations to fight and trends to roll back. ” The United States said it had punished the American soldiers implicated in the Kunduz hospital bombing. Russia said it could not “corroborate accusations leveled” against Russian forces in Syria. That the resolution only echoed rules laid out decades ago was not lost on one of its main proponents, Gerard van Bohemen, the ambassador of New Zealand. “These legal requirements already exist,” he said. “Some are among the oldest rules of international humanitarian law. The problem is one of respect and compliance. ” There have been   attacks on health workers in the past. Serbian troops stormed a hospital in the Croatian town of Vukovar in 1991, removed several hundred patients and executed them. Sri Lankan forces were accused of attacking hospitals in the Tamil   towns of the north in 2008 and 2009, during the last few months of the civil war in that country. In Pakistan, Taliban militants have assassinated dozens of health workers trying to vaccinate children against polio. Targeting a medical facility is considered a war crime, if proved to be deliberate. That is a difficult legal hurdle, and few prosecutions have been made against warring parties accused of attacking hospitals and health workers. The Pentagon has said that the strike on the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz in October was unintentional. British and American officials have increasingly publicly urged their allies in the   coalition waging war in Yemen to abide by international law, though they have not called for international inquiries into possible rights violations in Yemen as they have in Syria. A United Nations panel of experts has documented what it described as “widespread” breaches, pointing to airstrikes by the   coalition as well as shelling of health facilities by Houthi rebels. In Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East, a fourth of all health care facilities were destroyed or shuttered in one year of war, according to the United Nations. Saudi Arabia was among the   of the Security Council resolution, which was delicately worded. Drafted by Egypt, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and Uruguay, it avoids a direct reference to possible prosecutions by the International Criminal Court, a delicate topic for some countries. But the resolution cites the statute that created the court, condemns the “prevailing impunity” for attacks on health centers and calls on governments to carry out independent investigations. It also demands that armed combatants allow unimpeded access to health workers. Those demands have been repeatedly made in Syria  —   and been ignored. Millions of people living in besieged and    areas have no access to medicines.",0

10344,N.F.L. Says Officials Missed Head Hit on Panthers’ Cam Newton - The New York Times,"The N. F. L. has determined that a penalty should have been called against a Denver Broncos linebacker after his    hit against Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton in the third quarter of Thursday night’s game, which opened the football season. Dean Blandino, the league’s chief of officiating, said that officials on the field had erred in not penalizing the linebacker, Brandon Marshall, for roughing the passer in the third quarter. The acknowledgment came as the league continued to combat the perception that it was not doing enough to protect players from hits that could lead to head trauma. In recent years, the league has added neurotrauma specialists in the press box and on the sideline to decide whether a player should be taken out of a game. On Thursday, in a nationally televised rematch of last year’s Super Bowl, the Broncos hit Newton in the head at least four times. The league determined one of the hits was not illegal because Newton was out of the pocket. Another hit was not illegal because the defender, Von Miller, was grappling with a blocker while Newton was being sacked. Marshall’s hit, though, should have drawn a flag, the league said. Newton, though, was not taken out. In a statement, the league said that medical personnel on the Panthers’ sideline, including the neurotrauma specialist and two independent athletic trainers in the press box, had communicated after the hit and that the neurotrauma specialist and team physician had reviewed video of the play. “They concluded there were no indications of a concussion that would require further evaluation and the removal of the player from the game,” the league said. A fourth hit, by Darian Stewart in the fourth quarter, did draw a penalty, but an   call against Newton offset that penalty. Newton, the league’s most valuable player last season, shrugged it off. “It’s not my job to question the officials,” he said. “I really like this officiating crew, so I know it wasn’t something they did intentionally. But it’s not fun to get hit in the head. ” The reaction to the hits was quick and clear. Scott Fowler, a columnist at The Charlotte Observer, said he was “furious” that Newton had not been taken off the field to be examined after being hit in the head. Cecil Newton, Cam’s father, criticized the officials for failing to penalize the Broncos. “I think the culprit is the mere fact that they allowed the game to get out of control,” he told ESPN. “They allowed players to push the envelope to the very edge. ” In a story on the hits, The Ringer ran a headline that read, “It’s Getting Harder and Harder to Deny That Football Is Doomed. ” Hyperbole aside, the N. F. L. will continue to struggle to find a balance between keeping players safe and not destroying the flow of games, which are already burdened with challenges, video reviews and a blizzard of television timeouts. The league will always face pressure to make the game safer, but also to try to appease players and coaches, as well as fans, who do not want to see the action on the field diluted. “In a way, the Cam Newton situation is the latest example to personify how tough it is for the N. F. L. to figure this out going forward,” said Lee Igel, an associate in the medical ethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center and a clinical associate professor of sports ethics at the NYU School of Professional Studies. “It’s medical interests versus business interests. Because there are enough different factors weighing in, it looks unsolvable. ” Last season, the league was criticized after several players were not removed from games even after being hit so severely they had trouble standing up. In one case, Case Keenum, a quarterback for the Rams, hit his head on the turf. A team trainer ran onto the field to look at him but returned to the sideline without removing him from the game. Only after the game did the Rams test Keenum to see whether he had sustained a concussion, and it was confirmed that he had. In addition to the challenges of diagnosing a concussion in the middle of a game, players are often reluctant to admit they are hurt, and unwilling to go to the sideline to be evaluated. Coaches, too, can be reluctant to remove their best players, particularly at key junctures in the game. To reduce the chance of that happening, the league this summer said that it would fine teams hundreds of thousands of dollars and possibly take away their draft picks if they failed to take players out of games after the players had sustained concussions. Troy Vincent, the N. F. L. executive vice president for football operations, this week highlighted the dangers of head hits on Twitter, noting that “it’s illegal to use the crown of the helmet to tackle. ”",0
10345,Kansas City Man Freed After 17 Years in Prison When His Doppelganger Is Found,"A Kansas City man was released after serving 17 years in jail for a robbery he didn’t commit when a man, who looked so much like him they could be twins, was finally discovered and brought to the court’s attention. [Richard Anthony Jones was convicted of a Roeland Park robbery committed in 1999, but since the first day he was arrested, Jones claimed he was innocent of the crime. While serving time in prison, he began hearing from other prisoners that he bore a striking resemblance to another known criminal.  After years of pleading his case, Jones, who was convicted solely on eyewitness testimony, finally received help from the Innocence Project who believed him enough to begin looking into the claim of a doppelganger who may have been the real culprit, the Kansas City Star reported. Jones’s lawyers investigated the prisoner’s story and believed they found the man everyone said looked so much like their client that they could pass as the same person. “We were floored by how much they looked alike,” said Jones’s attorney Alice Craig of seeing the other man who some believe committed the crime instead of Jones. The legal team then contacted the victim from the robbery to look at photos of the two men   . Photos of the two men show each with braided hair and a   goatee. The two look so similar that they could easily be mistaken as two photos of the same man. The victim agreed that she could not tell the two men apart and could now not be sure of her    testimony. Jones was arrested in 1999 after the victim picked him out of a police photo database. But Jones’s lawyers maintain that the police acted in a “highly suggestive” manner because Jones was the only suspect in the photo group shown to the victim who looked anything like the description the victim gave. Ultimately, Johnson County District Judge Kevin Moriarty ordered Jones’s release based on the new evidence. Further investigation revealed that the other man, known as “Ricky,” also lived very near the victim in 1999. The now released man was said to be angry for years about his incarceration, but when he looked at the photo of his doppelganger, even he had to admit that it was an easy mistake to make.

10346,"South Carolina Man May Be Linked to 7 Killings, Authorities Say - The New York Times","A South Carolina man charged in the kidnapping of a woman found alive in a storage container confessed on Saturday to the unsolved killings of four people in 2003, and may be linked to a total of seven deaths, the authorities said. Late on Saturday, the Spartanburg County sheriff, Chuck Wright, said that a body found in a shallow grave the day before was that of Charles D. Carver, 32, the boyfriend of the rescued woman, The Associated Press reported. He died of gunshot wounds, Sheriff Wright said. Todd C. Kohlhepp, 45, the owner of the property and a registered sex offender, has been charged with kidnapping the woman, Kala V. Brown, who disappeared along with Mr. Carver in late August. Investigators had been sweeping the   woods and fields with cadaver dogs after finding Ms. Brown inside a storage container on the property, about 20 miles east of Greenville, S. C. The sheriff said there were indications that two other bodies might be buried on the property. In a stunning twist that drew gasps at a news conference, Sheriff Wright said Mr. Kohlhepp had confessed on Saturday to a quadruple homicide on Nov. 6, 2003. The police said four people were killed at the Superbike Motorsports shop in Chesnee, S. C.: Scott Ponder, 30 Beverly Guy, 52, his mother, who worked there part time and Brian Lucas, 29, and Chris Sherbert, 26, who were employees, The Greenville News reported. Sheriff Wright said Mr. Kohlhepp “told us some stuff that nobody ought to know” about the killings. He described Mr. Kohlhepp as “very cooperative. ” He added: “I’m rejoicing that our community can know that four people who were brutally murdered  —   there’s no wondering about it anymore. ” Four murder warrants were signed in connection with the killings in the shop, and a murder charge was pending in the case of Mr. Carver, Sheriff Wright said. The case began to unfold when deputies heard Ms. Brown, 30, banging from inside a storage container on Thursday. At a hearing on Friday during which Mr. Kohlhepp was denied bond, the prosecutor, Barry Barnette, said Ms. Brown had told investigators she saw Mr. Kohlhepp shoot Mr. Carver. Ms. Brown also told the authorities that there might be four people buried on the property, Sheriff Wright said. He added that missing persons’ cases were being reopened in light of the revelations. He said investigators would continue to search other properties owned by Mr. Kohlhepp. Mr. Barnette told Magistrate Judge Daniel R. Burns of Spartanburg County that officials had found “numerous guns, assault rifles, two   handguns with silencers on them” and “rounds of ammo. ” “It’s unbelievable how much he had out there,” Mr. Barnette said. “This individual is a very, very dangerous individual. ” Sheriff Wright said the authorities were also looking for clues online to shed light on what he said had not been a “random act” of kidnapping. The disappearance of Mr. Carver and Ms. Brown had taken a strange turn last month when friends and family noticed that their Facebook accounts had suddenly become active, updated with posts they did not believe had been written by the couple, The Daily Beast reported. On Friday, Sheriff Wright told reporters that investigators were trying to figure out whether Mr. Kohlhepp or another person had published the posts. Mr. Kohlhepp, of Moore, S. C. sold real estate and had a landscaping business, Sheriff Wright said. He was convicted at age 15 in Arizona in the kidnapping and rape of a    girl at gunpoint, Mr. Barnette told the court.",0
10347,Push by ‘John Doe’ to Block Release of List Adds Mystery in New Jersey Bridge Scandal - The New York Times,"Add another mystery to the murky case of the disappearing traffic lanes at the George Washington Bridge: Who is John Doe and why is he putting up such a struggle to shield his identity? A man known only by that alias has hired a lawyer from a prominent Manhattan firm to plead with two federal courts in five days to keep his name out of the impending prosecution of the alleged criminal conspiracy known broadly as Bridgegate. So far, he is winning the fight for anonymity. On Tuesday, an appellate court in Philadelphia blocked the scheduled release of a list of people who prosecutors believe were somehow involved in the scheme to tie up traffic at the New Jersey end of the bridge in September 2013. The court set a hearing on John Doe’s appeal for June 6. So, the riddle of John Doe’s identity and motivation will keep the politically curious guessing for a few more weeks, at the least. Who, they wondered, could have played a notable role in the highly publicized scheme and still hope to avoid being linked to it? And why did he wait until the eve of the scheduled release of the list of “unindicted  ” to try to suppress it? “There are no coincidences in New Jersey politics,” said John S. Wisniewski, a Democratic state assemblyman who was   of a legislative committee that investigated the   scheme. “I’m certain that there is an important reason for whoever John Doe is to have retained counsel, a reason that only recently came up. ” Whoever he is, Mr. Wisniewski said, John Doe had the resources and connections to hire Jenny Kramer, a former federal prosecutor who is now with the Chadbourne  Parke law firm. Ms. Kramer filed a motion in federal court in Newark last week, arguing that her client would be “publicly branded a felon” by his inclusion on the list, even though he has not been charged with a crime. Prosecutors have not said how many names are on the list, but they have obtained indictments against only three former allies of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, suspected of plotting to tie up traffic in Fort Lee, N. J. They contend that the three  —   Bill Baroni, David Wildstein and Bridget Anne Kelly  —   sought to punish the borough’s mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Mr. Christie for   in 2013. Mr. Baroni was the governor’s top executive appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge. Mr. Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy last May, was a deputy to Mr. Baroni at the agency. Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly, who was a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, are scheduled to stand trial in September on nine counts, including conspiracy to commit fraud. Mr. Wildstein has stated that there is evidence that Mr. Christie knew about the scheme while it was being carried out, but the governor has said he found out about it afterward and quickly informed the public. Unless those denials have been refuted by prosecutors, Mr. Wisniewski said, “it probably is unlikely that the governor is on this list. ” He declined to speculate about John Doe’s identity, but trying to puzzle it out has been something of a parlor game among those who have continued to follow the case. Holly Schepisi, a Republican state assemblywoman who was on the committee with Mr. Wisniewski, called it a “Bridgegate fantasy league” that had people swapping rosters of possibilities and wishes. “There are some people out there who still hold out hope, for whatever diabolical reason, that John Doe is somebody very senior,” Ms. Schepisi said. Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science at Montclair State University, said in an interview on Tuesday that there was “widespread speculation” that John Doe could be Mr. Christie. “It is someone who has an enormous amount to lose,” Ms. Harrison said. “Who has the most to lose?” Ms. Harrison noted that Donald J. Trump, the Republican candidate for president, was scheduled to attend a rally in New Jersey on Thursday that will raise money to pay for Mr. Christie’s aborted presidential campaign. “So there is at least some advantage he has gained from the delay of this,” she said, referring to the governor. But Assemblywoman Schepisi said she was reasonably certain that John Doe was not Mr. Christie, but another current or former public official or government employee. Beyond that, she said, she had heard plenty of guesses, but “everybody’s speculating. ” Susan Wigenton, the judge in the United States District Court in Newark who denied John Doe’s motion to keep the list confidential, said that the public’s right to know outweighed the interests of privacy of the people on the list, for “whom the government has sufficient evidence to designate as having joined the conspiracy. ” Ms. Schepisi said she thought John Doe had a strong argument against being implicated in a conspiracy without being charged and having a chance to defend himself. She said she imagined he had good reason to want to keep his presence on that list a secret. “When people hear the phrase ‘unindicted ’ the implication is no longer, unfortunately, O. K. you didn’t commit a crime it is, you very probably did something criminal and somehow you skated,” Ms. Schepisi said. “It’s like having a big scarlet letter put across your chest for the rest of your life. ”",0
10348,"Election Recount, Fidel Castro: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald Trump was criticized from across the political spectrum for his baseless claim on Twitter that he lost the popular vote because millions cast ballots illegally. California’s top election official called the allegations absurd and said Mr. Trump’s “reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming. ” Mr. Trump made the claim after Hillary Clinton’s campaign agreed to participate in a recount effort in Wisconsin and possibly two other states. ____ 2. Mr. Trump has resumed holding transition meetings at his headquarters in New York, Trump Tower, which has been heavily fortified as a kind of White House North. As suspense continued over whether Mitt Romney would be chosen for secretary of state, Mr. Trump set up meetings with two other possibilities: the retired Gen. David Petraeus, above, and Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. We took a close look at Steve Bannon, the incendiary figure whom Mr. Trump appointed as chief White House strategist. Mr. Bannon once told a colleague that Mr. Trump was an “imperfect vessel” for the revolution he had in mind. But they bonded anyway. ____ 3. Cuba began nine days of mourning for Fidel Castro, only to be jarred by Mr. Trump’s threat on Twitter to “terminate deal” to normalize diplomatic relations. It is now up to Fidel’s brother, Raúl Castro, who assumed presidential powers in 2006, to steer the country. Their sister, an outspoken critic of Fidel Castro living in Miami, had not spoken to him in decades but was nonetheless upset by exiles’ celebrations of his death. Here’s our full obituary of Fidel Castro. ____ 4. Syrian rebels lost a large stretch of territory in the city of Aleppo to government forces and Kurdish fighters, a possible turning point in the grinding civil war. Residents described horrifying scenes of people being killed by shells as they searched for shelter. They said it was the heaviest bombardment yet in years of war. “It’s like doomsday,” one activist said. ____ 5. Nine people were injured on the campus of Ohio State University when a student drove his car onto the sidewalk and then stabbed several people with a butcher knife. The attacker, identified as Abdul Artan, 18, was shot dead within about a minute by a campus police officer. ____ 6. A federal judge granted Dylann Storm Roof’s request to represent himself in his capital trial on charges of killing nine   churchgoers in Charleston, S. C. That means the avowed white supremacist could   survivors of the massacre and family members of the dead. Mr. Roof has offered to plead guilty to the 33 charges against him in exchange for a life sentence. ____ 7. Officials in sanctuary cities across the country are gearing up to oppose Mr. Trump if he follows through on his campaign promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants. They say they will continue to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents. In doing so, they risk losing federal funding. “We are not going to use our resources to enforce what we believe are unjust immigration laws,” the mayor of Oakland, Calif. said. ____ 8. In the coal country of West Virginia, where Mr. Trump pummeled Mrs. Clinton, Appalachians are eyeing Washington with a feeling they have not had in years: hope. That’s despite the predictions that coal will never come back and that the only way to revive the economy is to diversify it. “I don’t think he can ever fulfill all the promises he made even in four or eight years,” said one man who lost his job at a coal company last year. “But I think we’re headed in the right direction. ” ___ 9. A Cold War battle playing out in Lower Manhattan for the last three weeks  —   through the medium of chess  —   will last another game. Sergey Karjakin, a Russian, left, and Magnus Carlsen, a Norwegian and the defending world champion, ended the final regulation game in the    World Chess Championship in a draw. They will meet again to try to break the tie on Wednesday. ___ 10. Finally, what’s worth watching tonight? Our answer: Two HBO documentaries that capture Cuba on the brink of change (good time to watch!) and “Don’t Look Back,” D. A. Pennebaker’s chronicle of Bob Dylan’s 1965 British concert tour, which is streaming on Filmstruck. ___ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

C.E. Dyer writes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are generous people — that is, generous toward themselves. 
The Clintons are probably the world’s most famous grifters and the Clinton Farce Foundation has proven to be a great cover for them. 
Bill and Hillary gave $1,042,000 to charity according to their tax return and $1 million of that went to, you guessed it, the Clinton Foundation. Of the $1,042,000 the Clintons gave to charity as listed on their return, $1 million went to the Clinton Foundation https://t.co/IuNXUGZBdC

— Da Hack (@NoMoreSheepdog) August 12, 2016 
It’s a pretty slick move: donate to your own charity and write it off on your taxes. One twitter user aptly called the Clinton Foundation “their own slush fund.” 
As far as the money laundering comment goes, well, dirty money does need to get clean, you know, and Clinton Foundation money is dirty in more ways than one. 
First, it’s a great way to make enough money to pay for Hillary’s ugly designer clothes and Bill’s girlfriends — not to mention that Chelsea needs a job; $600,000 at NBC only goes so far, you know. 
Second, the Clinton Foundation takes enormous amounts of money from countries with disgusting human rights abuses and all the Clintons have to do is a photo-op here and there to make it look like it’s all about charity and whatnot. 
This fits perfectly with the Democrat Party, though — it doesn’t matter what is, just what it looks like, and fortunately for them Democrat voters aren’t the most discerning bunch. 
Apparently Clinton made $10.6 million in 2015…but hey, she’s just like us! 
She’s your neighbor down the street who can’t climb the stairs, screams at everyone and gets away with massive fraud and has yet to be held accountable for the death of four Americans on her watch — not to mention the others that drop like flies around her. 
Then there’s creepy, pervy, pathological liar uncle Bill, and their ne’er-do-well daughter Chelsea with questionable paternity — although that’s probably a lot more common …

10351,"Attacker in Nice Plotted for Months and Had Accomplices, French Prosecutor Says - The New York Times","PARIS  —   Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, who killed 84 people in a terrorist attack in Nice, France, last week, planned his assault over several months and got help from at least five people, the Paris prosecutor said on Thursday. However, although the Islamic State called the attacker one of its “soldiers,” there is as yet no evidence that he or the suspected accomplices had any direct contact with the terrorist network, the prosecutor, François Molins, who handles terrorism investigations in France, said at a news conference in Paris. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a    Tunisian who lived in Nice, drove a cargo truck through crowds that had gathered on the city’s waterfront promenade to watch the Bastille Day fireworks on July 14. He also fired an automatic pistol at the police, before they shot and killed him. The authorities initially said they believed that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, who had not been particularly religious, had become rapidly radicalized over a few weeks before the attack. But on Thursday, Mr. Molins suggested that the attack had been planned for months. Investigators have confirmed “not only the premeditated character” of the attack but also that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel “benefited from support and complicity in the preparation and carrying out of his criminal act,” Mr. Molins said. The five suspects, who were arrested in the days after the attack, were charged on Thursday evening. Mr. Molins said that the charges would include murder, attempted murder, terrorist conspiracy, and the possession and transportation of weapons. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel’s estranged wife was also arrested, but was released without charges on Sunday, as was a man who had been wrongly identified as a suspect, according to Audrey Delaunay, the man’s lawyer. On Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel’s phone, investigators found pictures of fireworks and of the Nice promenade from last year, as well as an image of an article about Captagon, an amphetamine that has been associated in some news reports with Islamic State fighters. Also on the phone was an image of an article on a Tunisian man killed in January after he tried to attack a police station in Paris. Mr. Molins also said that investigators had uncovered pictures, text messages and phone calls that showed he had been in close contact over the past year with three men who are now suspects. The authorities identified them as Ramzi A. 21, a native of Nice and a dual   citizen Chokri C. 37, a Tunisian born in Sousse, Tunisia and Mohamed Oualid G. 40, a dual   citizen born in La Marsa, Tunisia. Mohamed Oualid G. and Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel called each other 1, 278 times over the last year. Mohamed Oualid G. sent Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel a text message praising the attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, Mr. Molins said, and investigators found pictures on Mohamed Oualid G. ’s phone of the aftermath of the attack in Nice. Investigators also found pictures on Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel’s phone from July 11 and July 13 of Mohamed Oualid G. in the truck used for the attack, he said. On April 4, Chokri C. sent Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel a Facebook message advising him to “load the truck” and to “cut the brakes, my friend, and I’ll watch,” Mr. Molins said. His fingerprints were also found on the truck’s passenger door, and he was recorded by a surveillance camera in the truck beside Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, on the promenade in Nice, less than three hours before the attack, Mr. Molins said. A text message sent by Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel to Ramzi A. just minutes before the attack thanked him for an automatic pistol, which he then used to shoot at the police, and “asked for new ones,” Mr. Molins said. Like Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, none of the men were known to French intelligence services, Mr. Molins said. Ramzi A. had a criminal record with convictions for theft, violence and drug use between 2013 and 2015. An Albanian couple  —   Artan H. 38, and Enkeledja Z. 42, who also holds French citizenship  —   also face criminal proceedings. They are suspected of having helped Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel obtain the 7.  automatic pistol that he used. Questions continued to be raised about security measures in Nice on the night of the attack, which killed not only French citizens who had been celebrating their national holiday, but also people of 19 other nationalities, including citizens of Algeria, Brazil, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Madagascar and the United States. France’s Socialist government has sparred repeatedly with opposing politicians on the right and far right, especially local officials in Nice, over how many national and municipal officers were securing the promenade on the night of the attack and how they were spread out. The national police answer to the state, whereas municipal officers answer to city authorities. The newspaper Libération reported on Thursday that only one municipal police car was positioned at the spot where Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel barreled through and onto the promenade, and it said that although national and city officials had agreed on  —   and stuck to  —   a security plan for Bastille Day, the government had misrepresented those measures after the attack. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, while denying that accusation, has ordered an internal police investigation, separate from the continuing judicial one, which will look into the Bastille Day security measures in Nice. Questions have also been raised about why the authorities did not position heavy obstacles at the entrances to the promenade’s pedestrian area, to block vehicles from entering. The authorities across France are rushing to strengthen security at the dozens of events over the summer. They have added vehicular barriers at Paris Plages, an annual event that turns sections of the Seine’s embankments into artificial beaches, and have canceled events like an   film festival and a pedestrian day on the  . On Thursday, the French Parliament also passed a bill extending for an additional six months the state of emergency that was declared after the November attacks that killed 130 people in and around Paris. It grants the French authorities extraordinary policing powers, such as the ability to carry out police raids or place people under house arrest without a judge’s authorization. The latest extension, which would last until the end of January, would make this state of emergency the longest since the 1950s. In addition, legislation passed on Thursday gives the government new powers. For example, under the state of emergency, the police will be allowed to seize computers and phones and copy the data on them without prior judicial authorization. And from now on, the government will be able to place a person returning from Syria or Iraq under house arrest for up to three months instead of one.",0

10353,"E3 Hands-On with ’LawBreakers’: Tons of Style, Little Substance - Breitbart","LawBreakers is the next big   release from Unreal and Gears of War developer Cliff Bleszinski, but does it live up to the hype?[  Cliff Bleszinski (formerly known as CliffyB) is best known for his work on the Unreal and Gears of War franchises, both of which went on to spawn multiple sequels and are considered classics among both fans and critics. Bleszinski’s latest project, released under his own company Boss Key Productions, is a   shooter with an   twist that I got to get time   with at E3. LawBreakers lets players choose one of nine different classes spread across 18 characters to fight to the death in a team   shooter. The classes feature many character types that players of team shooters will be familiar with there are heavy shooters that utilize rocket launchers and grenades to decimate large groups of opponents, while also characters that rely on blades and speed boosts to slice their way through the competition at close range. LawBreakers focuses heavily on the futuristic elements of the game, both in promotional material and gameplay itself.   is a huge feature that is utilized throughout the game, with players moving between regular gravity and   zones constantly, forcing them to adapt their playstyle and utilize movement abilities in order to keep up with the   nature of the game. While the   elements provide a slightly new playstyle, overall LawBreakers suffers from a lack of originality. To the experienced FPS fan, LawBreakers comes across as an attempt to innovate in ways that aren’t as new and groundbreaking as LawBreakers presents them as being. Many of the mechanics we see in LawBreakers such as   are similar to the movement systems of shooters like Call of Duty: Black Ops III and the Titanfall franchise, while special character abilities are quite similar to the abilities in other hero shooters like Overwatch. While the game introduces some interesting design elements and in many cases attempts to rely on their futuristic style, the visuals can often be quite lackluster. Textures in many areas look bland and recycled, while many character designs are hit and miss. The LawBreakers team does seem to have chosen to appeal to the eSports market with much of their branding however which may be the games best chance at success. Overall my time with LawBreakers left me with the impression of a fun shooter to kill some time with but unlikely to win any awards for groundbreaking innovation. Hopefully, the full release of LawBreakers will reveal a bit more depth by its August 8 release date.

[The sentence for Adel Assaliyeh, a Muslim resident of Alexandria, was submitted to the Grand Mufti of Egypt, who has the prerogative on signing off on death sentences.  Assaliyeh admitted to killing the victim, Youssef Lamei, saying he had asked him to stop selling alcohol to no avail. Refusing legal counsel, Assaliyeh reportedly didn’t show remorse and said, “If I could, I’d kill all of the alcohol retailers. ” The victim’s son Tony said the defendant threatened him during the trial and said he would murder him too as well as all Coptic Christians. Tony said that the defendant nonchalantly reenacted the murder while citing Islamic rulings permitting the killing of Christians that he had heard on television. Lamei’s assault last month by an initially anonymous man was caught on   cameras and shocked the Egyptian public. It also further increased the uncertainties facing the Coptic community.",0

Latest information is that the Russian fleet off the coast of Syria is going to carry out military strikes in the Aleppo region including seaborne missiles launches. This is not surprising since the main elements of the Russian Navy force have at last converged off Cyprus & Syria. The Kuznetsov carrier has been on the receiving end of a lot of trolling, mocking all the way to the Syrian shores It has taken a while to finally get the vital naval pieces into place, much of it to howls of protest from NATO and the MSM. 
It is doubtful that the air strikes against the rebels will be carrier launched, largely due to the ski jump configuration that hinders the launching of fully laden aircraft, but SU-33s have already been reported in the skies above Syria, either probably on Combat Air Patrols, or more than likely having relocated to the main airbase at Khmeimim , supplementing the air assets there. If indeed true, it will nevertheless be the first combat air sortie in 25 years for the Kuznetsov’s air wing! Much less fuss has been made in the MSM & politically on the role of the Black & Caspian Sea fleets,which have already used Kalibrs in anger in 2015 & this year. Interestingly, 100 Kalibr & Onix missiles were ordered by the Russian Ministry of Defense in the 3rd quarter of 2016. (TASS 21 Oct). The destroyer, Smetlivy is also reported to have joined the fleet, after a Greek stopover, where sailors got to see the sights of Athens. Whereas Spain & Malta snubbed the Russian Navy, Greece welcomes them with open arms. 
At the beginning of November, the naval auxiliary, Prof. Nikolay Muru left Sevastopol along with the missile frigate, the Admiral Grigorovich, the only surface ship carrying Kalibrs in the eastern Mediterranean. The Prof. Nikolay Muru is a Search & Rescue (SAR) ship, also capable of underwater operations & has Dynamic Positioning System (DPS); it’s one of two vessels that frequently use AIS and as such trackable. The other is the Nikolay Chiker, an ocean going tug, which accompanied the Kuznetsov fleet down from Severomorsk. The Chiker is now quite close to Turkey, at the northernmost edge of what appears to be the Russian Navy operational zone. (See diagram for the NOTAM). 
Russia’s aircraft carrier group is ready to launch strike on Aleppo in the next 24 hours 
Also underway and heading to Syria is the Large Buoy Tender, KIL 158, with a deck cargo of what appears to be two fast ‘Raptor’ patrol craft . 
It has a heavy lift crane and also an underwater operations role. You don’t send off such ships far from their homeports for a nice training cruise, so although this might seem at first sight, dull news compared to the deployment of combat ships, it is interesting from a logistical point of view. There is the need to reconfigure the Tartus docks into a viable & safe naval base permanently and as such specialist vessels with diving support capabilities will probably come in handy. 
Equally, the arrival of specialist auxiliary ships makes for an intriguing combination, specifically looking at the underwater operations capability. This is especially so when you vector in what the Yantar did last month. The Yantar, a Russian navy oceanographic ship was off Syrian & Lebanese coasts, loitered over areas where there submarine cables linking Cyprus with the Levant & Turkey. My guess is that it was also surveying and checking out the Anti Submarine Warfare sonar arrays ‘toys’ left there by NATO – (US), in preparation for the arrival of the main fleet. Back in October, several UK MSM newspapers reported the deployment of 2 Akula class & 1 Kilo class submarines in the Atlantic. They added that they were joining the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean. So maybe the Yantar was giving the elusive Russian submarine(s?) some more room to maneuver discreetly. At the same time, there was what seemed to be a cat and mouse game taking place between the Russian navy (a sub?) firing missiles and the US Navy sending out an ASW P-8 air patrol the next day in the area. A discreet but vital underwater conflict is taking place off the Syrian coast. 
Caption: Map showing the location of the Yantar in relation to submarine cables in the region 
Some of the Russian ships took a northerly route past Cyprus, thus completely avoiding the French aircraft-carrier group and the busy airspace used by the RAF and ISF aircraft. Just by looking at the NOTAM map for Cyprus shows this crowded airspace). There are still NATO/US ships lurking in the area, probably keeping tabs on the Russians. One, off Crete, was the USNS Mary Sears (T AGS 65), an oceanographic ship, with sonar, underwater metal detection & satellite imagery capabilities, approximately in the same mould as the Yantar. The Yantar is now going to Iran and maybe will cause some ASW mischief making there. The latest ‘watcher’ is the Spanish navy tanker, the Cantabria, (A 15), and before that it was the turn of the Danish warship HMDS Absalon off Crete. The US naval oiler Leroy Grumman is also deployed in the area and it appears to be replenishing the French carrier group. 
The latest news in is that there was a ‘brief encounter’ between the Kuznetsov escorts and a Dutch NATO submarine. (SPUTNIK news 9 Nov) Supposedly for a top notch hyper silent submarine, the Dutch Walrus class diesel- electric submarine was detected by the Severomorsk & the Vice-Adm Kulakov. 
In other news, the Russian naval “Syrian Express” is still providing a much needed military supply shuttle service. In what is probably the oddest naval movement was that of a tug SB 5 towing a barge, that went through the Bosphorus twice in less than 30 hours, a record breaking transit. The barge looked like a mooring pontoon for one of the big combat ships or for the Kuznetsov. The naval logistical & combat support operations is a underrated but vital aspect of the Russian military campaign in Syria. 
P.S. Rumor has it that the Dutch sub detected is the Walrus, since it visited Valletta, Malta back in September.

10357,"For ‘S.N.L.,’ Clinton-Trump Has Been a Blessing and a Curse - The New York Times","The NBC news release for Monday’s “The 2016 S. N. L. Election Special,” which will compile recent “Saturday Night Live” political sketches, promises to “retrace the highlights of the current presidential campaign. ” That’s the first joke right there: that any part of this exhausting, acrimonious,   campaign can be considered a highlight. As Alec Baldwin put it, breaking character as Donald J. Trump on the last Saturday before the election: “Don’t you guys feel gross all the time about this?” But it’s undeniable that the race has blessed “S. N. L. ” with material. And cursed it. “S. N. L. ” faced   expectations: first, to wring laughs out of a national nervous breakdown, and second, to improve on a political reality so   that it writes its own penis jokes. “S. N. L. ” couldn’t manage that, at least when it’s taken the candidates head on. But it’s done some fine work around the election’s edges. “S. N. L. ” is a mainstream media institution, no less than “Meet the Press” or the presidential debates. (We’ve had televised   debates on a regular basis only since 1976, a year after “S. N. L. ” started.) So there’s a kind of dutifulness to its election satire, which unfolds with all the ritual merriment of a candidates’ pancake toss at a state fair. The big change the show made this fall was to bring in Mr. Baldwin to  . His boorish Trump felt like penance for “S. N. L. ” having let the candidate   the show last November during the Republican primary campaign, and maybe for NBCUniversal’s larger entanglements with him  —   the former “Apprentice” host, sucked up to by Billy Bush, coddled by Matt Lauer, patted like an apricot sheepdog by Jimmy Fallon. Was Mr. Baldwin’s Trump good? Mimetically, it was worthy of a biopic. If I try to visualize Mr. Trump from the debates now, I see Mr. Baldwin instead, hulking,   his lips pursed open like the suckers of some   creature. But there wasn’t a distinctive spin on Mr. Trump as a character, the way Kate McKinnon developed her Hillary Clinton long ago into a savage yet sympathetic portrait of political thirst. The scripts mainly highlighted moments, like Mr. Trump’s lurking in the second debate, that the writers’ room of Twitter had already hashed out in real time. Like any establishment institution, the show is prey to conventional wisdom. After the “Access Hollywood” Trump tape, “S. N. L. ” followed mainstream pundits’ conclusion that the election was over. The   sketch introduced the Democratic candidate as “President Hillary Clinton,” and Mr. Baldwin’s Trump declared, “I’m going to huff, I’m going to puff, and I’m going to blow this whole thing. ” (This, by the way, was the episode that enraged the real Mr. Trump on Twitter  —   “Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!”  —   and if the past year and a half taught us anything, it was being treated as a loser, not Mr. Baldwin’s huffing and puffing, that set him off.) The show hasn’t been able to   Mr. Trump’s   caricature, but then, neither has the rest of   comedy. He’s been a pulsating orange sun that blinds any comedian who stares at it directly. Which may be why “S. N. L. ” has been most effective when it’s looked past the candidates. “Celebrity Family Feud: Political Edition” sketched the motley circus of surrogates and campaign allies, including Ivanka Trump (Margot Robbie, her hair apparently blown by an offscreen fan) a vampiric Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennett) and Bill Clinton (Darrell Hammond, slipping on the role like an old sweatshirt). The taped short “A Day Off” imagined Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway (Ms. McKinnon) having a free day interrupted by repeated calls to defend the indefensible on CNN. (“Of course Mr. Trump thinks that Mexicans can read, and actually what he wants them to read the most is Hillary Clinton’s 33, 000’s missing emails”  —   an only slightly exaggerated version of a familiar    ballet.) By far the season’s peak was an installment of the returning   sketch, “Black Jeopardy! ,” with Tom Hanks as Doug, a Trump supporter, answering    questions against two black contestants (Sasheer Zamata and Leslie Jones). Doug, to everyone’s shock, got one response after another right. Prompted with the answer, “They out here saying, the new iPhone wants your thumbprint ‘for your protection,’” he answered, “What is: ‘I don’t think so. That’s how they get you. ’” The host (Kenan Thompson) was surprised  —   “Yes!”  —   even relieved. This   white guy was on the same wavelength as his black guests, suspicious of authority, anxious to make ends meet, unimpressed with skinny women. It was cathartic, almost moving. Despite all the vitriol out there, maybe they weren’t all that different? Then came the final category: “Lives That Matter. ” Said the host, “Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug. ” This wasn’t just the best sketch of the “S. N. L. ” election season. It was some of the best political analysis of the campaign, making a nuanced point about white Trump supporters and minorities, race and economic anxiety. Doug and his black counterparts, it said, have real issues in common  —   and a real, ultimate difference they may not be able to get past. The final cold open with Mr. Baldwin and Ms. McKinnon likewise turned its focus from the candidates to us. It started in straight campaign mode, portraying Mr. Trump being supported by the F. B. I. Mr. Putin and the Ku Klux Klan while CNN obsessed over Mrs. Clinton’s email. Then the two actors broke off, declared that they were tired of hurling insults, and ran into the streets of Manhattan to hug   before returning to urge the audience, in Ms. McKinnon’s words, to “choose what kind of country we want to live in. ” This too was a staged bit. But it also felt like a concession. The election, it said, has taxed the limits of typical election comedy, of     poking at foibles. It’s become an emotionally draining, terrifying,   culture war into which we’ve been drafted. It was hardly the most hilarious election sketch “S. N. L. ” has ever done. But it may have been the right place, this year, to stop: peering beyond the vanishing edge of satire to the point at which all this stuff is no longer funny.",0

10359,Bombing at Bangladesh’s Largest Eid Gathering Kills at Least 3 - The New York Times,"DHAKA, Bangladesh  —   A bombing at Bangladesh’s largest gathering for the Eid   holiday killed two police officers and a civilian on Thursday, police officials said, a day after the Islamic State warned that more attacks would follow the militants’ bloody siege in the capital last week. The attack on Thursday occurred at Sholakia Eidgah, a prayer ground in the Kishoreganj district, about 60 miles northeast of Dhaka, the capital. More than 100, 000 people were estimated to have gathered there for Eid   the holiday that concludes the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued a statement deploring the attack and the killers who had carried it out. “What kind of Islamic virtues do they hold as they go to kill people instead of offering their prayers at prayers time, carry out a suicidal bomb attack,” she said. In the aftermath of a bloody weekend attack carried out by young men, several from prosperous families, the prime minister renewed official entreaties to parents and school administrators to inform the authorities about unexplained and prolonged absences by young men. “I urge the guardians to take steps to bring back their missing sons home,” she said. “We will give them all cooperation to find their missing boys and for their treatment, if necessary. ” More details emerged about the attack on the religious gathering on Thursday. About half an hour before morning prayers were to begin, a group of men approached a police checkpoint at a high school near the prayer ground and set off a bomb, said Tofazzal Hossain, an assistant superintendent of the Kishoreganj police. “They attacked the police out of nowhere,” said Mr. Hossain, who added that some of the attackers had been carrying guns and bladed weapons. Six other officers were seriously wounded, said a police inspector, Mueid Chowdhury, but they were expected to survive. Several civilians were also hurt. The police killed one of the attackers and arrested two others, Mr. Hossain said. A search was underway for the other assailants. Security had been tightened for Eid celebrations around Bangladesh after the militant assault Friday night on an upscale restaurant in Dhaka’s diplomatic district, in which at least 20 hostages were killed. On Wednesday, the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the restaurant siege, released a video threatening more such attacks in Bangladesh. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on Thursday. But the imam of the Sholakia Eidgah mosque, Maulana Fariduddin Masud, had taken a public stance against violence committed in the name of Islam. In January, he led more than 100, 000 Islamic clerics in signing a fatwa, or religious ruling, that condemned militancy.",0

"" Robert William ""Willie"" Pickton (born October 24, 1949)[ 2 ] of Port Coquitlam , British Columbia , Canada, is a former multi-millionaire pig farmer[ 3 ] and serial killer convicted in 2007 of the second-degree murders of six women.[4][ 5 ] He was also charged in the deaths of an additional twenty women,[6] many of them from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside; however, these charges were stayed by the Crown in 2010.[7] In December 2007, he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years – the longest sentence then available under Canadian law for murder.[8] 

During the trial's first day of jury evidence, January 22, 2007, the Crown stated he confessed to 49 murders to an undercover police officer posing as a cellmate . The Crown reported that Pickton told the officer that he wanted to kill another woman to make it an even 50, and that he was caught because he was ""sloppy"".[9] Background[edit] 

By 1992, Robert William Pickton and his brother David owned a Port Coquitlam farm. Worker Bill Hiscox called it a ""creepy-looking place"", noting that it was patrolled by a 600-lb. (270 kg) boar , one of the few actual pigs on the farm. ""I never saw a pig like that, who would chase you and bite at you,"" he said. ""It was running out with the dogs around the property."" He later described Pickton as a ""pretty quiet guy, hard to strike up a conversation with,"" whose occasionally bizarre behavior, despite no evidence of substance abuse , would draw attention. 

Pickton's only vehicle was a converted bus, with deeply tinted windows, to which he was emotionally attached. The Pickton brothers gradually neglected the site's farming operations. They registered a non-profit charity, the Piggy Palace Good Times Society, with the Canadian government in 1996 as aiming to ""organize, co-ordinate, manage and operate special events, functions, dances, shows and exhibitions on behalf of service organizations, sports organizations and other worthy groups."" Its events included raves and wild parties featuring Vancouver prostitutes and gatherings in a converted slaughterhouse. These events attracted as many as 2,000 people. Hell's Angel members were known to often frequent the farm."" 

""650,000 Emails Found On Anthony Weiner's Laptop; DOJ Blocked Foundation Probe   
by Tyler Durden   
Oct 30, 2016 10:34 PM  
Yesterday, we reported that the FBI has found "" tens of thousands of emails "" belonging to Huma Adein on Anthony Weiner's computer, raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the FBI in the few days left before the elections Now, according to the WSJ , it appears that Federal agents are preparing to scour roughly 650,000 emails that, as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton's email use, as metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. 

As the WSJ adds, the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are work-related emails between Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide and the estranged wife of Mr. Weiner, and State Department officials; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe, which FBI officials call ""Midyear."" 

And, as we further reported earlier today , the FBI has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails, because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner, and that order was delayed for reasons that remain unclear. 

More stunning is just how many emails were found on Weiner's computer. And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau's second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Those emails stretched back years , these people said, and were on a laptop that both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Abedin used and that hadn't previously come up in the Clinton email probe. Ms. Abedin said in late August that the couple were separating. 

The FBI had searched the computer while looking for child pornography, people familiar with the matter said, but the warrant they used didn't give them authority to search for matters related to Mrs. Clinton's email arrangement at the State Department. Mr. Weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager. 

As reported yesterday, it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of Abedin linked emails on Weiner's computer: 

In their initial review of the laptop, the metadata showed many messages, apparently in the thousands, that were either sent to or from the private email server at Mrs. Clinton's home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the FBI. Senior FBI officials decided to let the Weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer, and report back to them. 

The WSJ then connects the dots between how the Weiner emails were linked to the Clinton reopening of the Clinton probe, despite Loretta Lynch's and the DOJ's vocal urges not to do so : 

At a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the department’s senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said. 

Mr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop’s contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant. 

Mr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned Mr. Comey that telling Congress would violate well-established policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey's repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his first press conference on the subject in July. 

But wait it gets better. 

Recall that this is the same Andrew Mcabe whose wife the Wall Street Journal reported last week received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a Clinton Foundation board member. 

Mr. McAuliffe had supported Dr. McCabe in the hopes she and a handful of other Democrats might help win a majority in the state Senate, giving Mr. McAuliffe more sway in the state capitol. Dr. McCabe lost her race last November, and Democrats failed to win their majority. 

FBI officials have said Mr. McCabe had no role in the Clinton email probe until he became deputy director, and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wife's campaign was over. Which brings us to the second big topic: the Clinton Foundation, and how the DOJ made sure that particular probe never made the light of day. At the same time as the Clinton server was being investigated, other Clinton-related investigations were under way within the FBI, and they have been the subject of internal debate for months. 

Early this year, four FBI field offices—New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark.—were collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The WSJ touches on something fascinating: Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Clinton Foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation, these people said. So where did that trail go? Apparently nowhere. 

The Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a Clinton Foundation board member, these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity. The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. 

In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn't go well. 

Some said that is because the FBI didn’t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn't a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. 

""That was one of the weirdest meetings I've ever been to,"" one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Needless to say, the probe into the Foundation faded. 

But back to the Clinton probe, according to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe, despite the department's refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn’t use those methods. 

At this point a question emerges: did McCabe seek to defend or press on with a Clinton probe: Mr. McCabe’s defenders in the agency said that following the call, he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the Clinton Foundation investigation: Agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had. 

Others further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: “Stand down.” When agents questioned why they weren’t allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director—Mr. McCabe. Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction. 

At this point the two probes, into Hillary's email and the Clinton Foundation converged: 

For agents who already felt uneasy about FBI leadership’s handling of the Clinton Foundation case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said. For those who felt the probe hadn’t yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct, the leadership’s approach was the right response to the facts on the ground. 

Things accelerated over the past two months, when in September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Clinton email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information. 

Some FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they could not “go prosecutor-shopping."" 

Not long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureau’s leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey's disclosure to Congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign 

While much of the latest developments are known, or could have been inferred assuming more corruption within government agencies, the punchline is that the weeks if not months of upcoming work means that if Clinton wins the White House, she will likely do so amid at least one ongoing investigation into her inner circle being handled by law-enforcement officials who are deeply divided over how to manage such cases. It also means that Trump will be hounding Hilllary for the remainder of the campaign as being the only presidential candidate to seek election with a recently reopened criminal probe hanging over her head.""

10362,Donald Trump Invites Conservative Media to White House for Exclusive Briefing - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump met with a group of conservative media reporters, columnists, and radio hosts to discuss his first 100 days as president, speaking about trade issues, foreign policy, and infrastructure spending. [Representatives from Breitbart News were present for the event.  The event was billed as a reception, as White House aides and members of the press office mingled with about   individuals from conservative media outlets to discuss Trump’s first 100 days and issues of importance. But the event turned into an impromptu press conference after the president entered the room flanked by senior advisers Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner. At one point economic advisor Gary Cohn peered in the door to view the event. White House press secretary Sean Spicer was also present, as Trump held a discussion, which the White House press staff put on the record afterwards. Conservative journalists asked Trump policy questions  —   particularly about trade foreign affairs in North Korea, Iran, and Syria and social policy. Trump announced that he wanted to levy a 20 percent tax on Canadian soft lumber and suggested he wanted to address milk imports as well. “It means we’re going to start doing lumber in our country, it’s going to mean that farmers are going to start selling milk in our country,” Trump said. A senior administration trade official said that the issue was a “long simmering problem” with Canada, accusing them of charging lumber companies low subsidized rates. “We love Canada, wonderful people, wonderful country, but they have been very good about taking advantage of us through NAFTA,” Trump said. Trump said that he would explore allowing more logging on federal lands with the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency. “We’re actually having some of those horrific fires because this stuff is sitting there, virgin stuff for so long, and it’s in very bad shape,” he said. Trump seemed to think that Syrian dictator Bashar   would not use chemical weapons again. “Wait and see if he uses them again, OK?” he said, adding that the Obama administration was wrong about Syria getting rid of their chemical weapons. “That turned out to be false,” he said. “They duped the Obama administration. ” Trump continued to highlight the problems with North Korea but remained elusive about what he was planning to do in the country. He mused that North Korea’s dictator Kim   was probably not as strong militarily as he appeared. “I’m not so sure he’s so strong like he says he is I’m not so sure at all,” he said. Trump criticized modern presidents for not acting decisively on the North Korea threat. “This should have been done by Obama and it should have been done by every president since, really, Clinton,” he said, referring to the former president’s memoirs. He also discussed the ongoing crisis of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. “Nobody’s been treated worse, it seems to me, than Christians in the Middle East,” he said, arguing that it was easier for Muslims to come into the United States as refugees than Christians, although it was far more dangerous there for Christians. “We’re going to be helping the Christians big league,” he said. Trump defended his plan to spend big on infrastructure, pointing out that the United States spent $6 trillion in the Middle East with little to show for it. “I tell you what we got, it’s 20 times worse than it first was when we first started bombing the hell out of Iraq,” he said. “Iraq was thrown in the hornets nest and it’s a disaster, far worse than anybody understands. ” Trump said he wanted to spend $1 trillion on building new infrastructure and repairing existing infrastructure projects like bridges, roads, and airports. When asked if he still believed DACA was illegal, Trump demurred, instead focusing on his efforts to crack down on   gang members. “We’re getting rid of people, and people in towns, they’re cheering. These are rough people,” Trump said, saying that DHS Secretary Gen. John Kelly called   members as bad as  . “We have people that came into this country that should have never ever in a million years been allowed into this country. ”",0
10363,Three Philadelphia prison guards charged for beating a handcuffed man unconscious,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:50 UTC © yelp.com Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center. Three Philadelphia prison guards are facing charges including aggravated assault after allegedly beating up a handcuffed inmate and submitting a fraudulent report. They say the inmate harmed himself, but their actions were caught on video. Milton Gibbs, 52, Terrance Bailey, 30, and Shaun Lowe, 26, are facing charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, and tampering with public records. There are also additional charges of misdemeanor, recklessly endangering another person, unsworn falsification to authorities, and obstructing the administration of law and official oppression. They turned themselves in for arrest on Wednesday. ""We cannot stand for any kind of assault, and this attack on a handcuffed inmate by sworn corrections officers is egregious. Every inmate who is held in our prisons deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,"" Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said in statement following arrests of the three guards. According to the investigation, the assault at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center dates back to June, when Gibbs allegedly threatened inmate Brandon Kulb, 22, stating that he would ""hang him and murder him."" It is alleged that Gibbs called Bailey, and the two then entered Kulb's cell and began beating, kicking, and spitting on him. District Attorney Williams says they eventually put Kulb in handcuffs and walked him down a staircase, while continuing to beat him. ""Once they arrived at the cell block's exit, Bailey struck the victim in the back of the head knocking him to the ground. Gibbs and Bailey then dragged the victim into the central control area and began to stomp on him. Lowe arrived on scene and joined in the assault,"" the DA's office said in a press release, adding that Kulb ""lost consciousness"" at least twice during that time. The guards tried to make sure that the assault would not get captured on surveillance cameras, but ""much"" of it was still caught on CCTV, offering the investigation irrefutable evidence. Despite that, guards tried to cover up the assault. After the purported beating of Kulb, Gibbs and Bailey submitted a mental health referral saying the inmate had intentionally harmed himself. Lowe allegedly transported the victim to the receiving room, and Gibbs tried to coerce the victim not to report the incident in exchange for food from the staff kitchen, the DA said. In their reports, the three wrote that they only used ""open hand"" control, because they had to subdue Kulb. They omitted their own actions. This is not the first time Gibbs has been arrested, according to NewsWorks. In 2004, he was reportedly fired for assaulting an inmate but was acquitted in a federal civil rights case filed against him.",0
10364,Reaching Peak Greek at the Met Museum - The New York Times,"Seen from on high, history is a grand sorting machine, loading on events, parsing populations, dividing time into nameable, datable piles. No one captures this process more grandly than the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And in “Pergamon and the Hellenistic Kingdoms of the Ancient World,” which opens on Monday, April 18, it is operating in truly epical form. But the show also offers something less often encountered: history viewed at ground level, from inside. From that perspective, it’s about binding, not sorting, about single lives threaded together day by day. And it’s not about statistics, but about impressions, personal sensations, evoked by the sight of sculpted cloth falling over vulnerable flesh and the worry lines etched into the brow of a portrait head. Grand exhibitions and historical epochs alike often revolve around a magnetic personality. The Met show does too: King Alexander III of Macedon, better known as Alexander the Great. Although he was born far from Athens, he deeply identified with Greek Classical culture (having Aristotle as a personal tutor helped). At the same time, he moved beyond it with the creative confidence of a superstar. Gorgeous and   culturally inquisitive and ravenous with ambition, Alexander embarked on what amounts to a world tour based on military conquest. Within a few years, he exerted political control over Greece, staked claims to sovereignty in Egypt and Persia, and reached the edges of India. He spread the Hellenic spirit as he went, but he also absorbed influences from the cultures around him, and shipped those influences home in the form of gold, jewels and precious objects. The Greek Classical tradition was based on an aesthetic, which was also an ethic, of idealization, austerity and emotional restraint. It represented, at least to some degree, the effort of a peninsular culture to distance itself from, and elevate itself above, what it perceived as a barbaric outside world. Alexander plunged into that outside world and the cargo of exotic fabulousness he sent back from it altered the character of Classical art. By the time of his death in 323 B. C. at 32, a new, hybrid, internationalist art, now known as Hellenistic, had begun to coalesce, and would flourish for nearly three centuries. Its history is the subject of the Met show and is, to say the least, a complex one. Alexander himself is everywhere in the opening gallery. A marble portrait head  —   possibly a Roman copy of an original bronze by his court artist, Lysippos  —   likely reflects what the ruler looked like: generically dishy with a designer haircut, Justin Bieber with gravitas. Two small bronzes suggest distinctive personas that Alexander, a born performer, wanted to market: in one he’s a buff hunk inviting worshipful admiration, in the other an armored equestrian, eyes wide, hair flying,   raised. Objects around him give a sense of globalist environment he relished and promoted. Asian elephants lumber over silver coins and glazed plates. Persian courtiers circle a monumental vase. A shimmering myrtle wreath of hammered gold, each   leaf, twig and flower exquisitely formed, seems to await the wealthy wearer who, wherever he lived and whatever he did, was a cosmopolitan member of Hellenistic society. A flair for the theatrical in this new art often expressed itself through exaggerated scale. In a gallery further along in the show, a marble statue of Athena, carved around 170 B. C. towers more than 13 feet tall. A    head of Herakles is a fragment of an image that, when intact, must have projected   immensity. Both sculptures were found at Pergamon in modern Turkey. The site was the capital of the Attalid dynasty, one of several   kingdoms that fought among themselves and eventually faced off with Rome. It’s most famous, though, for its   Great Altar, one of the most dramatic of surviving Hellenistic monuments. Uncovered by German archaeologists at the end of the 19th century, the altar reliefs are now in Berlin at the Pergamon Museum, which, currently closed for restoration, is the source for nearly a third of the 265 objects in the Met show. The sequence of   panels that once lined the altar staircase depicts a mortal clash between the major Greek gods and a race of marauding giants. With its   tone, the frieze is one of the great coups de théâtre of sculptural history and a lastingly influential one. It is also physically unmovable and couldn’t travel to New York. Two marvelous panels from a second, smaller frieze at the site did make the trip, though it is in a group of sculptures with no direct relationship to the altar that the    emotionalism of the Pergamon’s style comes through most sharply. The group makes a startling first impression: of fallen bodies strewn across the ground, as if in the wake of an execution squad that has just moved on. A marble figure of an Amazon lies dead on a patch of earth, her face slack, her limp body thrown open. Nearby is the famous sculpture, on loan from the National Archaeological Museum in Naples, of “Dying Gaul,” an image of a nude man, felled by wounds, making one final, futile effort to rise. These sculptures are not to meant to inspire pure pity. Their subjects  —   a mythically fierce female warrior, a real Celtic tribesman of a kind known to pillage Greek settlements  —   embodied cosmic forces seen as   to the Hellenic civilization. They are outsiders, the enemy. But pathos is pathos: The dying man, head hanging down as if he were staring into the earth, is a pitiable sight. One of the grand beauties of Hellenistic art is its insistence on confusing our feelings, on replacing the Classical certainty with emotional complication. The exhibition’s organizers  —   Carlos A. Picón and Seán Hemingway of the museum’s department of Greek and Roman art, leading a curatorial team of Ariel Herrmann, Kyriaki Karoglou, Christopher S. Lightfoot, Joan R. Mertens, Lillian Bartlett Stoner and Paul Zanker  —   have done well to emphasize this complex dynamic, one that gives Hellenistic art an exceptionally modern savor. But after the high Pergamon moment, there’s still a lot of ground to cover, and the show broadens out in a series of   devoted to specific features of Hellenistic art: jewelry, glass production coins and intimate sculpture. Each yields astonishments: onyx cameos with 10 layers of carving, glass bowls with inserted gold sheets and sculptures like the famed “Lo Spinario,” which turns the image of a child pulling a thorn from his foot into a tight Baroque tangle of coiled lines. In some eras, art loses steam, repeats itself, sputters out. Hellenistic art seemed increasingly fueled by audacity. Decorative glassware goes psychedelic. Portraits turn slightly psychotic. The margin for oddity, always wide, grows wider, and is rife with jokes and surprises. Look at the back of a   carving of a sleeping hermaphrodite and you see the smooth planes of an Ingres odalisque, Classical Venus look from the front and you see an erection. This marble sculpture is a Roman copy of a Greek original, done sometime in the second century B. C. By then, global political balances had long since shifted. Rome, that power mower of an empire, had picked off the Hellenistic kingdoms one by one. The last Attalid monarch handed over the keys to Pergamon without being asked. With Cleopatra’s suicide in 30 B. C. Alexander’s one remaining direct successor left the scene. The new Roman emperor, Augustus, was a Classicist. He liked pure, was comfortable with composed. Unruly emotion in art was out. Or was it? After centuries, the Hellenistic spirit had permanently changed art’s DNA. There could be no more Classicism, only   and  . At the end of the show we find a bronze caldron, made somewhere in the Greek world during the Augustan years: its basic form is   but from its surface a little satyr pops out like a     snaps his fingers and smiles a gleaming silver inlaid smile. And at a late date we find one of the exhibition’s most moving portraits, the bronze head of a young African king named Juba II, on loan from the Archaeological Museum of Rabat in Morocco. Juba’s father, the king of Numidia, had killed himself after losing a battle against Julius Caesar in Africa. The boy was brought to Rome as part of the victory spoils, paraded through the streets, then raised in the imperial household. Augustus eventually made him ruler of the African lands to which he was already the natural heir. Records tell us that Juba remained close to Augustus and lived a long life as a loyal Roman citizen. In the portrait, though, as intimate and unguarded as a snapshot, he’s still young, somewhere in his teens. He stares off as if lost in thought. His lip curls in something like anger. His face swells as if he were about to cry.",0
10365,Sexual Abuse Claims in English Youth Leagues Prompt Wider Inquiry by Authorities - The New York Times,"England’s Football Association, which remained largely silent for almost two weeks as former players came forward with accusations of sexual abuse by coaches in the country’s soccer development system, announced Sunday that it was broadening an internal investigation into the claims. The F. A. the governing body for soccer across England, said it had appointed Kate Gallafent, a lawyer with experience in sexual abuse cases, to oversee the internal investigation, which had not been revealed before. The F. A. also said it was working closely with the police in pursuing the claims. At least six former players have said publicly that they were molested as boys in the youth programs, and the head of the English soccer players’ union said Sunday that nearly two dozen more former players had come forward privately. Until now, the F. A. had made little public comment on the revelations other than to say it had set up a telephone help line for victims of abuse. “The internal review will look into what information the F. A. was aware of at the relevant times around the issues that have been raised in the press, what clubs were aware of, and what action was or should have been taken,” the association said in a statement Sunday. The scandal has grown out of an interview with Andy Woodward, a former player with the   Crewe Alexandra, that was published by The Guardian on Nov. 16. In the article, Woodward said he had been sexually abused by Barry Bennell, who has been convicted of sexual abuse charges in both Britain and the United States. Bennell worked as a scout and coach for a number of clubs, including Crewe, across England’s North West during the 1980s. Woodward, now 43, said the abuse began when he was 11 and was invited to stay at Bennell’s house. He said Bennell had silenced him during the years of abuse with threats of further violence and of undermining his prospective soccer career. Woodward said that Crewe had failed in its “duty to protect” those children under its care. Four more former players have since said that they had been victims of Bennell. Steve Walters, another former Crewe player, said that reading Woodward’s account had persuaded him to reveal that he had been abused for a year, until he was 14. David White, who would go on to the English national team, and Jason Dunford both recounted abuse, or attempted abuse, while playing for a junior team in Manchester called Whitehill that was run by Bennell. A fourth former player, Ian Ackley, said he had been raped “hundreds of times” while playing amateur soccer in Derbyshire. The allegations against coaches have spread beyond Bennell. Paul Stewart, who played for Liverpool and England, said he had been abused by another coach for four years. And on Sunday, Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, the players’ union, told the BBC that as many as 20 players have come forward with information. Many, he said, have chosen to remain anonymous for now. At least four police forces across the country  —   in Northumbria, Hampshire and Cheshire as well as the Metropolitan Police in London  —   have announced that they are conducting inquiries into sexual offenses in soccer clubs. Various clubs, including Manchester City, Newcastle United, Blackpool and Leeds United, have said they will cooperate with any inquiries. Crewe’s initial response to Woodward’s claims was to offer no comment. The club’s longstanding technical director, Dario Gradi, who worked with Bennell, said he had been instructed by his superiors not to discuss the issue. Only after a former director, Hamilton Smith, revealed  Thursday that he had informed the club of his concerns about Bennell at the time did Crewe announce that it planned to set up an internal investigation to determine what, if anything, the club had known during the period when Bennell was accused of abusing young players. Bennell worked with Crewe until 1992. He was arrested two years later while working in Florida, and he was convicted of raping a British boy at a soccer camp there. After his conviction in the United States, Bennell was deported to England and convicted, in 1998, on charges dating from 1978 to 1992, with another 22 charges left on file. He was jailed for nine years. In May 2015, Bennell was ordered to serve two more years for sexual offenses against a    boy that the authorities said dated to 1980. In its statement on Sunday, the F. A. said it had begun its investigation “with acknowledgment that a   inquiry may be required in time. ” The accusations of abusing children echo those against other authority figures connected to powerful institutions, including Roman Catholic priests, coaches in U. S. A. Swimming and Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at Penn State. Woodward has suggested that Bennell’s case could prove similar to that of Jimmy Savile, a British television personality who was found, after his death in 2011, to have committed many sexual crimes during a career that lasted decades. A   investigation of that case concluded, in a scathing   report, that Savile’s employers at the BBC had done little to stop his abuse of minors despite a history of complaints against him.",0

10367,Butter and Shrimp Make Holiday Magic - The New York Times,"Before I ever tucked into a dish of potted shrimp, I’d always imagined it to be the kind of thing a British vicar might be offered when he stopped to call on a pair of elderly sisters for tea. Wholesome and nourishing, but not at all sexy. My first taste, at a seafood restaurant in London, threw that idea on its head. The tiny pink shrimp were succulent and plump, bursting with brininess. Even better, they were coated in golden butter  —   not melted, but semifirm at room temperature  —   which turned velvety when plopped on the hot toast served alongside. From my American perspective, it was a bit like a lobster roll, but with even more of a textural contrast between the crunchy brown toast and the tender shrimp. Historically, shrimp, as well as other seafood and meats, were potted as a way to preserve them. The cooked shrimp were put into crocks or ramekins and covered in spiced, clarified butter, which sealed them from contact with air. Back at home, I set out to recreate the dish, but with a few changes. The most necessary one was the shrimp itself. In Britain, potted shrimp is made from small brown shrimp, an intensely saline local delicacy that we can’t get here. Sweet Maine shrimp would make an excellent substitute were it not for the fact that the fishing season was canceled this winter because of diminished stocks, resulting from rising ocean temperatures. I used wild shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico and cut them into pieces, which worked well. Use the best quality shrimp you can get. Next, I increased the spices in the butter. Traditionally, a bit of mace, a hint of pepper and a trace of anchovy suffice. In my recipe, I use all three, along with cayenne, garlic and thyme. I also added a pinch of celery seed, inspired by lobster rolls. With modern refrigeration, you no longer need to clarify butter, which removes its water content, to improve its preserving abilities. And so you may think you can skip that step here. You can, but you shouldn’t. With its smooth, satiny texture, the clarified butter cap is an elegant contrast to the soft shrimp below. Potted shrimp is an extremely rich dish  —   think of it like a shrimp pâté  —   so serve small portions as an appetizer either before a light meal, or with a big salad as your meal. Or tap into your inner vicar, and have it with tea. Recipe: Spiced Potted Shrimp",0

Now, in the interest of full disclosure , when the Kenyan-born and Muslim-raised Barack Hussein Obama was elected, I declared he would “never be my president”. And for the entire time of his presidency I wrote over 1,300 articles exposing him and his Marxist plan for America. Let this website be my witness to that. This is how I exercised my Constitutional right to free speech. But at no time did I ever protest in the streets, ever threaten another human being, and I never used the global platform of NTEB to ever call for physical violence of any kind ever. 
Why not? 
Because though I despised the anti-American president Obama, I still loved America and the ideals she stood for. I saw myself as a patriot in exile, but still teared up every time I heard the National Anthem or read about a soldier’s heroic sacrifice on a foreign battlefield. These anti-Trump protesters that are clogging city streets at this very moment hate America, hate what this nation stands for, and seek to destroy it and us. They preach “love” while they shoot innocent people in the streets, they demand “tolerance” while offering none. They accuse Trump of having a “dark vision” for America while carrying out despotic deeds of darkness no Trump supporter would ever even dream of. Whitney Houston – Star Spangled Banner

10369,Trump Signs Executive Order Unwinding Obama Climate Policies - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, flanked by company executives and miners, signed a   executive order on Tuesday to nullify President Barack Obama’s climate change efforts and revive the coal industry, effectively ceding American leadership in the international campaign to curb the dangerous heating of the planet. Mr. Trump made clear that the United States had no intention of meeting the commitments that his predecessor had made to curb   carbon dioxide pollution, turning denials of climate change into national policy. At a ceremony, Mr. Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to start the complex and lengthy legal process of withdrawing and rewriting the   Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of   power plants, frozen construction of new plants and replaced them with vast new wind and solar farms. “C’mon, fellas. You know what this is? You know what this says?” Mr. Trump said to the miners. “You’re going back to work. ” Throughout the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to roll back Mr. Obama’s major climate change policies, a set of ambitious E. P. A. regulations to curb greenhouse pollution from   power plants. He made clear that American leadership in the global campaign against climate change would take a back seat to his commitment to energy industry jobs. With his order to move forward with the rollback, climate diplomats around the world maneuvered to fill the vacuum left by the exit of the globe’s   climate polluter. “There are countless countries ready to step up and deliver on their climate promises and take advantages of Mr. Trump’s   to reap the benefits of the transition to the   economy,” said Laurence Tubiana, the chief French negotiator of the 2015 Paris agreement, the landmark accord that committed nearly every country to take action to reduce   emissions. Over all, the goal of the Paris deal is to keep the planet from warming more than 3. 6 degrees, the point at which scientists say the earth will be irrevocably locked into a future of severe droughts, floods, rising sea levels and food shortages. Mr. Obama pledged that the United States would cut its emissions about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Carrying out the Clean Power Plan was essential to meeting that target. “This is not the time for any country to change course on the very serious and very real threat of climate change,” said Erik Solheim, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program. “The science tells us that we need bolder, more ambitious commitments. ” Mr. Trump has not yet decided whether to formally withdraw from the Paris agreement. But by rolling back the policies needed to meet American commitments, the United States essentially announced that it would not comply, whether the nation remains a signatory or not, experts said. “One of the greatest concerns is what other key countries, including China, India and Brazil, will do when the U. S. reneges on the Paris agreement,” said Robert Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard, mentioning some of the world’s other largest carbon dioxide polluters. “The   scenario is that the Paris agreement will unravel,” Mr. Stavins said. “That would be a great tragedy. ” Diplomats from some of the world’s other major economies say they intend to continue carrying out their climate change agreements, with or without the United States. But the Trump administration’s moves are likely to embolden opponents of climate action around the world. At the heart of the Paris accord was a breakthrough 2014 agreement between Mr. Obama and China’s president, Xi Jinping, in which the leaders of the world’s two largest polluting countries agreed to enact policies to cut their emissions. At the time, Mr. Obama offered the Clean Power Plan as evidence that the United States would meet its target. Their   deal was seen as the catalyst to bring other countries to the table to forge the Paris pact. If Mr. Trump reneges on his predecessor’s commitment, it could further fray a relationship that has become more tenuous since his election. “Getting to that point was not easy,” said Kelly Sims Gallagher, an expert on Chinese environmental policy at Tufts University who helped broker the   climate talks. “This undoes many years of work building up trust that the U. S. will honor the commitments it makes at the presidential level. ” Mr. Trump is tentatively scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi next week at    his Florida estate. Mr. Xi has signaled that he is prepared to move forward with his Paris pledge that China’s emissions will drop by or before 2030. Speaking at the Davos economic summit meeting in January, Mr. Xi said, “All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations. ” But experts say that without action from the United States, China’s efforts to curb emissions may slow. “It may empower business and political interests within China that still opposed climate action,” said Alex L. Wang, a legal scholar of Chinese environmental policies at the University of California, Los Angeles. The same dynamic could play out in India, the world’s   carbon dioxide polluter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked closely with Mr. Obama on climate change policies, but he did so against internal domestic pressures to prioritize economic development  —   including the provision of cheap   electricity to India’s rural poor. Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Modi by telephone on Tuesday, but aides declined to say if they discussed climate change. Harsh V. Pant, a research fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi, said Mr. Trump’s order would give the Indian government political space to delay some of its climate commitments. “It will slow down a little bit,” he said. Still, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump’s orders will fully vanquish Mr. Obama’s climate change legacy. Legal experts say it could take years for the E. P. A. administrator to carry out the process of withdrawing and revising the climate change regulations, and the process will be hit by legal challenges at every turn. A coalition of states, including New York and California, has already vowed to fight Mr. Trump. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York said he was preparing to challenge any effort to do away with regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. Such a move, he argued, violated the Clean Air Act, as well as established case law. “If they want to go back into the   process, we believe they are compelled under law to come up with something close to the Clean Power Plan,” he said. “They probably don’t want to hear this again,” he said, “but if they want to repeal, they have to replace. ”",0
10370,Violence Escalates Between Myanmar Forces and Rohingya - The New York Times,"SITTWE, Myanmar  —   Violence between the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim population, and Myanmar’s security forces escalated over the weekend as two soldiers were killed by crudely armed attackers, said government officials and Muslim residents. In retaliation, troops of the   government used helicopters to fire at the attackers in dense forest in northwestern Myanmar, a government spokesman said. The two soldiers were killed Saturday by attackers armed with guns, knives and spears near the village of Gwason, south of Maungdaw, the main town in northern Rakhine, said the state information officer, U San Nwe. About 500 attackers were involved in the clash, he said. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it impossible to verify the scale of the fighting. The remote enclave of northern Rakhine State, close to the Bangladeshi border, has been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for what it said were armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers in early October. Since then, human rights groups have received reports of killings of unarmed Rohingya men by Myanmar soldiers, rapes of Rohingya women by soldiers in a number of villages, and beatings of Rohingya men held in detention in the town of Maungdaw. Before the latest attack, as many as 100 Rohingya civilians may have been killed, the groups say. Western diplomats have called on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who leads Myanmar’s government, to conduct an independent investigation into the violence. So far, she has declined, allowing a Rakhine State committee to investigate. She has also urged that specific complaints be filed with a commission  headed by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, that was formed in August. Her spokesman, U Zaw Htay, said on Sunday that the latest attacks made it necessary for the military and police operation to continue until the culprits were arrested and the weapons they had seized were found. The troops have been instructed to respect human rights, he said. But Myanmar’s army is known to be poorly trained and has a record rife with human rights abuses, including rape, in its battles with various separatist groups over many years, Western diplomats say. Also on Saturday, a police car was hit by the blast from a roadside mine near the village of Kyikanpyin, north of Maungdaw, where five of the nine police officers were killed on Oct. 9, according to the Ministry of Information in Naypyidaw, the capital. No one was killed in the blast on Saturday. Reached by telephone in Maungdaw on Sunday, Mohammed Sultan, a retired Rohingya teacher, said some students had told him that their villages had been set on fire. “One of my pupils said he was hiding in the rice field,” Mr. Sultan said. The connection then went dead, he said.   satellite images taken in October and this month showed widespread burning of Rohingya villages, Human Rights Watch said on Sunday. Although relations between the Rohingya and the security forces have always been tense, the tactic of Rohingya men attacking police stations, targeting security forces and apparently planting roadside bombs is new, government officials and Rohingya activists say. The motivation for the increase in violence by what appears to be a small group of armed Rohingya men is not clear. The government, providing little proof, immediately blamed two   groups: Aqa Mul Mujahidin and the Rohingya Solidarity Organization. The   repression of the Rohingya by the Myanmar authorities made the population of about one million Rohingya fertile ground for Islamic radicalization, activists and diplomats say. Here in Sittwe, in southern Rakhine, more than 100, 000 Rohingya have been kept in what amount to internment camps for four years, prevented from traveling and forbidden to reclaim land and property destroyed during communal violence in 2012. The new violence north of Sittwe was worse than that four years ago, said Mohamed Saed, a community leader. “Then, it was communal violence between two groups: Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists,” he said. “This is now direct government repression. ” Several Rohingya leaders said they did not believe Rohingya ties to radical jihadists were the cause of the attacks five weeks ago. New, harsh proposals by the government may have been the catalyst, they suggested. In September, a Rakhine official, Col. Htein Lin, said the government would destroy all “illegally” built structures, including more than 2, 500 houses, 600 shops, a dozen mosques and more than 30 schools. U Kyaw Min, a Rohingya who is the chairman of the Democracy and Human Rights Party, said, “That was saying we have to reduce the population of Rohingya and push them over the border to Bangladesh. ” The attitude of officials in Rakhine State toward the Rohingya is unequivocal. They call the Rohingya “Bengalis,” implying that they belong in Bangladesh. A leader of the Arakan National Party, U Aung Win, said it was now necessary to form a special paramilitary force. The Rohingya make up more than 90 percent of northern Rakinine State’s population, outnumbering the Rakhine Buddhists, so more protection is needed for the Buddhist minority, Mr. Aung Win said. The two groups cannot live together, he insisted. Mr. Aung Win is also the chairman of the Rakhine State investigation into the Oct. 9 attacks. The Rohingya villages around Kyikanpyin have become armed camps, according to telephone conversations and text messages from villagers to friends in Sittwe. Food is scarce, and a strict    curfew is enforced, they say. In those areas, villagers say soldiers have raped women and stolen their jewelry. Three women, ages 23, 21 and 17, were raped Wednesday by soldiers living in the local school, said Mohamed Rahim, a village leader in Pyoung Pai, not far from Kyikanpyin. “The villagers were told to gather in the rice fields, but the three girls were told to stay in the house with their mother,” he said in a telephone interview. “Before the rape, they told the mother to get out. I then saw the military enter the house. ” Myanmar officials deny that rapes have occurred. “It’s not so easy to rape a Bengali woman,” Mr. Aung Win said. “All the Bengali villages are covered by bamboo netting and plastic. ” In a recent interview with the BBC, Mr. Aung Win said it was impossible that soldiers had raped the women because Rohingya “are very dirty. ” The question of the rapes is particularly sensitive. The Myanmar Times newspaper fired a journalist, Fiona MacGregor, for writing an article about alleged rapes of Rohingya women on Oct. 19.",0

The pyramids in Egypt were built in a surprising way: They used a chemical formula to prepare a concrete limestone with which shaped the million stone blocks used in its construction. They are man-made stone. So they not had to cut them in distant quarries and then bring them back without wheels and pulleys by the desert sands. Nor winched blocks weighing between 4 and 70 tons to the height of a 40-story building, then you assemble each other with such precision that does not fit the card from a deck in 5 of their faces; even impossible to achieve with current technology.

10372,Modern Technology Unlocks Secrets of a Damaged Biblical Scroll - The New York Times,"Nearly half a century ago, archaeologists found a charred ancient scroll in the ark of a synagogue on the western shore of the Dead Sea. The lump of carbonized parchment could not be opened or read. Its curators did nothing but conserve it, hoping that new technology might one day emerge to make the scroll legible. Just such a technology has now been perfected by computer scientists at the University of Kentucky. Working with biblical scholars in Jerusalem, they have used a computer to unfurl a digital image of the scroll. It turns out to hold a fragment identical to the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible and, at nearly 2, 000 years old, is the earliest instance of the text. The writing retrieved by the computer from the digital image of the unopened scroll is amazingly clear and legible, in contrast to the scroll’s blackened and   exterior. “Never in our wildest dreams did we think anything would come of it,” said Pnina Shor, the head of the Dead Sea Scrolls Project at the Israel Antiquities Authority. Scholars say this remarkable new technique may make it possible to read other scrolls too brittle to be unrolled. The scroll’s content, the first two chapters of the Book of Leviticus, has consonants  —   early Hebrew texts didn’t specify vowels  —   that are identical to those of the Masoretic text, the authoritative version of the Hebrew Bible and the one often used as the basis for translations of the Old Testament in Protestant Bibles. The Dead Sea scrolls, those found at Qumran and elsewhere around the Dead Sea, contain versions quite similar to the Masoretic text but with many small differences. The text in the scroll found at the   excavation site in Israel decades ago has none, according to Emanuel Tov, an expert on the Dead Sea scrolls at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “We have never found something as striking as this,” Dr. Tov said. “This is the earliest evidence of the exact form of the medieval text,” he said, referring to the Masoretic text. The experts say this new method may make it possible to read other ancient scrolls, including several Dead Sea scrolls and about 300 carbonized ones from Herculaneum, which were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A. D. 79. The date of the   scroll is the subject of conflicting evidence. A   measurement indicates that the scroll was copied around A. D. 300. But the style of the ancient script suggests a date nearer to A. D. 100. “We may safely date this scroll” to between A. D. 50 and 100, wrote Ada Yardeni, an expert on Hebrew paleography, in an article in the journal Textus. Dr. Tov said he was “inclined toward a   date, based on paleography. ” The feat of recovering the text was made possible by software programs developed by W. Brent Seales, a computer scientist at the University of Kentucky. Inspired by the hope of reading the many charred and unopenable scrolls found at Herculaneum, near Pompeii in Italy, Dr. Seales has been working for the last 13 years on ways to read the text inside an ancient scroll. Methods like CT scans can pick out blobs of ink inside a charred scroll, but the jumble of letters is unreadable unless each letter can be assigned to the surface on which it is written. Dr. Seales realized that the writing surface of the scroll had first to be reconstructed and the letters then stuck back to it. He succeeded in 2009 in working out the physical structure of the ruffled layers of papyrus in a Herculaneum scroll. He has since developed a method, called virtual unwrapping, to model the surface of an ancient scroll in the form of a mesh of tiny triangles. Each triangle can be resized by the computer until the virtual surface makes the best fit to the internal structure of the scroll, as revealed by the scanning method. The blobs of ink are assigned to their right place on the structure, and the computer then unfolds the whole   structure into a   sheet. The suite of software programs, called Volume Cartography, will become open source when Dr. Seales’s current government grant ends, he said. The   scroll was brought to Dr. Seales’s attention by Dr. Shor. A colleague, Sefi Porat, who had helped excavate the   synagogue in 1970, was preparing a final publication of the findings. He asked Dr. Shor to scan the scroll and other artifacts as part of a project to create images of all Dead Sea scroll material, and showed her a box full of lumps of charcoal. “I said, ‘There is nothing we can do because our system isn’t geared toward these chunks,’ ” she said. But because she was submitting other objects for a   scan, she put one of the lumps in with other items. Dr. Shor had the lump scanned by a commercially available,   based,   tomography machine, of the kind used for   scanning of biological tissues. Knowing of Dr. Seales’s work, she sent him the scan and asked him to analyze it. Both were surprised when, after several refinements, an image emerged with clear and legible script. “We were amazed at the quality of the images  —   much of the text is as readable as that of unharmed Dead Sea scrolls,” said Michael Segal, a biblical scholar at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who helped analyze the text. The surviving content of the   scroll, the first two chapters of Leviticus, is part of a listing of the various sacrifices that were performed in biblical times at the temple in Jerusalem. Although some text has previously been identified in ancient artifacts, “the   manuscript represents the first severely damaged,   scroll to be unrolled and identified noninvasively,” Dr. Seales and his colleagues write in the journal  Science Advances. Richard Janko, a classical scholar at the University of Michigan, said the carbonized scrolls from Herculaneum were a small section of a much larger library at a grand villa probably owned by Julius Caesar’s    Lucius Calpurnius Piso. Much of the villa is still unexcavated, and its library could contain   works of Latin and Greek literature. Successful reading of even a single scroll from Herculaneum with Dr. Seales’s method would spur excavation of the rest of Piso’s villa, Dr. Janko said. Both Dr. Tov and Dr. Segal said that scholars might come to consider the   manuscript as a Dead Sea scroll, especially if the early date indicated by paleography is confirmed. “It doesn’t tell us what was the original text, only that the Masoretic text is a very ancient text in all of its details,” Dr. Segal said. “And we now have evidence that this text was being used from a very early date by Jews in the land of Israel. ”",0
10373,"Stock Market Rally Continues, With Records for Dow and S.&ampP. 500 - The New York Times","The markets reached another milestone on Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high. The broader Standard  Poor’s   index, a widely used benchmark for index funds, added to the record high it set on Monday. Both indexes have eclipsed peaks set in May 2015. The Dow, which is made up of just 30 stocks, is an older and   barometer of the market, but professional investors generally pay closer attention to the S. P. 500. The Dow rose 120. 74 points, or 0. 7 percent, to 18, 347. 67. That is 35 points higher than its previous record on May 19, 2015. The S. P. 500 gained 14. 98 points, or 0. 7 percent, to 2, 152. 14. The Nasdaq composite rose 34. 18 points, or 0. 7 percent, to 5, 022. 82. The Dow and S. P. 500 are each up 5. 3 percent for 2016, having roared back after a big drop in January and early February. The S. P. has soared 17. 7 percent since reaching a low of the year of 1, 829 on Feb. 11. The Nasdaq still lags the other two main United States stock market indexes. But the index, which is heavily weighted with technology and biotech stocks, erased its losses for the year on Tuesday. Investors continued to show an appetite for taking on risk. The biggest gainers included materials companies, banks and energy companies, which have been benefiting from a recovery in the price of oil. Financial companies, which have lagged the market this year, have been rising in recent days as   interest rates move higher in the bond market. Higher rates mean banks can make more money from lending. Citigroup gained $1. 15, or 2. 7 percent, to $43. 44. Despite recent increases, however, bond yields remain near historical lows, a worrisome sign to many analysts. Just last week, the yield on the   Treasury note touched a record low. “I wish we can be celebrating, but it’s a little disconcerting,” said Rob Bartenstein, chief executive of Kestra Private Wealth Services. “You’ve got government bonds at historical lows and equity markets at historical highs. That’s not something you see at the same time. ” He added: “I feel underinvested, but I’m not willing to chase stocks. ” Sectors that investors tend to favor when they’re nervous  —   including utilities, phone companies and makers of consumer staples  —   all fell as investors moved money out of   assets. Bond prices also fell sharply, sending yields higher. Shares of AMC Entertainment, the owner of the AMC theater chain, were up 7 percent after it said it would buy the European movie theater operator Odeon  UCI Cinemas Group from private equity firm Terra Firma in a deal valued at about 921 million pounds, or $1. 22 billion. AMC said the transaction would make it the biggest movie theater operator in the world. Seagate Technology surged $5. 26, or 21. 8 percent, to $29. 35 after forecasting strong sales. It also announced it would cut 6, 500 jobs, about 14 percent of its total work force. Benchmark United States crude added $2. 04 to close at $46. 80 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a standard for international oil prices, rose $2. 22 to $48. 17 a barrel in London. In other energy trading in New York, wholesale gasoline rose 5 cents, to $1. 43 a gallon heating oil rose 5 cents, to $1. 46 a gallon and natural gas rose 3 cents, to $2. 73 per 1, 000 cubic feet. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index jumped 2. 5 percent, a day after soaring 4 percent. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised new government spending to help jolt Asia’s   economy back to life now that his Liberal Democratic Party has won in parliamentary elections. Investors are betting that he will keep flooding the market with money by expanding bond purchases. The Kospi in South Korea edged up 0. 1 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1. 7 percent. In Europe, the CAC 40 in France rose 1. 6 percent, and the DAX in Germany added 1. 3 percent. The British FTSE 100 was flat. Shares of Nintendo jumped 12. 8 percent in Tokyo, fueled by the craze for Pokémon Go, a smartphone game that has become the   app in the Apple Store less than a week after its release in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the   Treasury note rose to 1. 51 percent from 1. 43 percent.

10374,Life: 6 Things That Happen In Every Jane Austen Story Ever,"6 Things That Happen In Every Jane Austen Story Ever Posted today Email Jane, we love ya, but maybe mix it up a little! 
1. Someone named Bullfinch comes back from vacation: If, in the middle of a tense dinner party between members of rival agrarian families, a man suddenly bursts through the wall wearing a Hawaiian shirt and carrying luggage, and someone in the back of the room shouts, “Hot damn! Bullfinch is back from vacation!” then you can be sure that you’re reading a Jane Austen novel. 
2. One chapter briefly digresses from the main storyline to describe a clever, bonnet-wearing mule: Literary scholars attribute Austen’s obsession with bonnet-wearing mules to the fact that whenever a publisher would pay Austen for her work, such an animal would immediately knock her down and eat all her money. Savvy readers know just to skip these chapters! 
3. Yorkshire County lifts up and moves itself a few inches further into the North Sea to try and crush skinny-dippers: Some say that, had Austen written another two novels, all the land of Yorkshire would’ve finally flattened the naked swimmers it’d always lusted to suffocate. 
4. Characters spend the entirety of a picnic trying to remember the word “picnic”: SISTER 1: I do believe the proper nomenclature is “dirt supper.”SISTER 2: Nonsense! Mother insists it is called a “scoundrel’s meal.”SISTER 3: Now, now, let us not be uncomely. I happen to know, as a matter of fact, that it is called a “porknock.” Every. Damn. Book! 
5. Abraham Lincoln always shows up at the main character’s home and asks to use the toilet: Did they even have toilets back then?!? Whether it’s Northanger Abbey or Mansfield Park , Sense And Sensibility or Persuasion , there’s always that part where Honest Abe is standing at the front door, holding his top hat over his crotch region and politely asking if he can “make disgrace” in the family commode.

10376,Google Silences Doubters With Blockbuster Quarter - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   It’s good to be Google. Sometimes it’s just plain great. Revenue regularly increases at a clip rarely achieved by firms of its size. The same goes for profits. Seven of its products have over a billion users, a scale unimaginable in the predigital era. A reorganization last year into a holding company called Alphabet, accompanied by some related   personnel moves, was unexpected but generally applauded. Investors and analysts see little in the short term to disrupt this happy state of affairs, which has pushed Alphabet’s value to more than $500 billion. Those sentiments were confirmed in its   earnings report, released Thursday after the market closed. It was even better than the rosy forecasts. Revenue rose to $21. 5 billion, about $750 million more than analysts were predicting and a 21 percent jump from a year earlier. Earnings per share after excluding certain items was $8. 42, or 39 cents more than forecasts. Last year, it was $6. 99. Celebration ensued. Alphabet’s shares, which drifted sideways during regular trading, immediately rose 4 percent after hours. In some ways, the quarter was the mirror image of the previous quarter, which was good but not as great as analysts hoped. That knocked the stock back and induced some    —   never far below the surface with even the best and most successful internet companies  —   that Google’s days of dominance in search and advertising might be on the verge of starting to wane. No such worries were on display on Thursday as executives talked to analysts. Google rose to fame and fortune on desktop searches, but the health of the company is now reflected in its presence on people’s phones, not only with advertising but also with its Android operating system. “The strength of the quarter is about mobile,” said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of the Google division where most of the company’s revenue and profits are made. “It’s transformed the way that people consume information, and Google’s products have become a central and   part of their experience. ” Last fall, Google revamped its ad formats and delivery, which have been powering the increase in revenue. The number of paid clicks in the second quarter increased 29 percent from last year, the same rate as in the first quarter. Aggregate cost per click fell 9 percent from 2015, the same drop as in the first quarter. Mr. Pichai’s lengthy prepared remarks took a   perspective, focusing on the importance of machine learning  —   software that adjusts to the user’s experience. It will be, he promised, the source of the next great innovations after the switch to mobile runs its course. He also made a reference to the latest game craze, Pokémon Go, “which I suspect a few of you are playing right now. ” Google had spun off Pokémon Go’s developer, Niantic, last year. The biggest complaint some shareholders can come up with is that Alphabet’s     moonshots  —   things like   cars and delivering goods by drone  —   are still in the early stages. Revenue for these “other bets” was $185 million, driven largely by Google Fiber the thermostat company, Nest and Verily, a life sciences company. Alphabet said it lost $859 million on “other bets” in the second quarter, more than the $660 million loss a year ago. Alphabet does not break down how many employees work at the moonshots, but in general the company’s head count is rising almost as fast as its revenue. More than 66, 000 people now work at the company, up nearly 17 percent over the last year. Some analysts predict that Google will sooner or later need innovation closer to home than its moonshots, somewhat in the mode of the ceaselessly inventive Amazon or Apple. “Amazon took their retailing platform and built a   stream of web services. Apple is increasingly talking about money from services, not just hardware,” said Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester Research. “Google needs things that expand beyond advertising to give it greater breadth. ” A more immediate problem could be European regulators, who unveiled another round of charges against the company earlier this month. The accusations involve Google abusing its dominance in search, advertising and Android. Google disputes the charges. Google could eventually be forced to pay   fines. It would not miss the money but if the cases succeed in distracting the company and tempering its innovations, that could be a real problem for management and ultimately shareholders. On Thursday, no one seemed unduly worried about this possibility.",0
10377,Leaders Struggle to Unite House Republicans Behind Health Bill - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act faced an uncertain fate on Wednesday as conservative Republicans pushed to eliminate federal requirements that health insurance plans provide certain benefits to consumers. House Republican leaders met with members of their party late into the night on Wednesday as they struggled to muster support for the bill, scheduled for a vote on the House floor on Thursday. President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, worked through the day to placate conservative House Republicans who said that the bill did not do enough to lower health insurance costs by reducing federal regulations. The legislation would roll back major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a significantpillar of President Barack Obama’s legacy. But in trying to satisfy conservatives, the Trump administration and House Republican leaders risked jeopardizing support for the bill among more moderate Republicans. On the eve of the crucial vote, party leaders appeared to be short of a majority and were working into the night to whip their members into line. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, expressed optimism on Wednesday night that talks with Republican leaders would lead to revisions to the bill. “We’re encouraged tonight, just based on the real willingness of not only the White House, but our leadership, to make this bill better,” Mr. Meadows said, crediting the personal involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. But Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a leader of a moderate bloc of lawmakers known as the Tuesday Group, said late Wednesday night that he would oppose the bill. “I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for    income and older individuals,” Mr. Dent said. And the powerful conservative network funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch issued a direct challenge to the president and said that it would provide financial support to members who voted against the plan. “We will stand with lawmakers who keep their promise and oppose this legislation,” said James Davis, executive vice president of Freedom Partners, the umbrella organization responsible for the Koch brothers’ political efforts. About two dozen conservative Republicans, including Freedom Caucus members, met Wednesday with top administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. “I don’t think they changed any minds,” Representative Randy Weber, Republican of Texas, said after the meeting. The tenacity and persistence of the conservatives appeared to give them outsize influence as Mr. Ryan struggled to round up votes for the repeal bill, which faces solid opposition from House Democrats. Supporters of their bill have put their faith in Mr. Trump, whose young presidency could be badly damaged by a public and consequential loss. “When the president calls someone and says, ‘I need your vote on this,’ it’s very hard to say no to the president of the United States when this torpedoes our entire conference, Trump’s entire presidency, and we end up losing the Senate next year and we lose members in the House,” said Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and a top Trump supporter in the House. But conservative opposition was over substance, not politics. Conservatives are upset over the failure of the House bill to repeal a set of regulations in Mr. Obama’s signature health law, which require insurers to cover a base set of benefits, like maternity care, preventive services, wellness checkups and rehabilitative services. These “essential health benefits” raise the cost of insurance and prevent companies from offering   options, the conservatives say. “How can you talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, without repealing the essential health benefits?” asked Representative Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican who attended the meeting with Mr. Pence. Republican leaders say that if the House makes such changes to the bill, it could imperil their ability to push the legislation through the Senate using expedited procedures that neutralize the threat of a filibuster. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, likened the swirling cloud of uncertainty to the situation in November 2003, when the House approved a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare after a   vote that lasted nearly three hours in the middle of the night. The bill passed, 220 to 215, after House Republican leaders put down a conservative rebellion. “It’s tough to pass controversial things, especially when Republicans have different ideas,” Mr. Simpson said. Eventually, he predicted, House leaders will get the votes they need, though they may need to tweak the repeal bill. Representative Scott DesJarlais, Republican of Tennessee, said the administration tried to sell the House bill, known as the American Health Care Act, by arguing that it could be improved later in the Senate. But House members rarely relish handing their political fate to the other chamber. “I am more skeptical,” Mr. DesJarlais said. “I like to see what I’m going to get when I vote for it, not promises that I get later. ” Asked if supporters of the bill had the votes to pass it in the House, Mr. DesJarlais said, “I don’t think they do. ” A spokeswoman for the Freedom Caucus, Alyssa Farah, said that more than 25 members of the caucus were “no” votes on the health care measure  —   enough to sink the bill in the House, though that count could not be independently verified. Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, said that despite recent changes to the health care bill, he was unable to vote for it. “This legislation simply won’t lower premiums as much as the American people need, and lowering the cost of coverage is my primary goal,” said Mr. Harris, an anesthesiologist and member of the Freedom Caucus. House leaders were also contending with opposition from more moderate Republicans worried about the toll that the health bill could take in their districts. Representative Dan Donovan of New York, who attended a meeting at the White House with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, said Wednesday that he would vote against the bill. “Recognizing that the status quo is failing isn’t, on its own, a compelling reason to vote ‘yes’ on the current replacement plan,” said Mr. Donovan, the only Republican House member from New York City. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he was sure the House would pass the repeal bill. “Slowly but surely we’re getting there,” he said. “There is no Plan B. There’s Plan A and Plan A. We’re going to get this done. ”",0

There are some who like to say that evolution is merely a theory and that man was created by God. The debate between the opposing ideas of evolution versus creationism have been going on for decades, and will probably never end, despite the fact that science conclusively proves evolution to be real and verifiable. 
Perhaps nothing proves evolution more than the existence of vestigial structures. Vestigial structures are what can best be called evolution’s leftovers. They are body parts that have outlived the context through which they came to be. 
As this video from Vox proves, we carry these structures with us each and every day, and they should remind us of just how incredible and adaptable the human form truly is.

10379,Trump Just Revealed He’s Going To End ALL Federal Clean Energy Development,"Comments 
Republicans have successfully conducted an entire primary and general election without addressing a single key issue on the campaign trail. Now that we’re just days from the election ending, Donald Trump’s campaign has finally addressed climate change – by planning to cut $100 billion dollars in climate change spending, presumably to pay for the ridiculous tax cuts to the rich he proposes. 
It’s been days since the Trump campaign policy was unveiled, but the mainstream media hasn’t even noticed. Most major media outlets who consider themselves “objective” are interested in “FBI has become Trumplandia” drama, more than this vitally important policy matter that might actually inform voters. Luckily, Bloomberg noticed and reports : 
Donald Trump says he would save $100 billion over eight years by cutting all federal climate change spending—a sum his campaign says would be achieved by eliminating domestic and international climate programs. 
“We’re going to put America first. That includes canceling billions in climate change spending for the United Nations, a number Hillary wants to increase, and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure including clean water, clean air and safety,” the Republican presidential candidate said Oct. 31 at a rally in Warren, Mich. “We’re giving away billions and billions and billions of dollars,” he said. The Trump campaign did not give a specific tally to account for the $100 billion total in response to a query from Bloomberg BNA. 
But in an e-mail, the campaign press office said that the figure combined an estimate of what the Obama administration had spent on climate-related programs, the amount of U.S. contributions to an international climate fund that Trump would cancel, and a calculation of what Trump believes would be savings to the economy if Obama’s and Clinton’s climate policies were reversed. The Trump campaign said the $100 billion total included $50 billion, or what it estimated the Obama administration has spent on programs related to climate change. “Eliminating that spending will save similar amounts over the Trump administration,” it said. 
Trump and his elected Republican supporters have spent this entire election practicing the art of political distraction by choosing a reality TV clown for President, and it’s worked perfectly on the mainstream media who have ignored actual policy for months, feasting on the high ratings of substantive debates about plagiarism, pussy grabbing and Putin. 
This story is important for any voter who’s not sure what you’re getting between the two parties, or torn between a third-party and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. While a third-party might promise the moon and the stars, letting Republicans take over the Oval Office with Trump guarantees that climate change efforts will be defunded, quickly. 
The first beneficiary of that kind of environmental know nothing-ism would be the Koch Brothers, oil companies and the wealthiest of the wealthy who will get the savings on their tax bills when Trump slashes every form of taxation on the rich to benefit himself and the top 1% of earners. 
Let your undecided voter friends know about this travesty which must be stopped on November 8th.",0

10381,Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton’s Campaign?,"in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests “And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her.” I realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. In fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled “ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside “… So what should the Democrats do now? If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th… If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. Who would they choose? Let’s take a look at the top five options… #1 Tim Kaine He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton’s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. #2 Joe Biden Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run … Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. But according to the vice president, the short answer is “no.” The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. Unfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. Biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn’t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. Biden would probably represent the “safest” choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. #3 Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. First of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. Secondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. Thirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be “another McGovern” and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. So even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. #4 Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the “Bernie Sanders” wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. So she is definitely a possibility. But she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as “another McGovern” because of her far left policies. #5 Michelle Obama One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. And these days Barack Obama’s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as “the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign” in a recent MSN article entitled “ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice “… The speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama’s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. “When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. “We know she didn’t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.” If I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. In the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. And if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. Submit your review",0
10382,"Biden Gets a Job, and Obama Goes Kitesurfing - The New York Times","For anyone wondering how former President Barack Obama is adjusting to life under the Trump administration, know this: He seems to be doing just fine. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, took a vacation to the British Virgin Islands, where they have been hosted by Richard Branson, the chief executive of the Virgin Group. On Tuesday, Mr. Branson published a blog post, along with photos and video, showing Mr. Obama learning to kitesurf. Yes, he seems to be doing just fine. Mr. Branson wrote that Mr. Obama spent two days learning how to stay afloat and navigate kitesurfing. “Being the former president of America, there was lots of security around, but Barack was able to really relax and get into it,” Mr. Branson wrote. While Mr. Obama was enjoying the wind and the waves, his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced details of his   work. Mr. Biden will lead the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a new effort “focused principally on diplomacy, foreign policy and national security,” the university  announced on Tuesday. Mr. Biden said in a statement: “The Penn Biden Center and I will be engaging with Penn’s wonderful students while partnering with its eminent faculty and global centers to convene world leaders, develop and advance smart policy, and impact the national debate about how America can continue to lead in the 21st Century. ” The center will be in Washington, but Mr. Biden will also have an office on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, which is a short Amtrak ride away in Philadelphia. The campus is also a fairly short trip from Delaware, where Mr. Biden served as a senator for 36 years and where he maintains deep roots. He will also be working with the University of Delaware, his alma mater. The university announced on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would be the founding chairman of the Biden Institute, which it described as “a new research and policy center focused on developing public policy solutions on issues ranging from economic reform and environmental sustainability to civil rights, criminal justice, women’s rights and more. ” The former vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, intend to split time between a lakeside home in Greenville, Del. a Wilmington suburb, and a home in Washington. Dr. Biden plans to continue teaching English at a community college in Northern Virginia. The couple previously announced the creation of the Biden Foundation as a platform to advance priorities like military families, preventing violence against women and a “moonshot” to cure cancer.",0
10383,BREAKING: Jury Reaches Decision on Oregon Wildlife Refuge Militia Leaders,"Pinterest 
The leaders of the militia who temporarily occupied a national wildlife refuge in Oregon have been acquitted on charges related to the standoff. 
The 41-day “occupation” brought heightened attention to a decades-long dispute over control of federal lands in the U.S. West. 
A jury in Portland found brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy not guilty of possession of a firearm in a federal facility and conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, some 300 miles southeast of Portland, The New York Post is reporting . 

Despite this acquittal, the brothers are still expected to stand trial in Nevada early in 2017, on charges stemming from another controversial standoff with federal authorities. The feds rounded up cattle at their father Cliven’s ranch in 2014, alleging unpaid grazing fees, but they faced armed protesters. 
The brothers are part of a Nevada ranching family embroiled in a lengthy fight over the use of public range, and their occupation drew an international spotlight to a uniquely American West dispute: federal restrictions on ranching, mining and logging to protect the environment. The U.S. government, which controls much of the land in the West, says it tries to balance industry, recreation and wildlife concerns to benefit all. 
“We are just so excited,” Angie Bundy, Ryan’s wife, told the Guardian after the verdict was announced. “We’ve been praying hard, and we knew they hadn’t done anything wrong.” 
The Post is reporting that the trial seemed like an open-and-shut case. There was no dispute that the group actually seized the refuge, established armed patrols, and vetted visitors. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, this case is not a whodunit,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Ethan Knight said in his closing argument, arguing that the group decided to take over a federal workplace that didn’t belong to them. 
But federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized at the standoff, testifying to 16,636 live rounds and 1,700 spent casings were found. 
Despite the evidence, the brothers were found not guilty, suggesting that the jury – along with the American people – are growing weary of continued government interference in local land use issues.",0
10384,"Mark Zuckerberg Covers His Laptop Camera. You Should Consider It, Too. - The New York Times","Mark Zuckerberg is one of the most powerful men in the world because billions of people give Facebook, which he founded, free access to their personal data. In return, users receive carefully curated snapshots of his life: baby photos, mundane office tours and the occasional 5K. On Tuesday, observers were reminded that Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, is not just a normal guy who enjoys running and quiet dinners with friends. In a photo posted to his Facebook account, he celebrated the growing user base of Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. An   Twitter user named Chris Olson noticed that in the image’s background, his laptop camera and microphone jack appeared to be covered with tape. Other publications, including Gizmodo, used the tweet to raise the question: Was this paranoia, or just good practice? The   camera and microphone jack are usually a signal that someone is concerned, perhaps only vaguely, about hackers’ gaining access to his or her devices by using   trojans  —   a process called “ratting. ” (Remote access is not limited to ratters: According to a cache of National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, at least two   programs were devised to take over computer cameras and microphones.) Security experts supported the taping, for a few good reasons: • The first is that Mr. Zuckerberg is a   target. “I think Zuckerberg is sensible to take these precautions,” Graham Cluley, an online security expert and consultant, wrote in an email Wednesday. “As well as intelligence agencies and conventional online criminals who might be interested in targeting his billions, there are no doubt plenty of mischievous hackers who would find it amusing to spy upon such a   figure. ” • The second is that covering photo, video and audio portals has long been a basic and cheap security safeguard. “Covering the camera is a very common security measure,” Lysa Myers, a security researcher at the data security firm ESET, said in an email. “If you were to walk around a security conference, you would have an easier time counting devices that don’t have something over the camera. ” • Third, Mr. Zuckerberg is not immune to security breaches. A recent  hacking of his Twitter and LinkedIn accounts shows that he most likely committed two basic privacy faux pas: He may have used the same password across several websites and did not use   authentication. Judging from his photo, however, it appears that Mr. Zuckerberg was taking simple precautions to protect himself from anyone who may try to gain remote access. The practice is fairly technologically simple: Hackers trick people into clicking on links or unfamiliar websites containing malware that allows them access to the devices. Mr. Zuckerberg is not the only   case: James Comey, the director of the F. B. I. told students at Kenyon College in April that he also puts tape over his computer’s webcam, for surprisingly simple reasons, according to NPR: “I saw something in the news, so I copied it,” Mr. Comey said. “I put a piece of tape  —   I have obviously a laptop, personal laptop  —   I put a piece of tape over the camera. Because I saw somebody smarter than I am had a piece of tape over their camera. ” People who are not billionaires or   government officials are not without risk, said Stephen Cobb, a senior security researcher at ESET. “For people who are not C. E. O. s, the threat is people scanning the internet for accessible webcams for a range of motives, from voyeurism to extortion,” Mr. Cobb wrote in an email. Experts don’t have a good estimate for how often such attacks occur, but according to a 2015 report released by the nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance, the practice is a growing problem for consumers, especially young women. The report also said that trojans account for some 70 percent of all malware. “They’ve been one of the most popular types of malware on every operating system, for quite a long time,” Ms. Myers, of ESET, said. “The best ways to protect against them are to update all your software on your machine regularly, and use reputable security software, including   and a firewall. ”",0
10385,How Liberian Women Delivered Africa’s First Female President - The New York Times,"MONROVIA, Liberia  —   Bernice Freeman was chatting with some market women, trying to explain why it was so important that they leave their food stalls to vote for the first woman to be elected president of an African country, when she noticed some boys laughing nearby, waving something white. It was October 2005, the first presidential election after 15 years of a hideous civil war in Liberia. On the ballot was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a   global technocrat with so much government experience it practically oozed from her pores, and a group of men, most notably the professional soccer player George Weah. Like many of the 1. 5 million women in Liberia who had survived the civil war, Ms. Freeman had personally witnessed acts of violence so brutal she still had nightmares. Soldiers had gutted her    cousin.   rebels wearing Halloween masks had murdered her friends. Ms. Freeman herself had knelt in the dirt, praying, while henchmen loyal to the president had chambered rounds of their machine guns on orders to shoot her and the other women praying with her one afternoon. Ms. Freeman had seen it all. But even so, she was unprepared for the sight of the young men laughing nearby as she campaigned for a female president. The boys had taken women’s panties, had smeared the crotches with tomato paste and were waving them at the women  —   their unsubtle way of saying that a woman could not be president. But instead of making Ms. Freeman and the other women embarrassed, the heckling only angered them. “You know what?” one of the undecided women told Ms. Freeman, looking at the boys in disgust. “We will vote. Don’t worry, we will vote. ” And vote they did. Close to 80 percent of the Liberian women who flooded the polls during the country’s first postwar presidential election voted to usher a woman into power for the first time on a continent that for centuries had been the world’s most patriarchal. Eleven years before Pantsuit Nation became a secret Facebook group for women who supported Hillary Clinton in America and “I’m With Her” buttons and bumper stickers sprouted on lapels and S. U. V. s, the women of Liberia held a master class in how to get a woman elected president. Now, as the American women who supported Mrs. Clinton grapple with the whys of last November’s election, the story of how, 4, 500 miles away, the women of Liberia upended centuries of male rule to accomplish what their American counterparts could not has acquired a sharp and keen relevance. The Liberia story is one of extremes. It is almost as if for Liberians to contemplate installing a woman as president, the country needed to first go over a cliff so steep that there seemed nowhere left to drop. Mothers saw their children kidnapped, drugged and forced to take up arms in the country’s   civil war. More than 70 percent of Liberian women were raped during the war years. Starving young girls gnawed on tree bark for sustenance, while horrified children were forced to watch their sisters, mothers and grandmothers   in front of them. What happened in the war years so devastated Liberian women, who blamed the men who waged the war for the ensuing horrors, that many of them came to view Mrs. Sirleaf not necessarily as the better of the presidential candidates but, rather, as the only alternative to putting a man back in power in a place that men had just run into the ground. Masawa Jabateh, who had seen her    daughter die from malnourishment during the war, said her despair became infused with a blind fury when she saw men campaigning to be president in 2005, especially since the leading candidate was Mr. Weah. “Those men want put some grona boy in the chair who don’t know what we doing? So we can go back to war again? No,” she said. Her thought process was straightforward: She was “voting for woman,” she said. “Vote for Woman,” in 2005, became the de facto campaign slogan of Ms. Sirleaf’s run for the presidency. It all started on the morning of May 2, 2005, a week into the voter registration period for the looming presidential elections, when Vabah Gayflor, the minister for gender, woke up to discover that women had not been registering to vote. A string of men were tossing their hats into the ring for the presidency, including Mr. Weah, a renowned athlete who had won the Ballon d’Or and been named FIFA world player of the year and African player of the century. Unlike his rivals, Mr. Weah was not tainted by any association with those who had brought Liberia to ruin over the past 15 years, but he had no college education. (His listing of a bachelor’s degree in sports management from Parkwood University in London was a subject of a scandal after news accounts surfaced calling the school an unaccredited diploma mill requiring no actual study.) At the other end of the spectrum was Mrs. Sirleaf. A former finance minister and jailed dissident, she had a pedigree that included the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. She had transformed herself from an abused wife, cowering and hunched in the front seat of her husband’s car while he slapped her, to an international bureaucrat attempting what no woman had ever done before: winning, by popular vote, the right to lead an African country. To the Weah supporters, there was no contest. Grandmother versus soccer star? But to women like Ms. Gayflor, Ms. Jabateh and Ms. Freeman, there was also no contest. “You will take our country, our baby, and throw the baby away to football player? I beg you, no,” Ms. Gayflor said. Ms. Gayflor’s job as gender minister was supposed to be about helping women and children get access to health care, school feeding programs (in a postwar country with hardly any schools) and rape support. But she decided to redefine her role: getting a woman elected president. And she was not happy with the news from the National Elections Commission: Of the 100, 000 Liberians who had registered to vote in the first week of the monthlong registration drive, only 15 percent were women. Who was registering instead? Former combatants, from all the armed groups that had fought in the war. Ms. Gayflor was appalled. Huddling with Etweda Cooper, the women’s activist known throughout Liberia as “Sugars,” Ms. Gayflor knew they had to take action fast. The men were holding mass rallies. But market women didn’t have time to go to mass rallies. They were busy making market. Ms. Gayflor and Mrs. Cooper realized they would have to try a different strategy. Quickly they organized a group to use the radio stations to plead: “Women, oh women! Y’all got to register to vote. ” They fanned out to the Monrovia markets. At first, some of the market women balked they had their wares and their babies to tend. But Mrs. Cooper was ready for them with babysitters and stall tenders. “We will mind it for you,” she said. “Go register. ” It was not enough to stay in Monrovia. The Liberian bush loomed, large, imposing and filled with village women. The women bought bullhorns and scattered their troops along the road. “Women, oh women!” they yelled into the bullhorns. “Go register. ” By the end of the registration period, the final figures came out: Some 1. 5 million Liberians out of the country’s population of three million had registered to vote.   percent of those registered were women. Unlike American presidential campaigns, the Liberian campaign season begins two months before Election Day. Liberian election rules dictate that a winning candidate has to get 50 percent of the vote  —   a quirk that guaranteed that in a crowded field of 22 candidates, there would be a runoff. So the key for Mrs. Sirleaf was to survive the first round by coming in second at least, so that she would then stand alone against Mr. Weah. As a government minister, Ms. Gayflor was not allowed to show favoritism for any candidate, let alone campaign on one’s behalf. So she and Mrs. Cooper devised a strategy: They would present their efforts as simply an attempt to empower women. Ms. Gayflor would not sully her cabinet position by telling women whom to support. (She left that to Mrs. Cooper.) Instead, she would simply encourage women to exercise their right. She organized women’s rallies where she gave speeches exhorting the crowd to vote. “I’m not telling you who to vote for, women!” she said. “Just make sure you vote. ” Right after Ms. Gayflor spoke, Mrs. Cooper  —   not constrained by any neutrality vows  —   shouted at the crowd, “Vote for woman!” Everywhere, the women’s rallies followed the same script: Ms. Gayflor: “Women, oh women! If y’all got to tie your baby on your back soon in the morning, I beg y’all, go vote!” Mrs. Cooper: “Vote for woman!” Ms. Gayflor: “Even self your baby got   diapers, put it down, go vote!” Mrs. Cooper: “Vote for woman! At the rallies, the women passed out plastic bags of drinking water, a rare and precious commodity in a place where people regularly drank from unsanitary wells and dirty rivers. The rainy season was ending, but the air was still stewy when Election Day dawned. Of the 1. 5 million people registered to vote, some 900, 000 showed up at the polls. They came in wheelbarrows and wheelchairs. They came with babies on their backs. They came the night before, some sleeping on the hard ground outside the polling booths so they could vote when morning came. The results began to trickle in that night. As expected, Mr. Weah was in first place. But he wasn’t close to 50 percent. And Mrs. Sirleaf was right behind him, where she needed to be. Time for the real battle. The soccer player versus the    grandmother. The men fell in line behind Mr. Weah and complained that the women supporting Mrs. Sirleaf were sexist. Given the choice between a soccer player with no credible college education and a   development expert, the top male presidential candidates who fell short of the runoff, with one exception, endorsed the soccer player. In the meantime, Mr. Weah, honing a message explaining why he, and not Mrs. Sirleaf, should run Liberia, settled on an “educated people failed” theme. But what the men who endorsed that strategy failed to realize was how much that very idea was angering the market women. Those women may not have been educated themselves, but they worked in the fields and the market stalls to send their children to school. Now the men were telling them that education wasn’t important. Just as the men fell in behind Mr. Weah, the women fell in behind Mrs. Sirleaf. The market women went door to door, passing out   and fliers. They slept on the side of the road at night, curled up on their mats. They walked from village to village, calling out the now familiar mantra “Vote for woman!” Mr. Weah’s supporters responded by promising that if he lost, the country would go back to war. “No Weah, no peace!” they chanted. Thus the runoff started resembling past elections, like the one in 1985, in which Samuel Doe’s supporters had suggested the same thing: Vote for Mr. Doe or the country goes back to war. Except that in November 2005, this tactic appeared to have met its match. Because the women had their own tricks, tricks that would make Mr. Weah’s threats look like boys’ play. “You want beer? Just give me your voter ID card I will buy you beer. ” “I say, we buying voter ID cards, oh. Ten Liberty dollars for one. ” “Who looking for money? Just bring your voter ID card. ” A group of women had stationed themselves at a bar near a major intersection, luring young men in a   fashion. Except this time the women were the ones with the cash, and the young men were the ones with the commodity for sale. “Some of those boys were finish stupid,” a market woman, Nancy Nagbe, recalled with a smirk. “We were crafty, oh!” Many of the young men thought they were done with voting after the first round and didn’t understand that they would need their IDs again. Others knew and did not care late in the evening of a muggy hot day, the lure of a crisp, cold and malty Club Beer far outshone whatever benefits they thought their voter card could bring them. As for the ones who were too smart to sell their voter card  —   their mothers simply stole them, recalled one gender ministry official, Parleh Harris. One market woman said she sneaked into her son’s room while he was sleeping, slipped his voter ID out of his wallet and buried it in the yard. “Yeah, I took it. And so what?” the woman said. “That foolish boy, what he knew? I carried him for nine months. I took care of him. I fed him when he was hungry. Then he will take people country and give it away?” Ms. Gayflor, by now, was sailing perilously close to getting fired for illegally campaigning as a government minister. A few days before the runoff, she called a meeting in a room at the gender ministry. She invited every female political candidate, no matter what party she belonged to, along with market women, female lawyers and anyone else she could think of who lacked a Y chromosome. That night, in the stuffy room, the women all stood, one by one, and pledged to support Mrs. Sirleaf, who was so overcome afterward she could barely stand upright. “If I were a crying woman,” she said, “I would be crying right now. You have humbled me. ” The repercussions came the next day. Ms. Gayflor arrived at work to find reporters camped out on the ministry’s steps. The questions came furiously. Ms. Gayflor was past the point of backing down. “You take a former football player and give him our country?” she shot back. “Liberia is not a learning ground!” She had one last shot to fire. “Let me give you a goodbye statement,” the     minister said. “Mrs. Sirleaf will be the next president of this country. ” On Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2005, the people of Liberia went to the polls for the second time in four weeks. There was a palpable sense in the air that something big was happening. International observers stationed themselves at polling places and voting booths some 230 agencies, from the Carter Center to the European Union, showed up to chronicle the proceedings. Helicopters from the United Nations mission hovered overhead, a constant presence above the voting booth lines. But the helicopters could not see what was going on at a polling station in Sinkor. Helpful poll workers were allowing pregnant women and nursing mothers to cut to the front of the line. So Ms. Freeman  —   who had been heckled weeks before by the young men waving white panties smeared with tomato paste  —   and a handful of other women were passing around babies and toddlers. “You want borrow the baby?” Ms. Freeman grinned at one woman, sneaking a furtive look over her shoulder. “Put the baby on your back. ” To another woman, she advised: “Act pregnant. If they think you pregnant you can vote in front. ” It was unclear whether the poll workers noticed how many different women were carrying the same baby to vote on that Election Day in November 2005. And when the National Elections Commission, on Nov. 23, announced the election results  —   Mrs. Sirleaf’s 59. 4 percent to Mr. Weah’s 40. 6 percent  —   Ms. Freeman wore a smile on her face.",0
10386,Reviving ‘The Mikado’ in a Balancing Act of Taste - The New York Times,"One of the most passionately debated stage works of our time is a    operetta. Is Gilbert and Sullivan’s enduringly popular “The Mikado” a droll satire of Victorian England? A racist caricature of Japan? Some amalgam of the two? Recent revivals have ended up in the cross hairs of these questions, sparking protests across the nation, along with earnest wondering about how  —   and even if  —   this 1885 piece should be staged in the 21st century. When an outcry arose last year over a planned revival of the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ old production  —   which had featured a mostly white cast in yellowface makeup, and employed some ugly stereotypes to evoke the imaginary Japanese town of Titipu  —   the company initially responded by saying that it would scrap the makeup. Then, realizing that the complications were more than skin deep, it decided to scrap the entire staging and take a year to rethink its approach, diversify its cast and create a new show. The result will open on Wednesday at Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College in Manhattan. Finding the right balance is not easy: Some of the most severe critics of “The Mikado” find it too inherently offensive to be performed, while some ardent fans view any changes as bows to excessive political correctness. Shortly after the New York company announced it was replacing last year’s “Mikado” with “The Pirates of Penzance,” David Wannen, its executive director, received a letter from a   pirate who complained that he was offended that the troupe did not plan to cast real pirates. David Auxier, the director of the new “Mikado” production, recalled that “Sometimes the conversation got to be: ‘You’re never going to please everybody, so why try? ’” He added: “I said, ‘We’re starting from the understanding that we’re never going to please everybody. But we’re still going to try. ’” As the use of yellowface  —   which can refer not only to makeup, but to broader attempts at racial impersonation or caricature  —   has drawn protests at “Mikado” revivals from Seattle to New York, companies presenting it have responded with a variety of approaches. A   2013 staging by Skylark Opera and Mu Performing Arts in St. Paul inverted the libretto, setting the piece in England and casting   actors in key roles. This year, the Lamplighters Music Theater in San Francisco decided not to set its new production in Japan after local   performers threatened protests. Instead it moved the action to Renaissance Italy and changed the opening line from “If you want to know who we are, we are gentlemen of Japan” to “If you want to know who we are, we are gentlemen of Milan. ” A production by the   Gilbert and Sullivan Players this fall was set in a 1960s   hotel in Las Vegas to, as the organizers put it, “recontextualize the origins of the show in Japonisme and commodity racism. ” It still drew protests. In New York, emotions have run high on all sides. A Save the Mikado NYC Facebook page sprang up, calling for the operetta “to be performed exactly as conceived by Gilbert and Sullivan, with only a very small number of minor alterations that have been standard for over half a century. ” Another Facebook group, Artists Against The Mikado, was “dedicated to the controversial idea that minstrel shows where white people dress up as fake Japanese is a little out of date. ” The old “Mikado” production had used yellowface, and the troupe had invented a minor role, played by a child, that was credited as a “coolie,” which company officials said they had not realized was a slur. A 2004 version of the staging included “a man with a Fu Manchu mustache and impossibly long fingernails,” Josephine Lee, a professor of English and   Studies at the University of Minnesota, writes in her influential 2010 book, “The Japan of Pure Invention: Gilbert and Sullivan’s ‘The Mikado,’” which traces the work’s long, complex racial history. In an interview, Ms. Lee questioned the commonly heard defense that “The Mikado” should not be considered racist because it is meant in fun. “There are lots of instances in blackface minstrelsy that are lighthearted and funny  —   and also offensive,” she said. Before mounting their new “Mikado,” the New Yorkers sought advice, listened to critics and sent out casting calls that stressed a desire for diversity. At a forum held in November at the Kaye Playhouse, Jonathan Jenkins Ichikawa, a professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia who has performed in Gilbert and Sullivan works, noted that many of the most offensive elements of recent productions were invented by stage directors. “You don’t need to do a lot of violence to the work to not tape actor’s eyes back to make their eyes look ‘slanty,’” he said, recalling productions he had appeared in that did just that. So the New York company set about trying to strip away those elements. Like Mike Leigh’s 1999 film “” which told the story of Gilbert and Sullivan as they created “The Mikado,” the new production will firmly establish the operetta as a work of the Victorian imagination. A new prologue features the composer and librettist planning their next opera and admiring some Japanese objects. When a sword falls, knocking Gilbert unconscious, he dreams “The Mikado” proper, set in an imaginary Japan as conceived by a   Englishman. The production will emphasize the work’s satire of Victorian mores, and do away with racially charged performance tics and excessive bowing and shuffling in its choreography. While the ensemble would never be mistaken for, say, the multicultural cast of “Hamilton,” it is the troupe’s most diverse yet. Erin Quill, an   actress, wrote about the controversy last year on her lively blog, The Fairy Princess Diaries. Ms. Quill, who spoke at the company’s forum in November, said in an interview that she was “cautiously optimistic” about the new production. “Am I glad this conversation is happening?” she asked. “Absolutely. Do I wish this conversation had been 20 years ago? Of course. ”",0

10388,Clinton policy on Syria would lead to WW III: Trump,"Clinton policy on Syria would lead to WW III: Trump  57 am Clinton policy on Syria would lead to WW III: Trump Wed Oct 26, 2016 1:37AM US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Orlando Sanford International Airport on October 25, 2016 in Sanford, Florida. (Photos by AFP) 
US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton’s policy towards Syria would “lead to World War III”, arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into an armed confrontation with Russia. 
Trump made the warning in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, following Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” in Syria earlier this month. 
“What we should do is focus on ISIL (Daesh). We should not be focusing on Syria,” Trump said. 
“You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton,” he said. 
On October 7, the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. 
Clinton also described the situation in Syria as “incredibly complex” since the intervention of Russia. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at an early vote rally at Broward College in Coconut Creek, Florida, on October 25, 2016. 
“You’re not fighting Syria anymore; you’re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,” Trump said. 
The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. 
“Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,” Trump said. 
Russia might down US planes 
Meanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton’s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. 
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. James Clapper, the US director of National Intelligence, speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations, on October 25, 2016 in New York City. 
“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they — if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” he said. 
“I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they — why they did that,” Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. “The system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It’s very capable. And I don’t think they’d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.” 
During the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. 
A foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups — each supported by one foreign country or another — fighting the Assad government. 
Since 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. 
Instead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists, the air raids have killed many civilians, and caused extensive damage to the country’s infrastructure. 
Iran has been offering Syria advisory military help. Russia, another Syrian ally, has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in Syria at a request from Damascus. 
The foreign-sponsored conflict in Syria has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.",0
10389,Mexico’s Potential Weapons if Trump Declares War on Nafta - The New York Times,"How could Mexico inflict the most damage on the United States? In normal times this question would not be top of mind for Mexican policy makers. Mexican governments over the last   have consistently pushed back against the nation’s historical resentment toward the United States, hoping to build a more cooperative relationship with its overbearing northern neighbor. But these aren’t normal times. As President Trump prepares the opening gambit in his project to either renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or pull out, Mexico’s most important strategic goal is narrowing to one word: deterrence. It must convince Mr. Trump that if he blows up the trade agreement on which Mexico has staked its hopes of development, by weaving its economy ever more closely into that of the United States, the United States will suffer, too. The critical question is whether Mexico’s threat will be convincing. Mexico’s main challenge as it confronts a hostile Trump administration is the enormous asymmetry of the bilateral relationship. Ending Nafta would hurt the United States: Six million American jobs depend on exports to Mexico, according to Mexican officials. But to Mexico, it could prove devastating. Mexico has relied on the pact to draw foreign capital into the country, not only ensuring multinational companies stable access to the largest consumer market in the world but also guaranteeing that their investment is safe, noted Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City. The makings of a Mexican strategy for defending its interests started coming into focus on Monday, when President Enrique Peña Nieto declared that negotiations for a future relationship with the United States would not be limited to trade. “We will bring to the table all themes,” he said in a speech. “Trade, yes, but also migration and the themes of security, including border security, terrorist threats and the traffic of illegal drugs, weapons and cash. ” His hope is that by introducing broader uncertainty about the bilateral relationship  —   Will Mexico still cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking? Will it stop foreign terrorists from using Mexico as a way station into the United States?  —   Mexico can raise the stakes enough for Mr. Trump to reconsider his “America first” approach to commerce. “Mexico has a lot of chips to play,” said Jorge Castañeda, a former foreign secretary who has staked out a combative approach. Let Mr. Trump pull the United States out of Nafta, he argues. Instead of stopping Central American migrants at its southern border, Mexico should let them through on their way to the United States. “And let’s see if his wall keeps the terrorists out, because we won’t,” Mr. Castañeda added. The view from Mexico City is not uniformly bleak. Some analysts believe there is a potential for a situation in which a new Nafta benefits all. “I have always believed one should never let a good crisis go to waste,” said Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. “There is an opportunity that we could end up modernizing and improving Nafta. ” The view that there is a potential silver lining to Mr. Trump’s hostility toward Nafta is also popular in some Washington circles. The    agreement is due for some modernization anyway, if only to deal with things like data protection, online crime and    —   which were not around in the early 1990s. Nafta’s weak provisions on labor and environmental standards could also be improved. Many aspects of Nafta could be upgraded, trade experts say. It could do with new rules to open up government projects to bidders from all three Nafta partners. Allowing   trucking companies from Mexico and the United States into each other’s markets could make trade between the two more efficient. What’s more, the   border could benefit from more infrastructure investments to integrate energy networks, reduce clogged lines at border crossings and the like. Now that Mr. Trump has formally nixed the   Partnership, which would have tied North America and nine other nations from the Pacific Rim into one large trade bloc, some of its provisions could be drafted into a new North American deal. Gary Hufbauer of the   Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington suggests that the name “Nafta” be retired  —   it has a bad reputation. But a lot of its substance could remain, perhaps in the form of separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico. “Trump wants some easy victories,” Mr. Hufbauer pointed out. If he can score political points using his Twitter feed to persuade a few companies to keep jobs in the United States, why risk hurting the American economy by abandoning the North American trade deal? “Maybe that’s the reconciliation,” Mr. Hufbauer said. Still, it’s hard to reconcile the proposal for an improved, more effective trading pact in North America with Mr. Trump’s frequent portrayal of trade as a   game that inevitably shortchanges the United States. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, improving Nafta seems to mean eliminating Mexico’s trade surplus with the United States and limiting investment by American multinationals in Mexico. But one can’t quickly eliminate a $60 billion trade surplus with a new Nafta  —   not unless it has some incredibly draconian limits on imports or local content requirements that could be as damaging to Mexico as abandoning the pact altogether. Many Mexican officials fear that it is precisely this kind of draconian change that Mr. Trump has in mind. It would be politically profitable, at least in the short term. And it would signal toughness to China  —   a more formidable rival that is next on Mr. Trump’s list. If Canada stays out of the fray, cutting a separate deal with the United States to replace Nafta, Mexico would be left alone in an existential fight for its future. In this case, Mexico may have no choice but to raise the stakes and hope to arrive at the negotiating table with a threat at least as credible as Mr. Trump’s promise to pull out of the deal. Mr. Trump’s negotiating position does have some soft spots. For one, said Mickey Kantor, the American trade negotiator who concluded the Nafta negotiations during the Clinton administration, “he is under pressure to deliver a deal. ” If Mexico stands its ground and even allows Nafta to dissolve, it would send its own signal to China: Resistance is not futile. And Mr. Trump’s threat to raise tariffs against Mexico to 35 percent could easily be challenged under the rules of the World Trade Organization. This is, of course, a hugely risky strategy for Mexico. When Mr. Trump entered the presidential race in June 2015, a dollar was worth about 15 pesos. Now it’s worth about 22. A frontal confrontation with the United States might send it to 40, Mexican officials fear, fueling capital flight. And yet that may be Mexico’s strongest card. As noted by C. Fred Bergsten, director emeritus of the Peterson Institute, an irony of Mr. Trump’s approach to Mexico is that by weakening the peso so much, he is going to increase the bilateral trade deficit, increase Mexico’s competitiveness and make it more attractive for American companies to invest there. “That is going to swamp anything he achieves with his    efforts,” he added. That’s if Mexico manages to hold on. The more ominous situation is one in which the United States pushes too hard and Mexico  —   its economy, its unpopular government, its public order and political stability  —   buckles. The United States has enjoyed a peaceful southern border for 100 years, since Pancho Villa made his marauding raids into the Southwest during the Mexican Revolution. “That is worth pure gold in this and any other world,” Mr. Castañeda said. “Mexico’s best argument is ‘Don’t mess with that. ’”",0
