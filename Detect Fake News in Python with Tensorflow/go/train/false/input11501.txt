11523,AWESOME PHOTOS CAPTURE A “Badass” Trump And His Retired Navy Seal Cabinet Member On Horseback,"While visiting the USS Gerald R. Ford today docked at Newport News in Virginia where he gave a wonderful speech, President Trump was given an awesome new hat and bomber jacket. We think he looks pretty spectacular, and would go as far as to say that he looks like a pretty  badass  Commander In Chief. President Trump started his speech by saying:  They just gave me this beautiful jacket. They said  here Mr President, please take this home . I said  let me wear it . Here are a few photos from our Commander in Chief s visit aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford:We re pretty sure that most Americans are grateful that after 8 long years of the  me first  Commander in Chief, we re ready for someone who truly respects and honors the men and women who wear the uniform: And in other news, Trump s new badass Interior Department secretary and retired Navy Seal Ryan Zinke, caused quite a stir today when he showed up on horseback in DC on his first day on the job.On his first day on the job, the new Interior Department secretary, Ryan Zinke, proved he knows how to make an entrance: arriving high in the saddle on Tonto, an Irish sport horse. Mounted police escorted him a few blocks through Washington.Mr. Zinke, a fifth-generation Montanan who now oversees the country s 500 million acres of public land, including 59 national parks, showed up to work to a grand reception.Officers from various agencies under the Interior Department lined the steps to the administration building. A drummer from his home state s Northern Cheyenne tribe performed. The department is the liaison with federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native nations.Mr. Zinke, 55, served nearly two dozen years with the Navy SEALs before entering politics in 2008 as a Republican. After two terms in the Montana legislature, he was elected in 2014 as the state s at-large representative in the House, before his nomination to the cabinet by President Trump. He was confirmed on Wednesday by the Senate with a vote of 68-31. NYT s",0
11524,SORRY NANCY! Here’s PROOF Democrats Have NOTHING On Jeff Sessions [VIDEO],"Watch: Fox News' Catherine Herridge has the latest on AG Jeff Sessions and Russia. https://t.co/9s4PWKABvR pic.twitter.com/i0Djb4vSzB  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 2, 2017Several senators on both sides of the aisle rushed to back Attorney General Jeff Sessions Thursday as he sought to blunt resignation calls from senior Democrats, following revelations he met last year with Russia s ambassador   a detail omitted from recent congressional testimony.His defenders say such meetings between senators and diplomats were routine. And Sessions even got an inadvertent boost from Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who in demanding the AG s resignation initially claimed she never called or met with Russia s ambassador   only for tweets to surface indicating she had, at least twice.Other former colleagues intentionally came to Sessions  defense, backing the former Alabama senator s claim he only met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I ve met with the Russian ambassador with a group, in my capacity, with a group of other senators,  Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told CNN.  That s in my official capacity. That s nothing. That s my job. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said in a statement that he d talked to  at least twenty ambassadors in the last six weeks. It would have been very normal for Sessions, as a senator, to have talked to the Russian ambassador without discussing the election,  Blunt said.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on MSNBC that he d met with  six ambassadors in the last five months.  Though he hadn t met with Kislyak, Cruz said he would do so without reservations.The statements of support came as other lawmakers   including the two top-ranking Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schemer   demanded Sessions  resignation.   FOX NewsWatch: ",0
11525,"STUNNING STORY The Media And Democrats Hid From Public: How OBAMA’S AG Eric Holder Used TAXPAYER Dollars To Organize Street Mobs Against George Zimmerman, Take Down Police Chief","In an email sent on April 15, 2011, our upstanding Attorney General Eric Holder wrote: Issa and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of Mexicans were being killed with guns from our country. All they want to do   in reality   is cripple ATF and suck up to the gun lobby. Politics at its worst   maybe the media will get it. Holder was also involved in the IRS scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations. He was never held accountable.What s truly shocking however, was Holder s involvement in the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Florida. While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS) to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman. Holder was also present in Ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos.Set up under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the DOJ s CRS, the employees of which are required by law to  conduct their activities in confidence,  reportedly has greatly expanded its role under President Barack Obama. Though the agency claims to use  impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures,  press reports along with the documents obtained by Judicial Watch suggest that the unit deployed to Sanford, FL, took an active role in working with those demanding the prosecution of Zimmerman.On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the Orlando Sentinel reported,  They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  The paper quoted the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church, a focal point for protestors, as saying  They were there for us,  after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents.Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an audio recording of a  community meeting  held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford s Police Chief Bill Lee, was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the  Dream Defenders  barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired. According to the Orlando Sentinel, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford.Once again, Eric Holder was never held accountable for this horrendous act that was the catalyst for Obama s race war. The impact Eric Holder had in dividing our nation by race and the hate he inspired towards our law enforcement, can never be underestimated.For entire story including detailed payments go to: Judicial WatchAs a side note, in 2013, House members introduced a resolution to impeach Eric Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors:Sets forth articles of impeachment stating that Holder: (1) engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him in that position by refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 12, 2011, in connection with a congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); (2) failed to enforce multiple laws, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; (3) failed his oath of office by refusing to prosecute individuals involved in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal of unauthorized disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors; and (4) testified under oath before Congress on May 15, 2013, that he was neither involved in nor had heard of a potential prosecution of the press but later confirmed to the House Judiciary Committee in a letter dated June 19, 2013, that he approved of a search warrant on journalist James Rosen.Of course he was never impeached and as recently as yesterday was threatening Americans that Obama was going to start becoming more public with his anti-Trump rhetoric ",0
11526,STUNNING VINTAGE VIDEO Shows BARACK OBAMA Mocking God…The Bible…Where Was This 9 Years Ago?,"Obama can be seen addressing a crowd about religion and the role it plays in our lives and in politics. The most interesting line comes at the beginning of the video when he tells the crowd America is no longer a Christian nation:  We are no longer a Christian nation. At least not  just ! Which passages of scripture should guide our public policy?   At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise. It s the art of the impossible. If God s spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God s edicts regardless of the consequences. Barack Obama goes on to criticize his interpretation of several passages in the Bible suggesting God s word is ridiculous and needs to be examined and challenged ",0
11527,VALERIE JARRETT JUST MOVED INTO Barack And Michelle Obama’s DC Home…Plans To Help OUST Trump…ERIC HOLDER WARNS: “It’s coming…He’s coming…He’s ready to roll”,"Barack Obama is turning his new home in the posh Kalorama section of the nation s capital   just two miles away from the White House   into the nerve center of the mounting insurgency against his successor, President Donald J. Trump.Obama s goal, according to a close family friend, is to oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment.And Obama is being aided in his political crusade by his longtime consigliere, Valerie Jarrett, who has moved into the 8,200-square-foot, $5.3-million Kaloroma mansion with the former president and Michelle Obama, long time best friends.Jarrett played a vital   if at times low-key   role in the Obama presidency. She lived in the White House, dined with the Obamas, and help shape his domestic and foreign policies.The former president has set up an office on the West End of the national s capitol, where he recently hosted an open house for his White House staff   including Joe Biden, Susan Rice, Josh Earnest and Jarrett.But the office, part of his post presidency perks, cannot be used for political purposes. The rent on his home is paid by him personally.On Tuesday, former Attorney General Eric Holder revealed that Obama is indeed getting closer to making his public reappearance in politics. It s coming. He s coming,  Holder said speaking to reporters.  And he s ready to roll. According to the family source, Obama was at first reluctant to assume the role of leader of the opposition. No longer the most powerful man in the world, he was just observing Trump and not liking what he saw,  said the source. He was weary and burned out after eight years in office. But Valerie convinced him that he didn t have any choice if he wanted to save his legacy. And, as usual, he bowed to Valerie s political wisdom and advice. In his only public comment against Trump since leaving the presidency, Obama came out in support of the protests opposing President Donald Trump s executive order to restrict immigration from predominantly Muslim countries.A spokesman said the former president thinks they re  citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.

11528,"‘DEAD MUSLIMS’ Cause A Big Stir In A Small Texas Town Of 3,000 [Video]","The politics of Muslim cemeteries have sprung up recently in Dudley, Mass. (pop.: 11,390); Walpole, Mass. (pop.: 24,070); Farmington, Minnesota (pop.: 21,086); Carlisle, Pennsylvania (pop.: 18,916); and Farmersville, Texas (pop.: 3,301), reports the Associated Press.Apr 26, 2016Not only is it Muslim cemeteries that are being forced upon us, it s also Mosques. With the help of our Department of Justice, towns are being threatened if they don t cave to the construction of mega Mosques:Over the past decade, the total number of mosques in the US has continued to grow at a tremendous rate. As part of this Survey, a count of all mosques in the US was conducted and 2,106 mosques were identified. A total of 1,209 mosques were counted in 2000, and 962 mosques were counted in 1994.Islam is set to surpass Christianity as the most popular religion in the world in no time flat:How Many Muslims In The World? Islam Set To Overtake Christianity As Most Popular Religion, While US Population Also Rapidly GrowingIslam is the fastest growing religion in the world and will overtake Christianity as the most popular before the end of this century, according to an analysis of religious surveys published Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.With 1.6 billion, Muslims made up 23 percent of the world s population, according to a 2010 Pew estimate. That figure was still some way short of the 2.2 billion Christians which comprised 31 percent of the population.However, by 2050 there could be near parity between the numbers of adherents of the two religions for the first time in history. The reasons for this rapid growth are thought to be the greater number of children Muslims have compared to other religious groups and the comparatively young age of Muslims.PROPOSED 34-ACRE MUSLIM CEMETERY:Jack Hawkins, a Farmersville landowner, said he was strongly opposed to the cemetery and the Muslim religion in general.  If I had my way, I would outlaw it in America. And I would tear down every mosque that was in this country. That s the way I feel about it,  Hawkins said. Resident said that one of their main concern was the way in which Muslims inter their dead (In shrouds with NO caskets in the ground). Pastor David Meeks, of the Bethlehem Baptist Church, was one of the most vocal opponents in 2015   opposition he said has only grown stronger.  From what I hear, from my perspective, is that people are really more concerned than before,  Meeks said.  There have been terrible, drastic things happen in the world through radical Islamic terrorism, and any thought of that coming to our community just brings and harbors anxiousness, you know, that we re concerned with.

11529,BEAU BIDEN’S WIDOW Is Having An Affair…With His Married Brother,"The grieving daughter in law of Vice President Joe Biden has formed a relationship with Hunter Biden, the younger brother of her late husband, according to a bombshell report.Beau Biden, the former attorney general of Delaware, died in 2015, shocking the entire family and playing into his father s decision to stay out of the race to succeed President Obama after decades in politics.Hunter Biden, 47, separated from his wife Kathleen in 2015. He has now taken up with his brother s widow, the couple said in a statement to the New York Post s Page Six, which acknowledged their  love and support.

11530,MEDIA ATTACKS TRUMP…IGNORES Obama’s Miserable War Legacy: Soldiers Deaths QUADRUPLED Compared To GW Bush Years…Made Soldiers Wait To Be Shot At By Jihadists Before Attacking [VIDEO],"Here s Chris Matthews attacking Trump s speech and his acknowledgment of Ryan Owens  widow last night. Matthews can be seen along with fellow MSNB host Rachel Maddow demanding that Trump take responsibility for the death of Navy Seal Ryan Owens. No such demand was ever made of Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton by her friends in the press (fake media):So lets take a closer look at Obama s war legacy, which includes a horrendous record number of deaths in Afghanistan during his 8 years in office and the rise of ISIS, an even greater threat to America and to the stability of the Middle East.A discussion about President Barack Obama s legacy cannot ignore his policies in Afghanistan, where security conditions continue to deteriorate primarily at the hands of the Taliban, Afghans have suffered record casualties, and U.S. military fatalities have dramatically increased under his watch. The rise of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq and Syria has continued to overshadow Obama s war in Afghanistan even after the group established its still growing branch in the South Asian nation.The president s legacy on Afghanistan cannot be measured without taking into account what he inherited from George W. Bush. President Bush had been well aware at the end of his presidency that he was leaving behind Afghanistan a challenge. In his memoir Decision Points, he acknowledged Afghanistan was  unfinished business,  adding that the effort to transform the country into a stable democracy had  turned out to be more daunting than I anticipated. Nevertheless, the war found a successor willing to put in more time and resources, including human capital, into the ongoing effort. As President, I will make the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war that we have to win,  Obama vowed in a major 2008 campaign speech on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama also vowed to turn the  good war  in Afghanistan around and pull out all U.S. service members.Eight years later, U.S. military fatalities in the war have more than quadrupled from 558 under Bush to 2,247 under Obama, Pentagon data shows. There were 1,689 U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan under Obama, a figure that makes up more than 75 percent of all American fatalities since the war started in October 2001. The number of U.S. military injuries has increased more than 7-fold, from 2,702 under Bush to 20,237 now, according to Pentagon figures.The number of U.S. military injuries under Obama s watch (17,535) account for more than 90 percent of all 20,237 wounded in action incidents throughout the 15-year-old war.Almost immediately after implementing his own strategy, violence dramatically worsened in 2009, peaking in 2010, the deadliest year (497 deaths) for U.S. troops in Afghanistan.Obama presided over the top three deadliest years of the war: 2009 (303 deaths); 2010 (497 deaths); and 2011 (399). U.S. military fatalities under Bush peaked in 2008 at 151, according to a Breitbart News analysis of Pentagon data.At nearly 100,000 in 2010, the presence of the American military also reached its zenith under Obama.The rules of engagement have also been a subject of contempt for analysts and U.S. service members alike.A top commander of U.S. and NATO troops indicated that, after the end of the combat mission on December 31, 2014, American forces fighting Taliban jihadists had to wait to be shot at first to be able to attack. Being a member of the Taliban was no longer a justification for U.S. troops to open fire, attack a even as the terrorist group expands its territorial control across the war-ravaged nation.The Taliban currently controls more territory now than at any time since the group s regime was dethrone by the U.S. military in 2001. In the year after President Obama declared an end to the U.S. combat mission (2015), the Taliban surpassed their ISIS jihadist rivals as the the world s chief perpetrators of terrorist attacks, with 1,093 individual attacks, reported U.S. State Department.Nevertheless, U.S. troops are still banned from offensively attacking the Taliban. American forces can only attack from a position of defense.- Breitbart",0

11536,PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SPEECH: “BELIEVE IN YOURSELF”…”BELIEVE IN AMERICA”,"THE TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP S SPEECH TO CONGRESS: THE VIDEOS ARE BELOWMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice   in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands, and we will use it to light up the world.I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.All the nations of the world   friend or foe   will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.In 9 years, The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Founding   250 years since the day we declared our Independence.It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we ve watched our middle class shrink as we ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit   and so many other places throughout our land.We ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross   and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.And we ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds   families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus   as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake   and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first   because only then, can we truly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. PART 1 OF THE SPEECH: Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic Veterans will get the care they so desperately need.Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American People.It s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I ve made in keeping those promises.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our government.We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by Executive Branch officials   and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.We have undertaken a historic effort to eliminate job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines   thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs   and I ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on ReducingViolent Crime.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the Criminal Cartels that have spread across our nation.We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth   and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.We want all Americans to succeed   but that can t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a Great Wall along our Southern Border. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United states.We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.We have seen the attacks at home   from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, should support this country and love its people and its values.We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America   we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe   and to keep out those who would do us harm.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim World, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court from my list of 20 judges who will defend our Constitution.I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American Justice.To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.More than one in five people in their prime-working years are not working.We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.We ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of Party.It will require us to tap into the American Spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.president-trump-sou-3But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American Economy   making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes   but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley Davidson.In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?They said that it s good.I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.They told me   without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it   that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They weren t even asking for change.But I am.I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that  The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people. Lincoln was right   and it is time we heeded his words.I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.I am going to bring back millions of jobs.Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and putsgreat pressure on taxpayers.Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others   have a merit-based immigration system.It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: It will save countless dollars, raise workers  wages, and help struggling families   including immigrant families   enter the middle class.I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: To improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation s security, and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, instead of the unusual special interests, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program   the building of the interstate highway system.The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.With this $6 trillion we could have rebuilt our country   twice.And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion dollar investment in the infrastructure of the United States   financed through both public and private capital   creating millions of new jobs.This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better healthcare.Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America.The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits   as an example, Arizona went up 116% last year alone.Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state   it is unsustainable and collapsing.One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges   leaving many Americans with no choice at all.Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?We now know that all of those promises have been broken.Obamacare is collapsing   and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.Action is not a choice   it is a necessity.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts   but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government.Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance   and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines   creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.Every problem can be solved.And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more   so why not join forces to finally get it done?On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have Paid Family Leave, to invest in women s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.Megan was diagnosed with Pompay Disease, a rare and serious illness when she was 15 months old.She was not expected to live past five.On receiving this news, Megan s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan s life.Today she is 20 years old   and a sophomore at Notre Dame.Megan s story is about the unbounded power of a father s love for a daughter.But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan s life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA, but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind   and the souls   of every American child.Education is the civil rights issue of our time.I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.Today, she is the first in her family to graduate not just from high school, but from college.Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone   and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.This is not acceptable in our society.Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.But to create this future, we must work with   not against   the men and women of law enforcement.We must build bridges of cooperation and trust   not drive the wedge of disunity and division.Police and sheriffs are members of our community.They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters   and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they ll come home safe and sound.We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.And we must support the victims of crime.I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.The office is called VOICE   Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Jamiel s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback.But he never got the chance.His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.Their husbands   Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis   were slain in the line of duty in California.They were pillars of their community.These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know   we will never stop fighting for justice   your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States Military with the tools they need to prevent war and   if they must   TO FIGHT AND TO WIN.I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense Sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our Veterans.Our Veterans have delivered for this nation   and now we must deliver for them.The challenges we face as a nation are great.But our people are even greater.And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William  Ryan  Owens.Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero   battling against terrorism and securing our nation.I just spoke to General Mattis who reconfirmed that, and I quote,  Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. Ryan s legacy is etched into eternity.For as the bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one s life for one s friends.Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our Freedom   we will never forget him.To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.But our partners must meet their financial obligations.And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific   to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people   and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.My job is not to represent the world.My job is to represent the United States of America.But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict   not more.We must learn from the mistakes of the past   we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.We want peace, wherever peace can be found.America is friends today with former enemies.Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars.This history should give us all faith in the possibilitiesfor a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America s centennial.At that celebration, the country s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.Remington unveiled the first typewriter.An early attempt was made at electric light.Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.Imagine the wonders our country could know in America s 250th year.Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.And streets where mothers are safe from fear   schools where children learn in peace   and jobs where Americans prosper and grow   are not too much to ask.When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before.For all Americans.This is our vision.This is our mission.But we can only get there together.We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood.We all salute the same flag.And we are all made by the same God.And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrateour 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.The time for small thinking is over.The time for trivial fights is behind us.We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations   not burdened by our fears. Inspired by the future   not bound by the failures of the past. And guided by our vision   not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.I am asking all members of Congress to join me in Dreaming Big, and Bold and Daring things for our country.And I am asking everyone watching tonightto seize this moment and   Believe In Yourselves.Believe In Your Future.And Believe, Once More, In America.Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States",0

11544,WHY LIBERAL ACTRESS JENNIFER GARNER Is Bucking Hollywood Haters…Wants To Meet With President Trump,"Jennifer Garner has not given up on Donald Trump s Washington.The 44-year-old actress spent the weekend lobbying the town s pillars of power to support early education for poor rural children. She spent Friday on Capitol Hill meeting dozens of top staff members. On Saturday, she delivered the keynote address before the annual National Governors Association winter meeting here. A potential sit-down with Ivanka Trump, who is advocating for more funding for child care, fell apart because of scheduling conflicts, but Garner remained optimistic about a face-to-face discussion soon.Other Hollywood liberals have shunned the new commander in chief   notably during Sunday s Academy Awards ceremony, when many jokes were told at President Trump s expense. But Garner, a true-blue Democrat who campaigned for Hillary Clinton last year and held a fundraiser for Barack Obama in 2008, is taking a unique approach: pushing a cause that would benefit the new administration s political base.The West Virginia native has long worked to bring assistance to poor, rural communities in desperate need of it. She has no plans to change that just because most of those communities went big for Trump in last year s election. In fact, she sees an opportunity to hold the president accountable for the pledges he made to the country s rural working class.While other celebrities merely attach their names to charities to promote themselves, actress Jennifer Garner is actually very involved in helping poor children in her home state of West Virginia.According to a study by British academics, when celebrities lend their names to a good cause, they are usually the main beneficiaries I m looking forward to helping him make good on what they saw as promises, a mandate from him, that he was going to make their lives better,  Garner said in a 45-minute interview with The Washington Post.That makes Trump s presidency a psychological test of sorts for some members of the Hollywood elite, who can either demonstrate their true commitment to the causes they push   or expose their charity work here as more about bolstering themselves.Very much in the former camp, Garner acknowledged that some of her friends  want to turn their back to this administration . . . [and] just wouldn t even want to engage. Not her.  If he s willing to help the poor kids who got him elected, then let s do it. They certainly think he s going to,  she said.She grew up solidly middle class, but she knew plenty of poor children who started elementary school behind and never caught up. They lived in the same sort of communities that Robert F. Kennedy, Shriver s uncle, visited in the mid-1960s along the Mississippi Delta, shaping the ideas of his 1968 presidential campaign.Garner returned home to West Virginia last year to help raise money after devastating flooding in the state. Reliably Democratic during her childhood, West Virginia ended up giving Trump his largest margin of victory   something she could see coming by talking to people in economically depressed areas. People felt like Trump really understood them, that he was going to come in and create jobs for them,  she said.  They felt like they needed something to just turn everything upside down. It s that level of despair that leaves Garner willing to deal with Trump when some of her friends want to offer nothing but resistance. She may even be willing to meet the president. Send me a ticket to Mar-a-Lago. I m ready to go down and have a steak and a good chat,  she said, only half joking about the prospect.  I really think it s great, if he s willing to help the poor kids who got him elected.    Washington PostWe applaud Garner for her courage and her true commitment to poor children in her home state of West Virginia.Watch this short clip explaining why Garner s so passionate about helping these kids in West Virginia:",0

11553,SABO…The Most BADASS CONSERVATIVE ARTIST In America Will Be On Tucker Carlson Tonight…Why You Don’t Want To Miss It! [VIDEO],"Hardcore, unconventional, conservative and badass artist  Sabo  has been taking his message to the streets for several years. I had a lengthy phone conversation with him last year and after I hung up the phone, I had the same kind of feeling I had after meeting Andrew Breitbart. Like Andrew Breitbart, Sabo s not fighting a conventional war against the left, he s studied them, he knows the dirty tactics they use to win and he s determined to beat them at their own game, even if it means shocking a few Americans along the way. Sabo never got to meet Andrew Breitbart, but always wanted to, as he recalls here:Now a thing about me was I d spent a good three years trying to get sober. In that time I did everything I could to stay the hell away from politics. It was the most peaceful three years of my life. Unfortunately during those three years guys like Glenn Beck and Andrew Breitbart were really picking up steam. So, because of my absence from the political scene I didn t really know much about them. And what little I did know about Glenn Beck I didn t really like. I remember friends would try turning me on to him but I wasn t into his delivery, too loud, too passionate. Not my deal. Sadly Andrew passed away about the time I decided to get back into the political fray. I never had the privilege to meet him. Everyone says we d of really gotten along. I did however get to meet his crew and they were all stand up people.Glenn Beck interviewed Sabo in 2015 when he was still keeping his face hidden from the public:  One of Sabo s most popular pieces of work was his badass representation of Ted Cruz who he wholeheartedly supported for President.During the campaign, Sabo came after Hillary and Bernie Sanders pretty hard. He focused on plastering his hard-hitting posters in areas where fundraisers or events for Bernie or Hillary were taking place. Sabo wanted to make sure the American public saw Hillary as he saw Hillary:It took him a while to come around to Donald Trump, but eventually he did.Sabo s controversial artwork can be found on posters, t-shirts and bumper stickers at his online store: unsavoryagents.com Here s a video of Sabo replacing a sign in a park bench in LA with his own unique printed message. Notice the guy smoking a crack pipe on the bench the entire time.In 2014, Sabo got a little visit from the Secret Service over his  controversial  posts on Twitter. He certainly didn t handle the interview in the way most Americans would have.:Sabo will be on FOX News  Tucker Carlson show tonight at 9 pm EST. He ll likely discuss the artwork that he plastered all over LA in advance of the Oscars last night.Here are a few of the posters liberal actors found when they arrived on the red carpet.   We can promise you one thing it won t be an interview you ll want to miss ",0
11554,MESSAGE TO THE LEFT ON IMMIGRATION: If You Disagree With “AMERICA FIRST”…Who Are YOU Rooting For?,"IT S A MUST READ! The first month of the Trump administration has already changed the direction of the immigration debate, with many more changes coming soon. So far, executive orders and deportations dominate the discussion. But the fight over how many refugees to admit or how best to vet those refugees obscures what the debate is really about.Changes in social policy do not make everyone better off, and immigration policy is no exception. I am a refugee, having fled Cuba as a child in 1962. Not only do I have great sympathy for the immigrant s desire to build a better life, I am also living proof that immigration policy can benefit some people enormously.But I am also an economist, and am very much aware of the many trade-offs involved. Inevitably, immigration does not improve everyone s well-being. There are winners and losers, and we will need to choose among difficult options. The improved lives of the immigrants come at a price. How much of a price are the American people willing to pay, and exactly who will pay it?This tension permeates the debate over immigration s effect on the labor market. Those who want more immigration claim that immigrants do jobs that native-born Americans do not want to do. But we all know that the price of gas goes down when the supply of oil goes up. The laws of supply and demand do not evaporate when we talk about the price of labor rather than the price of gas. By now, the well-documented abuses of the H-1B program, such as the Disney workers who had to train their foreign-born replacements, should have obliterated the notion that immigration does not harm competing native workers. Over the past 30 years, a large fraction of immigrants, nearly a third, were high school dropouts, so the incumbent low-skill work force formed the core group of Americans who paid the price for the influx of millions of workers. Their wages fell as much as 6 percent. Those low-skill Americans included many native-born blacks and Hispanics, as well as earlier waves of immigrants.But somebody s lower wage is somebody else s higher profit. The increase in the profitability of many employers enlarged the economic pie accruing to the entire native population by about $50 billion. So, as proponents of more immigration point out, immigration can increase the aggregate wealth of Americans. But they don t point out the trade-off involved: Workers in jobs sought by immigrants lose out.They also don t point out that low-skill immigration has a side effect that reduces that $50 billion increase in wealth. The National Academy of Sciences recently estimated the impact of immigration on government budgets. On a year-to-year basis, immigrant families, mostly because of their relatively low incomes and higher frequency of participating in government programs like subsidized health care, are a fiscal burden. A comparison of taxes paid and government spending on these families showed that immigrants created an annual fiscal shortfall of $43 billion to $299 billion.Even the most conservative estimate of the fiscal shortfall wipes out much of the $50 billion increase in native wealth. Remarkably, the size of the native economic pie did not change much after immigration increased the number of workers by more than 15 percent. But the split of the pie certainly changed, giving far less to workers and much more to employers.The immigration debate will also have to address the long-term impact on American society, raising the freighted issue of immigrant assimilation. In recent decades, there has been a noticeable slowdown in the rate at which the economic status of immigrants improves over time. In the 1970s, the typical immigrant could expect a substantial improvement relative to natives over his or her lifetime. Today, the economic progress of the typical immigrant is much more stagnant.Part of the slowdown is related to the growth of ethnic enclaves. New immigrants who find few ethnic compatriots get value from acquiring skills that allow more social and economic exchanges, such as becoming proficient in English. But new immigrants who find a large and welcoming community of their countrymen have less need to acquire those skills; they already have a large audience that values whatever they brought with them. Put bluntly, mass migration discourages assimilation.The trade-offs become even more difficult when we think about the long-term integration of the children and grandchildren of today s immigrants. Many look back at the melting pot in 20th-century America and assume that history will repeat itself. That s probably wishful thinking. That melting pot operated in a particular economic, social and political context, and it is doubtful that those conditions can be reproduced today.Many of the Ellis Island-era immigrants got jobs in manufacturing; Ford s work force was 75 percent foreign-born in 1914. Those manufacturing jobs evolved into well-paid union jobs, creating a private-sector safety net for the immigrants and their descendants. Does anyone seriously believe that the jobs employing low-skill immigrants today will offer the same economic mobility that unionized manufacturing jobs provided?Similarly, the ideological climate that encouraged assimilation back then, neatly encapsulated by our motto  E pluribus unum  (Out of many, one), is dead and gone. A recent University of California directive shows the radical shift. The university s employees were advised to avoid using phrases that can lead to  microaggressions  toward students and one another. One example is the statement  America is a melting pot,  which apparently sends a message to the recipient that they have to  assimilate to the dominant culture. Opinion Today Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Europe is already confronting the difficulties produced by the presence of unassimilated populations. If nothing else, the European experience shows that there is no universal law that guarantees integration even after a few generations. We, too, will need to confront the trade-off between short-term economic gains and the long-term costs of a large, unassimilated minority.Identifying the trade-offs is only a first step toward a more sensible immigration policy. We also need some general principles, combining common sense and compassion.First and foremost, we must reduce illegal immigration. It has had a corrosive impact, paralyzing discussion on all aspects of immigration reform. A wall along the Mexican border may signal that we are getting serious, but many undocumented immigrants enter the country legally and then overstay their visas. A national electronic system (such as E-Verify) mandating that employers certify new hires, along with fines and criminal penalties for lawbreaking businesses, might go a long way toward stemming the flow.But what about the 11-million-plus undocumented immigrants already here? A vast majority have led peaceful lives and established deep roots in our communities. Their sudden deportation would not represent the compassionate America that many of us envision.Perhaps it s time for some benign neglect. Many will eventually qualify for visas because they have married American citizens or have native-born children. Rather than fight over a politically impossible amnesty, we could accelerate the granting of family-preference visas to that population.We will also need to decide how many immigrants to admit. Economists seldom confess their ignorance, but we truly have no clue about what that number should be. About one million legal immigrants a year entered the country in the past two decades. The political climate suggests that many Americans view that number as too high. History shows that when voters get fed up with immigration, there is no reluctance to cut off the flow altogether. Back in the 1990s, Barbara Jordan s immigration commission recommended an annual target of about 550,000 immigrants. Such a cut would be significant, but it may be preferable to the alternative, which, in this political climate, could mean shutting off the flow.Finally, we need to choose between highly skilled and less-skilled applicants. High-skill immigrants, who pay higher taxes and receive fewer services and can potentially expand the frontier of knowledge, are more profitable for us. But giving an opportunity to the huddled masses is part of what makes our country exceptional.Regardless of the allocation, employers should not walk away with all the gains, and workers should not suffer all the losses. We need to ensure a more equitable sharing of the gains and losses among the American people.No matter where one stands in the ideological divide, President Trump has already answered the fundamental question guiding the design of a more rational policy. In his speech at the Republican National Convention, he described how he would pick among the available choices:  We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone,  he said.  But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. He added,  We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people. Many of my colleagues in the academic community   and many of the elite opinion-makers in the news media   recoil when they hear that immigration should serve the interests of Americans. Their reaction is to label such thinking as racist and xenophobic, and to marginalize anyone who agrees.But those accusations of racism reflect their effort to avoid a serious discussion of the trade-offs. The coming debate would be far more honest and politically transparent if we demanded a simple answer from those who disagree with  America First  proposals: Who are you rooting for?Via: NYT",0
11555,SHERIFFS SAY They Won’t Allow Officers To Help Feds Enforce Immigration Laws…Judge Jeanine OBLITERATES Them: “You’re too damn dumb to be in law enforcement” [VIDEO],"Two law enforcement officials from the Utah resort area of Park City drew cheers from a large crowd with their promises not to let officers help federal immigration officials apprehend people living in the U.S. without proper documents.Summit County Sheriff Justin Martinez and Park City Police Chief Wade Carpenter told about 300 people Thursday in Summitville that they won t agree to deputize officers to carry out federal operations, the Deseret News reported.Carpenter said he was assured the arrests were not part of a sweep of undocumented immigrants, but an effort by federal agents to arrest  specified individuals  with felony criminal histories or who have re-entered the United States illegally after being deported.Martinez and Carpenter referred to a federal immigration law that provides for state employees or agencies to help in  the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States. I will not be doing that as a sheriff,  Martinez said to loud applause.  This is a federal immigration issue, and therefore I will not be participating in that (and be) deputized.   Idaho State Journal If you re a cop working in a sanctuary jurisdiction, then you re being directed by left-wing liberal progressive mayors and governors to protect illegal criminals, who not only violated our laws in coming here, but in addition, committed crimes while here. Your e being told not to share information about illegal criminals and not honor federal ICE detainers. So, you ve got a decision to make and if this is a tough one for you, and if you can t figure out what your sworn obligation is then get the HELL out of law enforcement! Why would you treat an illegal criminal different than an American criminal? Hell..maybe law abiding states should clear out their prisons and send their own criminals to sanctuary states, since their open to taking other countries criminals. The least they can do is take ours. Can t you see you re being used in a political tug-of-war?  If this is a tough one for you, and you re going to start listening to the ACLU or some liberal mayor who doesn t give a damn about you, your contract, or your oath;  directing that you release the wanted criminal out the side door, then maybe you should re-think this whole thing and go into social work You re too damn dumb to be in law enforcement!   Every one of you in law enforcement who bought into this liberal nonsense has blood on their hands. If you release the criminal, you guarantee a fellow officer or agent will be in harms way when they go out to find that criminal! WATCH:",0
11556,BERNIE SANDERS Flips Off The Dems After Anti-Bernie DNC Chair Chosen,"WASHINGTON   Sen. Bernie Sanders wouldn t commit on Sunday to turning over his email list of progressive activists to the Democratic National Committee   a group he dubbed the  establishment s house. The Vermont Independent built up a list of activists throughout his presidential campaign that helped him raise nearly $238 million   largely from small-dollar individual donors.He s been under pressure from some to keep their personal information private from the DNC, which many of his backers believe rigged the presidential race in favor of Hillary Clinton.Pressed twice on CNN s  State of the Union  Sunday whether he d share his distribution list to help unite the Democratic Party, Sanders declined to commit.Instead, he said he ll focus on activism among certain candidates who share a progressive message. We are going to do everything that we can   and we have started that progress   to transform the Democratic Party into a party that stands up for working families,  Sanders said.  So we are going to work to support progressives who are running for the Senate, who are running for the House, who are running   for school board, for city council, for state legislature. His comments follow a tight contest this weekend for DNC chairman. Sanders campaigned for Rep. Keith Ellison, but the Minnesota progressive and early Sanders backer lost in a divided race to Tom Perez, former President Obama s Labor Secretary who had endorsed Clinton.In his first action as chairman, Perez asked Ellison to be his deputy in an effort to bring together a divided party and try to heal 2016 wounds.Read more: NYP",0
11557,SERIOUSLY? PRO-ILLEGAL ALIEN Supporters Demand Cops Explain Why They Can’t Physically Attack Trump Supporters [VIDEO],"The video begins with a clearly agitated pro-illegal alien female approaching Trump supporters. After a few of the agitators who were part of her group began to act in a hostile and threatening manner, police officers stepped in to form a barrier between the groups. The human barrier they formed was clearly not okay with the agitators who were looking to use physical force to shut up and shut down their opponents. Shortly after the police officer explained that the Trump supporters had a permit (which means nothing to people who have no regard for the law and are actually protesting on behalf of lawbreakers), another man who appears to be Hispanic, wearing a hoodie began to aggressively approach the crowd. We re not sure if these people were being paid to threaten the pro-Trump supporters or if they just happened to be angry supporters of illegal aliens, and were in the area.The Hispanic man on the pro-Trump side in the background, who was holding a  Deport Illegals  sign can be heard telling the pro-illegal agitators that he s  a legal American citizen  and he stands by President Trump. He hilariously follows up his comment with,  Homies for Trump.

11558,THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES: How Strong Arm Tactics By ANTI-CAPITALIST LEFT Could Destroy Millions Of American Jobs,"The fast food industry has been warning those demanding a $15/hr. wage that they could be easily replaced.In the social sciences, unintended consequences (sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences) are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American sociologist Robert K. Merton. It s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries,  former McDonald s USA CEO Ed Rensi said in an interview on Tuesday on the Fox Business Network s  Mornings with Maria.   It s nonsense and it s very destructive and it s inflationary and it s going to cause a job loss across this country like you re not going to believe. According to Rensi, rising labor costs are forcing chains to cut entry-level jobs and replace workers with machines. Currently, Wendy s, McDonald s, and Panera are rolling out kiosks across the US, in part because of the rising cost of labor.  Business InsiderAccording to statista.com, in 2016, there were over 3.7 million people in the US who were employed in the fast food industry. When those jobs go away, where will these workers go for employment? Will they be forced to do the jobs that  only the illegal aliens will do? Wendy s just announced their plans to install self-ordering kiosks at about 1,000 locations by the end of the year.A typical location would have three kiosks, The Columbus Dispatch reported. Higher-volume restaurants will be given priority for the kiosks.Wendy s chief information officer, David Trimm, said the kiosks are intended to appeal to younger customers and reduce labor costs. Kiosks also allow customers of the fast food giant to circumvent long lines during peak dining hours while increasing kitchen production.Trim estimates the company will see a return on its investment in less than two years. They are looking to improve their automation and their labor costs, and this is a good way to do it,  said Darren Tristano, vice president with Technomic, a food-service research and consulting firm.  They are also trying to enhance the customer experience. Younger customers prefer to use a kiosk. Customers will still be able to order at the counter for now, although Tristan predicts that mobile ordering and payment via smartphones will one day overtake self-ordering kiosks and cash registers.

Merkel assumed some of the blame for her reckless immigration policy, but still defended  her position.On September 19, 2016, Merkel admitted for first time she may have blundered over the migration crisis in the wake of another bitter poll drubbing.The German Chancellor admitted she was  unprepared  for last year s one million strong migrant influx. If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.

The truth is the media is dishonest,  reads one statement, a likely reference to Trump s frequent comments slamming the media s honesty.Here s another statement from the ad:  The truth is alternative facts are lies.  That one s an obvious reference to a comment made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.The ad runs through a series of other phrases, some targeting conservative talking points such as  we have to protect our borders,   the emails are dangerous,  and  climate change is a hoax. The ad finishes up with the phrase  The truth is hard to find,  which then switches to  The truth is hard to know,  and finally concludes with  The truth is more important now than never.   MRCTVThat final phrase is pretty clearly seen as a parting shot at the Trump administration s relationship with the press:Recently the Times featured an article touting the  renewed sense of mission  for journalists in the Trump era looking to take down the Republican president by uncovering a Watergate-style scandal.The New York paper is not alone in its pretentious claims of being the guardian of truth, on Tuesday, The Washington Post added this slogan to its website:  Democracy dies in darkness.

11574,JUST MINUTES AFTER NEW DNC CHAIR CHOSEN…Wikileaks Exposes Him For Political Wrongdoing,"HERE S THE WIKILEAKS LINK TO ALL REFERENCES TO TOM PEREZ: TOM PEREZ WIKILEAKSHERE S ONE EMAIL TO JOHN PODESTA FROM PEREZ VIA WIKILEAKS:From:tomperez1@verizon.net To: john.podesta@gmail.com, maya@mayalharris.com Date: 2016-02-05 03:10 Subject: Observations from the roadJohn and Maya Nice job two nights in a row by HRC. Congrats on Iowa as well. A win is a win. They said high turnout would hurt us and we won nonetheless. I was in NH on Sunday and Nevada on Monday and Tuesday for HRC and thought I would give you some observations from the field. 1. I was super impressed with the field staff that I met in both places. Really impressive group everywhere.2. I dont think I can add more on New Hampshire bc you are there and probably dont need someone else from the peanut gallery. I think people will be surprised at how she is able to close the gap. I like the  vote with your head and your heart  line, and I like the comeback on the establishment stuff. I also liked how she let her guard down a bit last night in the town hall format. She humanized herself.3. I wish she would talk about the issues she cares about through the prism of more human stories. Logos, ethos, pathos. She has met so many people with so many gut wrenching stories of grit and determination, struggle followed by success. I wish there were more pathos, or more real stories behind her really sound policy proposals. Whenever I talk about ACA, I talk about through the prism of real people for whom the ACA saved their lives. The stories are incredible. In my HRC advocacy, I now say how these people dont have the time to wait for Senator Sanders to complete his quest for the perfect health care system, or the perfect immigration reform bill; it gets alot of good nods, especially when I talk about Kennedy McCain immigration and how Bernie opposed this, and immigrants are still suffering the consequences of inaction.4. I spent two days in Nevada and I am a huge huge fan of Emmy, the state director. She is whip smart, passionate, organized, and knows Nevada inside and out. I have been with her twice now. She is a huge asset, as is Michelle, one of her top aides. Jorge is a top flight comms guy who knows Nevada well from Harry Reid days. Best field organizer I have met so far is a young man named Henry who is about an hour from Las Vegas. I spoke in this remote town at 10 am on Tuesday to HRC volunteers, and he had 50 people there  incredibly diverse! Great team.5. I think Nevada is the firewall on a number of levels, and the most important thing I want to communicate in this email is my strong belief that HRC should travel to Nevada asap after New Hampshire. I think she should be in Nevada no later than Thursday or Friday of next week.6. Nevada is an opportunity to fight back on so many levels. First, the current storyline is that she does not connect well with young voters. Given that Nevada is far more demographically representative of America, I am confident that HRC can do well with all African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans (dont forget the sizeable population of Asian Americans in Nevada, including Filipinos.). Emmy and the team have a good plan to attract all minority voters. When we do well there, then the narrative changes from Bernie kicks ass among young voters to Bernie does well only among young white liberals  that is a different story and a perfect lead in to South Carolina, where once again, we can work to attract young voters of color. So I think Nevada is a real opportunity , and I would strongly urge HRC to get out there within a couple days of NH.7. Nevada has a greater unity density than New Hampshire or Iowa, and this also presents an opportunity. I spent alot of time with union folks in Nevada. Of those who have endorsed, I think there are varying levels of enthusiasm. I spent alot of time giving passionate pep talk about how Nevada is labor s biggest and best opportunity thus far to send a strong message to the country that organized labor remains strong and relevant. They could use additional stroking. Teachers are fine. Trades have some great folks (Todd Koch for instance) and some seemingly more tepid folks. President Clinton I am told is coming out there very soon and I hope he can speak with labor and close the deal.8. I went and met with Jim Murren at MGM. A great guy as you know. The caucus system is really tough on shift workers, and he is a huge ally. We can reach out to him often enough to say thanks. I am glad I saw him.9. The major Latino publication in Las Vegas will be endorsing next week. Jorge has major street cred with them. We had a good meeting. They adore HRC and will endorse with enthusiasm.10. The caucus system out there is so screwy, and the challenges for shift workers sufficiently significant, that I do worry about turnout. This is why I hope HRC can get there asap. Anyway, wanted to give you my thoughts. Let me know how I can be of further assistance. I believe I am heading to Milwaukee next Thursday to help with debate spin. Tom Perez",0
11575,WOW! BARBARA BUSH Will Be Keynote Speaker For Baby-Killing Planned Parenthood Fundraiser,"Her father is a staunch supporter of life. Although her mother was not vocal about it during her conservative husband George W. Bush s presidency, Laura Bush was an advocate of abortion and of homosexual marriage. Here she is two years after leaving the White House expressing her liberal views to Larry King:Their daughter Barbara Pierce Bush was a vocal supporter of gay marriage. She also supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Although it s probably a huge slap in the face to her father,  Barbara Pierce Bush plans to help Planned Parenthood, the federally funded (for now) baby killing business to raise money at an upcoming fundraiser. Barbara Pierce Bush, the daughter of former President George W. Bush, will headline a Planned Parenthood fundraiser next week in Texas, according to a report from the Texas Tribune.Bush is expected to be the keynote speaker at the Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas s annual Fort Worth fundraising luncheon.President Bush pushed for anti-abortion policies during his time in the White House, but his wife Laura Bush has supported legal abortion in the past.The announcement comes amid the continuing debate over federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides a variety of reproductive health services to women, including abortions.Barbara Bush is the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps and called Planned Parenthood an  exceptional organization  last year in an interview with the New York Times. Bush also attended an event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Paris.   The Hill",0
11576,BRITISH COLUMNIST KATIE HOPKINS Has BRUTAL Reaction To “Trans” H.S. Student Beating Girls In Wrestling Matches [VIDEO],"Mack Beggs, the transgender wrestler from Euless Trinity High School, is halfway home to capturing the Class 6A state girls wrestling championship in the 110-pound weight class.Beggs dismantled two opponents on Friday s opening day, earning a major decision over League City Clear Spring s Taylor Latham 18-7 and then improving his season record to 54-0 with a major decision over Mya Engert of Amarillo Tascosa 12-4.Both of Beggs  opponents managed to avoid being pinned, but neither provided enough resistance to make the match close at the UIL Wrestling State Tournament.Beggs advanced to Saturday s 10:30 a.m. semifinal against area rival Kailyn Clay of Grand Prairie. Beggs defeated Clay in the semifinals of last week s regional tournament in Allen.For the most part, Friday s action was routine despite the sudden swirling controversy around Beggs, whose gender transition from female to male became a news story after the regional tournament.At the regional tournament, two wrestlers forfeited rather than grapple with Beggs. One, Coppell s Madeline Rocha, who had already qualified for state, lost her opening-round match Friday in Cypress.After losing to Beggs, who has has been on testosterone treatments since October 2015, Engert left the mat in tears and her coach tersely declined an interview request for her wrestler. Many of the coaches have said they re not upset at Beggs, but just the predicament of their girls having to wrestle against an athlete on testosterone.Conservative British actress and talk radio host Katie Hopkins is not one to shy away from a controversy. After reading about a  trans  high school student who takes regular testosterone treatments, beating non-testosterone enhanced females, she tweeted this brutal response:You want to be a boy. And are still prepared to fight girls. Forgive me if I don't applaud. Nasty narcissist. https://t.co/feLK1YqPuO  Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) February 25, 2017Watch the video of  trans  student Mac Beggs wrestling a non-enhanced female student:But at least one wrestling parent, Patti Overstreet, yelled  cheater  at Beggs. Look at how beefed up she is,  Overstreet said.  It s because she s taking an enhancement. Whether she s a boy, girl, wants to be purple or blue it doesn t matter. When you re using a drug and you re 10 times stronger than the person you re wrestling because of that drug, that shouldn t be allowed. One athletic director watching the action, who asked for his name not to be used because of the sensitivity of the issue, said he believes  there is cause for concern because of the testosterone,  adding,  I think there is a benefit.

All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books,  says one large poster containing a giant image of an Oscar statuette. The text was borrowed from Tarantino s True Romance.Sabo also created ads for Redbox and even built some replicas of the movie rental service s iconic kiosks.HERE S SABO S COMMENTARY ON HOLLYWOOD AND THE POSTERS HE JUST PUT UP:I hardly ever go to movies anymore and it there s ever a movie I really want to see I ll just wait for it to show up in ReBox.

11580,"HILLARY SUPPORTER, PROMINENT LAWYER Alan Dershowitz: If Dems Elect Muslim Keith Ellison To DNC Chair, He’s Leaving Dem Party…”Loyalty To My Country Exceeds Any Loyalty To My Party”","In today s distorted world of  human rights,  truth takes a back seat to ideology, and false claims   especially those that  support  radical ideologies   persist even after they have been exposed. Alan DershowitzHarvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a high-profile Democrat for decades, said in an op-ed published Friday that he will leave the party if Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is elected chairman this weekend. My loyalty to my country and my principles and my heritage exceeds any loyalty to my party,  Dershowitz, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, wrote in  The Hill  newspaper.When the Jews were being persecuted by the Nazis in 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which focused on rescuing Jews, a religious group. But if the religious group is the subject of the persecution based on their religion, it s perfectly OK for a First Amendment-bound society to emphasize their rescue, just as it is perfectly OK to emphasize the fact that many, if not all of the perpetrators of Islamic terrorism, come from countries with a history of supporting terrorism. Alan DershowitzDershowitz recounted Ellison s history of controversial statements and actions many deemed anti-Semitic, including the congressman s history with Louis Farrakhan s  Nation of Islam  movement. A prominent lawyer   told me that while he was a law student, Ellison approached her and said he could not respect her because she was a Jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school,  Dershowitz claims in the column.Dershowitz slammed Ellison for disavowing Farrakhan at the same time he was first running for office in Minneapolis, adding that his recent claims of support for Israel coincide with his bid to lead the Democratic National Committee.Calling the DNC election a  momentous choice,  Dershowitz said the party could either go the direction of British parliamentarian Jeremy Corbyn, who led a far-left shift in the Labour Party, or try to recapture the  Rust Belt  Democrats who switched their allegiance to President Trump last November. I hope they choose wisely,  Dershowitz said of the DNC s voting members,  If they do not, I have made my choice.   Fox News ",0

They get upset, they say we can t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the first amendment. They always bring up the First Amendment,  he said.  I love the First Amendment.

11588,ARRESTED: MUSLIM US ARMY VET Charged With Plotting Terror Attack In US On Behalf Of ISIS,"A U.S. Army veteran was recently arrested on charges that he plotted a coordinated terrorist attack on behalf of the Islamic State against civilian targets and military installations in Kansas City.Federal investigators believe Robert Hester wanted to murder his former military comrades and civilians through a series of bus and train attacks to be carried out on President s Day, the Washington Post reported Thursday.Hester was arrested following a months-long FBI investigation during which the 25-year-old met with undercover FBI agents who were posing as ISIS operatives and expressed his desire to reap mass casualties in the United States.Hester, a father of two, served a short stint in the Army beginning in 2012. He faced a series of disciplinary issues and received a general discharged in 2013.Three years later, Hester had converted to Islam, changed his name, and was posting anti-government messages to social media.The Army veteran was arrested last week and was charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.In late January, Hester met with one undercover FBI agent posing as an ISIS contact who asked the veteran to purchase a series of items that could be used to make bombs, including 9-volt batteries, duct tape, copper wire, and nails. Hester brought the bomb supplies to a later meeting and handed them over to the undercover agent.Hester s final meeting with the undercover agents was last week, where he brought a box of nails to be used as shrapnel for the bombs. He told agents on Friday that it felt  good to help strike back at the true terrorist. First on social media, then during face-to-face meetings with an undercover FBI employee, this defendant repeatedly expressed his intent to engage in acts of violent jihad against the United States,  U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Tammy Dickinson said in a statement.  He believed he was part of an ISIS-sponsored terrorist attack that would result in the deaths and injuries of many innocent victims.   WFB ",0

I read the Washington Post and the New York Times every day, and I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the way things are,  she said.Justice Ginsburg was nominated by Bill Clinton and is regarded as a liberal.Justice Ginsburg was careful to avoid commenting directly on Donald Trump s presidency.Before the election, in July 2016, Justice Ginsburg criticised Donald Trump   calling him  a faker . She later said she regretted making the comments.Watch: Think of what the press has done in the United States,  she said citing the Watergate scandal.  That story might never have come out if we didn t have the free press that we do. Asked about the rise of the so-called  post truth world , Justice Ginsburg said:  I am optimistic in the long run. A great man once said that the true symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle. It is the pendulum. And when the pendulum swings too far in one direction it will go back. Some terrible things have happened in the United States but one can only hope that we learn from those bad things. Justice Ginsburg said she was encouraged by the Women s March, which saw millions in the US and around the world take part in anti-Trump protests. I ve never seen such a demonstration   both the numbers and the rapport of the people in that crowd. There was no violence, it was orderly. So yes, we are not experiencing the best times but there is there is reason to hope that that we will see a better day. Justice Ginsburg has been on the Supreme Court since 1993 and   at 83 years-old   is the oldest serving member.Asked how much longer she would stay in post, she said:  At my age you have to take it year by year. I know I m OK. What will be next year? She added:  I m hopeful however, because my most senior colleague the one who most recently retired, Justice John Paul Stevens, stepped down at age 90.

We're talking about a TINY .01% of population. Let schools deal with this directly!  Nicole4Trump (@niteowlmom3) February 23, 2017The tweet immediately provoked criticism from liberals. Illinois State Rep. Will Guzzardi (D., Chicago), a supporter of the Obama rule, said that Pritzker s tweet was insensitive and mischaracterized the transgender bathroom and locker room debate. No disrespect  @JBPritzker but it s actually about precisely *not* that. We just want to let kids use their own gender s bathroom,  Guzzardi tweeted in response.  Your idea suggests that we support ppl going into opposite-gender bathrooms, which plays right into transphobic rhetoric. Pritzker has been called  the other mayor of Chicago  for his political influence and massive campaign spending on behalf of Democratic candidates such as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel. He has close ties to the Clintons, having served as the national co-chair of Hillary Clinton s failed 2008 presidential bid, as well as the Obama administration. His sister, Penny Pritzker, served as Secretary of Commerce under President Obama from 2013 until he left office. J.B. Pritzker and his wife were two of the largest individual spenders in the 2016 election, shelling out more than $21 million to elect Clinton and other Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Pritzker has now set his sights on the Illinois governor s mansion and is exploring the idea of self-funding a campaign. Rauner self-financed a $40 million campaign run in 2014, which helped him overcome steep Democratic advantages in the deep blue state.Other Democrats vying for the nomination were quick to criticize Pritzker s protest idea. Tom Elliot, communications director for Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar s gubernatorial campaign, accused the billionaire of  missing the point entirely Telling people to use the other gender s bathroom is missing the point entirely and a terrible idea.  @JBPritzker  #protecttranskids,  Elliot replied.

11594,"EXCLUSIVE Post-Election, Liberal Meltdown Explained In One Hilarious Poem: “Ode To Liberal Lunacy”","If you re like me . . . it s probably been an entertaining year Full of liberal lunacy, hypocrisy, and fear. There s been so many  episodes , it s easy to forget. Luckily, they ve all been logged upon the internet.The circus added one more ring when Donald got the nod To represent the GOP . . . the libs cried  Oh my God.  The media assured them there s no way that Trump could win So they sat back on their parent s couch, enamored by the spin.Election Day was coming . . . entertainment getting slow, Thank God the folks in Hollywood maintained the status quo. A host of A-list wannabes began to trickle forth, And told us that if Trump should win . . . they d all be headed north.When Donald passed two-seventy . . . and victory was at hand, A Trump-induced psychosis sprouted up in Liberal land. The fireworks were cancelled, and purveyors of fake news Were left to invent reasons why their candidate would lose.They blamed it all on Comey, then they blamed a Russian hack A dog that ate their homework, and of course . . . the men in black. A unicorn, a sasquatch, and a faulty Gallup Poll Next . . . they ll blame the shooter who was on the grassy knoll.Those celebs that promised egress . . . failed to adhere We waited for the moving trucks, which never did appear. Yes, not a star left Hollywood, although we wished it so, Despite the fact that Rush and Sean would pay for them to go.So now we re stuck with Miley, and we re stuck with Barbra too, Several washed-up actors . . . and the women of The View. We still have Maddow s meltdowns, and Sharpton s brand of hate. And, we still have Lena Dunham . . . though she s lost a little weight.In Congress, you can bet there s more than one defective gene. Just climb on board the crazy train with Nancy and Maxine. They often make me wonder just how awesome it would be, If parts of California could just slide into the sea.I m watching Liberal journalists like Cooper, Wolf, and Tapper, Spew the Leftist mantra . . . as their careers go down the crapper. Deplorables will have their fun with Liberal rank and file, Watching rats abandon ship when Clinton goes on trial.When Debbie left the DNC, I thought we d lost our clown. Then, from the state of Idaho, came Sally Boynton Brown. The DNC will be reborn, no matter what it takes. And the mix will look like cereal . . . with fruit loops, nuts, and flakes.Then, I saw the women s march, a feministic treat. I watched with fascination as they spilled into the street. Among the more disturbing sights were  lady  Democrats Who dressed up as vaginas . . . others wore their  kitty  hats.An incoherent Ashley Judd paraded  round a stage Saying all those  nasty women  should demand a higher wage. Then ranting about blood-stained sheets upon those women s beds. Somewhere a doctor s wondering why he took her off her meds.Madonna parked her walker to begin her caustic din, Dreams of blowing up the Whitehouse as senility sets in. Even in her senior years . . . the party never ends. She dances  round her nursing home in Vera Wang Depends.The Liberals, you must admit, have done some crazy things. It s fun to see them come unhinged as Donald pulls the strings. So, if you feel you need a shot of petulance and mirth, Sit back and watch the Liberals, it s the greatest show on earth.

11595,"HUFFINGTON POST PUBLISHES, Then DELETES “Trump Is Absolutely Right About Sweden” Article…But OOPS! It Was Archived…And We’re Happy To Share Its BRUTALLY HONEST Content With You!","Yesterday, social media was buzzing after The Huffington Post actually posted a story that not only backed up Trump s assertion about Sweden being a hot mess, but it called out journalists for lying about how the invasion of immigrants are destroying European nations. The title of the article in and of itself, is bad enough:  Trump is absolutely right about Sweden but the honesty with which the writer approaches the subject is even more stunning.  Not surprisingly, after getting a lot of negative reaction from the left who felt the Huffington Post let them down by actually telling the truth, the Huffington Post deleted the story. Our friend @TEN_GOP was kind enough to archive the story before they deleted it.https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/834822902495145985President Trump tweeted clarification of the comments he made about Sweden that the Huffington Post author Ren  Zografos  referenced in his article:My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017After The Huffington Post deleted his article, Ren  Zografos  came out in defense of his words and of Trump comments about Sweden on Twitter:Trump is absolutely right about Sweden https://t.co/jyFM3bjIE8  Ren  Zografos (@zokrates) February 22, 2017Here he Zografos defends his article as nothing but the truth. :Thank you for all supports so far, kind people. The story is nothing but the truth.. #truth #media #Trump  Ren  Zografos (@zokrates) February 23, 2017Sweden has huge problems because of liberal immigration policy Many journalists around the world are eager to condemn Donald Trump no matter what. When he tweeted about immigration in Sweden few days ago, the social media exploded. Most of the opponent said that Trump has made up the immigration problem Sweden have. They are wrong.Only hours later there was a riot of violence and destructions by immigrants in the capitol of Sweden, Stockholm. The police was forced to shoot with ammunition to put and end to it. In Malm , another city south in Sweden they have struggle with gang violence and lawlessness for years. So when Trump talk about that Sweden have an immigration problem he is actually spot on.It s well known for Scandinavians and other Europeans that liberal immigration comes with drugs, rapes, gang wars, robbery and violence. Additional to that we see the respective nations cultures fading away, for good and for bad.But the immigration problem is not only a Swedish predicament. The truth is, that several European cities have huge immigration problems where even the police force is afraid to interfere in some locations in these cities. UK, France and several other European countries are changing rapidly with extreme quantity of immigration. I m not saying immigration is only bad, but a lot of problems come with poor immigration policy, as consequences we get violence, terror and gangs. The fact is that the press here in Europe hasn t doing their job properly. There is this fear for journalists to not report the basic truth   which is that Europe has enormous problems that comes from liberal immigration politics, and as we also now can see in Sweden, but also here in Norway. But it s not political correct for journalists to say or write that immigration in Europe is unsuccessful. When that said, most of the people that come from other countries are behaving flawless and are a gift to our society, but then again to report that everything is all good is simply wrong and these journalists should find another job, because they do not have enough integrity that requires to be decent journalist.Go here to see the actual archived article.

11596,LIBERALS FREAK OUT! Trump Wipes Out One Of Obama’s Most Controversial Executive Actions…Gives Rights Back To States [VIDEO],"Top officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department joined forces to write a letter rejecting the Obama administration s policy on the nondiscrimination laws and supporting the rollback of the policy. They explained their belief that the directive was improperly devised,  without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy. This dispute is putting the President in the middle of transgender rights issues, which he expressed his general sympathy for during the campaign. This is an issue that continues to split the republican party and the nation.Despite his personal sympathies, though, the President has made it clear that he believes this should be a states rights issue. Keeping the federal government in its proper place is another issue that Trump promised to address during his time in office, and he seems to be keeping his promise.The Washington Examiner reported that White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that the President wants to leave this to the states to decide:  It s a state s rights issue, and that s entirely what he believes,  Spicer said.  If a state wants to pass a rule or a law   that s their right. But, it shouldn t be the federal government getting in the way of this. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has resisted this change in the past, saying that she is uncomfortable pushing an issue that could bring harm to transgender students.Via The New York Times:  Ms. DeVos s unease was evident in a strongly worded statement she released on Wednesday night, in which she said she considered it a  moral obligation  for every school in America to protect all students from discrimination, bullying and harassment.Gay rights protesters have come out en mass to chant and protest for their rights to use the bathroom of their choice. Thankfully President Trump remains steadfast in his mission to restore order to public schools.(Source: New York Times)",0

(How many times in the past month have we watched CNN cut the mic of a guest whose political views they disagreed with, and then called it a  technical issue ?)

Is CNN referring to the guy who single-handedly (with a little help from his good friend Hannah Giles, who posed as O Keefe s prostitute) took down ACORN, one of the most corrupt leftist organizations in America? And the same guy who exposed the truth about how Hillary s camp and Democrat operatives, who were actually responsible for inciting violence at Trump rallies?

11599,WOW! DOCUMENT Shows Teachers How To Teach History After Trump Election…”And Not Get Fired”,"Have you ever had an argument with a liberal who swears on her mother s grave that educators in America don t fill our children s heads with propaganda and liberal lies? Here s proof that they re wrong. We found this website listed on a radical leftist Facebook page used to recruit activists in the fight against Trump. One of their primary focuses in their battle against Trump is how to turn kids against him. The google document we reference in this article was created by history educators in Oakland, California. They make it a point to let the teachers know that they can t guarantee they won t be fired for teaching their version of  History  in  Post 2016   as suggested below, but hey, that s why they have teacher s unions right? We ve copied the Google document and taken several screen shots, as these documents, like the one created by the Assistant Professor Melissa Zimdars that was supposed to point out  fake news  sites was deleted once people realized she was just a radical trying to discredit conservative websites. The first thing the website addresses is how to keep your job but still teach your version of history post Trump election:How to Be a Critical History Educator. . . and not get fired.*Here are a few samples of articles the website suggests teachers use to aid them in their  indoctrination  of their students. Check out some of the titles and a sample of what the articles are about. These are pure indoctrination articles that all lean very hard to the Left. (Go to this link for full list): For example, Oakland Unified School District Board of Education Policy 6144 states that  The study of a controversial issue should help students learn how to gather and organize pertinent facts, discriminate between fact and fiction, draw intelligent conclusions and respect the opinions of others,  and Administrative Regulation 6144 states that  Controversial issues may be discussed in the classroom, provided that: 1) The issue is related to the course of study and provides opportunities for critical thinking, for developing tolerance, and for understanding conflicting points of view The ACLU of Washington State has also compiled The Free Speech Rights of Teachers, a legal guide covering speech inside and outside of the classroom, clothing, classroom or office displays and decorations, bulletin boards, conversations with colleagues, and campus demonstrations.*Although we think the guidance in this document is good practice, we can t guarantee you won t get fired. Use your best judgment, plan explicitly, and develop relationships with site, district, and community partners.One of the articles they suggest teachers use to aid them in  teaching history  to their students is The Zinn Education Project: The Zinn Education Project stands in solidarity with those who have denounced Donald Trump s racism, misogyny, xenophobia, and Islamophobia as well as his ignorant and deadly proposals about the environment and climate change. We have been encouraged by the young people in our classrooms and in the streets who are living the maxim that  people make history. As we have tried to make sense of this election and what it means for educators and our students, we have asked ourselves,  What would Howard Zinn say? While detesting the outcome, we doubt he would have been surprised. Zinn observed that,Is not nationalism one of the great evils of our time, along with racism, along with religious hatred? These ways of thinking cultivated, nurtured, indoctrinated from childhood on have been useful to those in power, and deadly for those out of power.But Zinn would surely remind us that just because the rich and powerful want something to happen, doesn t make it so. He would urge us not to lose heart, and to remember our history. Zinn wrote,There is a tendency to think that what we see in the present moment will continue. We forget how often we have been astonished by the sudden crumbling of institutions, by extraordinary changes in people s thoughts, by unexpected eruptions of rebellion against tyrannies, by the quick collapse of systems of power that seemed invincible.No doubt, still reeling from this poisonous election, it is hard to be hopeful. But we invite you to draw on curriculum at the Zinn Education Project to help your students make sense of this new context. We include lessons some highlighted below that:Show how social movements have made important strides even during dark times. Help students explore other moments in history when elites have mobilized to roll back racial and economic progress. Highlight examples of  divide and conquer  politics. Help students explore aspects of Trump s agenda immigration, the environment, Muslims, civil liberties, the press, and economic inequality. It s vital that we introduce our students to the individuals and social movements that have made this country more just. As Howard Zinn reminded us:To omit, or to minimize, these voices of resistance is to create the idea that power only rests with those who have the guns, who possess the wealth, who own the newspapers and the television stations. People who seem to have no power, whether working people, people of color, or women once they organize and protest and create movements have a voice no government can suppress.Civil rights organizer Ella Baker said,  We who believe in freedom cannot rest.  The role of teachers is crucial in this freedom struggle. Please check out the lessons and resources below.",0
11600,"TUCKER CARLSON EXPOSES REFUGEE CONTRACTOR Who Got $43 Million From Feds…Gets $200,000 Salary! [Video]","WORLD RELIEF received over $43 million dollars last year from the feds! They are only one of 9 refugee contractors who make money off of each refugee they bring in. The program was started by Ted Kennedy and Joe Biden 35 years ago. It has exploded to be an industry whereby the agency gets paid per refugee so it makes sense for them to try and make the feds take in more and more of these people.THE BIGGER PROBLEM: The taxpayer pays for all of the  goodies  the refugee gets so World Relief never covers the education, healthcare and many other things that YOU end up paying for!!!The CEO of World Relief and most other agencies all receive a six figure income .YOUR MONEY! SCOTT ARBEITER, WORLD RELIEF S CEO, MAKES $200,000 A YEAR! Arbeiter was on Tucker Carlson tonight trying to explain away how it s ok to take tax dollars from Americans:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lfCv0eQX6cANN CORCORAN OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT WATCH:In September, World Relief settled 1,400 refugees through churches and its 26 offices across the country. In the past year, the organization has worked with 9,759 refugees, the largest number of refugees to go through its office since 1999, according to Christianity Today, having partnered with 1,180 congregations.World Relief is one of nine organizations authorized by the federal government to help resettle refugees. Others include Church World Service, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), Episcopal Migration Ministries, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.I laughed at the use of the word  authorized  as if WR only had to get an authorization (a stamp of approval) and then was completely operating with Christian  charity  instead of mostly federal tax dollars. This is how they spin the lazy media, never mentioning that this is a business a business that could not function without your money!Incidentally, it is World Relief (a member in good standing of the Christian LEFT) that sent around a memo to staff over a year ago to tell them to not give out any R & P Abstracts for any of you calling looking for the plan for your local community.Checking the most recent Form 990 for World Relief we see that they had a total gift/grants income of $58,487,081 and $42,589,050 was provided by you, the US taxpayer, making their federally-funded share of their budget 73% taxpayer funded.I went back 6 years and their income from you jumped about $11.5 million over that time. That of course correlates with the fact that they placed more refugees into your towns each year and since they are paid by the head, that makes sense.Here is a screen shot of page 9 (this info. is usually on page 9) of World Relief s most recent 990. You can find several years of WR s 990 s here if you want to have a deeper look into their finances. All IRS 501(c)3 organizations are required to make their financial information public, so remember that if you are trying to get Form 990s for a local group.",0

11603,TERROR FEARS Keeping Tourists Away From OPEN BORDERS Paris…Costs Economy €1.3 Billion [SHOCKING VIDEOS],"Borderless travel through Europe is dying, a political victim of mass-murder in Paris. That is the conclusion of many sensible people, including Alex Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. Lord Carlile, incidentally, is a Liberal Democrat. Seeing the flaws in the Schengen rules, which allow free movement across much of the European Union, is no longer confined to the political Right.That conclusion is based on reports that at least one of the Paris killers arrived in Greece and claimed to be a refugee from Syria, then travelled on from Greece across the EU unchecked before reaching France.Even before Paris, Schengen was crumbling under the pressure of what some have called the great migration from the Middle East and Africa into the EU. Borderless travel meant a lopsided distribution of new arrivals, often unwanted. The fences that went up over the summer will now become higher and more numerous, as many will no doubt conclude that not only do the foreigners arriving on this continent threaten their culture and livelihood, some of them pose a physical threat too.  Telegraph UKBUT IS IT TOO LATE FOR THE CITY OF ROMANCE? Paris and the surrounding region lost 1.5 million tourists on 2016 as visitors, especially from the Far East, stay away due to ongoing terror fears.According to the Comit  Regional du Tourisme, the Paris Ile-de-France region also lost 1.3 billion euros in tourist income, while the number of nights spent by foreign visitors in the region s hotels also fell by 10.8 per cent.Tourists are probably not too excited about visiting Paris after shocking videos have been circulating that capture the filth and trash left behind by migrants that have overwhelmed the once thriving tourist spot.This is definitely not the Paris you dreamed about: Some sights in particular  have suffered deeply from the lack of tourists and cancellations by school groups , the committee says, including the Arc de triomphe which saw a 24 per cent drop in visitors.The Louvre museum, which earlier this month was subject to an attack from a machete wielding man shouting  Allahu Akbar , also saw a 13.3 per cent drop last year.The fears have even hit Disneyland Paris, which saw a 9.5 per cent drop in foreign visitors.This month has seen a series of disturbances in Paris s suburbs, with one coachload of Korean tourists robbed when men climbed aboard their coach, shouting threats.One witness described the incident as  ten minutes of horror , revealing that one of the men threatened the tourists with an object  resembling a glass bottle .Watch shocking video showing migrants attacking police officers and rioting in Paris. Listen to chants of  Allahu Akbar!  as they attack police officers:The disturbances began after a black youth was allegedly raped with a police truncheon while being arrested. Evenings of rioting spread through the suburbs, with cars torched, windows smashed and shops looted. At times, police appeared to have completely lost control of the situation.The South Korean government has now warned nationals from visiting Paris as tourists, in a move which will cause further damage to France s ailing tourism industry.The city also announced this month it was building an eight-foot tall bullet-proof glass wall around the Eiffel Tower, with visitors forced to enter through new security check points.

11604,BRAVE SWEDISH JOURNALISTS CONFIRM That Trump Is Dead On About Sweden [Video],"SUBTITLED VIDEO:HERE S ANOTHER JOURNALIST S TAKE ON WHAT S HAPPENED TO SWEDEN: SWEDEN: FROM ABBA TO ALLAH In the 1970s Sweden was a stable and wealthy country that was admired by many outsiders. It had international pop artists such as ABBA, sports stars like Bj rn Borg and Ingemar Stenmark as well as Volvo cars. Some outsiders still maintain this rosy image. In 2016, Sweden was still ranked as the world s   goodest   country.Unfortunately, being  good  in the Western world today seems to mean being suicidal.In just two generations, Sweden has become an increasingly dysfunctional and crime-ridden country. The main cause of this negative transformation is non-European mass immigration.I have been chronicling Sweden s decline for many years. My reports were falsely dismissed as fantasies made by an alleged  right-wing extremist.  This denial is no longer possible.Many alternative media and independent websites are now describing these issues. Major media in Britain, Germany, the USA and even in Russia have also finally discovered Sweden s Multicultural problems. This is causing huge embarrassment to the ruling elites in Sweden. They are used to being admired. They are not accustomed to international ridicule, or being viewed as an example of what not to do.Events reached a peak when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly made negative remarks about the problems in Sweden. The Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan L fven has repeatedly rejected suggestions that the authorities have lost control. On February 20, 2017, the former Prime Minister Carl Bildt accused President Trump of   engaging in misinformation and slander  against Sweden. That very same night, violent riots once again erupted in one of the no-go zones near Stockholm that allegedly do not exist.Car burning in Sweden, January 2017 All former Swedish governments since the 1970s, including those led by Mr. Bildt and Mr. L fven, have directly contributed to the massive problems Sweden is currently facing.Carl Bildt served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1991 to 1994. He was in charge of a center-right coalition government by Swedish standards. Bildt served as Minister for Foreign Affairs between 2006 and 2014 in the center-right coalition of PM Fredrik Reinfeldt. These governments also continued mass immigration, just as the Socialist Prime Ministers Olof Palme, Ingvar Carlsson, G ran Persson and Stefan L fven did.The Swedish author Astrid Lindgren published the first stories about Pippi Longstocking in the 1940s. If they were updated for today, perhaps Pippi would have to flee from the suburbs of a Swedish city after having been gang raped by immigrant boys. Alternatively, she might have been a radical Feminist who donned the Islamic veil in order to express her solidarity with the Muslims who are colonizing her country.The Swedish mass media and political elites are very careful not to suggest any connection between rapes and mass immigration from Third World countries. Yet there is every reason to suspect that such a connection exists. We know from other Western European countries that immigrants from certain regions and cultures, particularly from the Islamic world and Africa, are disproportionately represented as perpetrators in rape cases.READ MORE: GATE OF VIENNA",0
11605,COLLEGES ENLISTING “Bias Response Teams” To Snitch On Each Other For…”Offensive” Speech [VIDEO],"Hundreds of Universities across the nation are encouraging students to report other students or even professors who use what they deem to be offensive or even impolite verbiage.  The investigations are being done by Bias Response Team ROBERT SHIBLEY ON WHAT S GOING ON AT ALL THESE COLLEGES;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_lpVv-fShg&feature=youtu.beVia Washington Examiner:  Over the past year, I surveyed more than 230 such reporting systems for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and asked dozens of schools for records about their Bias Response Teams. What I found is detailed in a new report describing how universities broadly define  bias  to include virtually any speech, protected or not, that subjectively offends anyone. On many campuses, administrators are called upon to referee whether speech is polite. The threat to free speech is a real and present issue in America today as some Americans are putting a higher premium on political correctness than the right to freedom of speech.The threat to expressive rights isn t confined to speech from the Left or the Right. Bias reporting systems are being used to report all kinds of speech.At Appalachian State University, students have reported on one another for messages that were pro-Trump as well as calling Trump a  RACIST.  The former were reported by students as  hate speech,  the latter  politically biased slander  that was  unlawful. While students at Ohio State University reported each other for comparing Hillary Clinton to Hitler, students at Texas Tech were telling administrators that the Black Student Union s tweets in support of the Black Lives Matter movement offended them. Meanwhile, the University of Oregon thought it define  community expectations  to students who complained about the oppression.Source: Washington Examiner",0

11607,"WOW! STERLING HTS, MI CITY COUNCIL Caves On Mega-Mosque Project In Middle Of Christian Neighborhood…Council Member CAUGHT On VIDEO Admitting Mosque Is Part Of “Religious War”","In September 2015, the Sterling Heights, MI City Council representing a city of 130,000 people in southeastern Michigan, denied the proposal for a mega-mosque in a residential neighborhood populated largely by Christian refugees who fled Islamic persecution in Iraq.Sterling Heights already has two mosques, but a third, the American Islamic Community Center, applied for a permit and was rejected after it was determined its proposed use was incompatible with the residential area. Too much traffic, too little parking, the city planning commission decided by a 9-0 vote against the mosque in September 2015.But in December, the mosque sued the city and the Obama Justice Department joined in, claiming the real reason the mosque was denied was because the city was caving to anti-Muslim bigotry in the community. A settlement deal was announced last night during a Sterling Heights City Council meeting.As expected, the attorney for the mosque developers claimed the reasons these mostly Christian refugees from Iraq are in opposition to a mosque being built in their residential neighborhood  fake :Sterling Heights, MI residents spoke out against the proposed mega-mosque during a planning commission meeting where the residents were given an opportunity to have their views heard by the city council:Many of the Sterling Heights residents who live in the area of the proposed mosque are Christian-Iraqi refugees who fled persecution of Muslims in their native land. The last thing they want is an Islamic mega-mosque erected in their backyards.  Before announcing the decision to go ahead with the proposed plan for building the mega-mosque in a local neighborhood, Sterling Heights City Councilman Doug Skrzyniarz claimed the primary reasons for going ahead with the plans were to avoid costly litigation while allowing officials to have more say in the mosque s layout. We have reduced our financial risk and we ve been able to have input on what the actual development is going to contain,  Councilman Doug Skrzyniarz told the large crowd. But it s what he said next, that s NOT being reported by local or national news outlets that was even more telling and it happens near the end of the video:",0

I m afraid that you re gonna hurt some of us blacks. You are here, attempting to white-wash America. I don t like your definition of American, because I don t seem to fit within it. These adolescent activists really, really don t want a border wall or travel ban on state-sponsors of terror, because it s not  nice  and  fair : Not letting immigrants into America is really not nice, so please let them in. It s not fair for refugees. Just because I m Mexican, doesn t mean you can build a wall around the country. Please don t build a wall, and don t let people have guns. P.S.   Please don t build a wall around Mexico. P.P.S.   Please, please don t stop the refugees from coming. You re going to separate me away from the rest of my family, and I really don t what that because I love them too much. Some of my friends are really scared about you building a wall, and the travel ban, because a lot of their families live in different places. WATCH: And, then, there s this rebuke from a young lady who appears in both videos: When you speak on things that make me feel uncomfortable or I disagree with, you make me feel small, because I know I can t change it.

11611,WHY DID OBAMA APPROVE $418 Million Sale Of U.S. Weapons To Kenya On His Last Day In Office…And Why Was The Contract Awarded To A Firm Who Never Produced One Of These Planes?,"A group of lawmakers is planning to request a congressional investigation of a $418 million U.S. weapons sale to Kenya approved by the Obama administration on its last day in office. The sale, approved by the State Department and privately notified to Congress on January 19, would allow Kenya to buy 14 weaponized crop-duster-like planes   including two trainer planes and services, for missions against terrorist group al-Shabaab.The deal was publicly announced the Monday after Trump s inauguration.A handful of lawmakers, led by Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC), are questioning why the contract to produce the planes was awarded to major defense firm L3 Technologies   which has never produced such a plane   while a smaller, disabled veteran-owned company in North Carolina that already make those planes at a lower cost was not considered.The L3 contract would primarily benefit its Platform Integration Division in Waco, Texas. An L3 spokesman did not respond to a phone call asking for comment.Budd said the current deal is not a good one for the Kenyans either. He met with the Kenyan Deputy Chief of Mission last Monday, who was allegedly  flabbergasted  they were potentially paying almost $200 million more than necessary. We ve had several Kenyans reach out and thank us,  he said.Several Kenyan analysts also questioned the sale on Twitter, with the accompanying hashtag #KDFWeaponsScam.

11615,OBAMA’S DOJ SUED Michigan City To Allow MEGA-MOSQUE In Majority Christian Residential Neighborhood…Call Jeff Sessions NOW To Stop This Insanity,"There is only ONE WAY to STOP this mosque from being built against the wishes of citizens in this RESIDENTIAL area, whose citizens are comprised of mostly Christian refugees that fled from Iraq to escape persecution at the hands of Muslims in their homeland: Call the US DOJ and ask our new Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review this case TODAY and ask the DOJ to STOP the mega-mosque from being built: 202-514-2000 A city of 130,000 people in southeastern Michigan is under the gun of Islamic pressure following its denial of a mega-mosque in a residential neighborhood populated largely by Christian refugees who fled Islamic persecution in Iraq.Sterling Heights already has two mosques, but a third, the American Islamic Community Center, applied for a permit and was rejected after it was determined its proposed use was incompatible with the residential area. Too much traffic, too little parking, the city planning commission decided by a 9-0 vote against the mosque in September 2015.But in December, the mosque sued the city and the Obama Justice Department joined in, claiming the real reason the mosque was denied was because the city was caving to anti-Muslim bigotry in the community. Now, a settlement deal is headed to the Sterling Heights City Council on Tuesday evening. If the council votes to sign the deal, it could be very costly for the city.Watch the attorney for the mosque developers call the reasons these mostly Christian refugees from Iraq are in opposition to a mosque being built its their residential neighborhood  fake :Local residents fear it s a bad deal, something similar to the Obama DOJ-orchestrated deal forced upon nearby Pittsfield Township, Michigan, last year. That town had to pay out $1.7 million to local Muslims to whom it had denied a permit for an Islamic school, and township employees were ordered to undergo sensitivity training to assure they never again discriminate against Muslims.Attorney General Jeff Sessions could cancel any similar deal from taking effect in Sterling Heights, but only if he is aware of it and acts quickly. If the city council is found to be cooperating with the Obama DOJ staff who are expediting this consent order to stick it to the Sessions/Trump team, then this city will go nuts,  said Dick Manaserri, spokesman for Secure Michigan, a group formed to educate the public on Shariah law and how it differs from American law.In last November s presidential election, Donald Trump carried Sterling Heights, normally a Democratic Party stronghold, by 56 to 44 percent over Hillary Clinton. He also carried Macomb County, home to Sterling Heights and also a Democratic-oriented county.But Trump s new AG, Sessions, is apparently not yet fully in control of the Justice Department, which includes many holdovers from the Obama administration. Why else would Jeff Sessions not dismiss the Obama DOJ lawsuit against Sterling Heights?  Manaserri asks.  We have been told by legal experts that he has the power to simply dismiss the lawsuit. A consent order typically implies wrongdoing with the application of penalties. When the planning commission denied the mosque permit in September 2015, hundreds of Sterling Heights residents gathered outside City Hall to celebrate. That celebration was caught on video, and critics cited it as evidence the city was somehow biased against Muslims. Tom Mitchell is a resident of Sterling Heights whose family has been there since 1965. He s seen the city s transformation over the past couple of decades under the control of what he calls  progressives.  He avoids the world  Democrat  because the city s elections are technically nonpartisan. I feel that with the left taking over, they are destroying this community. I don t want to become another Dearborn or a Hamtramck. And our elected officials are enabling this takeover,  he said.Hamtramck, just a few miles south of Sterling Heights, became the nation s first city with a Muslim-majority city council in 2016, and a large portion of Dearborn resembles a Middle Eastern country with signs in Arabic and women walking the streets with their faces veiled.He said it s not a matter of discrimination. Churches have been denied building projects in the past because their sites were too close to residential housing. They didn t get the federal government to sue the city; they simply picked another site. I truly believe this one man, Mr. Sessions, has the power to throw out any consent decree that was engineered by Obama s Department of Justice. That is our hope,  Mitchell said.  In fact, I know of hundreds of us who are praying for that opportunity to get it in Jeff Sessions  hands, before Tuesday night, because once it s signed, how do you overturn that? Signing it is tantamount to a consent that we re a bunch of bigots here in Sterling Heights. Calls to Sessions  press office went unanswered Monday as all federal offices were closed for President s Day. A stinger in the eye  of Iraqi Christians in Sterling HeightsMitchell said he and others are trying to get the word out in the community that the Tuesday council meeting will include an agenda item on a proposed settlement to the lawsuit.But the city council did not publish its Tuesday-night agenda in the local legal newspaper, the weekly Sterling Heights Sentry, and it didn t put a notice on its official website until late Friday. We just found out about this, so we ve been rushing to try to put together an opposition to stop the city from signing this document, which is an admission of guilt to something we don t think we committed,  Mitchell said.  As a local resident, I m gonna say we don t discriminate in Sterling Heights. We ve already got two mosques, a Sikh temple, a Buddhist temple and many other diverse houses of worship, so for this city to be called discriminatory is unbelievable. The unfortunate thing is, they want to plop it right in the middle of a Chaldean Christian neighborhood,  Mitchell added.  Somebody planned that. Somebody is seeking to put a stinger in someone s eye. Dr. Ramsay Dass, M.D., president of the American Middle East Christian Congress, said he is not so concerned about another mosque being built in Sterling Heights. He s more concerned about the big picture of political pressure being placed on small cities by an out-of-control federal bureaucracy using coercive tactics. As an American citizen, they are entitled to build a mosque, but I do not believe in making laws that small cities and towns cannot fight politically or financially,  Dass told WND.The federal law being used to coerce cities into approving mosques, even when the mosque is in a residential neighborhood, is the Religion Land Use and Institutional Persons Act, or RELUIPA, which was passed by Congress in 2000.As WND has reported, the Obama administration used this law increasingly against communities denying mosques and less against those denying the construction of churches.Nahren Anweya is a spokesperson for the persecuted Middle Eastern Christians living in Michigan. She has appeared on Fox News and spoken at congressional hearings on Christian persecution in the Middle East. Her family has been living in Michigan since they escaped Iraq in 1989. She said Sterling Heights is home to the nation s second largest Chaldean Catholic community of Iraqi Christians. They thought they found a safe haven, only to find out their ancient nemesis, the Middle Eastern Sunni Muslims, were being resettled in the same county and wanted to build a mosque right in the middle of their neighborhood.Most Iraqi Christians are either Chaldean Catholic or members of an even more ancient Christian sect, the Assyrian Church of the East. The Assyrians speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus. My family they re pretty patriotic American Assyrian Christians. Both of my great-grandfathers were crucified by Muslims literally on a cross,  Anweya told WND.  And that was because they were proud Christians, my great-grandfather used to walk around with a large gold cross around his neck, we never tried to hide it. So to see those ancient persecutors not only showing up in Macomb County en masse, but building a mosque on top of the Chaldean neighborhood, is  traumatizing,  Anweya said. While we are living in our safe haven, to allow a mosque to be built where we are is like putting us back to Iraq. We left everything behind to start from scratch, and then watching it follow us, this is traumatizing,  she said.  There are so many Muslim countries who could take these Muslim refugees, but they send them here. If we were treated fairly in their countries, then I would say let them build as many mosques as they want, but that day is far from reality. She said Muslim leaders don t believe in equality, and anything they say on that level is mere pandering to gullible local Christians. They don t believe in equality, even if they say they do,  she said.  Show me a Muslim country where Christians are treated 100 percent equal. Why is Christianity being degraded in every Muslim country? In 2003, we were 1.3 million Christians in Iraq, and that is where Christianity began and thrived, and now these are people who would be beheaded for their Christian faith. So, she said, the Assyrian and Chaldean communities have news for the Islamic centers that wish to build in their midst: These people are not going to give up their Christian faith,  Anweya said.  Where a nation is most vulnerable, is when they are not even calling themselves Christian anymore, that s the most dangerous I believe. When the sword is placed to your neck it s too late,  she added.  The Christians from Iraq, we are not building churches in Dearborn, so why are they building mosques in Sterling Heights? If we started building churches in Dearborn, I think you would see a few protests coming from them. Read more at:WND ",0
11616,30 WORKERS FIRED For Skipping Work To Protest On Behalf Of Illegal Immigrants…Calls Employer Who Fired Them A “Racist” [VIDEO],"The owner of a masonry business in Colorado is speaking out about his decision to fire more than 30 employees who did not show up for work in support of last week s  Day Without Immigrants  protest.Jim Serowski, the owner of JVS Masonry, told CNN in an interview on Sunday he did nothing wrong and said he warned his employees about the consequences of joining in the protest movement before they actually took the day off.Serowski said he told his employees,  If you re going to stand up for what you believe in you have to be willing to pay the price. On Saturday, Serowski also spoke to his local CBS News affiliate in Denver after one employee made an allegation that his termination felt like racism. Serowski denied the decision to terminate the workers was in any way racially motivated and said he made the decision because the employees violated the company s policy about not showing up to work. He said the decision put his company in a real bind because he had to shutdown two job sites on Thursday due to the protest and he is now risks missing an important construction deadline. They were told, if you no-call-no-show, you don t have a job,  Serowski told the news station.  It s that simple. ",0
11617,"LEFTIST MEDIA DESTROYED Mike Flynn, Cracked Jokes After Horrible LIE Obama’s National Security Advisor Told Media, Families Of Benghazi Victims [VIDEO]","Fun fact: While Trump press secretary Sean Spicer fielded 55 questions on February 14 related to the Flynn debacle, Obama s press secretary Jay Carney received only 13 questions from reporters on September 12, 2012, three of which were set-ups to blast Mitt Romney s criticism of the administration after the attack. 55 to 13.So as we now suffer through yet another patch of media mania, conspiracy theories, and unsubstantiated claims about how Trump hearts Russia, as well as the daily beatings endured by Spicer, let s reminisce to when the media and Obama s press flaks spun, deflected even joked about golf and  Saturday Night Live! less than a week after Benghazi.Buried deep beneath the Michael Flynn hysteria this week was Judicial Watch s release of newly obtained State Department documents related to the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. One email confirms again that the Obama administration knew the day after the attack it was not a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video. That was the excuse shamefully propagated by top Obama administration officials (including the president himself) and swallowed whole by a media establishment desperate to help Obama win re-election six weeks later.According to the summary of a call on September 12, 2012 between State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy and several congressional staffers, Kennedy was asked if the attack came under cover of protest:  No this was a direct breaching attack,  he answered. Kennedy also denied the attack was coordinated with the protests in Cairo over the video:  Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint. But of course nothing matches the audacity of trope by Obama s National Security Advisor Susan Rice on September 16, 2012. Rice went on several Sunday shows to peddle a story she knew was completely phony, one that was already quickly unraveling even as most in the media and administration tried to keep it intact.Rice repeats the line that Benghazi attack was not premediated and was connected to the demonstrations in Cairo over the video (a document obtained by Judicial Watch last year shows Hillary Clinton met with Rice a few days before her television appearances). Which presidential administration is fact-challenged, again?In a press gaggle on Air Force One the next day, guess how many times Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about Rice s comments? Ten? Five? One? Not once. Let me repeat that. The day after Obama s national security advisor was on five news programs to blame a terrorist attack on a YouTube video, not one reporter asked the White House about it. I actually had to re-read the transcripts several times, even checking the date over and over, to make sure this was accurate. Her name did not even come up.No discussion about the investigation. No discussion about emerging evidence from around the world that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack. (The only time it was mentioned was when Jen Psaki criticized Mitt Romney s comments about how the administration handled Benghazi and questioned whether he was ready for  primetime. )Here s what they did discuss: Debate prep, Occupy Wall Street, and the Chicago s teachers strike. An actual human reporter asked this:  It was a beautiful weekend for golf and he wasn t out on the course. Is it safe to assume maybe he was doing some preparation at the White House?  WHAT? Then they joked about football and  Saturday Night Live.   The FederalistWatch here as Susan Rice intentionally lies her way around the different TV networks and Trey Gowdy blasts the double standard of our media:Here is US Ambassador to the UN, who was elevated to Obama s National Security Advisor after she lied to the media and to the American people about Benghazi protests being sparked by a video.

Joy started out by asking if Hayworth had any  discomfort  that an  undocumented  woman walked into a courtroom to file a protection order against an abusive boyfriend (no mention of his residency status) and was met with ICE agents who arrested her (The job of an ICE agent is to arrest people who illegally cross our borders). An alternative version would be: A woman who has broken our laws, and living in our country ILLEGALLY, was arrested after walking into a courthouse to ask for the same protections afforded to taxpaying US citizens, after it was discovered that she is also a lawbreaker.However it wasn t until Hayworth exposed Reid s liberal hypocrisy by bringing up the fact that Elizabeth Warren is not Native-American that Reid flipped out and kicked the GOP guest off the show.",0
11619,"THE BIG QUESTION: Why Do We STILL Take 1,000 Somali Refugees A MONTH?","Please understand that our government is unable to know the exact number of Somalis we re taken in through all the different ways the government imports them. The number above does not include all the Somalis who got in to the US through other means including the Diversity Visa Lottery (50K admitted in the name of diversity), those who received student visas and disappeared into the American woodwork, are here protected by Temporary Protected Status, or who came across one of our borders and applied for asylum (or simply disappeared) over the last 3 decades.And, in order for there to be only 129,000 people of Somali ancestry here it would require us to believe some who came to the US left the country, that a whole heck of a lot of them died while they weren t having babies for nearly 35 years! It is nuts!When the government does census counts do they rely completely on who is willing to answer surveys, or do they make some attempt to look at government-held numbers about those who entered the country? Apparently they rely on Somalis willing to tell them something!In addition to the 136,376 through FY16, we have admitted 4,478 in the last 4 months and 19 days.And, we pick up Somalis all over the world, and I can assure you that vetting the wandering Somalis is impossible.Here is where that 4,478 were placed since October 1, 2016 (according to Wrapsnet): Please check out Wrapsnet if you want to dig into your state or any other numbers. It s a great resource! The top five states  welcoming  Somalis since October 1, 2016 are Minnesota (609), New York (397), Ohio (306), Kentucky (283) and Arizona (276). Virtually all Somalis are Muslims. WHERE ARE THE CONGRESSMEN FROM THESE TOP FIVE STATES? RAND PAUL, JOHN MCCAIN and others have been silent on the effort for the UN to push Somalis into our towns! And, of all the ethnic groups entering the US right now, Somalis (I believe) lead the pack in the number of terrorist attacks or attempted terrorist attacks, or who have been arrested and convicted of helping to support jihadists in some form or another.Frankly, there is absolutely no reason for the US to take in more Somalis!

11620,CHARLIE DANIELS WARNS LIBERALS: Knock It Off Or “There Will Be Blood In The Streets!”,"Over a century ago, the United States of America went through a divisive and bloody Civil War that separated the people of this nation bone from marrow. It split friends, families and eventually the nation itself as a line was drawn dividing the Union States of the North from the newly formed Confederacy of the Southern States.Ostensibly, the war that followed was fought over the abolition of slavery, a devilish practice that never should have been allowed in the first place, and although it was the basic issue for the conflict   as is the case so much of the time   there were a myriad of other issues involved.One   in my opinion   was just plain stubbornness and pride and the dogged determination that the South would not let itself be told what to do by the other half of the country, but trade, tariffs and different attitudes and beliefs about just how far a federal government could go in setting the tone and making laws to be obeyed by all the states were also involved.The point I m trying to make is that the feelings festered so long and ran so deep that men whose fathers had stood shoulder to shoulder in the war for independence faced off across fields of battle and killed each other.The Civil War never should have happened, and had cooler heads prevailed on both sides, never would have. Southerners had to know that slavery was an abomination to the principles they had fought and died for in the Revolution.No man has the right to own another man, to reap the fruits of his labor for nothing, to consider his children nothing more than commodities to be sold off or traded away on a whim, separating families and breeding human beings like livestock.But instead of acknowledging the very obvious evil of this situation, politicians from the South, convinced that the economy of the Southern States was dependent on slavery, chose to become a separate nation and soon after over six hundred thousand Americans lost their lives in a senseless war that would set the Southern States back a half century.Surely, had it been approached by fair, level-headed men on both sides of the issue, abolition could have been achieved without war. But the rhetoric grew ever hotter. Brash young men on both sides, who had never fired a gun in anger, viewed a war as the pinnacle of romanticism, and implacable politicians refused to give an inch. Is this not the same attitude we see on the streets of America today?I see young people interviewed on television who can t even articulate the reason they are protesting. Others bent on destruction who probably espouse no cause but chaos.I ve seen hysterical protestors screaming about First Amendment rights which they seem to think only protect them and those who think like them and that the opposition has no First Amendment protection and should be shouted down at all costs.The rhetoric is becoming hotter and more nonsensical, the radical element more apparent, the violence and destruction of property more common place.The pot is boiling and it s only a matter of time before there will be blood on the streets.Americans have the right to civil disobedience, a right to gather and demonstrate against some policy they feel is unfair or harmful to the country at large, but they do not have the right to interrupt commerce, break windows, burn cars or do bodily harm to those who disagree with them.People who won t listen to reason, who ignore the law of the land and who try to stifle the opinions of others tend to forget that there is an element of violence on the other side as well, a side that, thankfully, so far has not yet come forth.But, should these conditions continue, someday soon the violent elements of both persuasions will find themselves on the same streets, and what will ensue will not be pretty.Learn from history, or repeat it.What do you think?Pray for our troops, our police and the peace of Jerusalem.God Bless America  Charlie DanielsCharlie Daniels is a legendary American singer, song writer, guitarist, and fiddler famous for his contributions to country and southern rock music.

BCI has always celebrated diversity and supported the immigrant community. . . Because of the time-sensitive nature of the jobs, these employees were assigned to, all employees were told that they would need to show up for work or they would be terminated.  On Thursday, the majority of BCI s employees fulfilled their obligations to our clients, but eighteen employees did not.  Regretfully, and consistent with its prior communication to all its employees, BCI had no choice but to terminate these individuals.  The reason these employees missed work to engage in peaceful demonstrations had nothing to do with BCI s decision to terminate them. . .

Frankly I used to think the Congressional Black Caucus, when it was first formed, was a good thing,  Lord began.  I changed my mind on this. I don t think there should be any caucuses in the House of Representatives that are divided by race. I mean, heaven forbid, if David Duke got elected and wanted to form a Congressional White Caucus, that would be appalling,  he said, explaining his change of heart. Sir, Jeffrey, that is I m looking for a word here. Beyond it s completely preposterous. To compare the Klan to the Congressional Black Caucus,  Brooks smilingly replied, visibly upset by the analogy his fellow panelist drew. You would be okay with a Congressional White Caucus? Really?  Lord shot back, interrupting Brooks  explanation of the Black Caucus s purpose.  I didn t say that,  was Brook s immediate reply.  Daily Caller ",0

11634,TRUMP WAS RIGHT About CNN Being “Very Fake News”: Federal Judge Rules Against CNN In “FAKE NEWS” Case…May Have Acted With “Actual Malice”,"Everyone laughing after Trump rebranded CNN as #VeryFakeNews. Then they go on their networks saying how ""dangerous"" and ""not funny"" it was   pic.twitter.com/d3IiaVh5VL  Asa J   (@asamjulian) February 17, 2017Those who accuse CNN and other mainstream media outlets of  fake news  will probably revel in a recent decision by a federal judge in Atlanta, Georgia. While Judge Orinda Evans didn t all out declare that CNN was peddling in falsehoods, she did take aim at the network in an initial judgment in favor of a former hospital CEO who sued CNN accusing them of purposely skewing statistics to reflect poorly on a West Palm Beach hospital. Judge Evans didn t mince words in her 18-page order allowing the case to move forward, and dismissing CNN s attempt to get it thrown out of court.Davide Carbone, former CEO of St. Mary s Medical Center in West Palm Beach, filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN after they aired what he claims were a  series of false and defamatory news reports  regarding the infant mortality rate at the hospital. CNN s report said the mortality rate was three times the national average. However, Mr. Carbone contends that CNN  intentionally  manipulated statistics to bolster their report. He also claims that CNN purposely ignored information that would look favorable to the hospital in order to sensationalize the story. In our case, we contended that CNN essentially made up its own standard in order to conduct an  apples to oranges  comparison to support its false assertion that St. Mary s mortality rate was 3 times higher than the national average. Accordingly, the case against CNN certainly fits the description of media-created  Fake News.  said Carbone s attorney L. Lin Wood, in a statement to LawNewz.com.Wood says that as a result of CNN s story Carbone lost his job and it became extremely difficult for him to find new employment in the field of hospital administration. False and defamatory accusations against real people have serious consequences. Neither St. Mary s or Mr. Carbone did anything to deserve being the objects of the heinous accusation that they harmed or put babies and young children at risk for profit,  Wood said.On Wednesday, Federal District Judge Orinda Evans ruled that the case could move forward, even ruling that she found that CNN may have acted with  actual malice  with the report   a standard necessary to prove a defamation claim. The Court finds these allegations sufficient to establish that CNN was acting recklessly with regard to the accuracy of its report, i.e., with  actual malice,  the order reads. CNN had tried to get the case dismissed.  LawNewz",0

Racism gave birth to the idea of race. This is a [sic] oversimplified definition Fast forward to today, where the student government at the University of Wisconsin-Madison said on Wednesday that black students should be offered free tuition and housing because blacks were legally barred from education during slavery and university remains out of reach for black students today.The Associated Students of Madison said in a resolution that suburban high school students are over-represented. The group said consideration of ACT and SAT scores in applications upholds  white supremacy  because it restricts opportunities for the poor.The college has proposed measures aimed at improving diversity.So what about Native Americans? What about Asians, Hispanics, refugees, Eskimos, European immigrants, descendants of the holocaust who died before we entered the fight?  And what about  the Irish who were treated horribly by other immigrants right here in America, after fleeing their homeland to escape the potato famine? What about descendants of Salem Witch trials? What about families who lost their primary bread winner fighting for our nation overseas, or as a first responder? Are they not worthy of a FREE education? What about poor white people? You know, there is such a thing. Despite what these snowflakes and their radical leftist educators would like you to believe, there are actually white families who struggle to make ends meet and live in ghettos or dirt-poor rural areas. Where does it stop? And who gets to decide that the only protected and special group who  deserves  a FREE college education are blacks? The proposal calls for 10 percent of donations from the college to bolster financial aid and study the feasibility of test-optional and geographically weighted admissions.Madison enrollment is currently made up of about two-percent of black students.University spokeswoman Meredith McGlone noted that the proportion of  students of color  has grown from 11 percent to 15 percent over the last decade.McGlone said the Chancellor proposed giving first-generation transfers from two-year schools free tuition for a year, contingent on funding in state budget, and a recent $10 million donation will be invested in expanding the Chancellor s Scholarship Program.-FOX News",0

You cannot win this if it turns violent. If you normalize violence, if violence is okay, you cannot win. You can win by reaching out to conservatives. Talk to them.

A lot of people were elected to Congress based on bold promises about ObamaCare, tax reform and regulatory reform,  Noah Wall, FreedomWorks  national director of campaigns, told Fox News.  We have to hold them to campaign promises, keep up the momentum and the energy. It s time to get off the bench and get this to work.

If successful, their efforts could mark a revival of the eight-year-old Tea Party movement   a political revolt against big government under then-President Obama that crested with Republicans  historic 2010 House takeover.

Media Forgot Ted Kennedy Asked Russia To Intervene In Election, Help Defeat Ronald Reagan","In 1991 a reporter for the London Times found a very interesting memorandum composed in 1983 by Victor Chebrikov, the top man in the KGB.  The memo was addressed to Yuri Andropov, the top man in the USSR.  The subject: Sen. Edward KennedyThe memorandum reads in part:  On 9-10 May of this year, Sen. Edward Kennedy s close friend and trusted confidant [John] Tunney was in Moscow.  The senator charged Tunney to convey the following message, through confidential contacts, to the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Y. Andropov. The message included an offer to visit Moscow  The main purpose of the meeting, according to the senator, would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA.   Kennedy was offering to help Soviet Russia deal with President Reagan, by telling them how to paint their propaganda picture.Via Forbes: The document,  Kengor continues,  has stood the test of time. I scrutinized it more carefully than anything I ve ever dealt with as a scholar. I showed the document to numerous authorities who deal with Soviet archival material. No one has debunked the memorandum or shown it to be a forgery. Kennedy s office did not deny it. As part of the deal, Kennedy promised to make sure that certain American news networks gave Andropov air time and would go soft on him while still making it look like true journalism.Why would Kennedy do this, you might ask? Tunney remarked that the senator wants to run for president in 1988,  the memorandum continued.  Kennedy does not discount that during the 1984 campaign, the Democratic Party may officially turn to him to lead the fight against the Republicans and elect their candidate president. So apparently, if a democratic senator actually seeks out help from Soviet Russia to beat his opponent, that s ok, but if a Republican cabinet member so much as has contacts in Russia, the gloves come off.(Source: Forbes)",0

11651,IN ORDER FOR TRUMP TO “Drain The Swamp” He’s Going To Have Take On The Alligators…And Here’s How [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump is a man in a hurry. Throughout his campaign he laid out his priorities. He s a man who likes to get things done and is intent on keeping his promises. We ve seen this before. But draining a swamp is never easy.As President Trump begins the process of implementing commitments and draining the swamp through his executive orders and legislative initiatives, he needs to clearly understand that the swamp will undoubtedly fight back.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has already slow-rolled the confirmation process of the President s new cabinet.The angry left has mobilized and encouraged protestors to attempt to create the impression that his new policies lack public support.Even some Republicans are proving to be less than helpful. These actions were all expected. Candidate Trump got a taste of this opposition during his campaign.What is conceivably new and maybe somewhat unexpected in terms of its scale and impact is the fourth branch of the U.S. government   the bureaucracy.Perhaps the most glaring example of the power of the bureaucracy was the decision by his acting Attorney General to refuse to defend the President s Executive Order on a refugee pause as new enhanced vetting protocols from seven countries were developed.The swamp now has officially claimed its first victim of the administration, Mike Flynn. Flynn made a mistake, no doubt about it. But he fell victim to the bureaucracy that was not fond of him or his reform agenda. It collected information secretively and then leaked it to a willing and eager media.Team Trump will soon see that this is just the tip of the iceberg. The federal bureaucracy is full of employees who do not share his world view. From Foggy Bottom to NOAA to the IRS, they have become increasingly politicized. The bureaucracy would be happy to undermine and  resist . Some have already begun and it will only get worse.President Trump must recognize this threat to his agenda. He needs to gather his team and get them on the field. The president has the ability to fill roughly 5,000 positions. While that number may seem massive, it pales in comparison to the almost three million workers in the fourth estate. Many if not most of who are committed to maintaining the status quo.Candidate Trump ran a clean and successful campaign that lasted about 18 months. If he expects to be a successful two-term president, he will need to build a strong core of supporters throughout the executive branch who share his same vision.Bringing change to Washington is complex.Newt Gingrich has advised President Trump. If you are determined to drain the swamp, beware of the alligators.Newt speaks from personal experience. He was a true transformational leader who confronted the status quo.The swamp fought back taking advantage of every  mistake  made by the former Speaker.The bottom line for Speaker Gingrich was that after four years, the swamp had claimed Newt Gingrich as its victim. And it then came creeping back.Balanced budgets and strong economic growth soon vanished. The bureaucracy and federal spending that fed it soon started rising again.If President Trump wants to truly transform America he will need loyal teammates to make it happen. He will need to run a tight ship. Yes, these alligators are relentless.No one should doubt what s at stake here. President Trump is serious about draining the swamp, and as we are currently witnessing, the swamp will surely fight back.Trump s team needs to find a way to improve quickly because if they don t, Mike Flynn will have been the first of many who will fall victim to the predatory swamp!

11652,WOW! WHY TRUMP’S PICK FOR LABOR SECRETARY Withdrew Just Hours Before His Senate Hearing,"President Donald Trump s pick for secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, has withdrawn from the nomination just hours before his first scheduled appearance before the Senate HELP committee.Puzder s nomination was controversial from the start because of some of his own business practices that many felt were less than generous.  He officially withdrew after an interview his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, did on The Oprah Winfrey Show came to light.  She claimed that she had to flee from her, then husband, and that she had been abused by Puzder during their marriage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cURHgCbSWOcFierstein has since admitted that her allegations were false and that she concocted them to get a better settlement in their divorce.  She has also sent a letter to the Senate in an attempt to clear her ex-husband s name but it seems to be too little too late.Puzder released this statement concerning his withdrawal.I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor. I'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me.  Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) February 15, 2017(Source: Daily Mail) ",0

11656,BOMBSHELL: Political Assassination Of Mike Flynn Reportedly Led By High-Level Obama Advisor Worried Hidden Details Of Iran Deal Will Be Exposed,"Much of the political world was shocked by the sudden resignation of National Security Adviser Mike Flynn from the administration of President Donald Trump, ostensibly the result of his having been exposed for having lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of a phone call Flynn had with a Russian ambassador before the inauguration, exposed by leaks from anonymous sources in the executive branch.According to a piece by Eli Lake of Bloomberg, however, that explanation for Flynn s unexpected departure only three weeks into the new administration has been viewed rather skeptically by some.Instead of simple miscommunications and alleged lies to cover such a mistake up, it is being surmised in some circles that Flynn just fell victim to a  political assassination  effort launched by holdovers and loyalists of the administration of former President Barack Obama. There does appear to be a well-orchestrated effort to attack Flynn and others in the administration,  explained California GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, chair of the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee.  From the leaking of phone calls between the president and foreign leaders to what appears to be high-level FISA Court information, to the leaking of American citizens being denied security clearances, it looks like a pattern. Yesterday, CBS published a  timeline  that discredits Trump s former national security advisor General Mike Flynn. Hmmm did Ben Rhodes have anything to do with CBS News publishing this?Indeed, such was the message garnered by The Washington Free Beacon through interviews with multiple anonymous sources both inside and out of the White House in regard to former Obama administration officials and loyalists working quietly from within to sabotage and handicap Trump s agenda.It was believed that the effort to take down Flynn was led by former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes, largely due to Flynn s open opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and plans to expose the hidden details, a deal that Rhodes was instrumental in arranging and securing in 2015.The steady drip of leaks over the past weeks and months regarding Flynn s alleged ties to Russia are believed to have emanated from a veritable  task force  set up in the shadows of the administration, in the White House and assorted executive branch agencies, by Rhodes and others.One veteran of the national security advisory team told The Free Beacon it was  undeniable  that there had been a  campaign to discredit Flynn  that began even before the inauguration, one that seemed similar to the campaign to sell the Iran deal which  probably features the same cast of characters. The biggest problem is the American public s trust in the administration around the White House, sources told The Free Beacon. The larger issue that should trouble the American people is the far-reaching power of unknown, un-elected apparatchiks in the intelligence community deciding for themselves both who serves in government and what is an acceptable policy they will allow the elected representatives of the people to pursue,  the National Security Council official said. Put aside the issue of Flynn himself. That nameless, faceless bureaucrats were able to take out a president s national security adviser based on a campaign of innuendo without evidence should worry every American,  he added.Flynn has been a target of the left ever since he was forced out of the Obama administration and began to criticize the former president s policies. It was well-known among insiders that exposing the Iran deal was at the top of Flynn s agenda in the new administration. The Obama administration knew that Flynn was going to release the secret documents around the Iran deal, which would blow up their myth that it was a good deal that rolled back Iran,  a congressional aide with intimate knowledge of the fight over the Iran nuclear deal told The Free Beacon.  So in December, the Obama NSC started going to work with their favorite reporters, selectively leaking damaging and incomplete information about Flynn. After Trump was inaugurated some of those people stayed in and some began working from the outside, and they cooperated to keep undermining Trump,  the aide added, referencing the series of leaks from within the White House targeting Flynn and others.  Last night s resignation was their first major win, but unless the Trump people get serious about cleaning house, it won t be the last. Conservative Tribune",0
11657,JAPANESE SCHOOLS DON’T EMPLOY JANITORS…Why Americans Should Demand Our Schools Adopt The Same Policy [VIDEO],"Watch NPR employee and Afghanistan refugee (who was eventually arrested) join others as they block our newly appointed Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from entering a school in DC on her first day on the job:Back in 2011, Newt Gingrich was running for president, and he proposed a radical idea to help schools cut costs: Fire the janitors and pay students to do the cleaning.Needless to say, the idea to turn students into moonlighting janitors had about as much support as Gingrich s presidential campaign.But ask Kim De Costa and she ll say there isn t anything radical about asking students to clean up after themselves. At her school, there are no janitors. Instead, students in grades 6-12 meet in teams once or twice a week to clean assigned areas.De Costa is the executive director of the Armadillo Technical Institute. It s a public charter school in Phoenix, Ore., a few miles from the California border.For 30 minutes after lunch, students sweep, mop, take out the trash and even clean the bathrooms   but responsibilities rotate so no one is stuck scrubbing toilets more than two or three times a year.De Costa says it s easy to encourage students to respect their environment when they re the ones responsible for preserving it. We really wanted a school where the students took ownership and made it their own,  says De Costa, who helped found ATI in 1999.The school still has maintenance staff for the difficult or dangerous work. But for the most part, students at ATI handle the daily upkeep. And with a little help from peer pressure, the school stays clean.Eden Cox, a 10th-grader, says that recently she had to confront a classmate after he left a mess behind.  I got on to him and said,  Can you please throw your trash away so I don t have to,    Cox recalls. After all, it s our school,  she says, with an emphasis on  our. Places like ATI that build cleanup into the curriculum are rare in the United States.But in Japan, there s a long tradition of students cleaning their own schools.There,  school is not just for learning from a book,  says Michael Auslin   a former English teacher in Japan.  It s about learning how to become a member of society and taking responsibility for oneself,  says Auslin, who is now a resident scholar and director of Japan studies at the American Enterprise Institute.To make cleaning easier, Japanese students put on slippers before entering the classroom to prevent dirt from being dragged into the room.Many Hands Make Light WorkAt Brentwood Academy outside Nashville, Tenn., keeping the school spick-and-span is just part of the daily routine for students.Each day before P.E., students at the private prep school report for 10 minutes of  clean-up  duty in their assigned areas.Susan Shafer, the school s director of communications, considers  clean-up  an additional component of the school s mission of educating the whole person. We re trying to train them for life,  says Shafer.  They re all going to go to college. No one is going to clean their dorm room for them. Maddie Jarrard, an 11th-grader, is responsible for dusting a classroom every day. She says even after sports games, Brentwood players are expected to stay behind to pick up any trash left in the stands. They re not only trying to keep the place clean,  says Jarrard, referring to Brentwood s staff.  But they re also trying to build character in each student. While some parents might balk at the idea of a school taking time away from class to make students push a broom, educators at both ATI and Brentwood both say that parents have shown overwhelming support.

11663,WOW! HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER Cracks Down On Refugee Invasion…Calls Out Open-Borders Soros For Secretly Using “TONS OF MONEY AND HEAVY ARTILLERY” To Influence Politics,"Hungary s populist prime minister on Friday lashed out against billionaire financier George Soros, claiming he and groups backed by him want to secretly influence the country s politics.In his annual state of the nation speech, Viktor Orban said groups partly funded by Soros, who was born in Hungary, needed to be made transparent and identifiable. Large-bodied predators are swimming here in the waters. This is the trans-border empire of George Soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery,  said Orban, who received a Soros-funded scholarship as Hungary was transitioning from communism to democracy in the late 1980s. It is causing trouble   that they are trying secretly and with foreign money to influence Hungarian politics,  Orban said.He did not cite evidence backing his claims, and did not identify the groups he mentioned. Government officials had earlier taken aim at corruption watchdog Transparency International and rights groups like the Hungarian Helsinki Committee and the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union.The Open Society Foundations is bigger than you think. In fact, it may be the largest philanthropic organization ever built, with branches in 37 countries. While the Gates Foundation spends more money, OSF has a larger footprint worldwide thanks to its many local offices, including throughout Africa. OSF s budget will be around $930 million this year which is substantially more than Ford s total grantmaking.That budget is set annually by George Soros, who s given away nearly $12 billion since he got into philanthropy decades ago. Nevertheless, thanks to his skills in financial markets, Soros who recently turned 85 is now richer than ever, with a net worth estimated at $26 billion. The bulk of that fortune is slated to go one day to OSF, creating a massively endowed foundation that, in recent years, has been redesigned to exist in perpetuity.Watch this video that explains a leaked memo from George Soros s Open Society Foundation, outlining a proposed strategy for successfully influencing immigration policy:In 2014, Orban ordered a crackdown on civic groups supported in part by Norway, but extensive investigations and audits did not uncover any financial irregularities of note.In an email to The Associated Press, a Soros representative said they were  proud to support Hungarians who insist on having a voice in their democracy. Orban also claimed that Soros  organizations were still working on bringing hundreds of thousands of migrants into Europe, contrary to the wishes of Hungarians and their government. Orban has been outspoken about his strong opposition to taking in refugees and migrants, and in 2015 ordered fences built on Hungary s southern borders with Serbia and Croatia to stop the migrant flow.On Friday, he reiterated a government plan to keep migrants in border camps built from shipping containers while their asylum applications are being processed.Orban also painted a bleak picture of Western Europe, saying its  future is casting a long and dark shadow on its present. He joked that Hungary was ready to take in Western Europeans, whom he said are suffering from globalization s effects. Naturally, we will take in the real refugees,  Orban said to laughter and loud applause.

11664,BREAKING: GEN MICHAEL FLYNN RESIGNS After Close Friend Steve Bannon Reportedly Offered These 4 Words Of Advice,"Michael Flynn resigned as President Donald Trump s national security adviser Monday night, amid a growing scandal over his contacts with Russian officials.The White House announced the resignation after days of uncertainty about Flynn s fate after reports that he d obfuscated the details of his conversations with Russian officials to Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials.Trump administration officials, including chief White House counsel Don McGahn, were briefed last month on Flynn s apparent misstatements about his discussions with the Russians. Yates was dismissed a few days later   after refusing to enforce Trump s travel ban executive order   but a source familiar with the situation said her briefing on Flynn did not appear to play a role in her firing.The Washington Post was the first to report the briefing Monday. The White House announced Flynn s resignation shortly afterward. In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude,  Flynn wrote in his resignation letter. I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,  Flynn added.Keith Kellogg, the National Security Council chief of staff, will step in as the acting national security adviser and head of the National Security Council. Retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who has known Kellogg for decades, said early Tuesday that he is a  good man  who was among the earliest Trump loyalists.Flynn, long a controversial figure in the national security establishment, was widely disliked by Trump s more establishment aides, who said he fueled Trump s conspiracy theories and distrust of the intelligence community. But he had maintained Trump s support, as the president believed he was loyal and had insight into military affairs. He was also particularly close to Stephen Bannon, the president s top strategist and a philosophical and strategic adviser with a vast sway on the presidency.Over the weekend, Bannon pulled Flynn aside for a conversation, according to a White House official. Gannon, who had supported Flynn amid turmoil, told him he should  do the right thing  and resign, this official said.The White House has already begun canvassing for Flynn s permanent replacement. Retired Gen. David Petraeus is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the plans.Petraeus was briefly considered for secretary of state during the transition but was passed over in part because of his 2015 conviction for mishandling classified information.Trump has long admired Petraeus and sought his counsel.  Trump likes him, he respects him,  said a person close to Trump.Petraeus did not respond to an email seeking comment.For entire story  Politico",0

In 1996, she came to California. She is an active member of the Council of Pakistan-American Affairs (COPAA), the author of  Mommy am I a ?  and a contributor to the largest Pakistani paper in the U.S., The Pakistan Link.Ali is the founder and board member of the American Muslim Women s Empowerment Council, which is the only Muslim women s organization that works on the ground with law enforcement and interfaith leaders to counter radicalization and build capacity in the Muslim community do they can be the first line of defense against radicalization.She graciously agreed to speak with Clarion Project Dialogue Coordinator Elliot Friedland about being a Muslim-American since the election. The views expressed herein are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of Clarion Project. Ryan Mauro previously interviewed Anila Ali for Clarion Project.1. Clarion Project: Since Trump s election many Muslim groups are feeling scared that he will implement repressive policies targeted at the Muslim community. How do you feel about such fears?Anila Ali: There is a real fear in the community that a Trump presidency will mean restrictions on Muslims. There is talk of internment camps and it was in registry and that is generating a lot of misconceptions and fears. There is also a concern that Mosques and citizens will be monitored as well.Personally, I have faith in the constitution of the United States of America and I feel majority of America knows and understands that you cannot make generalized statements about all Muslims and paint all Muslims with the same brush stroke.But we have also realize that it is time that Muslims in America step up their game and get more involved in making sure that the neighbors understand who they are and that they are peace-loving patriotic Americans.For it is mostly the fear of the unknown that spreads misconceptions.2. Clarion: What should public figures be doing to calm inter-communal relations?Ali: Public figures, especially the ones in the majority party, have a responsibility to represent all Americans. Their words can help alleviate fears about Muslims and stop the Muslims from getting marginalized. Show of support unity with all unities that maybe feeling slightly marginalized, will help them from further isolation.The level of hateful rhetoric that I have heard in the past one month has been the worst since 911. It seems people have a newfound courage to tell  Muslims to leave the country,   pack up and leave the country  etc. Anti-Muslim sentiment is rampant and most people are not able to distinguish between a radical and a moderate.There is a general perception that all Muslims condone violence and that all Muslims want sharia law in America. There is also a very toxic perception that Muslims like myself who are any patriotic, modern and progressive are lying as mandated in the Quran to convert people, the concept being taqqiya. This notion must be dispelled because the majority of Muslims don t even know what this concept is. Muslims who have come from South Asia have no idea of this Arabic concept because it is part of the Wahhabi Salafist ideology and Muslims like me, majority coming from South Asia, have never even heard of it.These misconceptions in the mainstream community must be countered and dispelled.3. Clarion: What do you think the impact of designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would be if it passed?Ali: If Arab countries can ban Muslim brotherhood why can t we? Any organization that has terrorist ties should be banned in the US. Any organization that condone the killing of an innocent, or promote so insights hatred for non-Muslims should be banned.4. Clarion: What organizations or activists would you recommend as standing up for the rights of the community and are unaffiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood or related organizations?Ali: Of course I would promote my own organization American Muslim women s empowerment Council, formed to counter extremism which gives women a voice, promotes the real Islam, gives women equality and completely condemns all shapes and forms of terrorism and hatred.Whoever wants to follow sharia law should migrate to a Muslim country like Saudi Arabia.For entire interview, go to the Clarion Project",0

11668,"FEDS, CA STATE OFFICIALS IGNORED OROVILLE DAM WARNINGS…While Obama, CA Gov Brown Obsessed Over Spending $15 BILLION To Dig Two Controversial Tunnels","No less to blame are the water agencies, including the powerful Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which argued that paying for the upgrades a decade ago was unnecessary.The 180,000 people forced to evacuate Sunday, running for their lives, beg to differ.Can Californians trust the decision-makers who control state water policy? We would not suggest it.California s population of 38.8 million people relies on a 60-year-old water delivery system consisting largely of aging dams and aqueducts that have not been maintained adequately and now are unreliable.Gov. Jerry Brown s obsession with spending $15 billion to dig two Delta tunnels is preventing the state from spending that money to upgrade the Delta levees, the sinking California Aqueduct and doing basic maintenance to the state s dams.  Mercury NewsTwo weeks before President Barack Obama left office, his administration vowed to move full speed ahead on California s controversial Delta tunnels project, calling it essential for the state s water supply as well as its environment.Rejecting the call by fishermen, Tribes, conservationists, family farmers and environmental justice advocates to terminate the Delta Tunnels plan, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell on January 4 issued a Secretarial Order that will mandate the completion of Governor Jerry Brown s controversial California WaterFix process  in a timely manner. The Obama administration order directs the Department of Interior and its agencies to  take timely actions to help address the effects of drought and climate change on California s water supply and imperiled wildlife. What are the Delta water tunnels?They re two, 30-mile water tunnels that would be built in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, east of the San Francisco Bay Area. Each tunnel would be 40 feet in diameter, larger than the tunnels that carry BART trains under San Francisco Bay. The project, dubbed  California WaterFix,  would be buried 150 feet below ground.What s the California Delta, again?It s a huge, inland estuary where Northern California s major rivers converge before the water flows out to San Francisco Bay. It used to be mostly wetlands and marshes, but much of the land was converted to farming.Who would get water from the tunnels?The tunnels would be part of the state s major water system that serves about 25 million Californians, from the Bay Area to San Diego. Built more than 50 years ago, the network of reservoirs, canals and aqueducts stretches hundreds of miles.It s designed to fix a tricky problem that state planners ran into a century ago. Most of the rain and snow falls in Northern California, but most of the state s population (and many farms) reside in Central and Southern California.Proposed Route of Delta Water TunnelsHuge underground project would divert water from the Sacramento River for export to Central and Southern California.Why Does the Brown Administration want to build them?The recent drought may have brought water battles to the forefront, but those battles are a perennial feature of California politics. That s because the central hub of this water system, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, is in bad shape.Water is drawn from the Delta by two massive pumping facilities that can move millions of gallon per minute. They re so powerful that they ve been shown to entrap endangered fish, like Chinook salmon and Delta smelt. When those species are at greatest risk, regulations require slowing down the pumps, potentially limiting how much water reaches cities and farms.The twin tunnels would take water from farther north near the Sacramento River, and deliver it to the pumping facilities. State officials say that would make the water system more reliable, because the pumps would be used less, avoiding the impacts on endangered species.How much would the tunnels cost and who would pay for them?They aren t cheap. Construction could cost $14.9 billion. Add in mitigation costs for construction impacts, operations and maintenance and the tab runs to about $17 billion over 50 years   and that doesn t count paying off the bonds that would finance the project. -KQED SciencePresident Donald Trump wants to invest $550 billion on the nation s infrastructure needs. Brown agrees that California should jump on the opportunity, but the money has to be used wisely. Neglect of the Oroville Dam, despite multiple alarms sounding over the years, does not inspire confidence.The Bay Area News Group s Paul Rogers reported Monday that three environmental groups   the Friends of the River, the Sierra Club and the South Yuba River Citizens League   filed a motion with the federal government on Oct. 17, 2005, as part of Oroville Dam s relicensing process, urging federal officials to require that the dam s emergency spillway be armored with concrete rather than remain as just a hillside.If we get through this winter without loss of lives and many more billions of dollars in property loss expected from the failure of the Oroville spillway, then we can take this as a fortuitous warning to prevent other disasters. But that s still a big  if.  Storm clouds return Thursday. Mercury News",0

11671,BRAVO! GAY LEGAL IMMIGRANT Designer Made PRO-TRUMP Dress Worn By BLACK Grammy Attendee Joy Villa…Says He’s “Example Of American Dream”…Standing Up For Constitution [VIDEO]," It s more so about love,  he said of the red, white and blue gown.  We all live on this planet. I ve never been in the political area. However, it s just so crazy that people are getting beat up because they voted for Trump, or this and that, someone wants to bomb the White House .I am an American, I moved here from the Philippines and I highly believed in the trueness of what this country can bring. It s about bringing people together, that s the message. Soriano skirted questions regarding the meat of his political beliefs, but said he is proud American and believes that he is an example of the American Dream. He was first discovered on Rihanna s Bravo reality show, Styled to Rock, and launched his label in San Diego in 2013, selling ready-to-wear and red carpet looks online only. He is a naturalized citizen. There are a lot of people that are in power that really misconstrued what this country stands for,  he said.  I love this country. I m from the Philippine islands, I am a proud American. I really love this country. I am a minority, Joy is black. America is about immigrants.

11673,Brigitte Gabriel Reveals Muslim Brotherhood “Plan For The Destruction Of The United States”…Left Goes Nuts Over Possibility Of Trump Declaring Them A “Terror Group” [VIDEO],"Brigitte Gabriel is a Christian who, after being terrorized by Muslim extremists in her homeland of Lebanon, fled to the US with her family. Gabriel, the president and founder of ACT for America, travels around the nation delivering a message to everyday Americans about the radical infiltration of Muslim extremists in America. She explains in easy to understand terms how the Muslim Brotherhood has one goal: to sabotage America from within, and to make Islam the dominant religion of the country.Watch Brigitte Gabriel explain the Muslim Brotherhood s plan for the destruction of the United States: The most important page of this document is the last page. Because in the last past, they list 29 Islamic organizations set up  in the United States with the specific goal of sabotaging America from within, and destroying America by our own hands. The MSA is listed as one of the Islam organizations whose goal it is to destroy America. The MSA, or Muslim Student Association has more chapters on American  college campuses than the Republican and Democrat Party combined. Watch here:The tolerance for the funding of terror groups by Americans is about to come to end under President Donald J. Trump. One of the first actions he may take is to designate what many experts have been calling a terror group for years. The Trump administration could soon declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, a move that would greatly restrict the controversial group s global reach and would come despite its insistence that it has peaceful intentions.Trump himself was often critical of President Obama s outreach to the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed a bill to call for declaring the Brotherhood a terror organization. In the past, it has been accused of supporting terrorist groups around the world, and several countries, including Muslim nations, have banned them.If the U.S. declares the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, it would make it a criminal act for Americans to fund the group, ban banks from processing money for it, bar people with ties to the group from coming to the United States and make it easier to deport immigrants who have worked with the organization. It is time to call this enemy by its name and speak with clarity and moral authority,  Cruz said in a statement introducing the bill. Watch Brigitte Gabriel destroy this Imam on Judge Jeanine s FOX News show: FOX NewsThe Left doesn t think Trump should designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and here s why:The New York Times editorial board thinks President Trump shouldn t designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization because it could make Trump the enemy of all Muslims.The liberal paper published Thursday an editorial Thursday titled  All of Islam Isn t the Enemy  arguing against the move, which the Trump administration is reportedly considering as a possible option. CIA Director Mike Pompeo has said he supports designating the group, which is open about its goal of creating a state ruled by Islamic law, as a terrorist organization. Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world? That could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim nations with an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood   perhaps the most influential Islamist group in the Middle East   as a terrorist organization,  the editors charged.

11675,HOW HILLARY Reminded Us Last Week That We’re So Lucky She Wasn’t Elected,"Clinton sent out a taunting tweet of  3-0  after the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously slapped a halt on Trump s executive order on immigrants and  refugees.Trump tweeted out  SEE YOU IN COURT Hillary responded with a snarky  3-0 Her support for the ruling isn t surprising   Clinton said she was for open borders at one point   but the gutter sniping was telling. The activist judges who based their ruling on their liberal politics instead of the Constitution are the same kind she would appoint to the Supreme Court and all other federal courts if she were in the Oval Office.Thankfully, she won t get the chance, a fact reinforced by Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. She fired back at Clinton with her version of  3-0,  tweeting  PA, WI, MI,  a reference to three formerly blue states, worth 46 electoral votes, that Trump flipped to his column. Touch !And so it went in Week 3 of the Trump era, with Clinton s taunt, the court ruling, nonstop demonstrations and congressional hijinks combining to illustrate why Trump s election was crucial. It was a necessary course correction and a dramatic rejection of an arrogant government that both overreaches and underperforms.Put another way, the hysterical, hateful reaction in many quarters to everything Trump says and does is absolute proof that the ruling elite deserved a comeuppance. The establishment was drunk on power, political and cultural, and never yielded an inch voluntarily or had the decency to admit error. Its rage reflects its sense of entitlement. This unhinged rage is the new America   only it s not new. It was hiding in plain sight, hinted at by the contempt that Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, tenured radicals, college snowflakes and the Democratic media openly held for those who don t share their worldview.Trump s victory ripped open the vein, but it would have erupted at any Republican president. Modern liberals  contempt for others is essential to their sense of superiority and justifies violence in the streets, threats and simple rudeness Read more: NYP",0
11676,WOW! UNDERCOVER VIDEO Proves Trump Was Right About Voter Fraud In New Hampshire [WATCH],"On Thursday, New Hampshire s Federal Elections Commission (FEC) called on President Trump to give proof of voter fraud, after he reportedly made further claims in a meeting with senators.Trump reportedly blamed voter fraud for why both he and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) lost in New Hampshire last November during a recent meeting with a bipartisan group of senators. The scheme the President of the United States alleges would constitute thousands of felony criminal offenses under New Hampshire law,  Commissioner Ellen Weintraub said in a statement Friday. The President has issued an extraordinarily serious and specific charge,  added Weintraub, who is a Democrat but was appointed by former President George W. Bush in 2002.  Allegations of this magnitude cannot be ignored. I therefore call upon President Trump to immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly.   The HillDemocrat sycophant George Stephanopoulos went after Trump s senior policy advisor Steven Miller on ABC s  This Week  show, DEMANDING he show evidence of voter fraud in New Hampshire as Trump claimed only days earlier. This is the media s newest Trump  witch hunt.  Given the willingness of both parties and the media to ignore massive voter fraud issues across America, one has to wonder if Trump continues to poke this fire on purpose, forcing the serious issue of voter to be addressed and eventually fixed. Careful what you ask for Georgie you just may get it, and it s not likely going to benefit your party THIS IS AWESOME!

11677,“OPEN MINDED” LIBERALS Ban Trump-Supporting Apartment Hunters,"In case you missed it Senator Marco Rubio gave a great speech about political tolerance in the Senate that rings true here. How can we solve anything if we can t debate about it? What can we accomplish if half of the nation hates the other half? Open-minded  liberals in Washington, D.C., are barring Trump supporters from applying to rent apartments online.Since the presidential election numerous listings have appeared on Craigslist, Reddit, and other sites written by woke vegetarian liberals, who are open to renters of any gender identity, but write-off anyone with opposing political beliefs. Alcohol, pets and meat products are not allowed in the house,  said one liberal woman seeking a roommate near Georgetown, quoted in the New York Times.  Neither are Trump supporters. Roommates Wanted. Trump Supporters Need Not Apply,  the Times reports, arguing that anti-Trump rental policies are legal despite political affiliation being a protected trait under D.C. law.The Times says anti-Trump housing listings are a  small act of defiance in an area that heavily favored Hillary Clinton.  Only 4 percent of D.C. voters cast their ballots for Donald Trump.Liberals say they are open to any  gender identity  or  non-identity with the exception of identifying as conservative. [T]wo women in their 20s were searching for a roommate to take over a lavender-colored room in their Columbia Heights apartment for $550,  the Times reported.  The women detailed their love of happy hours, a  good Netflix sesh,  pho and tacos. We re open to any age/gender identity/non-identity,  the liberal women said.  So long as you didn t vote for Trump. Another self-described  open-minded  liberal couple said they could not accept a Trump supporter to fill an open room in their house.Read more: WFB",0
11678,#BoycottGrammys… #TurnOffTheGrammys…Grammys Producer Encourages Stars To Get Political…TRASH TRUMP…Just Don’t Use “F-Bomb” Before 10 PM,"In a fraught moment of political protest across the country, the live mic at televised award shows has become a potent weapon.As such, Grammy Awards producer Ken Ehrlich has a message for those who will take the stage on Sunday s ceremony: Bring it on.Ehrlich has no reservations about political messages or anti-President Trump statements flying during CBS  three and a half hour Grammycast. Artists expressing passionate opinions about real-life issues are the stuff of memorable moments, he said. One of the tenets of our show is artistic freedom, and over the years we ve shown we do believe in it,  Ehrlich told Variety.  How many more times do we need to hear  I d like to thank my publicist, my agent, my wife and kids.  The great acceptance speeches are ones that have a point of view and are more personal. The only guidelines on speech that Ehrlich has to keep an eye (and ear) on is profanity, given the potential for CBS to be hit with FCC fines if F-bombs fly before 10 p.m. But almost everything else is fair game. One of the things I ve learned from working with artists for 40 years is that they are deep-thinking, vital individuals who have interests that cover a broad cover a broad spectrum of subjects and passions,  he said.  We should certainly allow for it on the broadcast. Ehrlich notes that the Grammy Awards as an institution has addressed issues of social justice and equality on the telecast in recent years.  NYP",0

11680,TREASON! HOW OBAMA’S SHADOW GOVERNMENT Is Commanding An Army Of Anti-Trump Agitators To Sabotage President Trump #WAR [VIDEO],"PAUL SPERRY SPOKE WITH LOU DOBBS ON HIS REPORT ABOUT OBAMA S SHADOW GOVERNMENT:Obama has two things going for him: The judiciary is his lethal weapon. He stacked the courts during his 8 years with liberal judges who can make things really difficult for President Trump. We ve seen it in action with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Trump s Executive Order. President Trump should shake this court up ASAP! Yes, he can do it and he should! NEWT: JEFFERSON WOULD ABOLISH THE 9TH CIRCUIT COURT:The second thing that s troubling is the  shadow government  that Obama is setting up just blocks away from the White House. He s not going to let his  legacy  go down without a fight. He ll use the power of the evil doers like George Soros to pay for an army of destructive anarchists:PAUL SPERRY OF THE NYP: When former President Barack Obama said he was  heartened  by anti-Trump protests, he was sending a message of approval to his troops. Troops? Yes, Obama has an army of agitators   numbering more than 30,000   who will fight his Republican successor at every turn of his historic presidency. And Obama will command them from a bunker less than two miles from the White House.In what s shaping up to be a highly unusual post-presidency, Obama isn t just staying behind in Washington. He s working behind the scenes to set up what will effectively be a shadow government to not only protect his threatened legacy, but to sabotage the incoming administration and its popular  America First  agenda.He s doing it through a network of leftist nonprofits led by Organizing for Action. Normally you d expect an organization set up to support a politician and his agenda to close up shop after that candidate leaves office, but not Obama s OFA. Rather, it s gearing up for battle, with a growing war chest and more than 250 offices across the country.Since Donald Trump s election, this little-known but well-funded protesting arm has beefed up staff and ramped up recruitment of young liberal activists, declaring on its website,  We re not backing down.  Determined to salvage Obama s legacy, it s drawing battle lines on immigration, ObamaCare, race relations and climate change.Obama is intimately involved in OFA operations and even tweets from the group s account. In fact, he gave marching orders to OFA foot soldiers following Trump s upset victory. It is fine for everybody to feel stressed, sad, discouraged,  he said in a conference call from the White House.  But get over it.  He demanded they  move forward to protect what we ve accomplished. Now is the time for some organizing,  he said.  So don t mope. Far from sulking, OFA activists helped organize anti-Trump marches across US cities, some of which turned into riots. After Trump issued a temporary ban on immigration from seven terror-prone Muslim nations, the demonstrators jammed airports, chanting:  No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all! Run by old Obama aides and campaign workers, federal tax records show  nonpartisan  OFA marshals 32,525 volunteers nationwide. Registered as a 501(c)(4), it doesn t have to disclose its donors, but they ve been generous. OFA has raised more than $40 million in contributions and grants since evolving from Obama s campaign organization Obama for America in 2013.OFA, in IRS filings, says it trains young activists to develop  organizing skills.  Armed with Obama s 2012 campaign database, OFA plans to get out the vote for Democratic candidates it s grooming to win back Congress and erect a wall of resistance to Trump at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.It will be aided in that effort by the Obama Foundation, run by Obama s former political director, and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, launched last month by Obama pal Eric Holder to end what he and Obama call GOP  gerrymandering  of congressional districts.Obama will be overseeing it all from a shadow White House located within two miles of Trump.DON T LET THE LEFT BE THE DEATH OF AMERICA!

11682,"YALE REMOVES Name Of DEMOCRAT White Supremacist, Passionate Supporter Of Slavery From Res College…Why Not Rename It After Most Famous Black Alum, Justice Clarence Thomas?","University trustees, known as the Yale Corporation, voted in favor of the renaming on Friday, reversing a decision last year to keep the name. Keeping the name had been defended as a way to confront rather than paper over the legacy of slavery.The change will go into effect in time for the 2017-2018 academic year. John C. Calhoun s legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a  positive good  fundamentally conflicts with Yale s mission and values,  President Peter Salovey said in a message sent to the Yale community on Saturday. He said depictions in the college celebrating plantations and the Old South suggest that Calhoun was honored in part because of his support for slavery, not in spite of it.Yale is among a number of colleges that have grappled with how to honor their histories without offending modern sensibilities. Vanderbilt University last year said it would pay $1.2 million to remove the word  Confederate  from a residence hall s facade, while Princeton University said it would keep Woodrow Wilson s name on its school of public and international affairs and a residential college, while increasing discussion of the former president s support of segregation. WSJIf Yale is so concerned about promoting diversity and working to erase any signs of slavery, why not rename the Calhoun College with their most famous black alumni, US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas? The tradition at Yale has been to name colleges after prominent, deceased, alumni, and ones that have contributed somehow to the human race. Morse College, for instance, is named after Samuel Morse, of the eponymous Morse Code.Yale will feel immense pressure to rename Calhoun for a minority figure, but who? Of Yale s deceased minority alumni, no one leaps to mind. Someone suggested Levi Jackson, which I thought was a nice idea, but Jackson isn t well known outside Yale circles, and I doubt any of today s students have any idea who he is.It seems likely Yale might jettison the  being dead  requirement. If that turns out to be the case, how about Clarence Thomas? He is easily Yale s most prominent black alum, even if he wasn t an undergrad.I am joking of course. While I would be proud if this came about, the left would sooner burn Calhoun to the ground than let it be named for a black conservative, only going to show that this isn t about race, it s about power and politics.One other thought: Elihu Yale was apparently a slave trader, among other things. How soon before the activists set there sights on renaming the entire university?  The Naked Dollar",0

11687,PRINCIPAL OF WEALTHY NYC SCHOOL Sends Hate-Filled Email To Parents: Trump Is Worse Than 9-11,"The principal of a fancy New York City private school says the election of President Trump is worse than the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Steve Nelson, principal of the Calhoun School, fired off a hate-filled email to parents blasting the president. He also said Trump s election would be more devastating than Vietnam, Watergate and the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. I walked the complex inner-city streets of Cleveland during the racial unrest of the 60 s,  he wrote in an email obtained by the New York Post.  I was in rural Georgia when Martin Luther King Junior was assassinated in Tennessee. I watched every moment of the Watergate hearings that led to the resignation of Richard M. Nixon. I watched soot-covered New Yorkers grimly trudging north on West End Avenue on September 11, 2001. I am more troubled now. The principal would have us believe that he was more disturbed by Trump s election than the sight of New Yorkers falling from the sky or the Twin Towers collapsing onto the streets of lower Manhattan.Just to put this in perspective, the principal believes President Trump is worse than the Muslim hijackers who flew jetliners into buildings and slaughtered thousands of Americans.I do not know Principal Nelson, but he sounds like a deeply disturbed educator who should not be around impressionable school children.I m rather surprised the principal did not blame Trump for sinking the Titanic or causing the Black Plague.As repulsive as his comments might have been, I believe the principal s beliefs are rather mainstream among liberals.- Todd Starnes, FOX NewsThe controversial missive roiled some parents of the elite Upper West Side school, who thought Calhoun went too far.But some members of the school community said they had the principal s back. Proud to work at Calhoun and for someone like Steve Nelson,  school staffer Nahuel Fanjul-Arguijo in a Facebook post. Getting this email yesterday made me a very proud Calhoun alumni,  posted Rachel Geisler.   NYDNSo let s set the record straight.President Trump has never waged jihad against Americans   nor has he assassinated a Civil Rights leader or napalmed a jungle in Vietnam.And to compare those horrific atrocities with the president s desire to make our nation great again is not just offensive   it s downright evil.  FNPeople like Steve Nelson, principal of the Calhoun School in NYC, who have so much hate in their hearts have no business anywhere near young and impressionable children. It really doesn t matter what your political leanings are. If a person tasked with educating children has so little control over their seething anger after their candidate loses an election that they feel it necessary to drag the parents into their world of pity and hate, why should any parent who have any faith in their mental capacity? Why would any parent, regardless of their political persuasion, entrust this clearly unhinged man with the safety and well-being of their most precious possessions? To have lived in  New York City and witnessed the horrific tragedy of 9-11 firsthand should make his email all the more serious for these parents ",0

Last month he also made a change to the Obama administration s policy of prioritizing deportation for convicted criminals, substantially broadening the scope of who the Department of Homeland Security can target, to include those with only minor offenses or those with no convictions at all.Immigration officials confirmed that agents this week raided homes and workplaces in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, the Los Angeles area, North Carolina and South Carolina, netting hundreds of people.

11693,WOW! 3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel…One Has Criminal Background…May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO],"3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! I hear what you re saying, I mean, these intelligence committees handle our terror strategies right? They got in on Benghazi by the way.Yes, and they also worked for many Democrats in the House. They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails. Derrick Robinson, spokesman for California Rep. Karen Bass, refused to comment on Alvi s employment status.For entire story: Daily Caller ",0
11694,LEFTIST LEGAL EXPERT DERSHOWITZ Calls Out 9th Circuit For Playing Politics: ‘Not a solid decision’ [Video],"Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz was on MSNBC to make a statement on the 9th Circuit Opinion: He stated that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  ruling against President Trump s immigration order is  not a solid decision.  And  looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. Look, this is not a solid decision. This is a decision that looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. There are many, many flaws. He added,  I think this court opinion will not ultimately be sustained by the Supreme Court. Take, for example, the argument that it s an establishment of religion, because it favors Christians or other religious minorities. In 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which specifically was designed to rescue a hundred thousand Jews, and everybody knew the purpose was to rescue jews. That didn t establish Judaism as the state religion of the United States. I think the establishment argument will fail in the Supreme Court. I think the standing arguments may fail in the Supreme Court.  ",0

There s just one problem.

11697,BREAKING: TRUMP Announces “Phenomenal” Tax Cut Plan For Businesses In Next 2-3 Weeks…Stock Markets Respond [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump said his administration would be announcing a  big league  tax cut that would lower the burden on businesses within the next two or three weeks.The revelation saw the Dow Jones industrial average rise around 115 points to a record, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. Lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league, that s coming along very well,  Trump said at the top of a White House meeting with airline industry executives Thursday.  We re way ahead of schedule, I believe. And we re going to be announcing something   I would say over the next two or three weeks   that will be phenomenal. The president s comment had an immediate effect on the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.The administration had gotten pushback a day earlier from conservative web site proprietor Matt Drudge, an influential media figure who Trump regularly lauded during the campaign. Republican party should be sued for fraud. NO discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys!  Drudge tweeted, on a day filled with fallout from the Senate effort to silence liberal Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.Tax reform has also been a top priority for House Speaker Paul Ryan and others in the GOP congressional majority, which has been anxious to slash taxes and regulations now that it finally has an ally in the White House.Trump has pledged to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent, but he offered no details on what his proposal might be. The value of the dollar against the Japanese yen jumped by 1 percentage point after the president s comments, Reuters reported. Airline stocks also spiked after the meeting.

The ruling increases the likelihood that the administration will ask the Supreme Court to step into a case that s the biggest test of Trump s executive power yet .The public  has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination,  a three-judge panel said in a unanimous 29-page ruling.A VICTORY FOR TECH COMPANIES WANTING CHEAP LABOR:The panel s ruling in favor of immigrants is a victory not only for Washington and Minnesota   the states that sued   but for Facebook Inc., Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which said in court papers that the measure would hinder their global businesses.Read more: Bloomberg Business",0
11699,LIKE VICTIMS OF SPOUSAL ABUSE…Middle Eastern Christians Fear Harsher Treatment By Muslims If U.S. Makes Rescuing Them A Priority: “Don’t Help Us Or We’ll Get Beaten Again”,"So I m concerned about what I m hearing from some of the priests representing Iraqi Christians in Iraq. Patriarch Louis Sako of Baghdad said:  Every reception policy that discriminates (between) the persecuted and suffering on religious grounds ultimately harms the Christians of the East He went on to explain that prioritizing Christians is not good because it invites harsher treatment from Muslims, increasing tensions and accusations that Christians communities are  foreign bodies  supported and defended by Western powers.  The Chaldean Bishop of Aleppo, Antoine Audo SJ, said  speeches  or  measures and laws  that seem to privilege Christians  feeds fanaticism and extremism. Archbishop Bashar Warda of Erbil, on the other hand, although more positive about the development, said that the media puts Christians in Iraq  at greater risk  when they  cry out that this is a  Muslim Ban.  He wrote in an interview:  Here in Iraq we Christians cannot afford to throw out words carelessly as the media in the West can do. I would ask those in the media who use every issue to stir up division to think about this. For the media these things become an issue of ratings, but for us the danger is real. Don t Help Us Or We ll Get Beaten AgainIt s true that part of what s going on, especially from Sako and Audo, is that these religious leaders don t want their flocks to flee. I can understand the desire to stay.  As Christians,  Audo said,  we ask to be helped not to emigrate, but to have peace in our Countries, in order to continue our life and our witness in the land where we were born. Contrast those responses with that of Anglican Canon Andrew White, better known as the Vicar of Baghdad. When his parishioners in Baghdad were getting killed, he responded with,  I just say,  I will stay, I will not leave you,  but I can t advise them to stay. The liquidation of Christianity from the Middle East is heartbreaking. But what is going on here with these representatives of Iraqi Christians is more than just the desire to stay in their homeland. Christians in Iraq and their leaders sound like abuse victims.I don t want to paint with a broad brush. There are many Iraqi Christians who desperately want to leave Iraq and are grateful for whatever help they can get. I believe Warda is the most balanced of all the leaders. His interview with Crux magazine is required reading for anyone desiring candid answers about Christians  situation in Iraq.Warda is an anomaly. Most church leaders, it seems to me, sound just like spousal abuse victims:  Please don t help me, he ll get mad and beat me up again.  It s the same type of victim mentality:  Don t help us,  these Christian leaders say,  because they ll increase our persecution. Asking for Decent Treatment Is Asking For ItThis  battered woman syndrome  in Middle Eastern Christians runs deep. This mental conditioning has been a plague on Middle Eastern Christians for a long time. In her book  Christianity in Iraq,  Suha Rassam recounts Muslim-Christian relations in the years when Iraq moved from British rule toward independence, under the monarchy a military coup toppled in 1958. The constitution that the British helped Iraq draft gave full and equal citizenship rights to all minorities. But this type of thinking is foreign to Middle Eastern Christians  minds, given their history of being terrorized by the Muslims they live under. Standing up for representation is a sure way to get cut down. When Iraq s old constitution was being drafted, the memories of the last decades of the Ottoman rule were still alive, and as Rassam writes,  the massacres of these communities [Armenians, Syrian Orthodox, Syrian Catholics, etc.] were partly attributed to Western European policies. And the failure of the Europeans to stand by their promises to them. One of the Iraqi newspapers warned:  Do not forget the fate of the Armenians and the Assyrians who put their trust in Christian powers and were practically exterminated in the process. When Helping HurtsIt s true that Western intervention helped the Christian communities at times. But Rassam says much of it led to greater tragedy for Christians, complicating the relationship between Muslims and Christians. She writes:  The Christians were seen [by the Muslims] as collaborators with the Europeans and identified with their policies. What Americans and most people in the West don t realize is that not only do these Christian have hundreds of years of oppressed mentality to overcome, but that the Muslims, just like wife-beaters, increase their wrathful acts upon their victims when they seek help. The increase in violence is usually triggered by a move of any Western power to help the Christians.But the answer cannot be for America or the West to do nothing. That s what the Obama administration did, and the persecution did not stop. The answer, as difficult as it is for Americans to accept, is exactly what President Trump is trying to do: give priority to the Christians who want a chance to flee the violence.Surely the wholesale removal of Christians from the Middle East is a tragedy of historic significance, but the removal of Middle Eastern Christians from the world altogether would be far worse.For entire story: The Federalist",0

11701,"TJ MAXX AND MARSHALLS Tell Employees To Trash Signs For Ivanka Trump Line, Mix Line With General Merchandise"," According to the New York Times, outlet stores T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed their employees to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump s clothing line, and hang her clothes so that they mix in with other lines.The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise,  not to remove it from the sales floor,  said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers  parent corporation. We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,  she said.The company did not respond to the New York Times query as to whether or not this kind of handling of product was normal, but one employee came forward and told the paper that after several years of being employed with the stores, she had not been instructed to do this before. -The BlazeTJ Maxx and Marshalls corporate headquarters are located in the very liberal city of Farmington, MA.In the 2016 general election, 75 percent of the 39,722 registered voters in Farmington participated in the presidential election.Of those voters, 20,277 voted for Clinton, with 7,031 for Trump. So it should come as no surprise that the people making the decisions on behalf of the stores would send such an outrageous message to their employees that appears to be intended to harm Ivanka Trump s clothing line. For many shoppers like myself, these new developments as they relate to the trashing of Ivanka Trump s clothing and accessory brand really puts a crimp in my shopping patterns at some of my favorite stores, which include Norstrom and TJ Maxx and the TJ Maxx owned Home Goods store. Gone are the days when these kinds of corporate decisions are made and kept under the radar. Trump has an army of exceptionally loyal supporters who are willing to defend him and his lovely family, even if it means we have to do our shopping elsewhere.In a USA Today article, TJ Maxx CEO Ernie Herrman noted,  We are extremely pleased that our comp store sales growth was almost entirely driven by customer traffic.  Your companies recent decision to trash Ivanka Trump s brand in your store may change that Mr. Herrman Here s a letter to TJMaxx CEO from a leftist in VT that was published in the local Mountain Times newspaper. Editors note: the following is an open letter to Ernie Herrman, CEO and president of TJMaxxDear Mr. Herrman,I am writing to tell you that I have stopped shopping in TJMaxx stores since the election in November of 2016. That is when I became aware that you carry Ivanka accessories. I m sure that you have not missed my 100 or so dollars a month that I would usually spend at your store. But I have missed shopping with you. This is probably hurting me more than it is you. But the real hurt is what is being delivered to our nation by Trump.Let me be very clear: The objective of boycotting is not to destroy your business or to cause job losses. The objective is to send a direct message to you, the CEO, to your Board of Directors, and your stockholders that your merchandising choice regarding Ivanka brand goods needs to change.I know that public pressure and consumer spending has a big effect on markets and policy. Just this week, the CEO of Uber resigned from Trump s Economic Advisory Council. Uber profited from continuing service at JFK airport last weekend when all the NYC cabs boycotted the airport in a show of support for the protesters. Consequently, 200,000 customers deleted their Uber accounts. The CEO decided it wasn t economically advantageous to be aligned with the Trump administration.Recently, the retailers: Shoes.com, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom s all cancelled their Ivanka fashion and jewellery line because of public outcry and customer boycotts of their stores.In a consumer based economy, our money has power. So I am asking you to cancel your merchandising of Ivanka accessories. Please let me know as soon as possible when you have done this, so that I can resume shopping at my favorite TJMaxx store.In the meantime, I am going to donate the $100.00 I would have spent at your establishment this month to the ACLU, so that green card holders, immigrants and refugees seeking to enter the US can have some legal representation.Sincerely and respectfully, Your Once Loyal Customer,Candy Jones, Rutland ",0

11706,WOW! NEW YORK TIMES ADMITS They “Cooked The Numbers” To Keep SOLD OUT Book About SHOCKING Story Media Hid From Public Off Bestseller List,"In 2013 Dr Kermit Gosnell was convicted of killing four people, including three babies, but is thought to have killed hundreds, perhaps thousands more in a 30-year killing spree.Gosnell is currently serving three life sentences (without the possibility of parole) for murdering babies and patients at his  House of Horrors  abortion clinic.This book now a major movie starring Dean Cain (Lois & Clarke) reveals how the investigation that brought Gosnell to justice started as a routine drugs investigation and turned into a shocking unmasking of America s biggest serial killer. It details how compliant politicians and bureaucrats allowed Dr. Gosnell to carry out his grisly trade because they didn t want to be accused of  attacking abortion.  Gosnell also exposes the media coverup that saw reporters refusing to cover a story that shone an unwelcome spotlight on abortion in America in the 21st century.Gosnell is an astounding piece of investigative journalism revealing a coverup among the medical political and media establishments that allowed a killer to go undetected for decades.Newsbusters  Among other things, Gosnell was convicted May 2013 of first-degree murder of three babies (while the nightmarish Grand Jury report, The Hollywood Reporter has noted,  alleges Gosnell killed hundreds of infants by sticking scissors into their necks ).On Tuesday, The New York Times responded to a Regnery statement Thursday criticizing the news outlet for  refus[ing] to include Gosnell on their nonfiction  Print Hardcover Best Sellers  list. While Gosnell made No. 13 on the Times   Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction  list, Regnery still accused the news outlet because it  ignored the real sales numbers and refused to correctly list Gosnell as the 4th bestselling nonfiction title. The publishing company argued that Gosnell reached No. 3 on Amazon s best-seller book list and was named Amazon s No. 1  Hot New Release.   This was all without any mainstream media attention no reviews, no features, no author interviews,  the statement added.A New York Times representative defended the outlet s methodology Tuesday in a comment to MRC Culture:The Times s best-seller lists are based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week. These standards are applied consistently, across the board in order to provide Times readers our best assessment of what books are the most broadly popular at that time.She added,  That process is not influenced in any way by the content of a book, or by pressure from publishers or book sellers. Unfortunately, the Gosnell story has faced media silence from the very beginning. Even Gosnell s trial, in which witnesses described baby abortion survivors  swimming  in toilets  to get out,  attracted a mere 12   15 reporters. And that came only after a local columnist tweeted a picture of the empty courtroom benches reserved for press. Only after 56 days, multiple letters from members of the House of Representatives and a public outcry, did all three broadcast networks report on Gosnell.Watch Megyn Kelly tear Dr. Gosnell s attorney who attempts to make her viewers believe Dr. Gosnell was a  good guy  and a  perfect gentleman after he was convicted of murder:From the authors, Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer:The  newspaper  has admitted it does not use sales numbers to decide which books are  allowed  on its  Best Sellers List . For The New York Times the numbers of books bought by real people don t matter. According to a statement they take into account the  context  of the sales. The context?????According to The New York Times this  context  allows them  to provide Times readers our best assessment of what books are the most broadly popular at that time.  In other words   to hell with the numbers we will decide what is popular and you can be sure it won t be a truthful book revealing the truth about abortion   even though that is what people are buying. The New York Times Best Sellers List is a Fake List in a Fake Newspaper.Well we need to send a message to these  elites  who seem to hate the the truth.Please send this link www.GosnellBook.com to as many people as you can and buy as many copies as you can. Give them to friends or donate them to your local library. We need to make sure that the mainstream media can no longer ignore this book or the truth about Kermit Gosnell. They tried to coverup the case when he was on trial. We defeated them then and we can do it again.The cover-up stops now.Thank you, Ann and Phelim",0

Bravo Senator Sessions!Discussion of a nuclear security bill was hijacked in a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting by Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), who insisted on a  Right to Migrate  amendment that would bar the United States from banning an potential immigrant based on religion.Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) then delivered a rebuttal to Leahy: Fundamentally, foreign nationals living in foreign countries have no constitutional right to enter the United States. If they did, any alien denied entry could file suit to demand entry and claim damages for lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income. Choosing who can immigrate into the United States is, by definition, an exclusionary process. The goal is to select immigrants for admission based on the benefits they provide to society based on skills, ages, values, philosophy, incomes, etc. Our goal is to choose for admission those likeliest to succeed and flourish and, crucially, to support our Constitutional system of government and our values of pluralism and Republican governance.

11711,SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP! Senator Whack-Job Warren Gets Rebuked After Ignoring Senate Rules…Makes Desperate Last Ditch “Race Card” Play Against Jeff Sessions [VIDEO],"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shut down Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren during a Senate floor speech on Tuesday, accusing the Democrat of violating Senate rules by criticizing their colleague and attorney general nominee, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.Warren was warned early on in her remarks by Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the Republican overseeing the floor speeches, after she quoted Coretta Scott King, the late widow of Martin Luther King, Jr.Warren quoted King asserting that Sessions had  exhibited so much hostility to the enforcement  of voting rights laws for blacks.Daines struck his gavel and reprimanded Warren, who is one of a handful of Democrats who plan an all-night Senate floor session to oppose the Trump nominee. The senator is reminded that it is a violation of Rule 19 of the standing rules of the Senate to  impute to another senator or senators any conduct or motive unworthy or becoming a senator,  Daines said.Around 20 minutes later, McConnell interrupted Warren s speech to invoke Rule 19. The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama as warned by the chair,  said McConnell. Senator Warren, quote, said Senator Sessions has  used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote of black citizens.  I call the senator to order under the provisions of Rule 19. Warren protested. Mr. President, I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate. I ask leave of the Senate to continue my remarks. McConnell objected to Warren s request and Daines ordered her to take her seat.Warren appealed the ruling and called for a quorum vote to delay the proceedings.Despite Democrats  protest speeches, Sessions is expected to be approved as attorney general on Wednesday.  Daily CallerIt s a sickening game Democrats play with the character of other people who don t agree with them and their radical views. They have no problem impugning the good name of Senator Jeff Sessions, who has an impeccable record of service to our nation, as long as he has been completely discredited by the time he takes office.",0

Some critics have said advocates like her push school choice with little regard for the quality of options parents have.Giving families the opportunity to make education related decisions on behalf of their own children is apparently a scary proposition for the radical teacher s unions. Fox News  Trish Regan had this to say about Democrats opposition to Betsy DeVos:Dems opposing #DeVos BIGTIME. School choice threatens unions by giving students & families ability to demand accountability. Imagine that.  Trish Regan (@trish_regan) February 7, 2017She and other advocates believe strongly that parents should be able to decide where their kids go to school, and that kids shouldn t be trapped in failing schools. But critics say choice advocates ignore the need for quality options, say charters have siphoned money away from traditional public schools and point to data that show charter schools aren t performing any better, and in some cases are performing worse, than their counterparts.In 2000, DeVos and her husband, Dick, led a failed petition drive to institute a voucher system in Michigan that would allow parents to use public money to send their children to private schools. The state constitution prohibits such use of public funds.Voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposal. But a similar plan is the centerpiece of Trump s education plan. He wants to spend $20 billion in federal funding now being spent on other things   and expects states to kick in even more   to provide to pay $12,000 in private school tuition for every high-poverty child in the country.   Detroit Free PressCrybaby Democrat and comedian/US Senator Al Franken was NOT happy about DeVos  confirmation.

11717,BRAVO! POPULIST REPUBLICANS Target Out Of Control LEGAL Immigration Like The Ridiculous “Diversity Lottery”,"Thank goodness someone is closing down the free-for all that s been happening with immigration for way too long! Did you know we let 50k  diversity lottery  winners come to America every year just because some government bureaucrat decided we needed more diversity. Oy vey! This lottery has gotten to be scam whereby favored people are given preference to immigrate. It needs to end NOW!Sen. Tom Cotton and Georgia Sen. David Perdue have started taking steps to crack down on legal immigration, a focus shared by the Trump administration. They ll formally propose legislation on the matter as soon as today. The details:1.Eliminates multiple avenues for U.S. citizens and permanent residents to sponsor family members for green cards. Chain migration is out of control! It means a family comes and then is allowed to bring other family members increasing the immigration numbers tremendously! This must end!2. Gets rid of the diversity visa lottery, which allots 50k visas per year for citizens of countries with low levels of immigration to the U.S.3. Restricts the number of refugees allowed into the country to 50k annually   similar to rates outlined in Trump s travel ban. We believe 50k is still way too high! 4. If approved, the number of legal immigrants allowed into the U.S. under the bill would plummet by 40% in the first year and by 50% over the next 10 years, according to Cotton s aides.Read more: Politico ",0

Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world s media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers.But the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading,  unverified  data.It was never subjected to NOAA s rigorous internal evaluation process   which Dr Bates devised.His vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a  blatant attempt to intensify the impact  of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.His disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump s determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor s  green  policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal   so triggering an intense political row.

The U.S is the land of opportunity and dreams for many people all over the world. The heightened profile for Khairullah, a former teacher in the Paterson public schools who worked at Office Depot, represents growing political power for Muslims in New Jersey politics.Seven weeks ago, Passaic County elected its first Muslim Freeholder when Assad Akhter, a deputy chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell and the son of Pakistani immigrants, took of the seat of Hector Lora. Lora resigned to become Mayor of Passaic.   Observer NJ",0

She said Friday on Twitter that she meant to say  terrorists  instead of  massacre,  referencing a 2013 ABC News story on two suspected terrorists living as refugees in Kentucky.According to the story:  The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky   who later admitted in court that they d attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq   prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists  fingerprints. An undercover FBI operation exposes Al Qaeda terrorists posing as refugees in the middle of the American heartland. They quickly learned the laxed background checks were to blame. But it turns out that may be just the beginning. There may be dozens more now in this country as well.The video below shows an admitted Al Qaeda terrorist who had already killed American soldiers in Iraq, trying to get weapons to kill more of them. And Authorities tell ABC News he may be just one of dozens of men with American blood on their hands where mistakenly allowed to settle in the US as refugees.The two men came from Iraq 4 years ago among tens of thousands of refugees who the State Department approved to come here, seen as  no threat to the US . But the two were in fact, as the FBI says part of an Al Qaeda connected insurgent group that had already killed American soldiers with road side bombs.

11734,TRUMP IS REPORTEDLY Preparing Executive Order To Deport Illegals Living On Welfare…Kill Anchor Baby Benefits,"According to the Center for Immigration Studies, in 2012 approximately 51 percent of all immigrant households collected welfare: HOW THE USDA Helps Illegal Aliens Get FREE Benefits Paid For By YOU! This is a problem. A lot of American households also collect welfare, and that is a problem as well.A liberal newspaper claims it has obtained copies of two of President Donald Trump s upcoming executive orders that if implemented would once and for all stop immigrants from leeching off the American taxpayer.Obtained by The Washington Post, the orders would reportedly  deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge  and set up standards for  determining whether an alien is deportable   for having become a public charge within five years of entry. The underlying goal would be to make the U.S. immigration system more  merit-based,  so those with the potential to contribute to the country would be welcome, whereas those more likely to be a burden to the American taxpayer would be kept out.According to New York magazine, the order would also  bar undocumented immigrants from accessing the child tax credit, even when their children are U.S. citizens,  which would be a huge blow to illegal immigrant families hoping to cash in on their anchor babies.The simple fact is that as a sovereign nation, the United States reserves the right to demand the very best from anyone who aspires to live here. It is a fact that the U.S. actually has much more lenient immigration policies than a large number of Western countries that liberals profess to admire. Try immigrating to Canada or Western Europe if you don t believe it.If an immigrant works hard, obtains citizenship and leads a good life but is later laid off and needs to collect welfare for a bit, that s one thing. But when someone immigrates here and then immediately boards the welfare train, that is another   and it s a problem that President Trump hopes to finally resolve.For entire story: Conservative Tribune",0

Fed Judge Ruling UNBLOCKS Trump Travel Ban…Asks ACLU Lawyer: “Where Does It Say Muslim Countries?”,"***UPDATE to story below***In a blow to every mainstream media news outlet (and likely hurting a lot of feelings), President Donald Trump s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries will take effect in Boston on Sunday after a federal judge refused to extend a temporary ruling blocking its enforcement.As Bloomberg reports, the decision by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton on Friday dealt a setback to rights advocates who argued that blocking people from seven nations in the Middle East was unconstitutional. Gorton was weighing whether to extend a seven-day order blocking parts of Trump s Executive Order.The case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of several affected immigrants, is one of several that followed Trump s Jan 27 order, which roiled global travel by barring entry to the U.S. of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Individuals, organizations, politicians and some states called it unconstitutional religious discrimination against Muslims.As GMA News Onine reports, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton on Friday asked Matthew Segal, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) representing the plaintiffs in the Boston case. If your honor s question is,  Does the word  Muslim  make a profound presence in this executive order?,  my answer is that it doesn t,  But the president described what he was going to do as a Muslim ban and then he proceeded to carry it out. Am I to take the words of an executive at any point before or after election as a part of that executive order? Judge Gorton on Friday asked U.S. Justice Department lawyer Joshua Press how the seven countries had been selected.Press responded that the list had come from a law passed in 2015 and amended early last year requiring that citizens of the seven countries apply for visas to enter the United States,  out of concern about the refugees that were coming, mainly from Syria at that time and terrorist events that were occurring in Europe.  As we noted previously, only 12.5% of the world s Muslims live in the seven countries on Trump s immigration ban list Which left the judge to decide (as the full docket explains here), The language in Section 5 of the EO is neutral with respect to religion, The provisions of Section 5, however, could be invoked to give preferred refugee status to a Muslim individual in a country that is predominately Christian. Nothing in Section 5 compels a finding that Christians are preferred to any other group. The order provides a reasonably conceivable state of facts (which concerns national security and) that could provide a rational basis for the classification,  he wrote.  Accordingly, this Court declines to encroach upon the  delicate policy judgment  inherent in immigration decisions. ORDERFor the forgoing reasons, the Court declines to impose any injunctive relief and will not renew the temporary restraining order that was entered on January 29, 2017 (Docket No. 6). Full Order at Zero HedgeUPDATE:Two federal judges across the country from each other issued two separate and equally different decisions late Friday   one refusing to extend an injunction against President Donald Trump s U.S. travel suspension and one blocking its effect nationwide.First, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, in Boston, said in a preliminary 21-page ruling that he would not extend a seven-day restraining order that has prevented the travel restrictions from being implemented this week.A short time later on Friday, though, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, in Seattle, upheld a challenge to Trump s order from the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota and issued another temporary national restraining order. The state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,  Robart saidThe Boston ruling was a key victory for the Trump administration on the matter, but the win didn t last very long. The subsequent Seattle decision, meanwhile, represented the most significant legal setback yet in the battle over the president s directive   as it blocks the order with a new injunction.   UPI",0

11745,WATCH PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVE ON AIR FORCE ONE: Scheduled To Host Red Cross Charity Event At Mar-A-Lago…Angry Leftists Plan Protest [VIDEO],"The president s visit stretches from Friday afternoon to Monday morning, when he will travel to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. He s then expected to head back to Washington, D.C.Here are five key things to know while Trump is in town:1. This is Trump s first visit to Palm Beach since his Jan. 20 inauguration.Before this trip, Trump s last visit to his Palm Beach home was over the Christmas and New Year s holidays, when he was still president-elect.While in town, he played golf twice: once with Tiger Woods at Trump s West Palm Beach golf course, and a second time on New Year s Eve at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter.Trump and first lady Melania attended a Christmas Eve church service at the historic Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, where the couple was married and their son, Barron, was christened.2. The Trumps are expected to attend the 60th annual Red Cross Ball on Saturday night.The event was planned to be held at Mar-a-Lago well in advance of Trump s presidential election win, but that hasn t kept it from being a source of controversy. As the Red Cross prepares to possibly aid refugees affected by Trump s recent executive order, some have called for the organization to postpone or move the gala.However, the Red Cross Ball has a history at Mar-a-Lago. The estate s first owner, cereal heiress Marjorie Meriweather Post, was a noted supporter of the Red Cross, and began hosting the annual fundraiser there in 1957.3. This will be Melania Trump s first public appearance with her husband since the inauguration.Soon after the election, it was announced Melania and Barron, 10, would live in Trump Tower in New York City until Barron finishes his school year.Trump s daughter, Ivanka, has accompanied him on visits typically attended by the first lady, according to The New York Times.4. Protesters are expected to march through West Palm Beach on Saturday.Two local groups, South Florida Activism and Women s March Florida, are hosting a modified version of an earlier plan to march from Trump Towers in downtown West Palm Beach to Mar-a-Lago. Now, organizers say the march will head south to an area in West Palm Beach that sits just across the Intracoastal from Trump s lavish estate.The march, which kicks off at 5 p.m., could draw more than 2,200 people.5. Mar-a-Lago s original owner wanted the estate to be used as a  winter White House. Post, who built the mansion and named it Mar-a-Lago because it stretches  from ocean to lake,  left Mar-a-Lago to the federal government in her will. However, federal officials said,  Thanks but no thanks,  citing the high cost to maintain the property and its position under one of Palm Beach International Airport s primary flight paths.More than 10 years later, Trump purchased the estate and its furnishings for a bargain: $10 million.Via: Palm Beach Post",0

I was just getting ready to switch our TV, internet and phone service to Comcast from AT&T. It looks like we ll be sticking with AT&T after all. It s interesting how many CEO s of major companies in America are not really all that interested in putting America first. Trump s immigration policy, designed to protect our nation from future terror attacks, has shined a light on these CEO s and has made it possible for the American consumer to choose companies who take our national security seriously NBC s corporate parent, Comcast, is joining the corporate backlash against President Donald Trump s popular immigration reform, partly prodded by the company s Indian-born Chief Technology Officer, Sree Kotay.The company provided employers at its Philadelphia headquarters time off on Thursday to protest Trump s popular policy, which is designed to reduce the inflow of costly refugees and to exclude migrants carrying  hostile attitudes.  Company protests were also expected in Washington D.C., New York and California.Trump s new policy seeks to exclude people who:do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law   those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including  honor  killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.Trump underlined the pro-American nature of his reform today, saying at the National Prayer Breakfast that;Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world. But there are those who would exploit that generosity and undermine the values that we hold so dear. We need security. There are those who would seek to enter our country  to spread violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith.We will not allow  intolerance to spread in our nation  So in the coming days we will develop a system to make sure those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination. We want people to come into our nation but we want people to love us and love our values. Not hate us and hate our values.In Philadelphia, the 45-minute protest against the  hostile attitudes  policy was held just after lunch.Employees of Comcast in Philadelphia are walking out in protest against trumps immigration order. pic.twitter.com/hk69WdH088  Bianca Portillo (@BiancaAmarilis) February 2, 2017The growing campaign by corporations   including Google, Starbucks, Amazon, Lyft and Netflix   against the newly elected president and his immigration reform is shaped by their bottom-line desire to raise the inflow of immigrant consumers and cheap workers.But the corporate backlash is also boosted by sympathy from many top-level managers   both native-born and immigrant   towards striving migrants, regardless of the migrants  political or ideological views.Comcast s Kotay, for example, arrived in the United States as a child and worked his way to the top of the nation s high-tech sector, alongside other Indian immigrants who now running Google and Microsoft. In his Twitter account, he describes himself as  comcast. chief technology officer. immigrant. Kotay made his political sympathies clear in a message to his employees, in which he appears to described the elected President as  the enemy,  and also suggests that Trump is similar to now-dead Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.The screenshot was leaked to a radio station, New Jersey 101.5.Kotay s Twitter feed also shows his personal dislike of Trump s policies, which may end up reducing the inflow of Indian-born migrants and contract-workers into the United States.#include #techhasnowalls https://t.co/jopiMpbBet  sree kotay (@sreekotay) February 1, 2017Trump s policy is designed to exclude  hostile immigrants,  including those who reject the U.S. constitution or who support violence via Islamic holy war or  jihad.  The new policy would also exclude people who endorse  honor killings  of women and girls, which is a widespread problem in India and a growing problem in the United States.Like many other progressive advocates, Kotay praises immigrants while downplaying the accomplishment of ordinary Americans, who either birthed most of Comcast s workforce and customers, and or remain the vast majority of Comcast s employees and customers.Those who would surrender liberty in the name of security deserve neither. pic.twitter.com/eF3bR6Mdw7  sree kotay (@sreekotay) January 28, 2017For entire story go to: Breitbart News",0

11749,BREAKING: IRAN Tests Cruise Missile…Trump WARNS…They’re “Playing with fire…They don’t appreciate how ‘kind’ President Obama was to them. Not Me!” [VIDEO],"Peace through strength President Donald Trump raised the stakes with Iran again this morning by dashing off a tweet.The tweet comes a day after the new president dramatically raised the possibility of military action against Iran over its missiles test on Thursday saying  nothing is off the table  amid news that a new round of sanctions could be coming within hours. Sources told the Associated Press that up to two dozen Iranian individuals, companies and possibly government agencies could be penalized as part of the move.Action could come as early as later Friday, said the officials and others with knowledge of the decision. The individuals weren t authorized to discuss the unannounced sanctions publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Gen. Michael Flynn told reporters during a White House press briefing that the administration  condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East that puts American lives at risk.   As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,  he said.Trump used the phrase when asked directly if military action was possible, and after a series of angry tweets about how the Islamic republic tested a ballistic missile   something the nuclear bargain it struck with Barack Obama explicitly forbids. It also emerged Thursday that Iran has tested a cruise missile called  Sumar  that is capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The development was reported by German newspaper Die Welt reported Thursday, citing unspecified intelligence sources.Trump s personal involvement began earl on Thursday morning when he used social media to issue an explicit warning to Tehran.Trump has been openly hostile to the terms of the Obama-Tehran nuclear deal, saying during his presidential campaign that it was  stupid,   a disgrace,  and  the worst deal ever negotiated.  His tweets likely stand as the first time a head of state has used social media to threaten a foreign country. They were met with contempt by the Iranian regime.A top adviser to the Iranian supreme leader said the country will not yield to  useless  US threats from  an inexperienced person  over its ballistic missile program.Ali Akbar Velayati said, who is a senior counsel to Iran s most powerful man Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hit back. This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran,  he said. The American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless. The report of a cruise missile test in the German newspaper said the Sumar cruise missile was built in Iran and traveled around 375 miles in its first known successful test.The missile is believed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons and may have a range of 1,200 to 1,800 miles, the paper said, citing intelligence sources.Cruise missiles are harder to counter than ballistic missiles since they fly at lower altitudes and can evade enemy radar, confounding missile defense missiles and hitting targets deep inside an opponent s territory.But the biggest advantage from Iran s point of view, a security expert told Die Welt, was that cruise missiles are not mentioned in any United Nations resolutions that ban work on ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.There has been no explicit response from Iran or from Washington on the cruise missile disclosure.However, Trump s National Security Advisor had issued his own stern warning to Tehran s mullahs on Wednesday.

On Tuesday Democratic Senator Time Kaine told the Morning Joe in an interview that Democrats need to fight the Trump administration including online and on the streets in addition to  the ballot box.Partial Transcript:MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST  MORNING JOE : So, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we ve all been through. There s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you   we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there s the momentum to be able to do this. And we re not afraid of the popular outcry, we re energized by it and that s going to help us do our job and do it better.  -GPListen to faux man Tim Kaine call for fighting on the streets here. Pay special attention to his comment about the  Women s March  that  was organized under a grassroots  label.'  It sounds like Kaine s admitting that it was organized under a grassroots  label  but that it wasn t really grassroots at all. Why didn t he just come out and admit that it was organized by Soros, Obama and Planned Parenthood?We could also add the DNC s California Chair: In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him.

TRUMP Channels Reagan…Threatens Violent Berkeley College Rioters…COMPARE TO REAGAN’S No Nonsense Response To Berkeley Rioters In 1966 [VIDEO],"Last night, at the birthplace of free speech, we watched as rioters took to the campus of Berkeley College to shut down the free speech of gay conservative Milo Yiannopoulos. The speech was scheduled in advance, and police were aware that angry Democratic Party supporters and anarchists were likely to cause chaos and threaten the security of students who attended the event, as well as the guest speaker. After violent riots broke out, which included hundreds of rocks and firecrackers thrown at police, the event was cancelled. Yiannopoulos was rushed out of the building and taken to a place of safety. It s important to note, that only 1 month ago, these violent riots would have likely been ignored by President Obama. But this is not 1 month ago. This is now, and now, we have a new sheriff in town. We have a President who respects the free speech rights of every American, whether he agrees or disagrees with them. We have a President who will not sit back and allow innocent citizens to be threatened by violent radicals who are breaking the law.Here is an example of the violence that was exacted on innocent people who were interested in hearing the opinions and facts of scheduled presenter, gay conservative Milo Yionnopoulos:President Donald J. Trump s response to the violence and the shutting down of these peaceful American s free speech rights was swift. He put essentially put all of Berkeley College on notice.

Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017Compare and contrast Reagan s decision to address the unlawful behavior of the Berkeley protesters while he was the acting Governor of California in 1966:In his 1966 campaign for California governor, Republican Ronald Reagan promised to  to clean up the mess at Berkeley.  Reagan was referring to the unrest prevalent not just at the University of California, Berkeley, but on college campuses throughout state. Students and faculty alike were engaged in protests, demonstrations, and strikes related to issues such as the draft, civil rights, discrimination, and women s liberation.In one 1966 campaign speech, Reagan declared that many leftist campus movements had transcended legitimate protest, with the actions of  beatniks, radi cals and filthy speech advocates  having become more to do  with riot ing, with anarchy  than  academic freedom.  He blamed university administrators and faculty, who  press their particular value judgments  on students, for  a leadership gap and a morality and decency gap  on campus, and suggested a code of conduct be imposed on faculty to  force them to serve as examples of good behavior and decency. [1]Six months after Reagan took office in 1967, he wrote this letter to Glenn Dumke, the chancellor of San Francisco State College, one of California s largest public institutions. Dumke served as the public face of the state college system, and he was a staunch opponent of radical student and faculty demonstrations. In his letter to Dumke, Reagan criticizes liberal activism on campuses. He condemns  these people & this trash  on campuses as well as  the excuse of academic freedom & freedom of expression  in allowing protests and demonstrations to go on.  We wouldn t tolerate this kind of language in front of our families,  Reagan writes of campus protesters. He urges Dumke to  lay down some rules of conduct,  promising that  you d have all the backing I could give you. HERE IS THE TRANSCRIPT OF REAGAN S LETTER:Dear GlennHow far do we go in tolerating these people & this trash under the excuse of academic freedom & freedom of expression? Please understand, that question isn t made in any tone of accusation. I mean myself too in that use of the term  we. We wouldn t let a LeRoi Jones in our livingroom and we wouldn t tolerate this kind of language in front of our families. Hasn t the time come to take on those neurotics in our faculty group and lay down some rules of conduct for the students comparable to what we d expect in our own families? If we do and the  we  this time means you d have all the backing I could give you, I believe the people of Calif. would take the state college system to their hearts.[illegible] Ron ",0

Chobani is not traded on the stock market, but is one of the biggest advocates for importing employers to the US from Muslim majority nations to Twin Falls, ID                Chobani CEO Hamdi UlukayaChobani is owned by Turkish Muslim immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya. Chobani has filled 30 percent of its 600 positions at the world s largest Yogurt plant in Twin Falls, Idaho, with refugees resettled in America through a U.S. State Department program carried out in cooperation with the United Nations.Ann Corcoran, author of the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog, said the potential conflict of interest is disturbing and should be questioned by Twin Falls residents. Twin Falls is really a microcosm of what we find going on in so many of the refugee communities across the U.S., where you have people moving in and out of government and the Chamber of Commerce with a vested interest in making sure a meatpacking plant or some other industry has continuous access to refugee labor,  said Corcoran.  Only in this case we have a blatant example of conflicts of interest by an elected official who is also the head of the Chamber enticing companies to come in and make use of the steady influx of cheap, overseas labor. These are jobs that Americans would be happy to fill but they are forced to compete now with someone from Sudan or Iraq who is used to working for a dollar a week. The local Muslim community in Twin Falls grew out of its mosque and built a new, much larger house of worship last year.Here s Chobani CEO s response to Trump s moratorium on refugees from 7 countries:  This is very personal for me,  Ulukaya wrote in internal memo to his staff that was obtained by CNN.  As an immigrant who came to this country looking for opportunity, it s very difficult to think about and imagine what millions of people around the world must be feeling right now. General Electric GE (NYSE) stock was down .87%           CEO Jeff Immelt said, in a memo on the G (GE)employee blog, that he shares the  concern  felt by his employees and said the company has many employees from the countries named in the ban.  These employees and customers are critical to our success and they are our friends and partners,  he wrote, adding that GE would  stand with them  and try to find a balance between security and  movement of law abiding people.  Immelt was one of 28 business leaders named to a council to advise Trump on manufacturing growth.Trip Advisor CEO Stephen Kaufer Trip Advisor s (TRIP) CEO wrote in a Linkedin post that Trump s immigration ban is  not only heartless and discriminatory, but also against the principles that make our country great.  Kaufer also said in a tweet that  We need to do more, not less, to help refugees,  and said the action was  wrong on humanitarian grounds, legal grounds, and won t make us  safer.'

11764,BREAKING: PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES HIS PICK For The Supreme Court,"JUDGE NEIL GORSUCH   A strict conservative similar to Justice Scalia   A STRICT CONSTITUTIONALISTJudge Neil Gorsuch, 49, is President Donald Trump s pick for appointment to the Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated a year ago by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP:BREAKING: Donald Trump reveals that his choice for US Supreme Court is Neil Gorsuch, 49 https://t.co/D91eYAcIMZ https://t.co/dbCiP2bP2U  CNN (@CNN) February 1, 2017Gorsuch has the typical pedigree of a high court justice. He graduated from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, clerked for two Supreme Court justices and did a stint at the Department of Justice.Since 2006, he has served on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Denver, Colorado. His supporters note that he is an outdoorsman who fishes, hunts and skis. On the court, conservatives hope he could become the intellectual heir to Scalia, long the outspoken leader of the conservative bloc. The real appeal of Gorsuch nomination is he s likely to be the most effective conservative nominee in terms of winning over Anthony Kennedy and forging conservative decisions on the court,  said Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center.  He s unusual for his memorable writing style, the depth of his reading and his willingness to rethink constitutional principles from the ground up.Like Justice Scalia, he sometimes reaches results that favor liberals when he thinks the history or text of the Constitution or the law require it, especially in areas like criminal law or the rights of religious minorities, but unlike Scalia he s less willing to defer to regulations and might be more willing to second-guess Trump s regulatory decision.

11766,USA TODAY SPORTS COLUMNIST Calls For Tom Brady’s Head Over One Thing Found In His Locker…Who Does She Think She Is?,"Just recently, a USA Today sports columnist said New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady deserves  to get some tough questions  on President Trump as his team prepares for the Super Bowl. Tom Brady no longer gets a pass on his friendship with Donald Trump,  wrote Nancy Armour, a veteran sportswriter.  Not after this weekend, when the country boiled over in rage and indignation at Trump s decision to turn America s back on refugees. Armour said the 39-year-old quarterback   who did not campaign with Trump   cannot dismiss his friendship with Trump when he answers questions from the press leading up to Sunday s game against the Atlanta Falcons. It s only now, when he s facing questions and criticism, that he thinks the friendship should be off limits. But it doesn t work that way. If you stake out a position, you need to own it. Or if you ve had a change of heart, explain why,  Armour wrote.The columnist conceded that she doesn t know if Brady is aligned with Trump s perspective or policies, but says he should  disavow  him regardless.  Brady might not agree with Trump s views or his policies   but in refusing to publicly disavow Trump s actions, Brady is giving tacit endorsement to both Trump and the chaos he has created,  she argued.Armour concluded her column by stating that any harsh treatment Brady receives from the press this week is ultimately a situation he created. Regardless of whether he was duped into being a prop or is genuinely friends with Trump, Brady inserted himself into the national firestorm. He can t be surprised that people want to know more. And now expect more,  she writes.Trump and Brady have said they are golfing buddies. Brady was spotted with a  Make America Great Again  hat in his locker shortly after Trump launched his presidential bid. Asked in September 2015 whether he would like to see a Trump White House, Brady said:  It would be great. There would be a putting green on the White House lawn, I can tell you that. But Brady largely avoided answering questions about Trump throughout the race.Read more: The Hill",0
11767,"WOW! REFUGEES EXPOSED: Here’s the cold hard truth the media won’t tell you…“If Saudi Arabia is refusing to accept them because they are a national security threat, why are we accepting them?” [VIDEO]","Brigitte Gabriel is an intelligent and important voice of reason when it comes to the subject of Muslim refugees who are migrating West. She is the Founder and President of Act for America. She is one of the leading national security experts in the world -providing information and analysis on the rise of Islamic terrorism. Ms. Gabriel lectures nationally and internationally about national security and current affairs. Her expertise is sought after by world and business leaders.Gabriel is a Christian born who was born and raised in Lebanon. Her story is very compelling, and serves as a warning to Americans who are fighting to keep the flow of unvetted refugees coming into the United States:  I lost my country of birth to radical Islam   I do not want to lose my adopted country, America. Gabriel declared.Muslims started coming to Lebanon so their children could study at the country s universities. They also stayed to work in their economy.  We built refugee camps for them in Lebanon, we took them in because we wanted to take care of them, but these people turned against us, and they destroyed our country,  Gabriel recalled, bitterly. She said the tipping point was when Muslims became the majority population. Lebanon went from being  the Eden of the Middle East  to being the terrorist pit of the Middle East,  she declared. The country is run by a terrorist organization, and has no rule of law. Currently, there is not even a president in Lebanon, as none has been elected.  They are drowning in their own garbage, the government is falling apart. This is what happens when you import people into your country that do not share your values   that do not share your idea of freedom or democracy, your idea of tolerance,  Gabriel explained.Gabriel did not deny the charitable impulse of helping people in need.  We can still do humanitarian work, but we need to make sure we are protected first,  she declared. We know ISIS infiltrated them, they were coming here under the disguise of refugees, but they are actually ISIS recruiters and ISIS sympathizers,  Gabriel told PJ Media in an interview at the Values Voter Summit on Saturday. She added that the refugees  are making up names   they can tell us anything, and there is nothing we can do to check it. These people don t have passports. We don t even know if the name they give is their real name,  Gabriel explained. The refugees also are not just coming from embattled countries like Syria and Iraq, she argued. They also come from Tunisia, Libya, Eritrea, Djibouti and Afghanistan   migrants fleeing poor countries to go to rich countries.Gabriel argued that the refugees must have a reason for going further west, as opposed to other countries in the Middle East.  These refugees can go to any country in the region, where they speak the Arabic language, where their children can assimilate and continue in their schooling with Arabic schools. Why are they coming to Europe? One reason, she alleged, is that  the word got out that if you want a freebie, this is the opportunity to come to Europe and live off the government. Perhaps more importantly, however, many Middle Eastern countries would turn the migrants away.  Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country and a very big country   they have a lot of space,  Gabriel noted. She explained that Saudi Arabia, Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait are refusing to accept these refugees because  they are a national security threat.  When Arabic countries suspect terror activity from the refugees, why should we overlook it? If Saudi Arabia is refusing to accept them because they are a national security threat, why are we accepting them?  Gabriel asked.  Are we that dumb? Watch Gabriel as she exposes the truth about the refugees we are bringing to America: It is not difficult to see how the tens of thousands of refugees who have entered Europe and other western countries recently are having a devastating impact in their host nations. Areas holding these refugees have seen an increase in rape, theft, gang activity, intimidation, and organized crime. Media in Europe have reported that thousands of the refugees have disappeared   and are unaccounted for. Terror groups such as the Islamic State publicly announce how they are using refugees as cover to infiltrate the West.An Egyptian-American made this interesting comment under the video. He gives us an idea of what it s like to be a Christian in a Muslim dominated nation:Ms. Gabriel has addressed the United Nations, the Australian Prime Minister, members of the British Parliament/House of Commons, members of the United States Congress, the Pentagon, the Joint Forces Staff College, the U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. Asymmetric Warfare group, the FBI, and many others.She speaks Arabic, French, English and Hebrew.",0

11769,HEY AMERICA…Where Was The Outrage When Obama CHOSE The 7 Nations Trump Banned From Entering US…Or Obama’s Ban Of CUBAN REFUGEES On Last Day In Office?,"Alinsky s ideas for community organizing were controversial because he talked about fanning latent hostilities of low-income, inner city residents. He said that searching out hostilities and controversies could organize communities. Instead of setting your own agenda for a group. let them set their own agenda and unleash their own power. Obama laid the groundwork for the perpetual protests, chaos and rioting in the streets while he was in office. It started with the Trayvon Martin case and ramped up during Trump s campaign. Today, Obama s working behind the scenes, with the help of  radical globalist billionaire George Soros, to keep it going. Unless and until Americans rally behind Trump and support the defense of our national security, we will allow this small group of radicals on the Left and in the media to win the propaganda war they ve waged against Trump, and ultimately against America.In the wake of President Donald Trump s legal and constitutional executive orders on immigration, the left has lost their minds. Unhinged protesters lost their minds and so-called senators on the left have called Trump s actions unconstitutional as if non-American citizens have a constitutional right to come to the United States. Then there is Democrat Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer who with crocodile tears in his eyes, called Trump s actions  mean spirited and un-American. Oh the hypocrisy, where to begin?Does anyone know why the actual executive orders do not specifically identify the countries seven Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen in the text? Because in 2016, Barack Obama s DHS targeted those same countries in a 2016 law concerning immigration visas as  countries of concern. The Department of Homeland Security today announced that it is continuing its implementation of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 with the addition of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as three countries of concern, limiting Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries.DHS:  limiting Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries.  DHS noted  the three additional countries designated today join Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria as countries subject to restrictions for Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals. But the hypocrisy of the left does not end there. Where was the Left and why were they so silent when the Obama administration refused to issue visas to Iraqis for six months following the discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky?In 2011, fewer than 10,000 Iraqis were resettled as refugees in the U.S., half the number from the year before, State Department statistics show.It was the same Chuck Schumer in November of 2015 who said that a halt of Syrian refugees  may be necessary  after the Paris Islamist attacks occured that killed well over 100 innocent people. What a mean spirited and un-American act! But, that was different.We all know that Obama and the Democrats never stranded refugees in need. Of course we will just forget the fact that Barack Obama heroically on his way out the door put a travel ban in place during his final days and blocked Cuban refugees when he ended the Cuban  wet foot dry foot  policy and forced the refugees back to Communist Cuba. Where were the Democrats then? Where was the media? Where was the ACLU? Crickets!-Effective immediately, Cuban nationals  will be subject to removal, consistent with U.S. law and enforcement priorities,  the president said. Cuban migrants who have already begun the process of applying for legal residency through the program will be allowed to continue. Gateway Pundit",0

It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.Tonight, President Trump relieved Ms. Yates of her duties and subsequently named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until Senator Jeff Sessions is finally confirmed by the Senate, where he is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons.

11775,STUDY SHOWS UP TO 2.8 MILLION Non U.S. Citizens Voted In 2008…But Trump’s Crazy To Think 3 Million Illegally Voted In 2016…Right?,"One California resident commented: Lots of illegals vote here in California. Crooked Democrats run everything here and any Illegal invader can go to the DMV and get a drivers license/ID card which they can register to vote with.Police, a few patriotic state bureaucrats, concerned real American citizens or anyone else are not even allowed to question citizenship of obvious illegal grifters because that is considered  racist. President Trump s new DOJ needs to come in and bust some heads and work with some real journalists to break this story wide open. Jerry Brown (D) and all California Democrats should be arrested and brought up on federal voter fraud charges.Somewhere between 38,000 and almost 2.8 million non-citizens voted in the 2008 elections, according to a study published in Electoral Studies journal in 2014.Old Dominion University professors Jesse Richman and David Earnest, the study s co-authors, concluded that  some non-citizens participate in U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections. In spite of substantial public controversy, very little reliable data exists concerning the frequency with which non-citizen immigrants participate in United States elections. Although such participation is a violation of election laws in most parts of the United States, enforcement depends principally on disclosure of citizenship status at the time of voter registration,  Richman and Earnest note. We find that some non-citizens participate in U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections. Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress,  they continue.The authors later say that the number of non-citizen voters  could range from just over 38,000 at the very minimum to nearly 2.8 million at the maximum. Richman and Earnest s study has been contested by other social scientists and was the subject of a rebuttal article challenging their findings. That study, led by Harvard political scientist Stephen Ansolabehere, claimed instead that  the likely percent of non-citizen voters in recent US elections is 0. The Trump White House has faced criticism over President Donald Trump s belief that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has declined to offer any evidence to back up his claim. The president does believe that, I think he s stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him.  press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday. Spicer did not cite any specific studies to back up Trump s belief.The White House has not yet returned an email from The Daily Caller regarding whether or not Richman and Earnest s study was part of Trump s belief that  millions  of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election and   if not   what other studies make up the basis of Trump s belief.Read more: Daily Caller",0

CUSTOMS AGENTS IGNORE Obama Appointed Judge’s Court Order…ENFORCE Trump’s Travel Ban,"On Friday, a federal judge in New York issued an emergency stay temporarily halting the removal of individuals detained after President Trump issued an order to ban immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.The move appears to mark the first successful legal challenge to the Trump administration and affects those who have arrived in the U.S. with previously approved refugee applications or were in transit with valid visas. Similar rulings were later issued in Virginia, Massachusetts and Washington state.U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly ruled in favor of a habeas corpus petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of two Iraqi men who were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday after Trump signed his order.Donnelly, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama and confirmed to her judgeship in 2015, ruled in the Eastern District of New York that  there is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject  to Trump s order.   The Hill The ACLU is getting  multiple reports  that federal customs agents are siding with President Trump   and willfully ignoring a Brooklyn federal judge s demand that travelers from seven Muslim countries not be deported from the nation s airports. The court s order could not be clearer  they need to comply with the order,  Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU s Immigrants Rights project, told The Post late Saturday.

Wouldn t it have been great if they had been as vocal when Barack Obama was our President? Aside from his honorable service to our nation while in our military, John McCain has offered very little in the past decade to our nation. Now might be a good time for constituents in their districts to think about replacing Arizona Senator John McCain and South Carolina s Senator Lindsey (crybaby) Graham with someone who puts our nation first and their political relevance dead last Republican senators. John McCain and Lindsey Graham on Sunday denounced President Donald Trump s executive order on travel from several Muslim-majority countries, calling it  hasty  and warning that it could prove counterproductive in the fight against terrorism.McCain, Arizona s senior senator and the GOP s 2008 presidential nominee, and Graham, a South Carolina politician who also competed briefly for the 2016 nomination, are both considered hawkish on national security. However, they frequently buck their party on key issues, which in the past has drawn the ire of grassroots conservatives.They join several of their GOP Senate colleagues, including Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio, in criticizing the measure. The White House has defended the order, arguing it is necessary to properly vet people coming into the U.S. from nations with terrorism concerns.Late Friday, Trump signed the order, which indefinitely bars Syrian refugees from entering the country. It also suspends all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocks citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the country for 90 days.  CNBCTrump didn t waste any time blasting these two Presidential race losers, who both seem to have a penchant for war: The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong   they are sadly weak on immigration. The two  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017Watch Mike Huckabee tell Fox News host Bill Hemmer: He didn t ban people from 7 countries. I don t know if John McCain read the executive order, he might want to do that because those countries are not mentioned in the executive order. The only country mentioned is Syria. Where did that list of 7 come from? It came from the Obama administration dating back to 2011, signed into law and I assume John McCain probably voted for that law. ",0

11781,BLACK RADIO HOST: DEMOCRATS Have “Owned” Blacks Since The “Civil Rights Act”…How Trump Will Be “The White Savior To Black America”,"By Jesse Lee Peterson   President Donald Trump has issued a blunt warning to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel about his city s out-of-control violence:  If the city doesn t fix the horrible carnage going on, I ll send the feds! Trump s words sent shockwaves across the country.But what s wrong with black men that they can t stop the carnage?Those of you who read my columns know that for the past 27 years I have run a nonprofit, BOND, dedicated to  Rebuilding the Family by Rebuilding the Man.  I work with all men, but the primary focus has been to get black men to drop their anger so God can guide them, and they can lead their families in the right way.Men are supposed to represent Jesus Christ on earth; the man is the Christ in the family. But the black community is nearly devoid of men who truly exemplify Christ.Black men were not like this prior to the 1960s. They believed in God and took care of themselves and their families. But after Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Democrats seduced blacks away from God and the Republican Party with  programs.  They ve  owned  blacks ever since.Democrats empowered black liberal politicians to run cities like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, Baltimore and Memphis. They left these cities in worse shape than when they took office, but the media refused to hold them accountable because of their color and political affiliation.Coleman Young ran Detroit for 20 years. He was racially divisive and allowed the city to be ruined by drugs and crime. A succession of black Democrats followed, including Kwame Kilpatrick, who was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison for mail fraud, wire fraud and racketeering.Dozens of Congressional Black Caucus members have been in Congress for decades and they ve enriched themselves, but they haven t lifted a finger to save their districts.Donald Trump is going to make these people clean up the mess so that decent black people can live in peace. Why couldn t Obama and these black politicians do the same?Liberal blacks argue that it s unfair to expect Obama would stop the violence in  just  eight years. Some said it would be an infringement on freedoms. Yet blacks living in dangerous neighborhoods already feel like prisoners in their own homes.Comedians Conan O Brien, Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers mocked Trump for threatening to send in the feds. But it s no laughing matter for black families trapped in dangerous neighborhoods. These people wouldn t be joking if LGBT or Muslims were being slaughtered.Trump is going to reinstate law and order because he loves all Americans. His father was his role model. When men and women love their fathers, it s like loving God, and they have real love and a desire to help people.Still, many blacks hate Trump even though he is trying to save them. It reminds me of how Jesus Christ made it possible for us to return to the Father, and yet he was hated for that.To help himself and his family, the black man must recognize that Donald Trump and whites aren t the enemy. The black man s anger was first caused by his impatient mother and grandmother who raised him (the father is rarely in the home). When the black man understands this and repents of his anger, he will be set free. He can then help himself, his family and his community.To read the article in its entirety: WND",0

11787,LIST OF 20 “Vetted” Refugees Who Were Charged With Terrorism After Entering U.S:”I want to blow myself up…I am against America”,"While the lying media is perpetuating the lie refugees do not pose a terrorist threat, the facts show otherwise.1) On May 25, 2016, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Bilal Abood was sentenced to four years in prison for making a false statement to the FBI.

During an interview in October 2015, Al Hardan falsely represented that he had never received any type of weapons training, when in fact he had received automatic machine gun training. According to media accounts, Al Hardan told his wife  I will go to Syria. I want to blow myself up. . . . I am against America. 4) On August 12, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, Fazliddin Kurbanov was found guilty of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and possessing an unregistered destructive device.

Here s a transcript of what Darweesh said: First of all I want to thank the people that take care of me and support me. They leave their family, their business, and they come to support me. This is the humanity. This is the soul of America. This is what pushed me to move, leave my country and come here. I am very, very thankful to all of the people who come to support me.

But I don t know. This is a policy, I don t know. He is a president not a normal person. I have a special immigration visa in my pocket, me and my family, because I worked for the U.S. government.

11795,DERANGED LEFTISTS Cross The Line: Chicago Play Targeting 10 Yr Old Barron Trump Opens Tonight In Obama’s Old Neighborhood,"A play scheduled to open Saturday night in Chicago targets Barron Trump, the ten-year-old son of newly sworn in President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.The play, titled,  Barron Trump Up Past Bedtime , stars comedian Shannon Noll as Barron and is set for the Revival Theater in Hyde Park, the neighborhood of Trump s predecessor former President Barack Obama. Melania Trump will also be targeted in character on stage. But the main target, of course, is President Trump.After eight years of presidential children being off limits (to the point news articles about them disappeared after White House warnings), they are  fair game  now that a Republican is president. A headline about the play at the Chicago Reader makes that very point about young Barron Trump being  fair game : Barron Trump is fair game in Barron Trump: Up Past BedtimeThe Revival Theater s description of the play: Join Donald Trump s youngest heir Barron Trump (as played by Shannon Noll) for a  Pee Wee s Playhouse-style  show that features celebrity guests (Melania Trump, Ben Carson, and Vladimir Putin) patriotic games (Pin the Email on the Clinton), and fancy fun! The Chicago Reader interviewed Noll about the play. Noll says her approach is decidedly lighthearted: an exploration of the current political moment through the eyes of a child enmeshed in it. When I set out to do this show, I did it to use [Barron] as a vehicle to comment on this administration,  Noll says. She was initially inspired to take on the title role due to her resemblance to the youngest Trump, who stepped into the spotlight when he appeared to struggle to stay awake during his father s presidential victory speech, which occurred at around 3 AM.Up Past Bedtime begins as Melania Trump tucks Barron in for the night. He then secretly stays awake to explore a fantastical world, a la Pee-wee s Playhouse, populated by the likes of Vladimir Putin and Ben Carson.Noll told the Chicago Tribune that Barron Trump  is absolutely not the butt of a joke. I noticed that I looked like Barron Trump and I thought that would be an interesting approach,  she said. She has brought on collaborators who will perform solo material (the aforementioned imaginary friends)  and I m facilitating that as Barron Trump  as master of ceremonies. Barron Trump is absolutely not the butt of a joke,  she said.Asked if she had any second thoughts about going ahead with the show, Noll said,  No, I sort of doubled-down. I was originally going to create a fake Trump child, but I look so much like Barron. And going into this, I specifically created this character so that he bears no resemblance in personality to what we ve seen of Barron Trump. I m just playing him as a generic kid.

TRUMP Announces CHRISTIAN Syrians Applying For Refugee Status In U.S. Will Be Given Priority [VIDEO],"Though they are officially  non-profit  organizations, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services, and several other Christian organizations are profiting from lucrative contracts with the federal government to resettle refugees in the United States.Of the 100,000 refugees resettled in the United States in 2014 under the Refugee Resettlement program, an estimated 40 percent were Muslims.  BreitbartAs of August 29, 2016, 224 new Syrian refugee arrivals have been reported. That lifts the total this fiscal year to 10,126, of whom 52 or 0.51 percent are Christians; and 9,945 or 98.2 percent, are Sunni Muslims.The Obama administration s goal was to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in the fiscal year.The number of Christians among the 10,000 was less than half of one percent.Of the 9,902 before Monday s arrivals, just 47 (0.47 percent) are Christians, according to State Department Refugee Processing Center data.The vast majority of the Syrian refugees permitted to resettle in the United States are Sunni Muslims   9,726 of the 9,902, or 98.2 percent. Another 20 are Shi a Muslims, and a further 85 are identified in the data simply as Muslims.  CNS NewsIn an exclusive interview President Donald Trump was asked by David Brody of Christian Broadcasting News if he considers it a priority to bring persecuted Christians over to the US from Syria.Trump responded,  You know, if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very, very tough to get in to. If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians, and I thought it was very,very unfair, so we are going to help them.

Connected To Benghazi Scandal And Clinton E-mail Scandal [Video],"The Washington Post reported that higher ups in the State Department jumped ship before Rex Tillerson could take the helm but we don t know that was the case. Were the people who left asked to vacate their post or did they jump ship? WaPo was even called out by CNN for the misleading headline.   One of the things that the main stream media doesn t mention is that these officials were knee deep in the Benghazi Scandal and one of those (see below for more on Patrick Kennedy) was knee deep in the Clinton e-mail scandal too! It s what the press doesn t tell you that s important. We just don t know if this is a matter of these people resigning or a matter of our new president recognizing that we need to DRAIN THE SWAMP! COULD THIS BE THE SMOKING GUN THAT TRUMP CALLED OUT ON PATRICK KENNEDY: In what one congressman called the  flashing red light of potential criminality,  FBI documents indicate a senior State Department official offered a  quid pro quo  to get the FBI to remove the  Secret  label from one of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s emails from the days when she was secretary of state.The documents say State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who had served as an aide and confidante to Clinton, offered the deal, and continued trying to influence the FBI s decision by taking his case over the head of FBI agents to whom he initially proposed the deal.FBI documents say Kennedy offered the FBI additional positions overseas if the  Secret  label, the middle level of classification, would be removed. Clinton, who used a private server for her emails while she was secretary of state, has contended she never sent or received classified information. The FBI has ruled otherwise.In response to the FBI bombshell, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump released a video on Twitter in which he said the allegations show  corruption at the highest level.

11805,BREAKING: Mexico’s President Cancels Visit With Trump Over Defending Our US Border From Lawbreakers…But Wrongfully Imprisoning US Marine Tahmooressi For “Border Violation” Was No Big Deal,"On March 31, 2015 Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was driving with his friends to go to a Mexican restaurant and accidentally missed the last exit before the Mexican border. Without the ability to turn around before he crossed the border, he proceeded to the Mexican customs post, where he explained that he missed the exit before the crossing, and volunteered that he had three US legal guns in the vehicle. After that, Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was arrested and charged with gun smuggling into Mexico.While we all understand the problem of illicit arms and drug smuggling between Mexico and the US, it is clear that Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was not part of it. He made an honest mistake, admitted it to the Mexican border agents, and was arrested anyway. His admission and cooperation with the Mexican authorities strongly attest to his innocent intent.Tahmooressi was released in November when a Mexican judge was finally convinced to do so on humanitarian grounds. His lengthy prison stay became a farce and a failure under the Obama administration, culminating in a September congressional hearing that was  highly critical of Obama Administration efforts to secure his release and Mexico s refusal to let him go. With the swipe of a pen on Wednesday, President Trump green lighted the construction of a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and vastly increased the presence of border agents. Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto soon expressed regret over the new U.S. leader s actions and pledged to protect Mexicans already in the States. Where there is a Mexican migrant at risk that requires our support, your country should be there,  Pe a Nieto said in a brief address to his nation, which he said was a response to Trump s actions earlier in the day. Our communities are not alone,  Pe a Nieto said.  The Mexican Government will provide them with the legal advice, which guarantees the protection they require.The 50 Mexican consulates in the U.S. will be advocating on behalf of Mexicans, Nieto explained. He added (again) that he does not intend to pay for Trump s border wall. Mexico offers and demands respect as the fully sovereign nation we are,  he insisted.BREAKING: Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says he has informed the White House he has canceled trip to Washington.  The Associated Press (@AP) January 26, 2017Nieto is apparently so distressed by Trump s executive actions that he is considering canceling their scheduled meeting for next week, where they were due to discuss not only immigration, but trade.Trump said that if Nieto is not willing to pay for the wall, he can go ahead and cancel.

11808,TERRIFIC! PRESIDENT TRUMP Takes On The United Nations With Latest Executive Order,"THE US PROVIDES 22% OF THE BUDGET FOR THE UNITED NATIONS!Donald Trump is preparing executive orders that would dramatically reduce US funding of the United Nations, as well as other international organizations that do not meet certain criteria.The executive order plans to repeal certain multilateral treaties too, officials told the New York Times, which would likely include treaties on climate change.The first order, called  Auditing and Reducing US Funding of International Organizations , will take away funding for any United Nations agency or international body that meets criteria, including: organisations that give full membership to the Palestinian Authority or Palestine Liberation Organisation; support abortion and any group that circumvents sanctions on Iran or North Korea.Funding will be taken away from any organization that is  controlled or substantially influenced by any state that sponsors terrorism  or is behind the persecution of marginalised groups or systematic violation of human rights.The order has singled out peacekeeping, the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Population Fund. The UNPFA targets violence against women, fights to keeps childbirth and abortion, where it is legal, safe, and was a key presence in safeguarding women in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew.The order demands decreasing US funding towards international organizations by at least 40 per cent.Earlier reports revealed that Congress was planning legislation to stop funding the UN after it voted to condemn Israeli settlement building in the Occupied Territories.Read more: The Independent ",0

11812,FAKE NEWS ALERT! CNN Finally Releases ACTUAL Picture Of Trump Inauguration Crowd…And Proof That Crowd Size For Obama’s 2009 Inauguration Was GREATLY Exaggerated,"As we pointed out throughout the months leading up to the election, crowd size matters. President Trump was crushing Hillary Clinton in number of rallies and number of participants at his rallies when compared to Clinton.Trump did won in an electoral landslide. Nevertheless, the numbers at the rallies were significantly different between the two candidates and the one with the larger number of participants won the election.The media remained silent on the crowd size numbers when it was clear that Trump was crushing Hillary in this area. But late last week the media finally reported that crowd size does matter. CNN (Fake News) reported that President Trump s crowd size was much smaller than President Obama s crowd size in 2009, and CNN provided two pictures to show the difference.However, the pictures in the article show the crowd size for Obama when he was speaking during his 2009 inauguration with the crowd from Trump s inauguration approximately 3 hours before Trump spoke.CNN s report was another of their  Fake News  lies. The photos used in their post were not comparing apples to apples and President Trump s Press Secretary pointed this out on Saturday in a special press conference. Trump s crowd was huge and every bit as big as Obama s crowd in 2009. Also, in CNN s article they say that Obama had 1.8 million people in 2009. This is now refuted and is more likely closer to 800,000.The mainstream media is trying to create a narrative that Donald Trump s inauguration was a failure by comparing it to Obama s first inauguration and saying that twice as many people showed up to his inauguration that attended Trump s inauguration.In order to better compare both inaugurations, let s take a look at the facts and let s also look at the events surrounding both inaugurations.Crowd Counting Guru Stephen Doig has come forward to offer his insights into the crowd sizes at both inaugurations.From Fast Company:Satellites will by flying over Trump s inauguration, as they did in 2009. Journalism professor Stephen Doig, one of the gurus of crowd counting, used an image from satellite company GeoEye to estimate a crowd of 800,000 people for Obama s first Inauguration. Official estimates for the event, though, were over twice as high, at 1.8 million, which may actually be impossible, say researchers. DDIS modeled how big a very tightly packed crowd of a million people would stretch back from the Capitol building along the Mall: It would extend across the Potomac River into Virginia.Attendance at Trump s inauguration is forecast to be up to 800,000, according to the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Task Force, which supports the ceremony. When final numbers come in, the 800,000 estimated for Trump may also prove wildly optimistic.Translation? The claims that Obama s first inauguration drew a crowd of 1.8 million people is fake news at best. It also means that the difference in crowd sizes is significantly smaller than what the mainstream media is reporting. According to the mainstream media Obama had over a million more people attend his inauguration than attended Trump s inauguration. While Obama s crowd was bigger, the reality is it was only bigger by a few hundred thousand people, it wasn t bigger by over a million people.Comparing Apples To Oranges There are two very important things to remember when comparing the crowd sizes.#1   The Weather Was DifferentWhile Barack Obama s first inauguration was slightly colder than Donald Trump s inauguration by roughly 10 F, Obama s inauguration was bright and sunny.Trump s inauguration was anything but bright and sunny, Trump s inauguration was cloudy and rainy.Weather plays a factor when people decide to attend an outdoor event.#2   Violent Liberals Attacked At Trump s InaugurationThis can t be overstated. When Barack Obama held his first inauguration, protesters didn t burn limo s, break windows at businesses, hit supporters, and police didn t have to use percussion grenades. All of these things transpired at Trump s Inauguration by violent and hypocritical liberals.More than 200 people were arrested for their violent acts at the Trump Inauguration.Watch here as a young female reporter is trapped in a doorway by anarchists protesting Trump s inauguration. This is a perfect example of why Trump supporters were afraid to go to DC for his inauguration:A simple google search for  how many people arrested at Obama s first inauguration  yielded no arrest numbers in the first few pages. Why is that? Because there were few if any at all.Trump supporters have been the victims of violent attacks by liberals around the country for many months, people were calling for Trump to be assassinated.Without question many people were seriously concerned for their safety with these liberals showing up to cause violence. The entire week leading up to the inauguration was filled with warnings that police were expecting a rowdy crowd of protesters.It is easy to draw the conclusion that many people most likely didn t attend for the simple fact they were concerned about a potential attack taking place.  GPIt s pretty clear that Trump had at least as many participants at his inauguration as Obama did in 2009, and very possible that Trump had even more. ",0

In order to eliminate perceived political bias associated with national news outlets, the Valparaiso Family YMCA will only be showing local news channels in the future,  the Valparaiso YMCA said in a statement.Chicago Tribune reporter/columnist Jerry Davich said he asked Valparaiso YMCA CEO Robert Wanek to elaborate on why the decision was made, and Wanek responded,  I cannot pinpoint the change origins, only to add that we get dozens of requests to change channels every day from numerous interest groups. We just want the Y to be a haven for wellness where people come together and have a sense of belonging, gain new relationships and achieve their personal goals,  Wanek added.  We will display local news moving forward. Davich complained that  the Y s decision to remove all national news outlets from its televisions says more about its leaders than its members.

He said he wondered if the company was  simply exercising its right to appease as many members as possible, or is the new Donald Trump-led America already flexing its muscles?

The DNC Chair will replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was fired (took the fall for Hillary) when it was discovered through leaks in the hacked DNC emails that she helped to rig the primary election against Bernie Sanders to ensure a Hillary win. For a brief period of time, Donna Brazile was the interim replacement for Wasserman-Schultz, until she was caught passing debate questions to Hillary in advance of the debate while working as a commentator at CNN.It seems that the DNC has had a string of bad luck when it comes to finding an honest person to run their party. But who needs honesty when you re a Democrat right? All you need is to be able to effectively pander to minorities right? I mean, it worked so well for Hillary after all Watch Sally Boynton Brown pander to the minorities in the crowd during a forum that gave candidates a chance to tell everyone why they believe they are the best candidate for the job. It appears she has a single agenda, to  shut white people up.  The funny thing is, there are two black candidates sitting behind her who don t seem to be impressed with her speech until she starts talking about  shutting white people down,  at which time you can see their demeanor change and smiles can be seen from ear to ear. 8 years ago, this would have been seen as a partisan and unnecessarily divisive speech.

However, effective Feb. 1, sheriff s officials will honor so-called immigration holds or  detainers  placed by federal authorities only when a suspect is booked into the Travis County Jail on charges of capital murder, aggravated sexual assault and  continuous smuggling of persons. Otherwise, federal agents must have a court order or arrest warrant signed by a judge for the jail to continue housing a person whose immigration status is in question, according to Hernandez s policy, which she released Friday. The public must be confident that local law enforcement is focused on local public safety, not on federal immigration enforcement.

The Obama administration s signature domestic programme, the Affordable Care Act, also fell victim to Mr Trump s move to unpick his predecessor s policies.In his fiery inauguration address on Friday, Mr Trump painted a bleak picture of America today   one exploited by foreign countries, burdened with lopsided alliances and failing to defend its borders. For many decades, we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidised the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military,  he said, blasting past policies. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. What s left behind, he said, is a dystopia of blighted inner cities and rusted-out factories  scattered like tombstones  across the land. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,  Mr Trump declared. From this day forward, it s going to be only America first  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.

One of the organizers of the march, Linda Sarsour is a Pro-Palestine Muslim activist.She also advocates for Sharia Law in America and has ties to terrorist organization, Hamas.Linda Sarsour, one of the organizers behind Saturday s Women s March, being held in Washington, D.C., was recently spotted at a large Muslim convention in Chicago posing for pictures with an accused financier for Hamas, the terrorist group.Sarsour, the head of the Arab American Association of New York and an Obama White House  Champion of Change,  was speaking at last month s 15th annual convention of the Muslim American Society and Islamic Circle of North America.While there, she posed for a picture with Salah Sarsour, a member of the Islamic Society of Milwaukee and former Hamas operative who was jailed in Israel in the 1990s because of his alleged work for the terrorist group.Though she avoids discussing it now, Sarsour has acknowledged in past interviews that she has cousins serving prison time in Israel because of their work for Hamas.Sarsour has denied having any contact with the terror group. She told The New York Times in 2012 that she would not have been appointed an Obama  Champion of Change  if she had.The activist has risen to national attention recently. She served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and she is one of four lead organizers for the Women s March.  Daily CallerThe fact that an Islamic faction was one of the organizers of the Women s March is laughable at best. Islam is responsible for the worst abuses of women and children not only throughout history, but at present day. Islamic supremacists who wish to impose Sharia law in America have infiltrated various leftist movements in order to appear as an oppressed minority.  GP ",0

11827,LOL! Lifetime Politician Who Got 2% Support From Voters In GOP Primaries Tells CBS: “I don’t know what ‘America First’ Means” [VIDEO],"Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican was unable to differentiate himself from other GOP Presidential candidates and in August 2015, national polls said that 13 percent of Republican or leans-Republican voters said they d never vote for him. Zero percent said they would vote for him.Even  someone else  polled at 1 percent (cue the joke about how hard it would be to find someone else who isn t already in the race). The highest Graham polled nationally was at 2 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.Yet this morning, on CBS s  Face the Nation,  while discussing President Donald Trump s inaugural address calling for his policy to be informed by putting  America first,  Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R-SC) said,  I don t know what America first means. Graham said,  To the president, if America first is a throwback to the 20 sand 30 s isolationism when it was first used as a phrase, the world would deteriorate even quicker, if it is a new way of Ronald Reagan s peace through strength I would like to work with him. I don t know what America first means.   Breitbart",0

11830,BOOM! FOX NEWS LEFTIST CHRIS WALLACE Attempts Trump Smear Over Inauguration Crowd Size…FOX News’ Brit Hume Backs Up Trump On Fake News Story [VIDEO],"The AP, CNN, People Magazine and other mainstream media, fake news outlets used pictures of the crowds at Obama s inauguration to compare to the crowd s at Trump s inauguration. The only problem is, the picture they used for Trump s inauguration crowd was taken before Trump s actual speech, where the crowds were much larger.Of course, there was never a comparison between Obama and George W. Bush s inauguration crowds, because instead of the full-blown media assassination attempt we see against President Trump, the post-inauguration media coverage was more like an all out effort to canonize Barack Obama by our sycophant media.The media completely ignored the fact that threats of violence were being made by Soros funded groups against Trump supporters since the day after the election. They ignored the open threats made against anyone who dared to attend Trump s inauguration.Anti-Trump rioters made good on their threats. They used human chains to lock visitors out of certain areas including check points where Trump supporters had to pass through in order to get to the inauguration and to the parade.Watch this husband and wife, as they are split up by human barricades. The husband manages to break through the barricade but the wife is trapped and unable to join him. (Does anyone remember seeing this on the news?):#Trump supporter gets past #DisruptJ20 barricade but couldn't get back to his wife #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/JFHOcgcT9c  Alex Rubinstein (@RealAlexRubi) January 20, 2017Fires were started everywhere on the streets. Rioters wearing black ski masks and carrying sledge hammers they used to bust out windows of banks and vehicles were roaming the streets as well.None of these threats existed prior to or during Obama s inauguration. It s pretty safe to say that angry Democrats and anarchists roaming the streets looking for trouble didn t make for the most family friendly environment. Many Trump supporters admitted they wouldn t attend the inauguration because they feared violence against them and their children. But the media just glossed over the fear factor created by the Left, and chalked it up to Trump s sudden (according to fake polls)  unpopularity. Here are the propaganda photos used by the media to discredit Trump.Comparing the crowds at Donald Trump s and Barack Obama s inaugurations https://t.co/YysDewDB9N pic.twitter.com/myrXutzMpH  NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) January 21, 2017For the record, here is an actual picture that was taken during Trump s inaugural speech. The mall appears to be jam packed with Trump supporters:Chris Wallace jumped on the mainstream media train this morning and attempted to discredit Trump and his Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Chris Wallace asked to have the picture comparing Trump and Obama s crowds up on the screen for the viewers to see before confronting  Reince Priebus. Priebus responded,  You re also not saying that that picture was taken before he even began speaking.  Chris Wallace freaks, and asks to have the picture put back up again (which of course doesn t change what Priebus just said).Watch:Fox News  Senior Political Analyst, who also attended the inauguration, tells a much different story than the one Wallace was trying to paint. Perhaps Wallace should have consulted with Hume, since they both work for the same network. Perhaps he should have asked about how the violent protesters affected the number of people who were actually able to make it to the inauguration. To be sure, Brit Hume was no cheerleader for Donald Trump leading up to the election, but at least he had the integrity to tell the truth about the deceitful media s attempt to prove Trump supporters have somehow magically deserted him.I was in the building at the bottom of picture on right yesterday. Shot was taken early, area was considerably fuller by time of speech. https://t.co/bzhWjm4alC  Brit Hume (@brithume) January 22, 2017Brit Hume is also one of the only journalists to point out the seriousness of these violent rioters and says they need to be held responsible for the damage they did to other people s property:""Property damage is not violence""  > Protesters who destroyed property on Inaug.

We have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. Radical Islamic terrorism, it has to be eradicated,  said Trump, on his first full day in the White House and his first official agency stop of his presidency.Trump s decision to travel to CIA headquarters so quickly after taking office was seen as an attempt at a fresh start with the intelligence agencies he will now rely on for guidance as he makes weighty national security decisions. Following his private meeting with top CIA leaders, Trump said the U.S. had been  restrained  in its efforts to combat terrorism, calling the threat  a level of evil we haven t seen.

11837,TRUMP BLASTS MEDIA For LYING About Bust Of MLK JR Being Removed From Oval Office…Brings One Very Important Bust BACK Into The Oval Office,"President Donald Trump didn t take long to put his stamp on the Oval Office, reinstalling a bust of Winston Churchill that had gotten the boot under President Obama.The Churchill bust was on view as Trump took some of his first actions as president, signing executive orders and a waiver to let generals serve in his cabinet despite prohibitions on ex-military tenure.There was a transatlantic flap when Obama removed the Churchill bust in 2009. The White House at first denied it had been removed, but it was later confirmed that it had been returned to the British Embassy.Reporters allowed into the Oval Office for the document signings observed the change.Obama defended the removal on a trip to the United Kingdom.  I love Winston Churchill, I love the guy,  Obama said at a press conference in London with then-Prime Minister David Cameron. Then-London mayor Boris Johnson, now foreign secretary, attributed the removal to Obama s  ancestral dislike of the British Empire  owing to his father s Kenyan heritage.During the initial flap, then-White House press secretary Dan Pfeiffer defiantly denied the charge, saying  The bust is still in the White House. In the Residence. Outside the Treaty Room.  In fact, that was another bust that had been a gift to President Lyndon Johnson.The new Trump press shop didn t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night.The Sun reported that when Johnson visited Trump tower and met with Trump advisors Steven Bannon and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, they asked for the bust to be returned. The Prime Minister is happy to loan the Churchill bust to the White House and will be delighted to view it on display when she visits this Spring,  a spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May told the paper.   Daily MailYesterday, TIME reporter Zeke Miller erroneously reported that Trump removed the MLK Jr bust from the Oval Office. He was called out for lying by President Trump s Press Secretary Sean Spicer and was forced to apologize:Here s the tweet from Trump s outspoken Press Secretary Sean Spice:Thanks to White House Chief of Staff for this wonderful picture of the MLK bust in the oval pic.twitter.com/Lzgj6RljvI  Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) January 21, 2017 ",0
11838,TRUMP PROMISED TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST AND D.C. TREMBLED: “Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs” [VIDEO]," This wasn t a smooth-talking politician inviting us to climb aboard his fancy word ship for a voyage beyond the stars. He did not call upon the angels. Instead, he spoke in dark tones to the forgotten man. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,  Trump said.  Everyone is listening to you now. He began by punching the elites right in the mouth   the bipartisan Washington establishment sitting up there with him. For too long, a small group in our nation s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,  Trump said.Trump s campaign was nothing if not audacious, but to see him say such things in front of the Capitol, right to the establishment s face as those sitting behind him wore those tight smiles, was beyond audacious. It was Jacksonian.You could feel Washington trembling. But you could also feel the establishment wise men   like Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the K Street boys who buy them all with campaign checks, Democrats and Republicans   smirking and telling themselves a Washington truth:Fresh presidents talk a lot about change, and finally, when they re not fresh anymore, the presidents leave town, humbled, while the insiders remain.It was that beginning that was astonishing, his declaration of war on the establishment, especially as they all sat there with him, with former Presidents Carter and Bush and Clinton and Obama looking on, outgoing first lady Michelle Obama frowning, Hillary Clinton icy and distant.Bush bobbed his head and smiled as if in pain. Bill Clinton s eyes were two frozen blue grapes, locked in a thousand-yard stare. But what he was looking at inside his own head, I wouldn t ever want to know. We ve defended other nations  borders while refusing to defend our own,  Trump said,  and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.   The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. The Bush Republicans and neoconservatives and European elites won t like his  America First  message one bit.Predictably, the left hated his speech. They love the working-class hero in the abstract, unless working-class heroes dare to support Trump. Then the left mocks them. The culture clash between liberal commentators and Trump voters has gotten so petty that I ve even seen Trump voters mocked as fools for spelling mistakes.They re not fools. They re not deplorable. They re hardworking Americans, people who sent their children to our wars, people who were pushed aside by our politics, slapped down by our economy and abused by Democrats, Republicans and the very elites who formed the establishment.They were once the forgotten. But now their guy is president of the United States.For entire story: Chicago TribuneWatch Trump s full inauguration speech here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcfrbB9hpoI ",0

The two couples exchanged pleasantries, before the Obamas boarded the helicopter for the quick hop to Joint Base Andrews, where daughters Malia and Sasha awaited along with the Air Force jet that, for the next four years, will only be known as Air Force One when Trump is on board.Barack Obama addressed the crowd after their arrival at Andrews, and joked that  Michelle and I, we ve really been milking this goodbye thing, so it behooves me to be very brief. He then circled back to his campaign message of hope:  Throughout it was infused with a sense of hope   It wasn t blind optimism that drove you to do all this work, it wasn t naivet    it was hope in the face of difficulty. It was hope in the face of uncertainty. This is just a little pit stop. This is not a period, this is a comma. In the continuing story of building America,  he added later.Via: People",0

The  wizard  is now being held in a Miami-Dade County jail after using Twitter to threaten Trump s life.Trump is scheduled to be sworn in Friday in Washington, D.C. as Puopolo remains incarcerated on a charge of threatening to harm a public servant.Puopolo reportedly admitted to posting a video to Twitter, saying:  This is the 16th of January 2017, I will be at the review/ inauguration and I will kill President Trump, President elect Trump today. He was nabbed after leaving a Washington Avenue Subway sandwich shop about 4 p.m. Tuesday.Puopolo, however, may not be the average Trump hater. On various social media platforms, where he posts as JesusChrist1701, the computer consultant claims to have testified in terror cases as an expert witness in a German federal court in Hamburg from 2003 to 2008.He also says he served in the Navy.He once posted a photo of himself holding an image of his mother in front of a wall that sports a picture of him with Colin Powell and a famous shot of Ronald Reagan.Puopolo has published a number of pictures of outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry, whom he calls a friend.

11873,N. DAKOTA LEGISLATOR Proposes Bill To PROTECT MOTORISTS If They Hit Pipeline Protesters Intentionally Blocking Roads,"Protesters who take to the streets in North Dakota might want to look both ways for changes in the rules of the road.A bill sponsored by state Rep. Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, would protect drivers from legal consequences if they inadvertently hit, injure or kill pedestrians who are obstructing traffic.The legislation is a direct response to the massive protests around the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, Kempenich said. The ongoing protests have shut down a nearby highway for months and stalled construction of a pipeline that would carry crude from the North Dakota oil patch. If you stay off the roadway, this would never be an issue,  Kempenich said.  Those motorists are going about the lawful, legal exercise of their right to drive down the road.   Those people didn t ask to be in this. The legislation has drawn withering criticism from Standing Rock supporters, who worry that it could be open season for protesters on North Dakota roads.Kempenich said he wants to shift the blame for a crash from drivers to the people who choose to protest in traffic. The legislation, he said, would not protect someone who deliberately tries to run down a protester, and it would not let drivers off the hook if they hit a jaywalker or a child chasing a ball into the street. This bill puts the onus on somebody who s made a conscious decision to put themselves in harm s way,  he said.  You can protest all you want, but you can t protest up on a roadway. It s dangerous for everybody.    Star TribuneHighways shouldn t be used as staging areas for protests, Kempenich said.  They re intentionally putting themselves in danger,  he said, adding that accidents could result.Blocking roads or highways has also been a tactic adopted on occasion by protesters in other movements, such as Black Lives Matter.A spokeswoman for the pipeline protests said she is concerned the bill, if passed, would give careless drivers a free pass to kill or maim people who are exercising their free speech rights. It is basically giving permission for vehicular homicide, and that is wrong,  said Joye Braun, an organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network.  Nobody has the right to take the life of another person. The network is an activist group that opposes the pipeline, which would carry Bakken crude oil across the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Protesters say the pipeline s path crosses sacred land and could endanger the tribe s source of drinking water.Braun said she once was struck by a woman who objected to her video-recording a protest outside a fast-food restaurant in Mandan, and she worries the bill would embolden people to harm pipeline protesters. I believe there is a small element who may use this as an excuse to attack people,  Braun said.The proposal has attracted some national attention. Robert Reich, a former U.S. labor secretary and liberal commentator, has criticized the bill.-Inforum",0

11876,"VIETNAM VET, MILITARY “Lifer” DESTROYS Crybaby Democrats In Scathing Letter: “I sometimes wonder if I’ll get to heaven, but if I go to hell, I’m sure I’ll still be a few hundred floors above that bastard…”","A powerful letter from a  lifer  in the military:Because I am a  lifer  in the military, I ve seen the impact of a president more than many of you can imagine. I enlisted with LBJ and saw just what a Democrat clusterflock was all about. I went to Vietnam and saw how we were constantly and incessantly bombarded with micromanagement from Washington that got thousands of military people killed. I sometimes wonder if I ll get to heaven, but if I go to hell, I m sure I ll still be a few hundred floors above that bastard Robert McNamara , LBJ, John Kerry, Jane Fonda, and yes, even the  hero  John McCain.After Johnson  abdicated  rather than having his ass waxed, I lived through Nixon who was hawkish but allowed the generals (and there WERE a few real generals back then versus now) run the show. He was so out of touch that he never knew North Vietnam was about to surrender when the Paris Accord was presented.Only God could help us after Gerald Ford was beaten by Jimmy Peanuts who d been funded by Saudi money. The military was turned into Section 8 and even the Whitehouse suffered the austerity. Then the light began to shine and Ronald Reagan swept into the fray. He not only loved the country and the military, they loved him back. Esprit d corps was off the scale during his presidency. The Liberals were slowly turning into socialists, however, and about this time all the draft dodgers of the 1960 s who d been given amnesty by Jimmy Peanuts were turning out college graduates with degrees in socialism. Bush 1 was an enigma from the CIA and though he never did much either way, he NEVER DID MUCH EITHER WAY.Welcome to Bill Clinton. Clinton spent most of his two terms wagging the dog and creating the Oral Office, sending a bomber to blow up Quaddafi s tent and killing a goat or two, while allowing the UN to set up the infamous Black Hawk Down situation. He made history by becoming only the second president to be impeached.I actually felt sorry for Bush 2. He was doomed to infamy from the start. He thought most of America was still the rah rah patriots of WWII when they were simply socialists waiting to feed him to the sharks. Then there came the Manchurian Candidate with a faked (OK Democrats, let s say  of questionable origin  to assuage your PC brains) birth certificate, who d gotten a free ride through college under a foreign student exemption, and whose college records and complete life history had been sealed. (We know more about Thomas Jefferson s bastard children than we do about Obama, Michelle, OR their two kids.) From his inaugural address, he slandered America and within days had begun to encourage dissention of the races as well as slandering police who  acted stupidly.  That was mild to the crap that would come in doubling the national debt from what had been built by ALL THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS COMBINED, feeding us bullspit about how Muslims built this country, and nationalizing American industries. Fueled by George Soros  money and using the Air Force fleet as his personal charters, he appointed malcontents and traitors into positions of authority. He trashed the Constitution by installing  czars  (interesting he chose a title like that) to bypass Congressional authority. By that time, Congress was completely corrupt on both sides of the aisle. No one had balls to impeach this charlatan. Mysteriously, the lone outspoken conservative Supreme Court Justice suddenly dies in his sleep at an Obama pal s hunting lodge and the Supreme Court is evenly split. Finally, Congress shows some balls and rejects Obama s nomination. The Libtards aren t worried because the fix is in. Soros has paid demonstrators to cause turmoil at all the Republican gatherings, Obama concedes that illegal aliens should vote as they won t be prosecuted, and Soros-manufactured voting machines are caught switching votes in certain precincts. Hillary has cheated her way to the nomination and her lies are completely ignored by the brainwashed minions of sycophants who follow her. But a shocking thing happened on the way to the forum.Middle America had had enough and although the pollsters and the pipers tried to convince them not even to bother to vote, they were fed up with the denizens of the swamp. It was time. Florida was designated a  swing  state ignoring that all those old retirees living in St. Petersburg, and the fed up Cuban Americans of Miami weren t interested in their platform. Ohio and Pennsylvania, where coal production was blacklisted and where Obama had ridiculed them for  clinging to their Bibles and their guns,  lay awaiting this supposed  landslide  Hillary vote and creamed it.The Socialist world of the Democratic Party disintegrated. An American who expressed unbridled love of country and respect for police, firemen, and military steamrolled across the heartland and the liberals realized their scheme was trashed. A CONSTITUTIONALIST would be nominated to the Supreme Court and if the hag who d claimed to retire if Trump were elected would actually leave, the Supreme Court would have a massive majority of CONSTITUTIONALISTS for the next 40-50 years.Now, the same party who d ridiculed Trump on his comments about the election being rigged, started screaming that the election was rigged. They even advocated having the election repeated. They created mobs that burned and pillaged, stopped traffic, threatened murder, battery and rape of Trump supporters, and became the anarchists that the socialist dream thrives upon. They run like castrated pigs for safe zones and use diaper pins as their national symbol.This is exactly what happens when political correctness takes over and participation trophies are awarded to everyone. They can t conceive how disgusting and subservient they have become. Donald Trump may NOT be the best person for the job, but he s such a welcome respite from the candy-assed whimps who ve been running the swamp that it s refreshing to see. At the very least, Donald Trump derailed the Socialist train and bought us precious time. If he only does half of what he s promised, we ll still be legions ahead of where Obama has dragged us. Already countries who held us in contempt are lining up to be found in the favor of America.So for you liberal lurkers and you half-assed fence-sitters, kiss off. You had your big hurrah and now your party is over. For you staunch Republicans in office, don t gloat so much yourselves. You ve been put on notice by the American people that we re fed up with ALL YOU BASTARDS and if you don t start putting America first, you do so at your own peril. You might want to buy a copy of George McGovern s autobiography and see how shocking and humbling it can be for a professional politician to have to try to find legitimate work once he falls from grace. This election was pure, unadulterated AMERICAN. Hillary got beaten and AMERICA WON THE ELECTION.

O Reilly recalled how college president Dr. Billy Hawkins  appearance last week on the  O Reilly Factor  was not intended as a fundraising announcement, but that subsequent guest Omarosa Manigault mentioned the GoFundMe account.Hawkins has since received threats and derogatory comments for standing firm on sending his students to the District of Columbia.Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer added that the nationwide response to the appeal by Talladega is what Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and Inauguration Day, is all about.   FOXThe haters came out on social media and made outrageous statements like the one below:The sons of two deceased Talladega graduates posted on Facebook that they are returning their parents  diplomas in opposition to the school s decision to march. Both of our parents have passed away since receiving this cherished recognition from the College. But we have no doubt that they would be angered and deeply disappointed if they knew of the plans for Talladega College to pay tribute to Donald Trump by participating in his inaugural,  Peter, David and Steven Rasmussen wrote.  Mr. Trump has demonstrated in innumerable ways, during the electoral campaign and his time as president-elect, that he is the antithesis of all they worked and stood for and of the values they nurtured in their students.

That s why people who look like me have a hard time understanding why so many black people are still angry while others have given up on America altogether.I ll let Ta-Nehisi Coates boil it down for you. White society was not achieved through  wine tastings and ice cream socials, but rather through the pillaging of life, liberty, labor and land.  In short, through three centuries of kidnapping, torture, murder and rape. Broken teeth, broken bones and broken spirits. Families ripped apart. Children taken from their parents. Men humiliated in front of their wives. Women brutalized within earshot of their husbands. Lash after bloody lash on bare backs. Then, sleep on a bare wooden floor. No doctor, no dentist, no nothing. Just non-stop misery with a few hymns on Sunday.We built an entire society on these bruised and broken backs. That and countless Native Americans driven off their land. Then, after the house of horrors fell, and the sin was purged by the blood of more than a half-million young mostly white men, white America still did not relent. Despite passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, states found ways to disenfranchise blacks. We took back the vote, cordoned blacks off in the most undesirable parts of our cities, forced them into inferior schools and denied them opportunities. Few blacks owned their homes. Many could not read and write. Thousands were lynched. That s Southern for murdered without a trial.

Bush’s Inauguration [VIDEO],"It s a free country, and the nineteen (and counting) members of Congress who are planning to boycott President-elect Trump s inauguration are certainly within their rights. So even is Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who said over the weekend that Trump s election (or his presidency) is  illegitimate. That doesn t make his comment true or honorable or helpful to the nation s well-being, but he is free to say it.Reps. Lewis, Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and the other inaugural boycotters are certainly not alone in finding Trump uniquely awful. They are not alone in believing the president-elect has gone out of his way to offend people. Probably they also recognize that, in the safe districts they all represent, an inaugural boycott might even be a political winner.But this is also part of a pattern. Lewis and Lee, along with some other Democratic lawmakers at the time, also boycotted to make a point when President George W. Bush was inaugurated in 2001. The Washington Post reported at the time that Lewis  thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush s swearing-in because he doesn t believe Bush is the true elected president. Maybe they had a better excuse that time, as there was so much lingering acrimony surrounding the Florida recount. But we re talking about elected members of Congress who have refused to accept two Republican presidencies in a row. Is there always a good enough excuse whenever a Republican wins?

Nothing in Washington, D.C. is 100 percent, but I do believe there is a high probability that it happens. Republicans across the spectrum of conservatism, from moderates to far right members, are now lined up and prepared to support that bill and strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding.That commitment that is not new to Capitol Hill, where Republicans have pushed since 2015 to defund the organization in response to secretly recorded videos of abortion doctors discussing the use of fetal tissue, which were deceptively edited. House Republicans passed a defunding bill in 2015, but the bill never got a vote in the Senate. -BuzzFeed (We only used the fake news site Buzzfeed as a source because it is part of the story, as it was included in Rep.

That group was formed by ex-employees after Creamer resigned in 1997 when the allegations first surfaced.Creamer worked for 22 years for the Illinois Public Action Fund and for the Citizens Action Center for Consumer Rights. The not-for-profit groups had been influential in pushing progressive causes such as campaign finance and health care reform.",0

She s a great girl. And we re protecting them well,  Trump told PEOPLE at a benefit honoring Australia director Baz Luhrman at the Museum of Modern Art Monday night.  They are very safe. PeopleIn 2008, Hudson performed  Let s Stay Together  for Barack and Michelle Obama during Obama s inauguration ball. It s not clear if Obama and Michelle did anything to help her after her family was murdered.Two days ago, another  Dream Girls  star, Broadway sensation Jennifer Holliday, who had previously committed to performing at Trump s inauguration, backed out over bullying and threats she received from the Left.Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19, and she agreed, seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies.  I just thought of the history part of it, and about singing on the mall where Marian Anderson paved the way for me to sing as a black American,  she said, referring to a 1939 concert that Ms. Anderson, a popular singer, performed from the Lincoln Memorial after being denied permission to sing at Constitution Hall because she was black.Ms. Holliday said she had been startled and disheartened on Friday by the venom that greeted the news of her participation. It brought a lot of threats from people already saying I ll never work again,  she said.  If that s what America has come to, where we all hate and bully people, there s no more freedom of speech. She added,  I know everybody hates me now, but that shows we are all just hateful people now   we don t even want to work together. Ms. Holliday said she did not see herself, or her singing, as political, a sentiment echoed by Jackie Evancho, the 16-year-old classical-crossover singer who will perform the national anthem at Mr. Trump s inauguration on Jan. 20. I just kind of thought that this is for my country,  Ms. Evancho said.  So if people are going to hate on me it s for the wrong reason. Ms. Holliday said her goal is to support America:  Are we saying that if there is anything that could be done for America in four or eight years or however long Trump is there, we re not supposed to participate or help anybody?  she asked.  Shouldn t we all be praying for the success of America? I would like to sing some hope and have my voice not be associated with some kind of label, but I guess that s where we are now.   NYT s ",0

Instead of pursuing meaningful changes,  Al Sharpton and his liberal friends took the time to get rich,  the news release says.On Saturday morning, NBCI s president, Rev.

Another source put that number below 1,000. CPSAN is live-streaming the event, and its footage shows a sparse-looking crowd.Speaking at the March, Sharpton tried to ward off criticism about the low turnout.

Here s what kmov had to say about this new development: The office of a Democratic Missouri congressman says he intends to file a federal lawsuit over the removal of a constituent s painting from a display on Capitol Hill.The painting depicts protests in Ferguson, Missouri, that erupted after a police shooting of an unarmed black man.The painting depicts a pig in a police uniform pointing a gun at a protester.

Several congressmen, including Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) have, on separate occasions, removed the painting and returned it to Clay s office:FED UP GOP CONGRESSMAN Removes Cop-Hating Artwork Hung In U.S. Capitol By BLM Activist CongressmanBlack Caucus Chair Threatens Over  Cops are Pigs  Painting:  We may just have to kick somebody s ass and stop them  [Video]As it turns out, the painting is in violation of  Suitability Guidelines :THE RULES PROHIBIT ART THAT DEPICTS  subjects of contemporary political controversy or a sensationalistic or gruesome nature According to FOX News:Architect of the Capitol Stephen Ayers determined the painting violates the House Building Commission s rules and will be removed Tuesday after the federal holiday.Rep.

11911,MEDIA ATTACKS TAYLOR SWIFT Over Refusal To Criticize President-Elect Trump,"Tom Barnes mocks Taylor Swift in his latest article, as he writes:  One Instagram is the only evidence we have that Nashville elite Taylor Swift even knew there was an election taking place in 2016. Today is the day,  she wrote on Election Day.  Go out and VOTE. Today is the day. Go out and VOTE  A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 8, 2016 at 8:01am PSTSo thirsty was the public for hints of Swift s political affiliations, that even an innocent picture of a voting line, stirred up a frenzy.  Who is Taylor Swift voting for?  skyrocketed in search queries, proving at the end of the cycle to have been one of the most popular search terms of the entire election.Fans read deeply into the symbolism of Swift s outfit and posture. Others took it as an opportunity to try to bait her into the political arena, pointing out her hypocrisy of having once styled herself as an outspoken feminist, only to back down at this most crucial moment. Admittedly some of those commentators had a point. It s difficult to look away from the fact that one of the most staunchly anti-woman candidates gallivanted into Washington followed by scores sexual assault accusations in tow, and Swift just watched.It is wrong to exploit feminism in order to sell records but then stand idly by as a misogynist ravages the country. Just FYI  Casey Mink (@Casey_Mink) November 8, 2016Swift remains to this day one of the only major A-list celebrities who has not weighed in on the election. Lady Gaga comforted fans distraught by Trump s successful attempts to reduce rape culture to  locker talk.  Kesha, Madonna, Beyonc , Nicki Minaj and Adele all connected with their fan bases to explain why Hillary Clinton offered the best way forward. Katy Perry literally did not stop singing and speaking for Clinton for the entirety of 2016. In a Time op-ed alongside a handful of clickier stunts, Swift bestie Lena Dunham said her support for Clinton was about far more than just  anatomy  or  girl power  Scores of artists have outright shamed the presidential inauguration committee for even asking to perform.Given her election silence, Swift has undoubtedly been approached, but her team has yet to offer a comment.A carefully chosen word of warning about the effect a successful Trump bid on normalizing misogyny or discrimination would have made for a natural extension of Swift s past desires to increase the level of public discourse around feminism. One could say the election is just another  narrative  she  never asked to be a part of,  and they would be correct. But if you re Swift, why not speak up? For every time she made sure that the word  feminism  was as close to her name in headlines, it feels odd she would pass on a lay-up as easy as helping clarify what  locker room talk  actually means. A close look at the fans she needs to please helps explain the silence. She caters to a white audience that used to be country and then crossed over into pop,  Ani Johnson, associate professor of Music Business at Berklee College of Music and international lecturer and consultant in music licensing, marketing and strategic startups, said in an email.  She has to  stay sweet,   stay demure    the perfect picture of the blond, blue-eyed, true blue, young American girl. She can t afford to speak up and lose sales from her red state, Republican base. It s clear to Johnson what that base wants:  a pretty girl who sings about love and has  effectively  nothing in her head.   Music.MicMeryl Streep s acceptance speech at the Golden Globes Award ceremony really backfired on her when conservatives in social media, and even some on the Left, were taken aback by her petulant attack on our President-elect Donald Trump.  Streep really gave her viewers an opportunity to see her mean, bully streak when she stood on the stage, and without any credible evidence to back it up, accused Trump of being a racist and demeaning a disabled reporter. Both of those claims are false, but who the hell needs facts when you re an Academy Award winning actress and can PRETEND they re true?The Left s obsession didn t start with Meryl Streep. As a matter of fact, some of the worst activists who mocked, lied and falsely accused Donald Trump of horrible things, were some of Taylor Swift s best friends.Hillary Clinton sycophant Lena Dunham, who admitted to sexually abusing her younger sister and lied to the world about being raped, likes to call Taylor Swift her  best friend.  She also promised to leave the country if Trump was elected. Unfortunately, she s still here. Her promise to leave the country was as honest as her manufactured claims about Donald Trump being a misogynist.Donald Trump hit back when Lena Dunham (along with a long list of  celebrities ) said she d leave the US if Trump won the election:Gigi Hadid can be seen frequently hanging out with Taylor Swift on Instagram and in the tabloids. Here s one of Swift s many photos with Hadid on her Instagram account:A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Apr 29, 2016 at 1:25am PDTKudos to Taylor Swift for sticking to performing, and staying out of the fray when it comes to President-elect Trump; even when it means she will be harshly criticized by the people in her business for not jumping on the  Hate-Trump  bandwagon.

11918,"WOW! Christian Author Gives UNEXPECTED And BRILLIANT Answer To Muslim Law Student Who Claims She’s Worried, “We Portray Islam And All Muslims As Bad” [VIDEO]","Brigitte Gabriel was born in the Marjeyoun District of Lebanon to a Maronite Christian couple, a first and only child after over twenty years of marriage. She recalls that during the Lebanese Civil War, Islamic militants launched an assault on a Lebanese military base near her family s house and destroyed her home. Gabriel, who was ten years old at the time, was injured by shrapnel in the attack. She says that she and her parents were forced to live underground in all that remained, an 8-by-10-foot (2.4 by 3.0 m) bomb shelter for seven years, with only a small kerosene heater, no sanitary systems, no electricity or running water, and little food. She says she had to crawl in a roadside ditch to a spring for water to evade Muslim snipers.According to Gabriel, at one point in the spring of 1978, a bomb explosion caused her and her parents to become trapped in the shelter for two days.They were eventually rescued by three Christian militia fighters.Brigitte Gabriel is now an American citizen, author, founder of ACT and a conservative lecturer. Gabriel attended a Benghazi Accountability Coalition forum that was supposed to be about Benghazi and how our government should be held responsible for their actions that led to the deaths of four Americans, but things took a dramatic turn when a Saba Ahmed, a Muslim law student in an America university stood up to defend the  majority of followers of Islam.  She told the panel,  We portray Islam and all Muslims as bad, but there are 1.8 billion followers of Islam. We have 8 million plus Muslim Americans in this country and I don t see them represented here.  Gabriel answered her question from a historical perspective and knocked it out of the park! She gave an answer that Ahmed, who it turns out, is a Islamic activist who was also very active in Democratic politics at the time this event took place.Watch:",0
11919,OOPS! UKRAINE Caught Colluding With Democrats To Help Hillary Win Election…President Poroshenko Scrambling To Repair Damage With Trump,"Donald Trump wasn t the only presidential candidate whose campaign was boosted by officials of a former Soviet bloc country.Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found.A Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation.The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine s foe to the east, Russia. But they were far less concerted or centrally directed than Russia s alleged hacking and dissemination of Democratic emails.The Ukrainian antipathy for Trump s team   and alignment with Clinton s   can be traced back to late 2013. That s when the country s president, Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort had been advising, abruptly backed out of a European Union pact linked to anti-corruption reforms. Instead, Yanukovych entered into a multibillion-dollar bailout agreement with Russia, sparking protests across Ukraine and prompting Yanukovych to flee the country to Russia under Putin s protection.In the ensuing crisis, Russian troops moved into the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and Manafort dropped off the radar.Manafort s work for Yanukovych caught the attention of a veteran Democratic operative named Alexandra Chalupa, who had worked in the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Clinton administration. Chalupa went on to work as a staffer, then as a consultant, for Democratic National Committee. The DNC paid her $412,000 from 2004 to June 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records, though she also was paid by other clients during that time, including Democratic campaigns and the DNC s arm for engaging expatriate Democrats around the world.A daughter of Ukrainian immigrants who maintains strong ties to the Ukrainian-American diaspora and the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, Chalupa, a lawyer by training, in 2014 was doing pro bono work for another client interested in the Ukrainian crisis and began researching Manafort s role in Yanukovych s rise, as well as his ties to the pro-Russian oligarchs who funded Yanukovych s political party.In an interview this month, Chalupa told Politico she had developed a network of sources in Kiev and Washington, including investigative journalists, government officials and private intelligence operatives. While her consulting work at the DNC this past election cycle centered on mobilizing ethnic communities   including Ukrainian-Americans   she said that, when Trump s unlikely presidential campaign began surging in late 2015, she began focusing more on the research, and expanded it to include Trump s ties to Russia, as well.She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton s campaign, Chalupa said. In January 2016   months before Manafort had taken any role in Trump s campaign   Chalupa told a senior DNC official that, when it came to Trump s campaign,  I felt there was a Russia connection,  Chalupa recalled.  And that, if there was, that we can expect Paul Manafort to be involved in this election,  said Chalupa, who at the time also was warning leaders in the Ukrainian-American community that Manafort was  Putin s political brain for manipulating U.S. foreign policy and elections.   POLITICONow Ukraine President Poroshenko is scrambling to repair the damage:Russia s meddling has sparked outrage from the American body politic. The U.S. intelligence community undertook the rare move of publicizing its findings on the matter, and President Barack Obama took several steps to officially retaliate, while members of Congress continue pushing for more investigations into the hacking and a harder line against Russia, which was already viewed in Washington as America s leading foreign adversary.Ukraine, on the other hand, has traditionally enjoyed strong relations with U.S. administrations. Its officials worry that could change under Trump, whose team has privately expressed sentiments ranging from ambivalence to deep skepticism about Poroshenko s regime, while sounding unusually friendly notes about Putin s regime.Poroshenko is scrambling to alter that dynamic, recently signing a $50,000-a-month contract with a well-connected GOP-linked Washington lobbying firm to set up meetings with U.S. government officials  to strengthen U.S.-Ukrainian relations. Revelations about Ukraine s anti-Trump efforts could further set back those efforts. Things seem to be going from bad to worse for Ukraine,  said David A. Merkel, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who helped oversee U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine while working in George W. Bush s State Department and National Security Council.Merkel, who has served as an election observer in Ukrainian presidential elections dating back to 1993, noted there s some irony in Ukraine and Russia taking opposite sides in the 2016 presidential race, given that past Ukrainian elections were widely viewed in Washington s foreign policy community as proxy wars between the U.S. and Russia. Now, it seems that a U.S. election may have been seen as a surrogate battle by those in Kiev and Moscow,  Merkel said. Politico",0

11921,DRAIN OBAMA’S RADICAL SWAMP! Rep Chaffetz Calls Out OBAMA APPOINTED Fed Gov Ethics Director Over UNETHICAL Public Criticisms Of Trump,"IT S TIME TO DRAIN OBAMA S SWAMP! Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight Committee, criticized the director of the federal Office of Government Ethics on Thursday over his criticism of Donald Trump s plan to address conflicts of interest. And he threatened to subpoena the official, Walter Shaub, if he refuses to participate in an official interview. He seems to be acting prematurely at best, without doing investigations or thorough looks,  Chaffetz said in an interview.  He s rendering opinions publicly that really cause you to scratch your head. We need the Office of Government Ethics to act ethically. Ironically, that s not what they re doing. Shaub, an appointee of President Barack Obama, has been a frequent critics of the incoming administration s ethics plans, peaking Wednesday when he called Trump s newly unveiled conflicts of interest policy  meaningless. The public rebuke of Trump s business arrangements came during a press conference at the Brookings Institution that included the outspoken former White House ethics lawyers for Obama and former President George W. Bush. In his remarks, Shaub said the president-elect  stepping back from running his positions is meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective. The plan does not comport with the tradition of our presidents over the last 40 years,  he added.Chaffetz said Shaub has refused since the election to agree to a meeting to discuss matters related to OGE s public remarks about Trump, as well as the Republican-led panel s plans to pass language reauthorizing the office. If Shaub continues to resist, Chaffetz said he d issue a subpoena  if we have to. He is coming in. This is not going to be an optional exercise,  Chaffetz said, adding that he expected a meeting within a few weeks.Shaub s 5-year term expires in January 2018. We need a fair person behind the plate that s going to call balls and strikes,  Chaffetz said.  What they re supposed to do is help work with somebody to comply with the ethics requirements. But when you talk publicly about private conversations, that s not ethical. And when you refuse to come in and talk to the committee when you re doing reauthorization, when you start tweeting and issuing press statements on things you never looked at, that shouldn t be the case at all. This isn t Chaffetz s first time challenging Shaub. In late 2015, the Republican accused the Obama appointee of giving Hillary Clinton a pass on conflict-of-interest laws over speaking fees she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were supposed to disclose. But Chaffetz said he s grown more frustrated with Shaub since the November election and also singled out the OGE s use of its official Twitter account to issue a bizarre series of posts   in Trump s own staccato style   congratulating the president-elect for making major changes to his business arrangements.For entire story: POLITICO ",0

He (Steele) was compiling this report on behalf of initially Trump s opponent Jeb Bush,  the BBC said on Wednesday.

11926,"IS OBAMA PUNISHING Fiat-Chrysler For 2,000 US Jobs, $1 Billion US Investment Announcement? Fiat-Chrysler CEO Says EPA Allegations Are ‘Absolute Nonsense’ [VIDEO]","We don t know whether the charges against Fiat Chrysler by Obama s EPA are accurate or not. One thing we do know however, is that much like the announcement today that Obama s DOJ will be going after FBI Director James Comey,  the timing of this announcement by Obama s EPA is certainly suspicious. Only 4 days ago Fiat Chrysler US confirmed the next phase of its industrialization plan by announcing a total $1 billion investment in plants in Michigan and Ohio, and the addition of 2,000 new American jobs. Consistent and combined with previously announced investments, FCA US is further demonstrating its commitment to strengthening its U.S. manufacturing base, and aligning U.S. capacity to extend the Jeep  product lineup. In total, FCA US has committed investments of more than $9.6 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities and created 25,000 new jobs to date since 2009.Many were giving Trump credit for creating a more business, and specifically manufacturing friendly environment that seems to be created a tsunami of good news in the way of US manufacturing. The only down side, is that it s shining a pretty big spotlight on the failures of our current over-regulating, punitive administration that has made it almost if not entirely impossible to compete with other countries to manufacture here, in the US. With all the egg Obama and his regime seem to be getting on their faces over the past couple of months, is it really all that surprising that the EPA would make an announcement that would harm Fiat-Chrysler sales and their reputation on the way out the door? Detroit CBSlocal   Fiat Chrysler is denying government charges that some of its diesel vehicles violate federal clean air standards.CEO of Fiat Chrysler Sergio Marchionne saying the allegations are a surprise to him   calling it  absolute nonsense,  reports WWJ AutoBeat Reporter Jeff Gilbert. There was never any intent   of creating conditions that were designed to defeat the testing process,  he says.The comparison to the issues VW is facing regarding deceptive emissions testing is one Marchionne refuses to make.  Anyone who draws a parallel between us and VW   is smoking illegal material. The way in which it has been described I think is unfair to us and that s the thing that bothers me most. The U.S. government is accusing Fiat Chrysler of failing to disclose software in some of its pickups and SUVs with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act.EPA Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles saying emissions software on those vehicles were not disclosed.  Those software elements   not being disclosed in Fiat Chrysler s required application for certification means that the vehicles were sold illegally. The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday it had issued a  notice of violation  to the company that covers about 104,000 vehicles including the 2014 through 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups, all with 3-liter diesel engines. The California Air Resources Board took similar action.Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that its emissions control systems  meet the applicable requirements. The company said it was disappointed with the EPA s action and intends to work with the incoming Trump administration to present its case. Fiat Chrysler said it spent months giving information to the EPA to explain its emissions technology and proposed a number of actions including software changes to address the agency s concerns.Fiat Chrysler s shares fell more than 16 percent after the news was announced to $9.29.If the company is found guilty of this charge they could face huge penalties.Marchionne says the company will work with the new administration to show they are compliant with all EPA standardsBut of course Like a puppy that s been left home alone to run around the home all day, someone s gonna have a lot of cleaning up to do once the Chicago contingent moves out of DC ",0
11927,HERE’S WHY L.L. BEAN Is Being Boycotted By The Loony Lefties And What YOU Can Do About It!,"President-elect Donald Trump came to the defense of L.L. Bean Inc. on Thursday after a group called for the boycott of the outdoor clothing maker because a granddaughter of the founder supported his campaign for president. Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L. Bean for your great support and courage,  Mr. Trump tweeted.  People will support you even more now. Buy L.L. Bean. Ms. Bean, who is a member of L.L. Bean s board of directors, donated $60,000 to Making America Great Again LLC, a political-action committee created to support Mr. Trump s candidacy, according to website Open Secrets. That contribution appeared to exceed the $5,000 annual limit for individual contributions, opening up the PAC to possible punitive action, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The PAC has responded to the FEC that it is a super PAC that can raise unlimited amounts.Grab Your Wallet, the group behind the boycott, has a list of dozens companies that it is calling on consumers to shun for their support of the president-elect, including retailers who sell Trump-related products. L.L. Bean is one of about 30 companies listed on the group s website. It s certainly a testament to the strength and influence of the #GrabYourWallet movement that certain powerful people who disagree now feel compelled to tweet advertisements for the companies being boycotted,  Shannon Coulter, co-founder of the group, said in an email.In a Facebook post on Sunday, Shawn Gorman, L.L. Bean s chairman and a great-grandson of the company s founder, said Ms. Bean was one of 50-plus family members involved with the company, who  hold views and embrace causes across the political spectrum, just as our employees and customers do. Mr. Gorman added that no individual speaks for the company and that L.L. Bean, which is based in Freeport, Maine, doesn t endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions.Ms. Bean, who was a Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988 and 1992, told Fox News on Thursday that she had no intention of backing down.

Rand Paul (R.-KY), voted for the resolution. Paul criticized the budget resolution for not addressing the federal debt and for not having a companion replacement bill. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D.-CA), who is recovering from a scheduled medical procedure was absent from the chamber.As senators waited for their names to be called by the clerk, Paul approached the clerk s desk from side and whispered:  No. All Democrats and the two Independents who caucus with Democrats voted against the resolution.Soon after they voted, virtually all Republicans left the floor. Among the handful staying behind were Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R.-KY) and Majority Whip John Cornyn (R.-Texas), along with Sen. John R. Thune (R.-S.D.), Sen. Roy Blunt (R.-MO) in the front. McConnell sat quietly at his desk, but Cornyn stood tall in the well watching the votes come in.All of the Democrats did not respond with their names were called off and they sat glumly with their armed crossed or their chins resting on their hand. When the Republicans were done, led by Minority Leader Charles E.

Hmmm Republicans would have distanced themselves from anyone who even had the appearance of taking part in criminal activity that could be tied to their party, but true to form, the Democrat Party gives them front-row seats.  Just look who showed up in the front row at Obama s farewell speech none other that Democratic operative, felon and his wife, Democrat US House member, Jan Schakowsky.

They [the press] don t know how to deal with it, and he s making  em look like children. In this press conference today there was a man in the front row from CNN, a reporter in the front row, and he kept shouting at Trump like a little child. He demanded that Trump take his question. He started shouting at Trump while Trump was answering other questions, and Trump refused to take the question and looked at the him and said,  No, you re fake news.

11944,"SAY WHAT? Trump-Hater, RINO John McCain Admits HE Handed Smear Dossier Outlining Claims Of Kremlin Blackmail To FBI","Sworn Donald Trump enemy John McCain admitted Wednesday that he passed the dossier of claims of a Russian blackmail plot against the president-elect.The Arizona senator issued a public statement amid mounting questions of his exact role in the affair   and how a document riddled with errors and unverifiable claims came to be published.  Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,  he said. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue. But the 2008 Republican loser, who disowned his party s candidate weeks before the election, may have been far more intimately involved than that.The chain of how the document reached the FBI is not officially known.However Carl Bernstein, the Watergate reporter who contributed to the first story about its existence, published by CNN on Tuesday afternoon, suggested that McCain was handed it by a former British ambassador to Moscow. Arizona Senator who disowned Trump before election admits he handed document outlining claims of Kremlin blackmail to FBI Brief statement claims that he received it and gave it directly to FBI Director James Comey because he was  unable to make judgment about accuracy But Washington reporter Carl Bernstein says former British ambassador to Moscow handed it to McCain Ambassador has not been named   and author of report also gave to FBI agent he knew at its station in Rome months ago Report was apparently paid for first BY Republican enemies of Trump then by DemocratsBernstein told CNN:  It came from a former British MI6 agent who was hired from a political opposition research firm in Washington who was doing work about Donald Trump for both republican and democratic candidates opposed to Trump. They were looking at Trumps business ties, they saw some questionable things about Russians, about his businesses in Russia, they in turn hired this MI6 former investigator, he then came up with additional information from his Russian sources, he was very concerned by the implications of it, he then took it to an FBI colleague that he had known in his undercover work for years, he took it to this FBI man in Rome who turned it over to the bureau in Washington in August. And then, a former British ambassador to Russia independently was made aware of these findings and he took the information to John McCain   Senator John McCain of Arizona   in the period just after the election, and showed it to McCain   additional findings. McCain was sufficiently disturbed by what he read to take it to FBI director James Comey himself personally, they had a five minute meeting the two men, very little was said, McCain turned it over to him and is now awaiting what the FBI s response is to that information. The identity of the former British ambassador has not been disclosed.Only one former British ambassador to Moscow remains in UK government service, Sir Tim Barrow, who went on to be Foreign Office political director and is now Britain s ambassador to the European Union.The new information, which has not been independently verified, claims that Russian officials also gathered highly damaging information on Trump, but only released the details attacking Clinton through the WikiLeaks website.The Kremlin has denied all of the allegations, while Trump tweeted:  FAKE NEWS   A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT .Buzzfeed followed up a report by CNN which disclosed the existence of the explosive dossier, but only gave a brief outline of the contents.The 35-page document, which had been collated by a former British Secret Intelligence Service agent had initially been handed over to the FBI in August.Buzzfeed s Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith wrote an email to his staff shortly after publishing the document.Buzzfeed is one of the radical  publications  on the internet.

11951,REPORT: WHY HILLARY WONT’ ACCEPT Obama And Valerie Jarrett’s Invitation For Post-Inaugural Gathering To “Lay Groundwork For The Offensive Against Trump”,"Hillary Clinton has turned down repeated requests by Barack Obama to join him in a nationwide political movement that he plans to lead against the presidency of Donald Trump. Hillary s received two phone calls from Obama and several from Valerie [Jarrett],  said a source familiar with Hillary s conversations with the outgoing president and his chief political adviser.  They ve been urging Hillary to get on board their anti-Trump campaign. They invited her to a post-Inaugural Day gathering at the mansion the Obamas have rented in D.C., where they re going to lay the groundwork for the offensive against Trump,  the source added.  Among those on the invitation list: Donna Brazile, Nancy Pelosi, and James Carville. But Hillary told Obama and Valerie that she couldn t work it into her schedule. According to the source, Hillary doesn t have much faith in Obama s leadership of an anti-Trump crusade. Obama s proved time and again that he thinks only of himself, not of his fellow Democrats,  said the source.  He s been a lousy leader of the Democratic Party and, after eight years in the White House, he s left the party in shambles. There s yet another reason Hillary doesn t want to be associated with an Obama-led movement against Trump,  the source added. Trump has indicated he s willing to let bygones be bygones as far as Hillary s email scandal and her pay-to-play involvement with the Clinton Foundation. She doesn t see any upside to pissing off Donald as he moves into the White House.   Edward Klein",0

11953,BOOM! CLOCK BOY’S DAD LOSES Defamation Case In District Court: “The lawsuit filed by Clock Boy’s father is yet another example of Islamist law fare” [VIDEO],"It s hard to be famous for being a  victim  in an Arab Gulf state who settles their disputes in a Sharia Court of Law. Someone should have told  Clock Boy  that being a victim in a country where victims are plentiful isn t really that special. Unlike America, being accused of bringing a fake bomb to school in Qatar isn t likely a guarantee you ll land a visit with their King.Within days of demanding a total of $15 million from the City of Irving and the Irving Independent School District,  Clock Boy  Ahmed Mohamed announced in a long distance phone interview from Qatar, he is homesick and wants to come home to Texas now.It wasn t long before the Clock Boy and his father returned to Texas and were filing a defamation lawsuit. Well today they got some bad news A year earlier, Ahmed, then a 14-year-old freshman at an Irving, Texas, high school, was arrested, briefly detained by police, and suspended for three days after bringing to school a  cool clock  that looked like a briefcase bomb. Ahmed claimed to have  invented  the easily assembled clock, and that he had brought it to school to show it to his shop teacher.The incident led many to question the Mohamed family s motives. Newly appointed District Court Judge Maricela Moore dismissed the lawsuit following a nearly three-hour hearing on Monday, according to the American Freedom Law Center:Mohamed had sued Hanson and CSP for statements Hanson had made on Beck s program about the connection between the Clock Boy hoax bomb affair, the attendant media frenzy created in large part by his father Mohamed, civilization jihad, and the Counsel on American-Islamic Relations ( CAIR ), the Muslim Brotherhood-Hamas front group in the United States that promotes civilization jihad.Here s a clip from Hanson s interview with Glenn Beck:During the hearing, AFLC co-founder and senior counsel David Yerushalmi explained to Judge Moore that the purpose of the lawfare-driven lawsuit was to intimidate into silence those who might comment publicly on the connection between jihad, terrorism, sharia, and Islam. As such, Yerushalmi argued,  this case is a classic Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation or  SLAPP  case and should be dismissed. During the lengthy hearing, Judge Moore pressed Mohamed s lawyer, Fort Worth attorney Susan Hutchison, to provide any facts that would suggest that Hanson and the other defendants had said anything false or defamatory about Mohamed or his son during the television broadcasts. After spending a painfully embarrassing 15 minutes flipping through reams of paper, Mohamed s lawyer was unable to provide any such evidence.Upon leaving the courtroom, Yerushalmi made the following statement: This lawsuit filed by Clock Boy s father is yet another example of Islamist law fare, which is a component of the Muslim Brotherhood s civilization jihad.

The deployment is the culmination of a promised heavier armed troop presence in eastern Europe since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.The move was meant to reassure nervous NATO allies the United States was prepared to respond in the event of further Russian aggression in the region.The arrival of the 3,500-troop heavy brigade is part of Operation Atlantic Resolve. The Army has maintained troop deployments in the region for decades, but had allowed their numbers to lapse for months at a time as troops were rotated out of Europe without being replaced. Stars and Stripes reported the Pentagon plans to maintain the full deployment and immediately replace returning soldiers after their 9-month deployments are completed.The troops will meet in Poland and eventually will be deployed there, as well as Romania, Bulgaria, Germany and across the Baltics. Once there, they will engage in training exercises with NATO host nations.  UPI",0

11975,OBAMA FINALLY BUILDS BORDER WALL…But There’s One Problem…It’s ONLY For The Obama’s,"President Obama blasted Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in April, 2016 for his plan to bar immigrants in the U.S. from sending money back home to force Mexico to pay for a new border wall. Oh, no. It s Trump,  a smiling Obama said when he was asked about the 2016 candidate s latest comments.Obama called plan another shortsighted idea from Trump that could spark concern among world leaders.  I am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made,  Obama told reporters at the White House.Obama said Trump s border wall proposal could have  enormous  economic consequences for Mexico, which receives billions of dollars in payments that immigrants in the U.S. send home, and possibly touch off a major spat with an ally. The notion that we are going to track every Western Union bit of money that s being sent to Mexico   good luck with that,  Obama said.Obama s remarks came after The Washington Post published a two-page memo from Trump outlining how he would get Mexico to pay for his wall. Trump s memo outlines how he would cut off certain remittances   cash transfers from people in the United States to Mexico   unless Mexico s government offered $5 billion to $10 billion to pay for the wall.Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto has said he won t pay for Trump s wall and claimed the candidate has damaged U.S.-Mexico relations.The country s former president, Vicente Fox, slammed the proposal, saying,  I m not going to pay for that f ing wall. Meanwhile, TMZ reported that workers are busy building a large wall around Obama s new DC residence where he will be moving from the White House, that was coincidentally, also surrounded by a massive wall.Why is it that politicians like Obama and even Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who has a two-decade-long history of promoting open borders immigration policies, have no problem building a border fence for themselves and their family, even as they denies the American people those same protections.They re quick to criticize Trump and his supporters for wanting to build a wall on our southern border to keep foreign intruders and criminals out for the sake of our national security, yet have no problem erecting large walls around their personal residences to keep their own families safe ",0
11976,DECLASSIFIED US INTEL REPORT Used To Discredit Trump Is Huge Embarrassment…Evidence Was Compiled In 2012 After OBAMA’S Reelection,"A highly-anticipated declassified US intelligence report, aimed to prove that Russia supported Donald Trump, has turned out to be a huge embarrassment. The annex that contained factual material that was thought to provide evidence of RT influencing the American public was compiled in December 2012, right after the reelection of Barack Obama.The report focuses on television shows and interviews that took place four years before Trump was elected, and well before he was even a politician. In Annex A of the report, intelligence agencies claim that  Kremlin s TV Seeks To Influence Politics, Fuel Discontent in US.  Buried at the bottom of that page is a note stating,  This annex was originally published on 11 December 2012 by the Open Source Center, now the Open Source Enterprise. The report notes that two RT shows, Breaking the Set and Truthseeker, focused on criticism of US. The problem is, both of these shows were off air before the 2016 election season began.The report goes on to detail programming in 2012 about voting booth irregularities, which, again, would have been during Obama s campaign. Despite being an old report, the topic became largely relevant once again during the Democratic primaries when voters found themselves purged from voting rolls, and hundreds of thousands of ballots went uncounted.Perhaps most shocking of all, the dastardly RT network dared to host third party debates, as they were not allowed participation in the main debates.  In an effort to highlight the alleged  lack of democracy  in the United States, RT broadcast, hosted, and advertised third party candidate debates and ran reporting supportive of the political agenda of these candidates. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a sham.  Apparently, the intelligence communities do not agree that some of the people they serve may not fit perfectly into the two neat and tidy political boxes of Republicans and Democrats. The report states that the network aired a documentary on Occupy Wall Street, an obviously left-wing movement, in 2012. Again, this was the year Obama was elected, so perhaps the Russians actually won HIM the presidency. They presented evidence that Russian media often reports on infringements of civil liberties, police brutality, and drone use. While these issues are all popular topics of discussion in left-leaning media, RT s reporting in 2012 was clearly part of a long-running plot to elect Trump, right?If the report is true and RT the Almighty was swinging votes in 2012, the only beneficiary of the coverage was the now-outgoing president of the United States, who won a landslide victory over Republican Mitt Romney. Four years ago Trump was not thought of as a politician and it remains a mystery how RT s 2012 coverage could propel him. A mystery, that even a classified version of the report would have a hard time explaining.    Sputnik news ",0

While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS)  to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman. Holder was also present in Ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos. California lawmakers already are preparing for a legal brawl with the Donald Trump administration   and they ve got President Obama s former top attorney in their corner.Top state Democratic lawmakers announced Wednesday that former Attorney General Eric Holder has been tapped as outside counsel to advise the Legislature on potential challenges with the Trump government. He will lead a team from the Covington & Burling law firm, where he s been working since leaving the Obama administration in 2015. With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead,  California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le n and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement.  This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great. They said Holder and his team will advise  in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made. The statement did not specify which policies they anticipate will cause friction, though California s numerous sanctuary cities are likely to face challenges from an administration that has threatened to pull their federal funding.   FOX NewsSets forth articles of impeachment stating that Holder: (1) engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him in that position by refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 12, 2011, in connection with a congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); (2) failed to enforce multiple laws, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; (3) failed his oath of office by refusing to prosecute individuals involved in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal of unauthorized disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors; and (4) testified under oath before Congress on May 15, 2013, that he was neither involved in nor had heard of a potential prosecution of the press but later confirmed to the House Judiciary Committee in a letter dated June 19, 2013, that he approved of a search warrant on journalist James Rosen. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, De Le n suggested Holder s team will work on issues like immigration, climate change, the environment and voting rights. The unorthodox arrangement assigns to Holder s team some duties that normally would be handled by the state s top law enforcement official, the California attorney general. Gov. Jerry Brown has nominated Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra for that job.Holder was one of Obama s longest-serving and most controversial Cabinet members.He had a contentious relationship with congressional Republicans, who in 2012 voted to hold him in contempt of Congress for not turning over documents on the Fast and Furious  gun-walking  scandal.

11980,BREAKING: OBAMA Regime Announces Federal Takeover Of Elections [VIDEO],"In a stunning last minute power grab by the Obama administration with just 14 days left in his Presidency, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement this evening officially declaring state election systems to be  critical infrastructure.  The statement from DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson defines  election infrastructure  as  storage facilities, polling places, centralized vote tabulations locations, voter registration databases, voting machines  and all  other systems  to manage the election process so pretty much everything.I have reached this determination so that election infrastructure will, on a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for cybersecurity assistance and protections that the Department of Homeland Security provides to a range of private and public sector entities. By  election infrastructure,  we mean storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments. Given the vital role elections play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election infrastructure meet the definition of critical infrastructure, in fact and in law,  Johnson stated.  Particularly in these times, this designation is simply the right and obvious thing to do. The designation  allows for information to be withheld from the public when state, local and private partners meet to discuss election infrastructure security   potentially injecting secrecy into an election process that s traditionally and expressly a transparent process,  according to the AP. U.S. officials say such closed door conversations allow for frank discussion that would prevent bad actors from learning about vulnerabilities. DHS would also be able to grant security clearances when appropriate and provide more detailed threat information to states. The announcement of a federal takeover of the electoral process follows a report from several intelligence agencies also released Friday which purports the Russian government worked to influence the outcome of the 2016 US election.The AP reports several states in recent months opposed the move fearing  the designation would lead to increased federal regulation or oversight on the many decentralized and locally run voting systems across the country. At least one member of the US Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group, Georgia Secretary of State Brian P. Kemp, stated he opposed the measure claiming  more federal oversight could make systems more vulnerable and could make protected records more accessible,  the AP writes.Kemp reportedly called the move  a federal overreach into a sphere constitutionally reserved for the states  on a conference call with Johnson Thursday, and said the designation  smacks of partisan politics. Examples of election infrastructure include storage facilities, voter registration databases, voting locations, voting machines and other systems designed to manage the election process, the AP notes.  For entire story: InfowarsDecember 18, 2016   Georgia s secretary of state has claimed the Department of Homeland Security tried to breach his office s firewall and has issued a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson asking for an explanation.Brian Kemp issued a letter to Johnson on Thursday after the state s third-party cybersecurity provider detected an IP address from the agency s Southwest D.C. office trying to penetrate the state s firewall. According to the letter, the attempt was unsuccessful.And now, Channel 2 Investigative Reporter Aaron Diamond has learned two more states  election agencies have confirmed suspected cyberattacks linked to the same U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP address as last month s massive attack in Georgia.Watch here:Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp recently told Politico it is nothing more than an attempt to  subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security. During an earlier interview with the site Nextgov, Kemp warned:  The question remains whether the federal government will subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security.  Kemp told POLITICO he sees a  clear motivation from this White House  to expand federal control, citing Obama s health care law, the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation and the increased role of the Education Department in local schools.To some election officials, this sounds like the first stage of a more intrusive plan. I think it s kind of the nose under the tent,  said Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos, a Democrat.  What I think a lot of folks get concerned about [is] when the federal government says,  Well, look, we re not really interested in doing that, but we just want to give you this,  and then all of a sudden this leads to something else.  Meanwhile, Kemp continued on by noting that  this administration only has 15 days left in its term  and to make such a critical decision during the 11th hour  smacks of partisan politics. But we re sure it s nothing, Obama doesn t really strike us as the type to play the  partisan politics  game.  Zero Hedge",0

The guy went on,  Why is she on our flight? She should be flying private.  The guy had his kid in his arms as he went on the tirade. Ivanka ignored the guy and tried distracting her kids with crayons. JetBlue personnel escorted the unruly passenger off the flight.

If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight. Our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight. A passenger sitting in front of Trump entourage made it clear that he felt the flight crew made the right call. He said the irritated passenger could be seen visibly shaking. the secret service was on the plane but stayed out of the disturbance.The intolerant left proved yet again that they are unhinged losers!

11983,BOOM! Trump Drains Obama Swamp…Mandates All Ambassadors Vacate Positions “Without Exceptions” By Inauguration Day,"President-elect Donald J. Trump s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan, breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods.The mandate   issued  without exceptions,  according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23, diplomats who saw it said   threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain. In the past, administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow a handful of ambassadors, particularly those with school-age children, to remain in place for weeks or months.Mr. Trump, by contrast, has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements.  Political  ambassadors, many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president, almost always leave at the end of his term; ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts.A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations, said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date.   NYT s",0

11991,HE WAS SO CLOSE: We Were “Obamerica”…We Were More Tolerant…More Guilty…The End Of The 1st And 2nd Amendments Were Only A Clever Campaign Away…And Then America Woke Up,"Obama and his supporters loved talking about history. His victory was historic. They were on the right side of history. History was an inevitable arc that bent their way.The tidal force of demographics had made the old America irrelevant. Any progressive policy agenda was now possible because we were no longer America. We Were Obamerica. A hip, happening place full of smiling gay couples, Muslim women in hijab and transgender actors. We were all going to live in a New York City coffee house, work at Green Jobs and live in the post-national future.The past was gone. We were falling into the gorgeous wonderful future of dot com instant deliveries and outsourced everything. We would become more tolerant and guilty. The future was Amazon and Disney. It was hot and cold running social justice. The Bill of Rights was done. Ending the First and Second Amendments was just a clever campaign away. Narratives on news sites drove everything.Presidents were elected by Saturday Night Live skits. John Oliver, John Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Samantha Bee were our journalists. Safe spaces were everywhere and you better watch your micro-aggressions, buddy. No more coal would be mined. No more anything would be made.The end of men was here. The end of the dead white men of the literary canon. The end of white people. The end of binary gender and marriage. The end of reason. The end of art. The end of 2 + 2 equaling 4. This was Common Core time. It was time to pardon an endless line of drug dealers. To kill cops and praise criminals. To be forced to buy worthless health insurance for wealth redistribution to those who voted their way to wealth.This was Obama s America. And there was no going back. We were rushing through endless goal posts of social transformation. The military fell. Then the police. Now it looks as quaint as anything from the 50s, the 70s or the 80s. A brief moment of foolishness that already appears odd and awkward. And then one day nostalgic. It wasn t the future. It s already the past. It s history.Scalia died. Hillary Clinton was bound to win. And she would define the Supreme Court. Down-ticket races would give her a friendly Senate. And then perhaps even the House.But there is no right side of history. There is only the side we choose. The Obama era was permanent. It was history.Now it is history.Its shocking ascendancy has been paired with an equally shocking descent. The Obama era is done. It s gone. It s over. It was wiped from the pages of history in one night that left Congress and the White House in Republican hands.It would have been bad enough if Jeb Bush had succeeded Obama. That would have been inconvenient, but not a repudiation. Instead Obama s legacy was dashed to pieces. His frantic efforts to campaign for Hillary did no good. The public did not vocally reject him. What they did was even worse. They brushed past him. They sidelined him. They gave him passable approval ratings while dismissing his biggest accomplishments. They forgot him. They made it clear that he did not matter.And that is in its own way far more brutal and wounding. They didn t just destroy the Obama era. Instead they dismissed it as if it never existed.Obama didn t make history after all. He wasn t a teleprompter demi-god standing athwart of history. He was Carter and Ford. He was there to be forgotten. He didn t change the world. He wasn t the messiah. He was merely a mortal. Just another politician who will sag and age. Who will, in the end, be photographed like Bill Clinton, lonely and lost in a world that has passed him by.The Obama era ends not with a bang, but with a whimper. With a national consensus that maybe he didn t really matter so much after all. And those to whom he mattered the most were his enemies determined to undo everything he did.Obama once thought that he belonged to the ages. Now he belongs in the rubbish bin.By Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. ",0

12002,THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET UGLY: GOP Introduces Plan To Stop $44 BILLION In Obama’s Last Minute Taxpayer Funded Regulations,"Republicans have put forward a plan to stop Obama administration s last minute regulations Tuesday. These  midnight regulations  published after the 2016 presidential election could cost the American taxpayer over $44 billion.California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa re-introduced legislation Tuesday that would allow Congress to overturn executive branch regulations finalized in the last 60 legislative days of an outgoing presidential administration.The bill amends the Congressional Review Act, which would allow Congress to recoup the ability to essentially curb numerous regulations rushed through the regulatory process in the last days of an outgoing administration at one time.Issa s office claims the bill is designed  to stem a growing trend by Presidents, of both parties, to use their last few months in office to rush in costly, expensive or controversial new regulations. The legislation, expected to be approved by the House Wednesday, was already introduced with support from the Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tom Marino. Regulations impacting the economy, the environment, families, and our community should be done with great caution and transparency, not get rushed in last-minute on a President s way out of office. This is a good piece of legislation that will help keep this and future Presidents in check. The Midnight Rules Relief Act is a reasonable plan to strengthen executive branch oversight, giving Congress a better tool to ensure regulations are limited and, when necessary, approved in an open and transparent manner,  Issa said in a statement.

12004,INVITED POP STAR SAYS SHE’LL PERFORM At Trump Inauguration ONLY If She Can Sing Song About Lynching Blacks,"British pop singer Rebecca Ferguson, daughter of a white British woman and Jamaican father, says she has been invited to perform at Donald Trump s inauguration, but her response may not be the RSVP the President-elect s team were expecting.The former UK X-Factor runner-up said she would only accept the invitation on the condition that she could perform  Strange Fruit    a song protesting racism in 1930s America, made famous by Billie Holiday.The lyrics, written in the 1930s by Jewish communist Abel Meeropol, were composed as a protest poem to highlight endemic racism in America s southern states.The song s opening lyrics deal with lynching, which was still happening in parts of the country at the time: Southern trees bear strange fruit // Blood on the leaves and blood at the root // Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze // Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.According to Billie Holiday s Estate, Holiday regularly performed the song at live performances in 1939. Her record label, Columbia, refused to let her record the song under their name, so they granted her a one-session contractual release that gave Holiday clearance to independently record the track.Later that year, the album featuring  Strange Fruit  sold a million copies, becoming Holiday s biggest-selling record at the time. In 1978, the single was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  Last month, The Beach Boys told CNN that the group has been contacted about performing, but that  no decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate.

12006,BREAKING: FORD CEO CITES TRUMP In Announcement To Scrap $1.6 Billion Mexico Plant…Will Invest In MI Instead [VIDEO]," The Government-Orchestrated Bankruptcies Of General Motors And Chrysler Led To Tens Of Thousands Of Direct Factory, Supplier And Other Related Job Cuts.   While government influence at decade s end helped Detroit recover financially, the government-orchestrated bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler led to tens of thousands of direct factory, supplier and other related job cuts. The primary benefit of the U.S. industry restructuring for employment has been the balance of jobs saved rather than jobs created.  (John Crawley,  Analysis: Obama Seeks Lift From Detroit Auto Jobs,  Reuters, 1/12/12)TARP Inspector General: Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs Were Lost Due To Hasty Factory Closings.  The report by Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program of the Treasury Department, said both carmakers needed to shut down some underperforming dealerships. But it questioned whether the cuts should have been made so quickly, particularly during a recession. The report, released on Sunday, estimated that tens of thousands of jobs were lost as a result.  (Nick Bunkley,  TARP Audit Questions Rush To Close Auto Dealers,  The New York Times, 7/18/10)Ford Motor Company announced Tuesday it will cancel a $1.6 billion plant planned for Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in a Michigan assembly plant, directly tying the decision to  pro-growth policies  championed by President-elect Donald Trump.Trump had previously been critical of Ford s plans to build in Mexico. After the announcement, Trump tweeted a link to a story about the Ford decision and then added in a subsequent message:  Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world s great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION. We re doing this decision based on what s right for our business,  Ford CEO Mark Fields told Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Network.  As we think about the investments here in Michigan, as you can imagine, Neil, we look at a lot of factors as we make those. One of the factors that we re looking at is a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and some of the pro-growth policies he said he s going to pursue. And so this is a vote of confidence.   FOX News",0

Trump regularly attacked her, at times in viciously personal terms.Fox News s parent company, 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by the family of Rupert Murdoch, had offered Ms. Kelly more than $20 million a year to stay after her current contract expires this year. Rival networks seeking to hire Ms. Kelly away, including NBC News, had made it clear that they could not match that money from Fox, the cable news leader for the last 15 years running.Ms. Kelly s contract is not officially up until the summer, and it was unclear whether Fox News would refuse to release her from any contractual commitments that might delay her start at a rival.The Sunday night program, which is yet to be named, would provide Ms. Kelly with a continued hand in hard news.

12010,VALERIE JARRETT CLAIMS OBAMA’S Presidency Was “Scandal-Free”…Here’s A LIST Of Obama’s Top Scandals That Prove She’s Lying [VIDEO]," The president prides himself on the fact that his administration hasn t had a scandal and he hasn t done something to embarrass himself,  Jarrett said in an interview broadcast on CNN Sunday.The aide, also a close friend of Obama and his wife, Michelle, credited the first couple with being good people and getting good results. That s because that s who he is   that s who they are   and I think that s what really resonates with the American people,  Jarrett said.Critics of the Obama administration said Jarrett was trying to rewrite history.  NYPThe great  stimulus  heist: Obama seems to think nobody will remember he grabbed almost a trillion dollars for  stimulus  spending, created virtually zero private-sector jobs with it, allowed a great deal of the money to vanish into thin air, and spent the rest of his presidency complaining that he needed hundreds of billions more to repair roads and bridges.Vast sums of taxpayer money were wasted on foolish projects that came close to the Keynesian economic satire of hiring some people to dig holes, and others to fill them in. Obama added insult to injury by appointing Vice President Joe Biden as the  sheriff  who would supposedly find all that missing stimulus loot.Operation Fast and Furious: Obama partisans seem to think any given example of abuse or ineptitude by their man stopped being a  scandal  the moment it seemed clear he wouldn t be impeached over it. Operation Fast and Furious, the Obama administration s insane program to use American gun dealers and straw purchasers to arm Mexican drug lords, is a scandal with a huge body count, prominently including Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jamie Zapata, plus hundreds of Mexican citizens. Agent Terry s family certainly thinks it qualifies as a scandal.Sheriff Paul Babeu implicates Eric Holder and the Obama Justice Department as accomplices in the crimes involving weapons used in the  Fast and Furious  scandal:It is difficult to imagine any Republican administration surviving anything remotely close to Fast and Furious. The media would have dogged a Republican president without respite, especially when it became clear his Attorney General was putting political spin ahead of accountability and the safety of the American people.Remember, AG Eric Holder escaped perjury charges by claiming he didn t know what his own subordinates were doing   a pioneering, but sadly not unique, example of an Obama official using his or her incompetence as a defense.Eric Holder held in contempt of Congress: This was a result of Operation Fast and Furious, but it merits distinction as a separate scandal in its own right. Holder was the first sitting member of a president s cabinet in the history of the United States to be held in contempt of Congress.ObamaCare: Everything about ObamaCare is a scandal, from the President s incessant lies about keeping your old plan if you liked it, to Rep. Nancy Pelosi s  we need to pass it to find out what s in it  dereliction of Congressional duty.ObamaCare is a scam, pure and simple   sold on false pretenses by people who knew it wasn t going to work the way they promised. It doesn t feel right to dismiss it as a  failed  scheme when so much of the failure was intentional. The bill was so sloppily crafted that Democrats were basically signing blank sheets of paper when they rushed it through Congress in a foul-smelling cloud of back-room deals. ObamaCare s designers precipitated a constitutional crisis by forgetting they left in a provision to cut subsidies for states that didn t set up health-care exchanges   a provision that would have killed the entire program stone-dead two years ago, if it had been enforced as written.The Supreme Court rewrote ObamaCare on the fly twice to keep it alive, which is a scandal in and of itself. President Obama delayed and rewrote the law so often it was impossible to keep track of the changes, cutting Congress out of the loop completely. (Actually, someone did keep careful track of them, and the tally was up to 70 distinct changes by January 2016.)That made some of Obama s rewritten mandates and deadlines blatantly illegal   but then, the Affordable Care Act isn t really a  law  in the sense American government understood the term. In practice it became something entirely new, an enabling act that gave the executive unlimited power to do whatever it thought necessary to keep the system running. If subverting the American system of government isn t a scandal, what is?Spying on journalists: Establishment media came about as close to falling out of love with Barack Obama as ever when his administration was caught spying on journalists.The IRS scandal: The selective targeting of conservative groups by a politicized Internal Revenue Service was a scandal grenade Democrats and their media pals somehow managed to smother, even though the story began with the IRS admitting wrongdoing.Founder of non-partisan True The Vote group Catherine Engelbrecht gives gut-wrenching testimony to Congress about being being preyed upon by the IRS and other government agencies.https://youtu.be/db21AQu30XwDemocrats suffocated the scandal by acting like circus clowns during congressional hearings, but at no point were the actual facts of the case truly obscured: yes, pro-life and Tea Party groups were deliberately targeted for extra scrutiny, their tax exemption applications outrageously delayed until after the 2012 election without actually being refused. If anything remotely comparable had been done to, say, environmentalist and minority activist groups by the IRS under a Republican administration, the results would have been apocalyptic.The House voted to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress and to instruct the Justice Department to probe her for criminal charges.Benghazi: This is the clearest example of Obama and his supporters thinking all of his pre-2012 scandals ceased to exist the moment he won re-election. Benghazi has been investigated extensively, and argued about passionately, since the night of September 11, 2012. Nothing can change the absolute fact that the Obama administration s story for the first few weeks after the attack was false, and they knew it was false. They spun a phony story to buy themselves a little time during a presidential election campaign, and it worked.Watch Hillary lie and blame the cause of the Benghazi attack on our US Consulate on  an awful youtube video : Iran nuclear deal and ransom payment: Everything about Obama s dealings with Iran has been scandalous, beginning with his silence while the Green Revolution was brutally put down by the mullahs in 2009. The Iran nuclear deal was pushed with lies and media manipulation. The infamous pallet of cash that wasn t a ransom has become symbolic of Obama s mendacity and penchant for breaking the rules, when he thinks following them is too much trouble.Watch Obama try to explain his way out of makingBowe Bergdahl: Bergdahl s ultimate fate rests in the hands of a military court (unless Obama pardons him) but no verdict can erase the scandalous way this administration conducted the prisoner swap that freed him from the Taliban and its allies. Many lies were told, the law was flouted, a deal of questionable wisdom was struck with his captors, and outraged Americans demanded recognition for the soldiers who died searching for Bergdahl after he abandoned his post.Polluting the Colorado river: The Environmental Protection Agency managed to turn the Colorado River orange under this greenest of green Presidents. Of course there was a cover-up. Would you expect anything less from this  transparent  administration?",0

12014,"TRUMP KICKS Pro-Amnesty, Globalist Koch Brother And “Author” Friend Off His West Palm Beach Golf Course","President-elect Donald Trump told a critical biographer and guest of billionaire David Koch to leave his West Palm Beach golf course on New Year s Eve, forcing Koch to leave with him.Trump s gesture was another slight against the pro-amnesty, pro- free trade  billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who opposed Trump during the Republican primary season and refused to help him during the general election. It also signals Trump will not necessarily play nice with the GOP political establishment and Beltway right.The Kochs swooped in during the Tea Party revolt in 2010, training amateur political activists and trying to channel populist energy against the Obama administration into supporting the progressive-business alliance that wanted more cheap labor and lesser sentences for drug traffickers, under the umbrella term of  smaller government. But the  grassroots army  was not controllable,  as one former Koch staffer lamented, and the Kochs appeared curiously unwilling to make any concessions to Americans who wanted populist, nationalist policies, and relief from the relentlessly eroding forces of mass immigration and globalization. A majority of voters  some of whom saw more demographic change take place in their communities than many countries saw in a millennia want immigration slashed in half or reduced to zero. Trump captured that energy and it propelled him to the White House, much to the Kochs  and their network s chagrin.The Kochs wanted candidates amenable to their will, and Trump didn t fit the bill. They considered him a distraction before he rocketed to first in the polls, and even toyed with the idea of spending tens of millions of dollars to attack him.Trump mocked the Kochs while on the campaign trail, calling their preferred candidates  puppets  enacting their donors  agenda:I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016Koch s guest: Harry Hurt III, who authored the 1993 book, Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, which stated Ivana Trump accused her ex-husband of  raping  her in a sworn deposition during their divorce.Accusing Trump of  raping  his ex wife, Ivana Trump, was a false media accusation arising early in the Republican primaries and a weapon the Democratic Party planned to use in the general election after Fox News  Megyn Kelly and the Daily Beast  rushed it on air  and into print, using Hurt s book, before bothering to check with Ivana about its truth.It backfired spectacularly when Ivana slammed the allegations and endorsed her ex-husband for president.

12016,"YES, Obama CAN Appoint A Supreme Court Justice Before He Leaves…But Will He?","The President who has thumbed his nose at our US Constitution, and clearly has no respect for our rule of law, has the ability to appoint a Supreme Court Justice before he vacates the White House, but will he? In those few moments the Senate will go into what s known as an  intersession recess,  creating one golden moment when the president could test his recess-appointment powers by sending Judge Garland to the high court.A smattering of activists has asked him to give it a try, but Mr. Obama has given no indication that he s thinking about it. The White House didn t respond to a request for comment for this story.The move would be a legal gamble under the high court s last ruling in 2014 on recess appointments. That 9-0 decision overturned a handful of Mr. Obama s early 2012 picks, saying the Senate was actually in session when the president acted, so he couldn t use his powers.That ruling also said, however, that there s a difference between appointments made during the annual yearlong session of Congress, dubbed  intrasession,  which Mr. Obama used in 2012, and picks made at the end of the year, after Congress adjourns, which are known as  intersession. William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, said Mr. Obama would have the power to elevate Judge Garland. But he said it would be  politically unwise and damaging to the prestige of the court. The consensus, though, is that Mr. Obama would be making a mistake to test it that theory. I think it s fair to use the word stretch. I don t know why he would try this. It would backfire,  said Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at the Constitution Project who served for decades as Congress  top expert on separation-of-powers issues.He said Mr. Obama s 9-0 loss in the 2014 case should still be stinging someone who earned his law degree from Harvard University and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Does he want to go down that road again?  Mr. Fisher said. Perhaps most problematic for Mr. Obama is that recess appointments have a shelf life. Even if he succeeds in putting Judge Garland on the bench, the appointment would expire at the close of 2017   and could end even earlier if the Senate confirms a full-fledged replacement named by Mr. Trump.Worse yet for Mr. Obama, Judge Garland would lose his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit   oftentimes dubbed the second-most powerful court in the country. That means the president would be trading a lifetime of Judge Garland for less than a year of Justice Garland. Since Garland could serve only a year, he presumably would accomplish little and his service would be clouded by the strange and controversial circumstances of his appointment,  said Mr. Ross, the law professor.For entire story  Washington Times",0

BLM Supporter, Dem Congressman Hangs COP-HATING, Race-Baiting Art-Work In U.S. Capitol Building","A piece of art depicting cops as animals that are killing minorities that has no business hanging in our US Capitol building Artistic expression, or one congressman s political statement masquerading as  student art? A very offensive depiction of police hands in the U.S. Capitol complex, and Missouri Rep. William Lacy Clay is drawing heat for placing it there.For several months the painting, called  Untitled #1,  has hung in the House building connecting hall, depicting police as animals seemingly engaged in the act of brutalizing minorities.  BPRIn February 2015, Democratic Congressman Clay suggested that prosecutors are responsible for fixing outcome of racially charged cases that involve cops when he claimed that in Ferguson and in Garner s death  we saw an all-too-familiar pattern of local prosecutors who work hand-in-hand with police every day, essentially prewiring the grand jury process to produce a known outcome. In a released statement, Clay said,  Members of Congress support student art competitions in our districts but we do not select the young artists and we do not judge the artwork. I had no role in selecting the winner of this student art competition and I would never attempt to approve or disapprove artistic expression. The U.S. Capitol is a symbol of freedom, not censorship. The young artist chose his own subject and the painting will not be removed. He also told the St. Louis Post Dispatch that the painting was  the most creative expression that I ve witnessed in the last 16 years.

12020,"ARE ANGRY LEFTISTS Planning Violent Communist Revolution?…“It is their goal to “block, obstruct, disrupt” Trump’s Inauguration","Author Ed Klein told Pete Hegseth on Fox and Friends Weekend that Barack Obama is setting up a shadow government in Washington DC to undermine President Trump after Inauguration Day. Does Obama have plans to work with the underbelly of the Democrat Party to disrupt Trump s term as President?But could the left really attempt a violent revolution to overthrow the U.S. government and overturn the American way of life?Not only could they, but they will try, according to Douglas V. Gibbs, who has appeared as a commentator on Fox News and is a radio talk-show host in Los Angeles.And it won t be a liberal revolution. It will be a communist revolution.That s the prediction Gibbs made in an article published Friday in the Canada Free Press titled,  Democrats Prepare for Violent Revolution. Examining the evidence, he concludes a revolution attempt is not necessarily imminent, but that it will happen, once various pieces fall into place.Gibbs declared,  They are in full preparation for social and economic collapse, or a violent revolution. He cites the website DisruptJ20 and its  Call for a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017. Gibbs quotes Michael Moore explaining,  It is their goal to  block, obstruct, disrupt, and do whatever they can to prevent the onslaught that is going to happen with Donald Trump. .It is Gibbs  contention that,  The liberal leftists want desperately to sabotage the Trump administration, and possibly overthrow the entire government. For their socialist big government agenda, the ends justifies the means. Why now?Because, he explained,  [U]nder Obama, the veil was raised. Why worry about exposure now? They ve been poking the right-of-center groups in the chest for years, trying to instigate a violent response, and they never got it. Now,  he continued,  they may be realizing, it is up to them to initiate the violence. It is up to the leftists to finally launch the true coup. Or, at least that is what a lot of people think. Evidence that could support his theory is not hard to come by, as the left is becoming increasingly violent.During the 2016 presidential campaign, leftist riots broke out in cities across the country, the worst perhaps in San Jose, California, and in Chicago.WND reported assassination threats against Trump accompanied the nationwide rioting.Often-violent anti-Trump protests broke out in cities including Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Denver, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Seattle, Tampa, Dallas and Oakland, California.In Chicago, a video showed a mob of young black men beating and dragging through the streets a white man who voted for Trump.Portland, Oregon police termed a protest a riot after  anarchists  threw objects at officers, vandalized local businesses and damaged cars.Some 1,000 protesters in Oakland broke store windows, left graffiti on buildings and threw M-80 firecrackers, Molotov cocktails and bottles at police officers, authorities told CNN.And that s only the beginning, if Gibbs is right.He suggests the left will inevitably move on to more violence following the election of Trump, because  the realization that the Democrats are losing grip on their transformational agenda in the rest of the country has slammed the leftists square in the face. Gibbs asserts the leftists  hate any opposition, and are willing to do whatever it takes to either win over their opposition, or silence and eliminate their opposition. The next step by the left, according to Gibbs, is the stockpiling of arms. Now, it s the liberals who are suddenly worried, and stockpiling food, guns, and emergency supplies,  he observed.  Trump s 2016 win was a wake-up call. Their cheating, lying and violence was not enough to stop the man, and his very unorthodox approach to politics. Gibbs sees the left s hysteria as now having gone beyond insanity, marking a transition to violent anger.He believes the hysteria arose because the left they thought they had finally defeated the right permanently with the election of Obama, and that the election of Hillary Clinton would seal the deal. They only needed, now, to disarm the crazy right-wing bastards,  wrote Gibbs.  Then, with a faint whimper, the last of the opposition to the liberal left agenda would be gone. It seemed to them a near-certainty, but when it all came crashing down on Nov. 8, it was a disorienting  shock to the system. Nobody on the left side of the aisle expected that Trump had a snowball s chance in Hell to win the 2016 Election. All of their skewed poll numbers said Hillary was going to win. Gibbs portrayed the left as in a state similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.For entire story: WND ",0
