17597,A Federal Judge Just Ordered The RNC To Reveal Its Voter Fraud Pact With Trump,"Comments 
Federal Judge John Michael Vazquez set a court appearance for this Thursday for the Democratic National Committee’s emergency legal action to fight Republican minority suppression efforts. 
The DNC filed suit over a generation-old consent decree last week seeking an injunction and extension of the order by eight years, which prevents illegal Republican voter suppression “ballot security” measures. 
That lawsuit is looking ever more likely to succeed, resulting in an order barring Republicans across the country from targeting minority voters. The RNC’s response pointedly omitted any defense of the Michigan and Pennsylvania RNC members accused of unlawful ballot security programs, who are the two key players in this courtroom drama that also involves VP candidate Mike Pence and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. 
The federal judge ordered both Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDonald – Mitt Romney’s niece – and Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason to submit sworn statements along with documentation of their ballot security programs by 5pm today. 
Last night, Republican lawyers tossed the two high-ranking RNC members under the bus by failing entirely to defend their actions, sworn accounts of which are due at 5pm today. The Democrat’s strongest claims are against the two national RNC members who spoke to the media about ballot security programs. 
The Washington Post wrote about the Pennsylvania GOP’s plans to flood urban Philadelphia with suburban poll watchers from other counties and a legal effort to remove state law restrictions on out of county ballot watchers, while t he Michigan State GOP Chairwoman was quoted in The Detroit Free Press as saying she was directing measures in Michigan to launch a “massive anti-fraud” effort. 
Under the 1982 agreement between the parties as it’s been modified through the years, any “ballot security program” must be submitted to the court and DNC for “preclearance” ten days before being implemented. It seems highly unlikely that the DNC was notified of any of the four major activities the court demanded to be explained. 
The Republican National Committee also has until 5pm today to deliver statements about minority voter suppression made in public, video recorded comments by VP nominee Mike Pence and media reports about the Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s statements after the third and final debate. Additionally, the national Republican party has got to deliver to the court any and all agreements between the RNC and the Trump campaign that involve electioneering or polling places to the court as well. 
The Democratic lawyers even submitted fresh evidence to the court that the RNC is involved nationally in poll security operations, which a former federal prosecutor obtained via text message during the normal course of poll watching activities. The RNC denies activity in any and all poll watching venues in their legal filings. 
The Republican National Committee is clearly frustrated by its lengthy tenure under the key voter protection legal agreement, and you can tell from the legal filing that it wants out. However, the Republican party of Trump isn’t playing by the rules, like it’s standard bearer doesn’t play by the rules, and now they’re likely going to be punished. 
Tonight, the music stops and the Republicans will finally have to answer for their dirty campaign tactics, or face the wrath of a federal judge. 
Here’s the judge’s complete order:",0

17599,Islamophobia Must be Fought and Defeated,"When I was a lieutenant colonel on active duty, I supervised an officer in the U.S. Air Force who was (and is) an Iraqi-American. He came to the US as a boy after President George H.W. Bush’s call to the Shia to revolt against Saddam in the aftermath of Desert Storm, which was ruthlessly suppressed by Saddam as Bush and company did nothing.
As an Iraqi-American in uniform, he served as an interpreter attached to the 101st Airborne in Iraq in 2004, if memory serves–dangerous times indeed for US troops in Iraq.
He wrote to me, rightly outraged, after Ben Carson made his anti-Muslim comments back in September of 2015 during the presidential primary season. It made him so sad, so angry, as a US Air Force veteran and as a Muslim-American to hear such ignorance, such bias, such Islamophobia. And it made me angry as well.

So many Muslim-Americans have served this country with distinction, troops like Navy veteran Nate Terani, who has written an eloquent article at TomDispatch.com on the prejudice he faced as an Iranian-American. Terani is doing his best to fight a new enemy, Islamophobia, the irrational fear of Islam fed by the unhinged rhetoric of candidates like Ben Carson and Donald Trump.
Here is how Terani puts it in his article :
In Iran, theocratic fundamentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders–of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry–Islamophobia–threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. 
As America builds walls and weapons and wages war all over the globe, as our leaders look outward for enemies, we’re forgetting the enemy within America, the enemy that is a much more serious threat to our national security. That enemy, which exists right here in America’s heartland, is ignorance, hatred, fear, aggression, compounded by a cowardly desire to “get even” and to “make America great again” by ostracizing other Americans who are considered “different” and “untrustworthy.”
But spreading fear and bigotry is not a way to national security; it’s a way to national insanity. Islamophobia, like all other irrational fears, must be fought and defeated.

17600,Queens Woman Is Charged With Strangling 9-Year-Old Stepdaughter - The New York Times,"In the packed apartment complex in Queens, the woman saw Shamdai Arjun, whose family shares a   apartment with hers, leaving on Friday evening. Ms. Arjun took her two young grandchildren with her and rode off with a man in a white car. Ms. Arjun’s    stepdaughter, though, stayed behind. Ms. Arjun told the woman that the girl was washing her hair, according to a criminal complaint. But the light in the bathroom had been on for hours, and the door was locked, the woman, whose name was not disclosed, told investigators. She knocked on the door, and there was no answer. She called the girl’s father, and he told her to break down the door. Inside, she saw the girl, Ashdeep Kaur, lying in a bathtub with no water in it. She was lifeless and bruised. Emergency workers and the police were called around 6 p. m. to the apartment in Richmond Hill, on 112th Street near 101st Avenue, where Ashdeep was pronounced dead, officials said. On Sunday, Ms. Arjun, 55, was charged with   murder in her death, prosecutors said. Ashdeep died of strangulation, and her death has been ruled a homicide, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner said. “Her actions, if true, are beyond comprehension and must be severely punished,” Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said in a statement. Ms. Arjun appeared in Queens Criminal Court on Sunday, where a judge ordered that she be held without bail. Michael Curtis, an assistant district attorney, said that Ms. Arjun had “the motive, the means and the exclusive opportunity to commit this awful and brutal crime. ” “This defendant repeatedly and on numerous occasions threatened to kill the victim,” he added, “most recently doing so this past Tuesday. On Friday, she made good on that threat. ” Ms. Arjun’s lawyer, Judah Maltz, said his client maintained that she was innocent. “She denied ever hurting the child,” he said. “There’s no confession. No one saw her commit this crime. All they have is circumstantial evidence. ” Ms. Arjun was arrested late Saturday in the South Ozone Park neighborhood at the home of her former husband, Raymond Narayan. He was the one who drove her and their grandchildren, who are 3 and 5, away from her home in Richmond Hill, the authorities said. When investigators arrived at Mr. Narayan’s home, he and Ms. Arjun refused to leave for over an hour, prosecutors said. He finally relented, opening the door, and they were both arrested. Mr. Narayan, 65, has been charged with obstructing governmental administration. Ashdeep had been in the United States for only a few months, neighbors said, leaving her mother and other relatives in India to live with her father and his wife, who is from Guyana. She came to a neighborhood that is filled with immigrants from India, Pakistan and Guyana. She moved into the   apartment, which her family shared with another family, in a crowded complex formed by brick houses that have been stitched together. Neighbors said that the building’s tenants turned over quickly and that many of them, like Ashdeep and her father, were from India. It is in an area of southwest Queens that has been shaken by killings this month, with an imam and his assistant gunned down in Ozone Park and a jogger, Karina Vetrano, found dead in an area of marshland in Howard Beach. And in Richmond Hill, Ashdeep’s neighbors struggled with the young girl’s death. “I see my daughter’s face in hers,” Kiran Kaur said, trembling and crying as she left a nearby gurdwara, or Sikh temple. (She is not related to Ashdeep.) “Every mother can see her kids’ faces in another,” she continued, her    daughter’s arms wrapped around her waist. “I don’t know how her mother feels to know that her daughter is no longer in this world. ”",0
17601,French Universities Play Politics by Emailing Students to Vote Macron,"French university academics have made an extraordinary intervention in the French election, emailing students and urging them to back establishment candidate Emmanuel Macron. [The president of the University of Angers in Western France, Christian Roblédo, claimed in an email to students that, “as a university professor” it was his “duty to denounce the harmful ideology that [Marine Le Pen] conveys”.  He characterised this ideology as “withdrawal into oneself, intolerance, fear of the other [and] refusal of differences” in opposition to “humanism, openness, pluralism and freedom of expression”  —   the values which, in Roblédo’s estimation, “constitute the very essence of higher education and research in France”. “Already in 2002, we were placed before such a choice,” he said, recalling the second round showdown between Jacques Chirac and Marine Le Pen’s father,  . Mr. Le Pen was expelled from the Front National by his daughter as she reformed it into a moderate, populist movement. “[In 2002] a Republican front had come together to make the Front National score as low as possible,” wrote Roblédo. “[Again] we have to vote massively so that [Marine Le Pen] does not win the presidential election. ” Anticipating criticism of his intervention as an abuse of his public position, the professor concluded by saying that “[Sometimes] the values of a man’s life take precedence over all other considerations. In addressing you as president of the University, the duty of reserve is obliterated by the threats to the institutional foundations on which our University is based. ” WATCH | @MLP_officiel to @EmmanuelMacron: ”France will be led by a woman, either me or Angela Merkel!” 👏🇷😂 pic. twitter.   —   LEAVE. EU  (@LeaveEUOfficial) May 3, 2017,  Colleague Manuel Tunon de Lara, president of the University of Bordeaux, was equally unabashed, writing of his “responsibility to call on the academic community to vote next Sunday to block   …     the accession of Marine Le Pen to the presidency of the French Republic. ” He claimed that the “Marine Le Pen programme” was incompatible “with the academic values we have hitherto defended”. “How to defend openness in a country that would close its borders?” he asked. “My position is not an isolated position,” he declared. “It is associated with that advocated by the Conference of University Presidents, which called for ‘voting against the extremism of the candidature of Marine Le Pen’. ”",0
17602,Vine Dries Up. Black Humor Loses a Home - The New York Times,"This summer, I thumbed past an Instagram photo of a   young man with silken brown skin and an enviable   fade dressed up in an azure suit. I lingered for a moment, slightly verklempt. I knew him, or, at least, I felt as if I did, and I couldn’t believe he was already going to prom. The teenager was an    from New Jersey known as Jay Versace, who has appeared in my life in   increments for the last two years on Vine, the video app. I’ve seen him confess that he’s wet himself, channel Drake and Beyoncé and balance an impressive number of items on his head. Most of Versace’s Vines are shot in his bedroom, and watching his videos is as intimate as finding your younger brother’s notebook of secret doodles or poems  —   you’re stumbling into his ( ) secret world. The kinship I felt reminded me of the bond I imagine my mother has when she talks about “Tracee” (Ellis Ross) or “Chris” (Rock) as if they could walk through our door at any moment and fix themselves something to eat. Jay Versace’s work gives me the same feeling that, say, “Everybody Hates Chris” gave my mom  —   comfort, stability, familiarity and warmth, a sense of identity and belonging. Versace’s Vines are a particular product of black culture  —   on the surface, they’re funny to anyone lucky enough to bear witness, but there’s a secondary layer that’s meant for black people, predicated on our shared culture, experiences and understandings. If Facebook has become a destination for moms who are increasingly technologically literate, and Twitter has grown into a place for journalists who spread information (and snark) in   missives, Vine, the mobile video app that Twitter announced late last week will be discontinued in the coming months, has become a home for young black people, who dominated the service and established its visual language early  —   quick cuts, referential jokes, deep allusions. (Jay Versace, for example, has three million followers.) Quickly consumed visuals have the potential to go viral online in ways that words do not, and Vines spread far and fast while also allowing its users to arbitrate their outcomes. While Facebook supplies recognition  —   first and last name, hometown, face  —   and Twitter can provide anonymity, Vine offered something in between: a place for people to see you, even people who didn’t necessarily know who you were. Visual platforms like Snapchat are similar canvases for creativity, but make it difficult to attract an audience outside of one’s social circles. Vine didn’t privilege traditional celebrities  —   its stars grew organically without the benefit of expensive equipment or   connections  —   though after its official release in 2013, it seemed like everybody wanted to be there. Drake premiered the first clip of his album “Views,” on it dance crazes like “The Running Man Challenge” were born there   slang like “on fleek,” “WHAT ARE THOOOSE” and “Why you always lyin’?” debuted and spread on Vine. Like much of pop culture, these bits of virality were rooted in the black community, then sucked into the mainstream where businesses benefit from them financially. Vine incubated black ingenuity and creativity, allowing makers to play with structure, form, insertion, pacing and interpolation, and letting users employ the videos as punch lines, shorthand and punctuation. The service became its own ecosystem of black culture, both by relying on familiar figures, experiences and jokes, and by creating the next batch of them. Jay Versace mirrors black experience in a Vine about a relationship breakup, set to the 3LW song “No More (Baby I’ma Do Right). ” He plays two characters: a befuddled male and his clearly angry girlfriend. It’s funny because of the large, exaggerated emotions spreading across his baby face, the way he overemphasizes the singer Kiely Williams’s lisp as he   the word “promises. ” Everyone can see that. But what’s funnier is that he’s making fun of the way we  —   black people, the main audience who bought the 3LW records, and memorized their songs and dances  —   all made fun of the song when we first heard it. Versace is sharing an inside joke. As the writer Kasai Richardson posted on Twitter, “black youth did more with six seconds than Hollywood has done with six decades. ” Most popular Vines were truly entertaining, even cinematic. But they also began conversations  —   however small  —   about the dynamics of comedy and culture created by black people. Chiefly, Vine was an exercise in how many black people talk among ourselves  —   in code and allusion  —   and how we telegraph blackness to white people, who may not know any black people besides the ones who live in their phone. Blackness is inherently political, but a number of black comedic Vines weren’t, perhaps making it easier for white kids to latch onto  —   there weren’t murky politics to consider. Many black Vine stars relied on familiar tropes to appeal to black people but, in turn, may have reinforced stereotypes for white people, who received the content without the tacit understanding that everyone else is in on the joke. Still, that didn’t stop Vine from functioning as a de facto FUBU  —   for us, by us  —   space for black people, where we could reinsert ourselves into a mainstream that excluded us, skewer our own culture (however safely) and create something new, a phenomenon that is relatively rare. There are few spaces to provide the public with black ingenuity Vine, in its own small way, was a digital exposition of black achievement. It was fitting, then, that Twitter announced the discontinuation of Vine the same day the “ ” scandal hit the internet. In an article about the film “Moonlight,” the film critic for The Toronto Star misheard the term “” a practice of alternating language or behavior based on the environment and atmosphere, and giddily included the eggcorn in promoting the article. It was a perfect example of how the experiences of minorities are often misconstrued. Vine was a place where you were either on the joke or you weren’t, and so help you if you weren’t. Vines were six rapid seconds of fun, a flash of candy down a throat. My favorite Vine wasn’t a lifesaver or a masterwork it just cheered me up more quickly than any other emotional fix in my arsenal. It’s called “Black people only need 3 claps to turnnn up!”  —   the premise is uncomplicated, and it manages to be cheeky, tender, nostalgic, surprising, hilarious, painfully true and      all in the span of six seconds. Vine was never that deep: it wasn’t designed to spark a national conversation on race, culture, appropriation, ownership and identity. Its effect and utility, though, as a venue for black art to be created disseminated and understood, will be its legacy. Nobody ever tried to change the world with a Vine. But it served as the best place to get away from the world for a while.",0
17603,Mainstream Media Ignoring 75 Lawsuits Against Trump to Focus on Clinton Emails,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 8:00 am ""Last spring...New York had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trump-owned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757""   
We looked yesterday at Kurt Eichenwald’s revelation that Donald Trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails. That is hardly Trump’s only misdeed, but how many people realize that Donald Trump, at this moment, has 75 – SEVENTY-FIVE – legal issues hanging over his head. 
He’s lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers – and with much less excuse, the mainstream media – thoroughly distracted by the Clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities. 
USA TODAY reported at the end of October that “Just two weeks before Election Day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by USA TODAY.” 
It will surprise no one, because Trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster , that “One Trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City, is scheduled to go to trial a week before Election Day.” 
If one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that Trump does not pay his bills. Earlier, we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a Florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts, having decided that the contractor had been “paid enough,” even though it wasn’t the agreed-upon amount. Trump got nailed by the court for $300K in attorney’s fees in that case. 
Just a few examples from USA TODAY’s investigation: 
Trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses: angry members at his Jupiter, Fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. There’s a fraud case brought by Trump University students who say the mogul’s company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. Trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. A disgruntled GOP political consultant sued for $4 million saying Trump defamed her. Another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. 
As pointed out by USA TODAY’s Nick Penzenstadler and John Kelly, these lawsuits will dog Trump into the White House, should he win. He will have no immunity because he is president. And America – and the world – will be treated to the spectacle of the President of the United States having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs. 
There are harassment cases, sex discrimination lawsuits, fraud, unpaid bills, racist comments, defamation, cases involving Trump University. As USA TODAY notes, “as recently as last spring…New York had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trump-owned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country.” 
And those 75 cases will likely grow. 
Trump has promised, after all, to sue The New York Times and each of the women – NYMag maintains an exhaustive list – who have accused him of sexual assault. 
USA Today says it spent six months researching court records. “The exclusive analysis,” they say, “found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. The cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the White House.” 
Donald Trump claims Clinton is tainted. He claims Clinton’s emails are bigger than Watergate. The other day tweeted , “We must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp.” 
This comes from the man who would turn the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue into a morality No-Go Zone. 
All the facts – including the new disclosures about Trump’s ties to a Russian server and his potentially illegal ploy to avoid paying taxes – make it clear that if Trump the deadbeat liar drains the swamp, he will be the first one down the drain.",0
17604,"Thomas Mair, Suspected in the Jo Cox Killing, Is Charged With Murder - The New York Times","BIRSTALL, England  —   The police in Britain on Saturday charged a    man with murdering Jo Cox, the lawmaker whose death shocked Britons and led to a suspension of campaigning in a referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union. In a statement issued early Saturday, Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen of the West Yorkshire Police said that officers had charged a man with murder and several other offenses, including grievous bodily harm and possession of a firearm. The suspect, Thomas Mair, of Birstall, a town in West Yorkshire county, is expected to make an initial court appearance at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on Saturday. Once charges have been made, British media law prevents any reporting about the case that might prejudice a trial. The shooting and stabbing death of Ms. Cox, 41, a member of the opposition Labour Party, left Britain stunned and set off a debate about the tone of Britain’s increasingly fractious politics ahead of the plebiscite regarding the European bloc. Ms. Cox was killed early Thursday afternoon after getting out of her car outside the public library in Birstall where she had been scheduled to hold a meeting with constituents, the police said on Friday in their most detailed description of the attack. Some media accounts, citing witnesses, said on Thursday that Ms. Cox had been coming out of the library after the meeting when she was attacked. Issues of immigration and national identity have been central to the occasionally bitter clashes over the referendum on European Union membership and have resulted in a tone that critics say verges on racism and xenophobia. Ms. Cox’s death was the first killing of a sitting member of Parliament since 1990. Her death brought Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, together to the site of the killing to honor her. Both sides in the European Union debate suspended campaigning on Thursday out of respect for Ms. Cox, though Vote Leave, which supports departure from the   bloc, said Friday that it would resume campaigning over the weekend. Speaking in Birstall, Mr. Cameron said he first met Ms. Cox in 2006 in the Darfur region of Sudan at the time, she worked for the humanitarian organization Oxfam. “Parliament has lost one of its most passionate and brilliant campaigners,” he said. Mr. Corbyn called Ms. Cox’s killing “an attack on democracy,” blaming “the well of hatred. ” Kathryn Pinnock, a Liberal Democrat councilor from Birstall who was appointed to the House of Lords in 2014, said she was scheduled to campaign with Ms. Cox on Thursday afternoon for Britain to remain in the European Union. There has been growing concern about threats British lawmakers have received in the line of their work, and Ms. Pinnock said Ms. Cox had mentioned receiving some “very unpleasant” messages on social media. The West Yorkshire police said Ms. Cox had gotten two threats in the past, including “one of a sexual nature” at her offices in London. The Metropolitan Police, who protect the capital, said Ms. Cox had alerted them in March to “malicious communication” by a man, whom officers detained and released with a warning. That man was not the murder suspect, the police said. Ms. Cox, who would have turned 42 on Wednesday, was elected to Parliament for the district of Batley and Spen in May 2015. In just over a year, she had already established a strong reputation, speaking on behalf of refugees, children in poverty and children with autism. Hundreds of people packed St. Peter’s Church in Birstall on Thursday night for a memorial service. Ms. Cox’s husband, Brendan Cox, said on Friday that a charitable fund had been set up in her memory.",0
17605,Celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Still Faces Pushback - The New York Times,"Today is Martin Luther King’s Birthday, the federal holiday that honors the assassinated civil rights leader. Well, not everywhere. All 50 states celebrate the public holiday on the third Monday in January, but not all states, cities and towns dedicate it solely to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Some package it as a broader celebration of both Dr. King and Confederate leaders.    naming differences are remnants of fierce opposition to a holiday that was not officially recognized by all states until 1999. Here is a brief history of how Martin Luther King Jr. Day came to be. How Did Martin Luther King Jr. Day Become a Holiday? A federal holiday honoring Dr. King was first proposed four days after he was assassinated, in 1968, but it took almost two decades of campaigning for it to be approved and designated at the national level. In the meantime, according to the King Center, a few Northern states approved the holiday from 1973 to 1975: Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut and, by court order, New Jersey. But   momentum slowed and Congress did not act. Advocates led by Dr. King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, spent years lobbying for the holiday, testifying before Congress and gathering millions of signatures on petitions. President Jimmy Carter expressed support for the federal holiday in 1979. The singer Stevie Wonder became a prominent supporter, too, financing a Washington lobbying office and releasing a hit 1980 song in support, “Happy Birthday. ” The campaign finally succeeded in 1983, when Congress passed the King Holiday Bill and President Ronald Reagan signed it into law. The third Monday in January would be celebrated as Martin Luther King Jr. Day starting in 1986. Who Opposed It? Proposals to honor Dr. King met strong resistance in Congress, and when the holiday was enacted, many states were slow to acknowledge it. New Hampshire became the last state to officially recognize the holiday in 1999 after years of acrimonious debate. When the proposal to create the holiday was debated in Congress in 1979, Republicans led the charge against it. The strongest opposition came from lawmakers in the Deep South, such as Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, who ran for president in 1948 on a segregationist platform. Opponents argued that giving federal employees a new paid vacation day would be too expensive and that it was inappropriate to bestow such an honor upon Dr. King because he had never held elected office, according to an essay by Donald R. Wolfensberger, a congressional scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. When the measure failed in 1979, Representative Cardiss Collins, Democrat of Illinois and leader of the Congressional Black Caucus at the time, said she believed that racism had played a role. But by 1983, many Republicans in Congress had changed their minds. The King Holiday Bill passed the House and the Senate with bipartisan support and was signed by a Republican president. But not everyone came around to the idea. Mr. Helms had filibustered the bill and denounced Dr. King on the floor of the Senate as someone who advocated “  Marxism” and other “radical political” views. Where Does the Holiday Stand Today? Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day is commemorated by the federal government and, in some form, by all 50 states, some, like Arizona and Idaho, combine commemorations of Dr. King’s birthday with a holiday to honor civil rights. A release by Nueces County, Tex. referred to the day as a “County Civil Rights Holiday. ” Biloxi, Miss. drew backlash on Twitter last week after the city’s official Twitter account posted an alert to residents about municipal closings on the holiday, calling it “Great Americans Day. ” The tweet was later deleted. The controversy prompted a special City Council meeting to consider making the city’s holiday name match that of the federal holiday honoring Dr. King. On Monday morning, the council voted   to do so (with one member absent) according to video footage from a local ABC station, WLOX. And then there are a few states in the Deep South  —   Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi  —   that combine celebrations of the civil rights icon and that of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general. (Lexington, Va. even honors Lee and another Confederate general, Stonewall Jackson, with a parade and celebration during the weekend leading up to Dr. King’s birthday.) Critics have decried those arrangements as an unholy merger that commemorate both freedom and slavery  —   a combination that is nonsensical at best and inflammatory at worst. Arkansas lawmakers have tried in recent years to separate the two holidays, but the measures have been opposed from constituents who call the effort an affront to Southern heritage or by lawmakers who say they have better things to do. “We’re looking for a solution to a problem we don’t have,” Josh Miller, a Republican state representative in Arkansas, told The Associated Press. “I haven’t noticed any humongous Robert E. Lee parades that are taking place in conjunction with Martin Luther King Day. ”",0
17606,"BREAKING: New Law Stops Hillary In Her Tracks, She Is Now Officially Ineligible To Run","
As if Hillary Clinton was not already facing enough legal trouble, new information has surfaced that the former Secretary of State could actually be legally ineligible to run for President of the United States. 
In fact, Clinton could be ineligible to hold any kind of federal office. 
This week, Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey spoke out to say that Clinton’s personal email server “disqualifies” her from the race. To support his argument, he cited federal law Title 18. Section 2071. 
The law reads as follows: 
(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. 
(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States. ",0

17608,Venezuela Casts a Long Shadow on Elections in Spain - The New York Times,"MADRID  —   Europe is facing a migration crisis, the threat of Islamic terrorism and the prospect that Britain will exit the European Union. But the big foreign policy issue before Spain’s national elections next Sunday? Venezuela, of course. Candidates have visited Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to grandstand. Spain’s governing conservative party has met in Madrid with opponents of Venezuela’s leftist government. There have been charges of a virtual Venezuelan infiltration of Spain’s politics. The shadow cast by Venezuela has been so long that its president, Nicolás Maduro, recently invited Spain’s politicians to hold their election debate in Caracas “so that I can also participate, and perhaps I will win the elections in Spain. ” It may seem a little odd, given the host of problems facing Spain. But the reason is simple. After six months of political deadlock and inconclusive elections in December, the only sign of change before Spain’s election redo is the growing strength of Podemos, the   party whose leaders once served as advisers to the former government of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. The stronger Podemos looks, the more its opponents try to link the party to Venezuela, where the economy is collapsing and Mr. Maduro’s increasingly authoritarian government has declared a state of emergency. The message is meant to be scary and clear: Venezuela is a mess, and it can happen here. “One of the four parties that is competing in the campaign in Spain was hosted and formed in Venezuela, so if they want to bring that model here, they have to explain why,” Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, an emerging   party, told a group of foreign correspondents this month, shortly after returning from Venezuela. “It is Podemos which brought Venezuela to Spain, not us. ” The leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, fired back in a televised debate that his opponents were ignoring the issues that could really affect Spain, starting with a possible British exit from the European Union. Podemos had its first electoral success in May 2014, when it won 8 percent of the votes in European Parliament elections. In its early days, Podemos looked to Syriza, the Greek party that came to power in early 2015, as an example of how a new and   party could overhaul the political establishment. Podemos may be poised to do just that. After recently forming an alliance with a radical party, United Left, it could now leapfrog over the Socialists into second place, behind the conservative Popular Party of the caretaker prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, according to recent opinion polls. Such an outcome would overturn the   political order that has prevailed since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s. Given the troubles in Greece, which is negotiating yet another international bailout, opponents of Podemos have made much of the connection to Syriza. But it is the link to the former Chávez government that has been a special focus. A handful of Podemos leaders  —   including Mr. Iglesias, Juan Carlos Monedero and Iñigo Errejón  —   once used their academic credentials as political scientists to work as advisers to the government of Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. They also did advisory work in Bolivia and Ecuador, while studying how   politics could reshape Latin American nations. Opponents of Podemos have attacked the party over its finances and possible links to foreign governments, particularly Venezuela. Such accusations have been rejected by Podemos, which has instead built part of its campaign on denouncing the corruption of established parties financed by construction kickbacks. Before Podemos entered the Spanish political scene, Mr. Iglesias and Mr. Errejón sat on the board of a Spanish research institute financed by the Venezuelan government. In April 2015, Mr. Monedero resigned from the leadership of Podemos amid ideological differences, but also after he had to pay 200, 000 euros (about $227, 000 under the current exchange rate) in back taxes and fines for receiving €425, 000 as payment for consulting with the Chávez government in 2010 to develop plans for a new regional currency. Mr. Monedero and other Podemos leaders were never charged with wrongdoing. However, during the recent televised debate, Mr. Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, repeated previous allegations that Podemos had relied on Venezuela’s money. “It is immoral that a foreign regime finances a party,” Mr. Rivera said. A visibly angry Mr. Iglesias responded that it was a “very serious” offense to accuse his party of illegal financing, particularly since it was an issue that had been already cleared by Spain’s Supreme Court. Mr. Rivera has recently issued the strongest statements over Venezuela during the Spanish election campaign, taking over from Mr. Rajoy, who last month convened his security council to review the safety of the 200, 000 Spaniards living under the state of emergency in Venezuela. With the help of Spain’s conservative establishment, the Venezuelan opposition has also made its presence felt in Spain, led by Lilian Tintori, the wife of Leopoldo López, a Venezuelan politician who was jailed in February 2014. This month, Ms. Tintori, a former television presenter, gave public speeches in Salamanca and Madrid, hosted by the Popular Party as well as a conservative newspaper, La Razón. “Two years and three months ago, we came to Spain and other countries and nobody paid attention to us,” she said before an audience that included three ministers from Mr. Rajoy’s government, as well as Mr. Rivera. Even as Podemos has distanced itself from Venezuela, it has not joined other parties in condemning Mr. Maduro’s policies. This month, the European Parliament approved a resolution demanding the release of Mr. López and other political prisoners in Venezuela. The lawmakers of Podemos abstained, while those of its ally, the United Left party, voted against the resolution, arguing that it was designed to further destabilize Venezuela. Podemos is making “economic proposals clearly similar to those of Venezuela,” Francisco de la Torre Díaz, an economic adviser to Ciudadanos, said. Among those proposals, he said, is “the idea that it would be worth getting out of the euro. ” He also mentioned that Podemos advocates a “massive increase in public spending,” as well as a plan to nationalize some strategic corporations. Mr. Iglesias has denied having any plan to drop the euro, dismissing warnings by Mr. Rivera and others as fallacious scaremongering. Podemos has gradually watered down its demands for an economic overhaul. Its latest party program seeks an increase in public spending of €60 billion, less than its previous proposal of €96 billion. Despite this, some conservative associations have recently been formed to help prevent Podemos from turning Spain into the next Venezuela. “We want to denounce the situation in Venezuela and warn about what could happen in Spain,” said Andrés Redondo, the president of an association called Let Us Save Democracy, which was formed in Madrid last year. “We want Venezuelans to share their experience with Spaniards,” he said, “so as to make voters here, particularly the young, wake up and realize that all the terrible things happening there are now happening here. ”",0
17609,Tim Kaine Cheers End of White Majority in Spanish Address,"Tim Kaine Cheers End of White Majority in Spanish Address Julia Hahn, Breitbart, November 5, 2016 
During an Arizona speech delivered in Spanish, Sen. Tim Kaine cheered the demographic transformation of the United States caused by the nation’s federal immigration policies, telling his Latino audience on Thursday, “You are the future of America.” 
“By 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population,” Kaine said. “So, of course, Latinos will help shape the future of America because you are the future of America.” 
As the Pew Research Center has documented, this demographic transformation is largely the result of the changes to visa issuance policies enacted into law in 1965 that lifted the immigration controls put in place by Calvin Coolidge during the 1920s. {snip} 
{snip} 
Yet during his remarks, Kaine laid out how a Clinton administration plans to hasten the demographic transformation through expansive immigration policies that would essentially bring about the dissolution of national borders . Kaine explained how a Clinton-Kaine administration would “end family detention,” “close private detention facilities,” freeze deportations, and would give citizenship–and, by extension, voting privileges and access to federal benefits–to the illegal population. 
Kaine also doubled down on his pledge to expand President Obama’s executive amnesty: 
A few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But it’s important to note that the Court didn’t actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the President’s authority, and we will keep fighting for it.

17610,There Might Be Consequences for the GOP Presidential Candidates Who Won't Endorse Donald Trump,"Getty - Chip Somodevilla 
Each Republican presidential candidate had to pledge their support for the eventual GOP nominee when they filed their initial statement of intent to run and be placed on the ballot in the South Carolina primary, no matter what. But it remains unclear of what will happen for candidates who break that rule. 
When a candidate files to be on the ballot in South Carolina, they must write down their name and address before a signing below a paragraph that in part reads: 
“I hereby affirm that I generally believe in and intend to support the nominees and platform of the Republican Party in the November 8, 2016 general election...” 
But a handful of Republicans have opted out of that promise to endorse Donald Trump, including Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former New York Governor George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham. In addition, businesswoman Carly Fiorina withdrew her previous endorsement of Trump. 
And if those candidates want to run again, they might face considerable hurdles in the Palmetto state, according to top Republican officials. 
South Carolina Republican Party chairman Matt Moore told Independent Journal Review that there are “no definitive punishments related to South Carolina’s pledge” but that any candidate who refuses to back the nominee “does so at their own political peril,” adding: 
“The political consequences would be in the minds of the voters. I expect that anyone who runs in 2020 without supporting the nominee in 2016 will find themselves in difficult situation in South Carolina.” 
However, the party could impose restrictions on candidates who violate the pledge, if they want. Moore said that while the South Carolina GOP's executive committee certainly has the authority to impose penalties, they have yet to meet on the subject. 
More stern on the prospect of penalizing candidates who do not get on board with Trump was Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said last month that the GOP is going to take a second look at how their members can launch presidential bids. 
“And if they’re thinking they’re going to run again someday, I think that we’re going to evaluate the process,” Priebus said. ""And I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them.” 
As to whether or not the GOP can bar individuals from running on their primary ballots, University of South Carolina associate professor Ben Means told Independent Journal Review that “political parties have a fair amount of discretion to control rights of participation,” so it would not matter all that much that candidates breached the contract. 
The South Carolina GOP could alter their rules to block the candidates from running again or they could absolve the disloyal candidates in the event of a catastrophic Trump loss. Either way, an evaluation of ballot access is in store for the Republican Party come November 9th. ",0
17611,Mexican Soccer Fans Boo the Star Spangled Banner at World Cup Qualifier - Breitbart,"Mexican fans booed, jeered, and whistled during the Star Spangled Banner on Sunday before a   soccer contest between our southern neighbors and Team USA. [The outrageous behavior by the thousands of fans tainted the World Cup Qualifier, which was held at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.   Both of the bordering nations walked away from the match without a victory but tied at  . The only losers at the stadium were the Mexican supporters who chose an important international game to disgrace themselves by failing to respect another country’s flag. The American and the Mexican teams showed some respect for each other when they met in Columbus, Ohio, in November agreeing to share a pregame “unity photo,” reported USA Today.  However, during Sunday’s game, Mexican fans showed their disfavor for America and its president, donning   and carrying banners with  . S. messages. The negative reaction by Mexicans to President Trump’s intention to build a wall to stop illegal immigration is highly hypocritical. “The Red Cross has protested rampant police corruption, intimidation, and bribery schemes targeting illegal aliens [in Mexico] for years,” reports the National Review. One Mexican Soccer fan, Francisco Cisneros Solano, 27, posed for pictures with friends wearing a   with, “(Expletive) Trump. ” “I did it just for the humor,” he told USA Today Sports. “But this game is the biggest one of all for us (in qualifying). ” Mexico soccer team supporter Hector Rivera said, “We have nothing against the American team apart from the fact we want to beat them. ”  He added, “But it is nice for us to say something to (Trump). ” USA Coach Bruce Arena shared his opinion on the issue of the highly charged political climate between the two countries. “I’m ashamed that there’s perhaps some discord on the political side,” Arena said. “But believe me I think most Americans appreciate the Mexicans that have come to America to make a better future for themselves and their families and the way they have contributed. “We have the greatest respect for Mexico, its people, its football team. I live in Los Angeles. I experience on a daily basis people of Mexican heritage. They’re wonderful people, they contribute greatly to our society in many ways. We think the world of them. ”",0
17612,Neil Gorsuch: Bill of Rights Added Because Founding Fathers Were ’Jealous of Their Liberties’ - Breitbart,"During last week’s confirmation hearings, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch explained that the Founding Fathers hedged in the right to keep and bear arms because they were “jealous of their liberties. ”[He said this in response to Senator Ben Sasse’s ( ) question about the Bill of Rights. Gorsuch stressed that Amendments protecting freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and private property also show the how determined the Founders were to protect liberty.  Sasse pointed out that a number of teachers in Nebraska planned to use the Supreme Court confirmation hearings to teach civics in their classrooms. Sasse stressed that the Constitution “is a negative document  —   it is not the government giving us freedoms, it is us giving the government a limited set of enumerated powers. ” He explained that we did not originally have a Bill of Rights and asked, “Why do we have a Bill of Rights and what fundamental difference would it make if we didn’t have one. ” Sasse tweeted Gorsuch’s answer: Asked Judge Gorsuch for quick overview of why we have the Bill of Rights. It’s worth watching his answer. #GorsuchHearing pic. twitter.   —   Senator Ben Sasse (@SenSasse) March 22, 2017,  Gorsuch said, “The Constitution is a negative document. And the theory behind it, in short order, was to divide power to better protect liberty. That was the theory. If you put all power into one set of hands you are going to get tyranny. And our Founders had too much evidence of that in their own time. ” He went on to explain how the Constitution divides the federal government into three branches  —   stressing that this division was intended to safeguard liberty  —   and how the states retain and enjoy the powers not given to the federal government, another safeguard. But Gorsuch said these safeguards “were not thought enough,” thus the Bill of Rights. He said, “Our Founders were very suspicious and very jealous of their liberties, so they added the Bill of Rights  …     and they enumerated 10 of them, starting with the freedom of speech, freedom of religion, no establishment of religion, [and] the right to bear arms. ” He pointed to the Third Amendment, which shields Americans from having the government commandeer private property for the purposes of housing soldiers. Gorsuch smiled and said he was glad issues tied to the Third Amendment are not litigated much.

17614,Trump’s Inauguration Rabbi: President Likely to Affirm His Stance on Jerusalem During Next Week’s Visit,"TEL AVIV  —   President Donald Trump’s inauguration rabbi criticized the president and his administration for its seeming reticence to clarify its position on Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem, but added that he was confident the president would erase all doubts once he arrives in Israel next week. [Speaking to the Algemeiner on Tuesday, Rabbi Marvin Hier  —   the founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) in Los Angeles  —   said he believes Trump will reaffirm his stance that “Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel. ”  “Trump is not going to let it stand that the Kotel (Western Wall) is going to be under the sovereignty of another nation, or that it’ll be ‘internationalized,’ as the Vatican would like,” Hier said. “Those are unworkable suggestions that are never going to be agreed upon by the State of Israel. Trump has made it clear on so many occasions that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel, so it would be quite a reversal for him to state differently on this occasion. ” Hier’s remarks came after a press briefing earlier in the day by Trump’s National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, who declined to give direct answers when pressed as to whether the U. S. regards the Western Wall as part of Israel. McMaster only said that the matter was a “policy decision. ” On Tuesday, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer affirmed that the holy site is “clearly in Jerusalem. ” The debate swirling around the Trump administration’s position on Israel intensified in recent days when it was revealed that a senior member of the U. S. delegation reportedly angrily shouted at his Israeli counterpart that the Western Wall was “part of the West Bank. ” However, it later emerged that the official was David Berns, a political counselor at the U. S. Consulate in Jerusalem who took up the role during the Obama administration. Later that day, the White House said that Bern’s position did not reflect that of the administration or the president. On Tuesday, McMaster confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s request to accompany the president on his visit to the Western Wall would not be fulfilled, stating that “no Israeli leaders” would be joining the president. Even though Trump will be the first sitting president to go to the Western Wall, the White House said it would be in the framework of “a private visit. ” The Western Wall, together with the Temple Mount complex and the eastern part of Jerusalem, was captured during the 1967 Six Day War. Its final status has not been agreed on by the international community, which views it as a core issue in the conflict with the Palestinians. “The notion that there is a question as to whom the Kotel (Western Wall) belongs to is just preposterous,” Hier said. “This is an unnecessary blunder on the part of, firstly,   officials, and then McMaster. To leave open the suggestion that the sovereignty of the Kotel is attached to the West Bank is just   to me. ” Hier repeated his belief that Trump would clarify matters after he arrived in the country. “When President Trump arrives in Israel, I don’t think there will be any doubt over who has title over the Kotel,” he told the Algemeiner. Also on Tuesday, a senior U. S. official said Trump still intends to fulfill his campaign promise of relocation. “We’ll move the embassy, just give us time,” the official was quoted as saying.",0
17615,Israeli official secretly visits Dubai: Report,"Israeli official secretly visits Dubai: Report By Press TV on November 4, 2016 Israel envoy to the United Nations (UN) Danny Danon (R) and a purported Emirati official (file photo) 
A high-ranking delegation from the Israeli regime has secretly traveled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), even as the Emirati government has no diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv. 
Danny Danon, the Israeli regime’s ambassador to the United Nations (UN), made a three-day secret visit along with his staff to Dubai to participate in a development conference organized by the UN, reported the Israel Channel 2 television station on Thursday. 
The UN conference was held in Dubai from October 30 to November 3. 
The report said Danon’s visit to the UAE was conducted “under heavy secrecy and tight security so as not to arouse the anger of UAE citizens.” 
The Emirati government does not officially recognize the Israeli regime, which would mean that Israelis cannot obtain passports to travel there. However, Emirati authorities reportedly provided special visas for Danon and his staff to enable their trip, reported the Israeli channel. 
Barring Jordan and Egypt, which have open, diplomatic relations with the Tel Aviv regime, Arab governments claim that they do not recognize Israel. They say they would normalize relations with the Tel Aviv regime only when it reaches a deal with the Palestinians, whose lands the Israeli regime has occupied. 
However, there have been numerous reports and public statements indicating covert ties between the Arab governments and Israel. 
In Mid-March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his regime’s relations with regional Arab countries was “ dramatically warming .” Moshe Ya’alon, Israel’s minister of military affairs, also in February pointed to open channels between the regime and Arab states. 
Also in July, a Saudi delegation headed by a former military general visited Israel and met a senior Israeli foreign ministry official and a number of Knesset members. 
Anwar Eshki, the Saudi former general, met Israel’s foreign ministry director general Dore Gold, and Yoav Mordechai, who coordinates the Israeli regime’s activities in the occupied territories. 
In November 2015, AP cited an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Tel Aviv would “soon” open a “permanent mission” in Abu Dhabi. The mission, it said, would operate as part of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) based in the Emirati city. Related Posts:",0
17616,Yellen Sees Stronger Case for Interest Rate Increase - The New York Times,"GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.  —   Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that she saw a stronger case for raising the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, suggesting the central bank was likely to act in the coming months. “In light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,” Ms. Yellen said. The remarks, delivered at an annual policy conference here, indicated that the Fed would consider raising rates at its next meeting in   though most analysts say they think the central bank is more likely to move in December. In trading on Friday, the chances of a September increase rose to 36 percent from 21 percent, according to a measure derived from asset prices. The chances of a rate increase by the end of the year rose to 61 percent from 52 percent. Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s vice chairman, who has suggested in recent months that the economy is strong enough to move, told the cable business network CNBC that a strong August employment report, due Sept. 2, “would probably weigh in our decision. ” But some officials remain nervous about the fragility of this long but tepid period of economic growth. The Fed also may be inclined to wait until after the presidential election in November, like earlier this year, when Fed officials said they did not want to raise rates before Britain’s referendum on European Union membership in June. Ms. Yellen’s speech “leaves the Fed in a stance of watchful waiting, which is exactly where it was at the end of the last F. O. M. C. meeting in July,” Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, wrote in an analysis. “Policy makers are leaning toward a rate hike, but feel that they can wait until they are more confident that the expansion will continue at a sustainable pace. ” The Fed raised interest rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis and predicted four more rate increases this year. Instead, it has kept its benchmark rate between 0. 25 and 0. 5 percent. Low rates encourage borrowing and   which can bolster economic growth. Raising rates will gradually reduce that stimulus, and the Fed has been reluctant so far to take its foot off the gas. Ms. Yellen’s remarks appeared aimed in part at jarring the complacency of investors who had concluded that the Fed would not raise rates in September. Fed officials have repeatedly warned that markets had too much confidence in the likely path of policy, given the central bank’s considerable uncertainty about its own plans. Ms. Yellen underscored the point with a chart showing that Fed officials thought rates could plausibly end 2017 anywhere from nearly zero to 4 percent. Yet she also stopped short of echoing other Fed officials who have suggested in recent weeks that they are inclined to raise rates in September. The Fed’s   committee is scheduled to meet Sept. 20 and 21 in Washington. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said last week in Anchorage that a rate increase “makes good sense. ” He repeated that point Thursday during an unusual meeting attended by 10 Fed policy makers and more than 100 activists brought to Jackson Hole by the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of community and labor groups pressing the central bank to postpone rate hikes. “It’s not about trying to stop the economy from growing,” Mr. Williams said, explaining his view that the economy no longer required quite as much help from the Fed. “We’re going to keep this economy growing we are going to run it hot. ” Yasenia Castro, a protester from Brooklyn, said at a demonstration before the meeting that she had not been able to find a   job since 2013. Ms. Castro, 35, has an associate degree in criminal justice and works weekends as a babysitter she and her three children live with her mother to make ends meet. “If you’re a Fed official, and you think the economy has recovered, tell me why I’m still working as a babysitter when I have a degree,” Ms. Castro said. Fed officials said repeatedly that they sympathized with the protesters, but they added that pushing too hard to increase employment could be counterproductive if it led to a recession. Those struggling now would likely suffer most. “Everybody on this panel is painfully aware of what the costs of the last recession were and wants to avoid a future recession,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said during the Thursday meeting. Much of Ms. Yellen’s speech on Friday was devoted to the question of whether the central bank will be ready when the next recession inevitably comes. Even as the Fed moves to continue raising rates, officials expect that they will not rise nearly as much in the coming years as they did during previous periods of economic growth. That means the Fed will not be able to match the scale of the rate cuts it used to combat previous downturns. But Ms. Yellen said that the Fed in recent years had shown that other kinds of stimulus could also be effective. After cutting its benchmark rate to nearly zero, the Fed amplified the effect by promising to keep rates low. It also bought trillions of dollars in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, forcing investors to accept lower interest rates. “Even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively,” Ms. Yellen said. She cited a recent analysis by David Reifschneider, a Fed economist, that found that the central bank’s new set of tools would most likely be sufficient to compensate for the weakening of its traditional tool of lowering   interest rates. Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was “not actively considering” a range of other possible policy responses to a future crisis. These include buying assets other than Treasury securities, like municipal bonds, or raising the Fed’s inflation target above 2 percent. She also noted that fiscal policy makers could play a role in addressing any future crises. In particular, she said, the government should consider policies that might increase the productivity of the American work force. “Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise productivity growth,” Ms. Yellen said. Among the possibilities, she mentioned investment in education and infrastructure and reductions in regulation.",0
17617,De Blasio administration finds a way to ruin food trucks,"New York Post – by Michael Gartland 
The de Blasio administration is trying to limit the number of food trucks in the city by claiming that each hot-dog and kabob cart causes more pollution than a truck ride to Los Angeles. 
Deputy Health Commissioner Corinne Schiff made the claim at a City Council hearing Wednesday, in an apparent effort to sink a bill that would nearly double the number of food-vendor permits in the city by 2023. 
“Meat grilling is a significant source of air pollution in the city,” Schiff said. “One additional vendor grilling meat emits an amount of particle pollution in one day equivalent to what a diesel truck emits driving 3,500 miles.” 
The new bill would boost the number of permits to 8,000 by 2023 and also create an enforcement team to sniff out violations. 
Since 1983, the number of street-food vending permits has remained steady at 4,235. But there are likely more carts than that on the streets, as some vendors simply open shop without a license and work until they are caught. 
Schiff argued any increase in the number of food carts needs to come with regulations stipulating that the carts operate in a more environmentally friendly manner. 
City Councilman Mark Levine (D-Manhattan), who is sponsoring the bill to increase the permits, wondered if this was already the case. “We have laws in the city about air quality that currently stipulate that any food establishment has got to have a hood over a grill,” Levine said. “Is that not currently the law?” 
Schiff, however, said there are no such laws regulating the carts as she suggested the proposals be delayed to ensure better pollution safeguards. 
“We really see this as an opportunity to work with the council to think through how we might use this modernization act to improve air quality,” she said. “The current laws don’t actually control the emissions that we’re concerned about.” 
Business-improvement districts and residents throughout the city also pushed for delays on increasing vendor permits, saying there are too many already in some neighborhoods, but welcomed increased enforcement. 
“The enforcement idea is a great idea,” said Ellen Baer, co-chair of the NYC BID Association. “Let’s see if this works, let’s see how it works, let’s see if it’s sufficiently funded, let’s see how many resources they need — before we start adding to the chaos.” 
But street vendors argued they’ve waited too long for reforms that would allow them to transition from operating illegally to legally. 
Sean Basinski, director of the Street Vendor Project, described the bills as “far from our dream,” but said he supports most of what they call for. 
“It is a reasonable compromise,” he said. “Vendors have been waiting 35 years for this change . . . We certainly welcome a study being done, but we don’t think that should delay the progress that needs to be made. The time for reform is now.” 
Before the hearing, some vendors rallied outside, demanding that city officials and police stop harassing them and treating them like criminals. 
The bill will remain before the committee while members discuss possible changes.",0

[The man, who has been identified as local musician Jared McLemore, proceeded run inside a bar while on fire, Saturday, before dying of “severe” burns at a local hospital.  “It was the most horrific thing I’ve seen,” said one witness, who added that McLemore targeted the bar because his   worked there. “Court records show that McLemore threatened to kill his ex and was sentenced to probation on domestic assault charges last month,” reported NBC News on Sunday. “The community raised more than $18, 000 for the woman so she could attend trauma therapy and replace her audio equipment  —   which was damaged in the fire. ” One other man was also injured and taken to hospital after he was burned in an attempt to kick the lighter out of McLemore’s hand. He is expected to make a full recovery. This month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that he would be hiring 3, 000 new employees to sort through violent content on the platform, following a spike in video suicides and murders on the site. “We know we need to do better,” said the company in a statement following numerous incidents, which included the revelation that one murder video had been on the platform for hours before removal. Earlier this month, police officers managed to save a teenager from a suicide attempt, which was being filmed on Facebook Live. In April, an Alabama man live streamed his suicide on Facebook Live following a relationship breakup, while a Thai father also streamed himself hanging his    child before killing himself. In January, four people were arrested in Chicago after they filmed themselves torturing and beating a tied up disabled man, who was repeatedly forced to say, “f*ck Trump,” and, “f*ck white people,” while on Easter Sunday, Facebook user Steve Stephens filmed himself shooting and killing    Robert Godwin Sr. before he evaded police for days  —   eventually committing suicide in a standoff.

17620,The Bundy Gang Rides Free,"Good for them : 
âPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â A federal jury has found Ammon Bundy and his six co-defendants not guilty on all charges for taking over a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon earlier this year. 
Standoff leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Several also were charged with possessing a firearm in a federal facility. âŚ 
On emotional grounds, Ammon Bundy and other defendants argued that the takeover was an act of civil disobedience against an out-of-control federal government that has crippled the rural West.

Russia Says Ceasefire in Syria's Aleppo in Place Unless Militants Attack TEHRAN (Tasnim) – The Kremlin said Monday Russia's air force would stick to the ceasefire in Syria's Aleppo unless militants launch an offensive. 
""The (Russian) president deems a regime when Russian air forces don't carry out strikes on eastern Aleppo as reasonable if militants don't start combat action,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Reuters. Posted by: schlub | Nov 7, 2016 1:37:48 PM | 1

17622,"""Собрал наглость в кулак и назвался писателем""","Общество » Практика » Как заработать В советские времена стать писателем было довольно трудно. Недостаточно было просто сочинить что-либо; требовалось добиться, чтобы сочиненное появилось в печати, и желательно не один раз, а потом вступить в профессиональный союз. Зато оставаться писателем было задачей довольно легкой — надо было только хранить свой членский билет и получать гонорары. О том, как обстоят дела сейчас , предлагаем вам узнать на примере писателя Александра Тавера. 0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Наоборот, в послесоветские времена стать писателем оказалось весьма легко: достаточно сочинить что-либо и истратить некоторое количество денег, чтобы услужливое издательство опубликовало сочиненное за авторский счет. Зато оставаться писателем стало делом довольно затруднительным, дорогостоящим и неэкономичным. Можно без труда вступить в любой профессиональный союз, которых расплодилось уже около сотни; членские взносы этот союз охотно возьмет, но на этом его полезная автору деятельность, как правило, и завершается. Членский билет такого союза лучше показывать только добрым знакомым — на остальных он никакого впечатления не производит. Гонорары практически не предусмотрены, особенно в периодических изданиях, где обязанности по заполнению страниц любым способом возложены на штатных сотрудников, работающих за зарплату. 
Выгоды писательского положения исчерпались, а расходы и трудности умножились. Короче говоря, если в советское время при встрече с человеком, которого вам отрекомендовали как писателя, возникала мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многое от жизни получает!"", то в наши дни при встрече с таким же писателем возникает мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многим в жизни жертвует"". 
Тем не менее, и в наши дни появляются отважные люди, желающие быть писателями и развлекать людей собственным литературным трудом только за скудные похвалы, без серьезной надежды на материальное поощрение. Интернет предоставляет им громадное поле деятельности. Каждый месяц сотни тысяч авторов наполняют блоги, чаты, форумы и странички в социальных сетях Рунета своими комментариями, новеллами, эссе, письмами и стихами. Тысячи авторов собирают эти случайные наброски в своих компьютерах и систематизируют их в надежде, что они пригодятся еще кому-нибудь, кроме непосредственного адресата. Сотни авторов, устав дожидаться востребованности, обращаются к издателям — и мигом получают на руки драгоценную книгу с собственной фамилией на обложке. И тут у них возникает вопрос: что делать дальше? 
Писатель Александр Тавер пытается найти достойный ответ на этот вопрос. Его книга ""Эскизы"", вполне прилично изданная в твердом переплете, распространяется как в бумажной, так и в электронной версии. Вопреки наивному мнению, будто книги за свой счет издают в основном люди пенсионного возраста, располагающие свободным временем и хотя бы небольшими накопленными средствами, Александр Тавер оказался человеком сравнительно молодым, энергичным и весьма уверенным в себе. Мы разговорились, я вкрался к нему в доверие, и он вручил мне написанную в третьем лице автобиографию, поразившую меня не фактами жизни, — они характерны для многих, а его отношением к собственному стилю. Недаром говорится: ""Стиль — это человек"". Интернет подсказал: эту крылатую фразу произнес французский естествоиспытатель Жорж Луи Леклерк Бюффон, когда его 25 августа 1763 года избрали в члены Французской академии. Ученый тем самым хотел сказать, что стиль есть неповторимая особенность человека, которая отражает его природные свойства, тогда как идеи, развиваемые им, могут быть достоянием многих. 
""Александр Тавер родился в 1977 году в Ярославле, но большую часть жизни прожил в Сибири, куда его семья переехала в начале 80-х. По образованию — прикладной математик. С 2000 года живет в Израиле, где, как и положено новому репатрианту, успел перепробовать целый ряд профессий и даже попытать силы в бизнесе, пока не остановился на профессии программиста. Он не планировал литературной карьеры, но его своеобразный, ироничный и легкий стиль письма неоднократно замечали люди, состоявшие с ним в переписке или читавшие его тексты, вроде заметок для школьных стенгазет. С этого все и началось — с писем. Получатели хранили их годами, перечитывали друзьям, и не раз Александру доводилось слышать: ""Когда ты напишешь книгу?"" Он в ответ лишь посмеивался: ""Да кому это нужно? Посмотрите на писателей и посмотрите на меня. Я рад, что вам нравится, но книга — дело серьезное"". В начале 2000-х он стал одним из множества блоггеров, и история с письмами повторялась: люди хотели больше, но все разговоры о книгах натыкались на тот же ответ: блоггер развлекает мимолетную публику или постоянных подписчиков, куда ему до писателя. Даже мутация блогов, чатов и форумов в социальные сети ничего не изменила. Он продолжал интересно и с юморком описывать забавные случаи из жизни, в том числе и своей собственной, иногда сочиняя что-нибудь забавное ради эпатажа. Гром грянул осенью 2014-го. Особенный гром, слышный только ему, заставивший остановиться и переосмыслить происходящее. Ответ на вопрос ""Кому это нужно?"" был совсем рядом. Его давно окружали сотни читателей, ждавших от него книги. Они говорили об этом открытым текстом на протяжении многих лет. Так пришло решение собрать лучшие из сочинений, подвергнуть, в меру сил, литературной обработке и издать"". 
Александру Таверу повезло, он слышал гром. Я перечитал ""Эскизы"" и никакого грома не услышал. Что ж, по-видимому, и в самом деле это был гром, слышный только ему. И я попытался уточнить некоторые аспекты этого явления природы дополнительными вопросами: 
— Вы полагаете, что написали действительно хорошую книгу? 
— Достаточно хорошую, чтобы быть изданной и найти благодарного читателя. Я могу сколько угодно считать ""Эскизы"" далекими от идеала и втайне стыдиться отдельных откровенно неуклюже написанных абзацев; но факт остается фактом — эту книгу перечитывают и с нетерпением ждут следующей. 
— Вы рассчитываете сделать литературную карьеру? 
— Скорее первые неуверенные шаги к ней. Каковы составляющие литературной карьеры в моем понимании? Быть востребованным читателями? Я достаточно востребован. ""Эскизы"" я выпускал для сотен, а сейчас меня читают тысячи. Писать хорошие книги? Я считаю, что книга хороша, если ее не только читают, но и перечитывают. Меня перечитывают. Обладать хорошим литературным стилем? Вот тут я вынужден в себе усомниться. Я считаю свой слог далеко не идеальным и постоянно над ним работаю. Все-таки писательство — огромная ответственность; не хочется являть пред очи читателя абы что. Само название сборника ""Эскизы"" символизирует для меня некую сделку с совестью. Я знал, что отправляю в редакцию далеко не идеальные тексты, и даже похвала главного редактора и чисто символические правки меня не переубедили. ""Считай, что показываешь людям наброски будущей картины. Просто сделай следующую книгу лучше этой"". И наконец, карьера подразумевает, что литература станет моей профессией. Я так же далек от этого сейчас, как мойщик посуды на кухне далек от поста генерального директора. 
— Что же такое, по-вашему, хорошая книга? 
— Смотря как оценивать качество книги. По тиражу? Но я видел книги, вышедшие тиражом в десятки экземпляров и намного более интересные, чем другие, издававшиеся сотнями тысяч. Может, по долговечности их оценивать? Хороша ли книга лишь потому, что она пережила века? Сомневаюсь. По красоте сюжета? Богатству языка? Жанру? Тут все зависит от индивидуальных предпочтений читателя. Если уж говорить о личных критериях оценки качества книг, то я считаю хорошими те из них, которые мне хочется перечитывать. 
— То есть все книги, которые стоят у вас дома, хорошие? 
— Вовсе нет. Нравится произведение или нет — труд автора я уважаю. Если откладываю книгу, не дочитав, ей всегда найдется место на книжной полке до тех пор, пока она не найдет своего читателя. 
— Имела ли ваша книга коммерческий успех или принесла только убытки? 
— Ни то, ни другое. Расходы на подготовку к изданию, иллюстрирование, создание аудиоверсии и печать первого тиража окупились, однако рекламная кампания издательства оказалась катастрофически провальной. Я потратил на нее больше денег, чем на все остальное вместе взятое, но на сегодняшний день издательство отчиталось ровно об одной продаже. 
— Получается, чтобы стать писателем, достаточно объявить себя таковым и заплатить издательству? 
— Даже менее того. Можно объявить себя писателем, не платя издательству и просто выкладывая тексты в интернет. Это так же легко, как объявить себя гуру или тренером и давать онлайн-советы. Можно представляться кем угодно и создавать видимость успеха в любой области. Интернет все стерпит. Но несоответствие образа действительности рано или поздно проявится. Гораздо важнее, кем тебя на самом деле признают другие. Люди, читавшие мои сочинения, признали меня писателем, как бы скептически я ни относился к такой оценке своего творчества. Когда накопилась некая критическая масса читателей, считающих меня интересным автором, когда у них появилось желание стать обладателями моих книг, я собрал всю свою наглость в кулак и назвался писателем. Разумеется, такое признание льстит моему самолюбию, и я много работаю над тем, чтобы действительно заслуживать это звание. 
— Состоите ли вы в какой-либо писательской организации? Помогают ли такие объединения писателю-новичку? 
— Я настолько новый человек в литературной среде, что еще не успел присоединиться ни к одному профессиональному писательскому союзу. Очень хочется присоединиться к союзу или литобъединению, подходящему мне по духу и открывающимся возможностям. Пока я лишь присматриваюсь к тем немногим, которые удалось найти, слежу за их активностью и мероприятиями. К сожалению, в Рамат-Гане, где я живу, пока не нашел ни одного. Очень надеюсь, что просто плохо искал, и на самом деле они существуют. Просто числиться где-то так же легко, как и объявить себя писателем. Я как автор, остро чувствующий ответственность перед читателем за качество своих произведений, выберу объединение, которое поможет мне профессионально вырасти. 
Живое общение с читателем, безусловно, идет мне на пользу. Не забывайте, что именно благодаря ему я и стал писателем. Как автору, мне всегда интересно выслушивать мнения о своих произведениях и узнавать о впечатлении, которое они производят. Оценки и толкования бывают разными, вплоть до диаметрально противоположных. Критика учит, а похвала вдохновляет на новые свершения. Юрий Мамлеев: можно ли прожить литературным трудом",0
17623,Activity Trackers May Undermine Weight Loss Efforts - The New York Times,"Wearable activity monitors can count your steps and track your movements, but they don’t, apparently, help you lose weight. In fact, you might lose more weight without them. The fascinating finding comes from a study published today in JAMA that found dieting adults who wore activity monitors for 18 months lost significantly fewer pounds over that time than those who did not. The results suggest that activity monitors may not change our behavior in the way we expected, and raise interesting questions about the tangled relationships between exercise, eating, our willpower and our waistlines. There have been tantalizing hints in a few studies recently that new technologies such as wearable activity monitors, which tell us how much we are moving and how many calories we have burned during the day, might help some people to drop pounds. Those studies, however, had typically been small scale and short term, so it was still unclear how much activity monitors might aid in weight loss. So for the new study, University of Pittsburgh scientists from the Physical Activity and Weight Management Research Center and their colleagues gathered almost 500 young, overweight men and women who wanted to lose weight. The recruits ranged in age from 18 to 35 since, presumably, these younger volunteers would be familiar with and competent using technologies such as activity trackers and any learning curve would be slight. The volunteers were weighed and their general health and fitness assessed. Then, for the first six months of the study, the volunteers followed a straightforward,   diet designed to provide steady weight loss and were urged to start moving more, aiming for at least 100 minutes of moderate activity each week. They kept daily food and exercise diaries and attended weekly counseling sessions. By the end of six months, everyone had lost weight. And then the actual experiment began. The scientists now divided their volunteers in half. One group was told to start logging their daily exercise sessions onto a study website. The others were given a monitor designed to be worn on the upper arm that would track their physical activity and provide feedback about whether they were achieving goals for step counts, calorie expenditure and so on. “We were pretty confident” that the volunteers in the group using the activity monitors would exercise more, monitor their calorie intake better, and lose more weight than the people in the   group, says John Jakicic, a distinguished professor in the department of health and physical activity at the University of Pittsburgh and the study’s lead author. For 18 months, the volunteers logged into the study website or wore the monitor on most days. Counselors occasionally checked with everyone by phone and sent encouraging text messages. After 18 months  —   and two years after the beginning of the study  —   all of the volunteers returned to the lab to repeat their measurements from the start. Most were thinner now than at the start of the study (although many had regained some of the weight that they had lost during the first six months). Those who had not worn activity monitors were, on average, about 13 pounds lighter now than two years ago. Those who had worn the monitors, however, weighed only about 8 pounds less than at the start. “We were definitely surprised,” Dr. Jakicic says. The reasons for the difference in weight loss are not immediately clear, he says. Theoretically, those using the monitors might have been so inspired to exercise that they moved a lot, developed large appetites, and overate, blunting any weight loss from the workouts, he says. But in fact, the data from the monitors shows that those wearing the technology generally exercised less than those in the other group. So perhaps the monitors resulted in less motivation to move, Dr. Jakicic says. It is possible, he says, that when those wearing the trackers realized they would not reach their daily exercise goal, they simply gave up, leading to relatively low caloric expenditure on those days, and less weight loss overall than among those not using the technology. The people using the monitors may also have assumed that, in some roundabout way, the technology removed responsibility from them for monitoring their energy intake, Dr. Jakicic says. “People may have focused on the technology and forgotten to focus on their behaviors” and ate too much, he says. Dr. Jakicic and his colleagues hope to conduct   studies that will directly examine how activity monitors affect exercise motivation and subsequent weight loss. “What these results say to me is that we still have a great deal to learn” about how monitoring technologies affect   actions, Dr. Jakicic says. People’s responses to a monitor strapped to their arm may not always be rational and could result in behaviors that are the opposite of those that the monitor would be expected to encourage. In other words, we humans are strange and often our own worst enemies, especially when it comes to trying to increase our exercise or reduce our weight.",0
17624,Here Is Why the Trump Administration Will Be a Force for Peace - James P. Pinkerton,"Originally appeared at The American Conservative 
Donald Trump played a wily capitalistic trick on his Republican opponents in the primary fights this year—he served an underserved market. 
By now it’s a cliché that Trump, while on his way to the GOP nomination, tapped into an unnoticed reservoir of right-of-center opinion on domestic and economic concerns—namely, the populist-nationalists who felt left out of the reigning market-libertarianism of the last few decades. 
Indeed, of the 17 Republicans who ran this year, Trump had mostly to himself the populist issues: that is, opposition to open borders, to free trade, and to earned-entitlement cutting. When the other candidates were zigging toward the familiar—and unpopular—Chamber of Commerce-approved orthodoxy, Trump was zagging toward the voters. 
Moreover, the same sort of populist-nationalist reservoir-tapping was evident in the realm of foreign affairs. To put it in bluntly Trumpian terms, the New Yorker hit ’em where they weren’t. 
The fact that Trump was doing something dramatically different became clear in the make-or-break Republican debate in Greenville, S.C., on February 13. Back in those early days of the campaign, Trump had lost one contest (Iowa) and won one (New Hampshire), and it was still anybody’s guess who would emerge victorious. 
During that debate, Trump took what seemed to be an extraordinary gamble: he ripped into George W. Bush’s national-security record—in a state where the 43rd president was still popular. Speaking of the Iraq War, Trump said, “George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.” 
And then Trump went further, aiming indirectly at the former president, while slugging his brother Jeb directly: “The World Trade Center came down during your brother’s reign, remember that.” 
In response, Jeb intoned the usual Republican line, “He kept us safe.” And others on the stage in Greenville that night rushed to associate themselves with Bush 43. 
In the aftermath of this verbal melee, many thought that Trump had doomed himself. As one unnamed Republican “strategist” chortled to Politico, “Trump’s attack on President George W. Bush was galactic-level stupid in South Carolina.” 
Well, not quite: Trump triumphed in the Palmetto State primary a week later, winning by a 10-point margin. 
Thus, as we can see in retrospect, something had changed within the GOP. After 9/11, in the early years of this century, South Carolinians had been eager to fight. Yet by the middle of the second decade, they—or at least a plurality of them—had grown weary of endless foreign war. 
Trump’s victory in the Palmetto State was decisive, yet it was nevertheless only a plurality, 32.5 percent. Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio, running as an unabashed neocon hawk, finished second. 
So we can see that the Republican foreign-policy “market” is now segmented. And while Trump proved effective at targeting crucial segments, they weren’t the only segments—because, in actuality, there are four easily identifiable blocs on the foreign-policy right. And as we delineate these four segments, we can see that while some are highly organized and tightly articulate, others are loose and inchoate: 
First, the libertarians. That is, the Cato Institute and other free-market think tanks,Reason magazine, and so on. Libertarians are not so numerous around the country, but they are strong among the intelligentsia. 
Second, the old-right “isolationists.” These folks, also known as “paleocons,” often find common ground with libertarians, yet their origins are different, and so is their outlook. Whereas the libertarians typically have issued a blanket anathema to all foreign entanglements, the isolationists have been more selective. During World War I, for example, their intellectual forbears were hostile to U.S. involvement on the side of the Allies, but that was often because of specifically anti-English or pro-German sentiments, not because they felt guided by an overall principle of non-intervention. Indeed, the same isolationists were often eager to intervene in Latin America and in the Far East. More recently, the temperamentally isolationist bloc has joined with the libertarians in opposition to deeper U.S. involvement in the Middle East. 
Third, the traditional hawks. On the proverbial Main Street, USA, plenty of people—not limited to the active-duty military, veterans, and law-enforcers—believe that America’s national honor is worth fighting for. 
Fourth, the neoconservatives. This group, which takes hawkishness to an avant-garde extreme, is so praised, and so criticized, that there’s little that needs be added here. Yet we can say this: as with the libertarians, they are concentrated in Washington, DC; by contrast, out beyond the Beltway, they are relatively scarce. Because of their connections to big donors to both parties, however, they have been powerful, even preeminent, in foreign-policy circles over the last quarter-century. Yet today, it’s the neocons who feel most threatened by, and most hostile to, the Trump phenomenon. 
We can pause to offer a contextual point: floating somewhere among the first three categories—libertarians, isolationists, hawks—are the foreign-policy realists. These, of course, are the people, following in the tradition of the great scholar Hans Morgenthau, who pride themselves on seeing the world as it is, regarding foreign policy as just another application of Bismarckian wisdom—“the art of the possible.” 
The realists, disproportionately academics and think-tankers, are a savvy and well-credentialed group—or, according to critics, cynical and world-weary. Yet either way, they have made many alliances with the aforementioned trio of groups, even as they have usually maintained their ideological flexibility. To borrow the celebrated wisdom of the 19th-century realpolitiker Lord Palmerston, realists don’t have permanent attachments; they have permanent interests. And so it seems likely that if Trump wins—or anyone like Trump in the future—many realists will be willing to emerge from their wood-paneled precincts to engage in the hurly-burly of public service. 
Returning to our basic quartet of blocs, we can quickly see that two of them, the libertarians and the neocons, have been loudly successful in the “battle of ideas.” That is, almost everyone knows where the libertarians and the neocons stand on the controversies of the moment. Meanwhile, the other two groups—the isolationists and the traditional hawks—have failed to make themselves heard. That is, until Trump. 
For the most part, the isolationists and hawks have not been organized; they’ve just been clusters of veterans, cops, gun owners, and like-minded souls gathering here and there, feeling strongly about the issues but never finding a national megaphone. Indeed, even organized groups, such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, sizable as they might be, have had little impact, of late, on foreign affairs. 
This paradoxical reality—that even big groups can be voiceless, allowing smaller groups to carry the day—is well understood. Back in 1839, the historian Thomas Carlyle observed of his Britain, “The speaking classes speak and debate,” while the “deep-buried [working] class lies like an Enceladus”—a mythological giant imprisoned under a volcano. Yet, Carlyle continued, the giant under the volcano will not stay silent forever; one day it will erupt, and the inevitable eruption “has to produce earthquakes!” 
In our time, Trump has provoked the Enceladus-like earthquake. Over the past year, while the mainstream media has continued to lavish attention on the fine points of libertarianism and neoconservatism, the Peoples of the Volcano have blown up American politics. 
Trump has spoken loudly to both of his groups. To the isolationists, he has highlighted his past opposition to the Iraq and Libya misadventures, as well as his suspicions about NATO and other alliances. (Here the libertarians, too, are on board.) At the same time, he has also talked the language of the hawks, as when he has said, “Take the oil” and “Bomb the [bleep] out of them.” Trump has also attacked the Iran nuclear agreement, deriding it as “one of the worst deals ever made.” 
Thus earlier this year Trump mobilized the isolationists and the hawks, leaving the libertarians to Rand Paul and the neocons to Rubio. 
Now as we move to the general election, it appears that Trump has kept the loyalty of his core groups. Many libertarians, meanwhile, are voting for Gary Johnson—the former Republican governor at the top of the Libertarian Party’s ticket—and they are being joined, most likely as a one-off, by disaffected Republicans and Democrats. Meanwhile, the neocons, most of them, have become the objective allies, if not the overt supporters, of Hillary Clinton. 
Even if Trump loses, his energized supporters, having found their voice, will be a new and important force within the GOP—a force that could make it significantly harder for a future president to, say, “liberate” and “democratize” Syria. 
♦♦♦ 
Yet now we must skip past the unknown unknowns of the election and ask: what might we expect if Trump becomes president? 
One immediate point to be borne in mind is that it will be a challenge to fill the cabinet and the sub-cabinet—to say nothing of the thousands of “Schedule C” positions across the administration—with true Trump loyalists. Yes, of course, if Trump wins that means he will have garnered 50 million or more votes, but still, the number of people who have the right credentials and can pass all the background checks—including, for most of the top jobs, Senate confirmation—is minuscule. 
So here we might single out the foreign-policy realists as likely having a bright future in a Trump administration: after all, they are often well-credentialed and, by their nature, have prudently tended to keep their anti-Trump commentary to a minimum. (There’s a piece of inside-the-Beltway realist wisdom that seems relevant here: “You’re for what happens.”) 
Yet the path to realist dominion in a Trump administration is not smooth. As a group, they have been in eclipse since the Bush 41 era, so an entire generation of their cadres is missing. The realists do not have long lists of age-appropriate alumni ready for another spin through the revolving door. 
By contrast, the libertarians have lots of young staffers on some think-tank payroll or another. And of course, the neocons have lots of experience and contacts—yes, they screwed up the last time they were in power, but at least they know the jargon. 
Thus, unless president-elect Trump makes a genuinely heroic effort to infuse his administration with new blood, he will end up hiring a lot of folks who might not really agree with him—and who perhaps even have strongly, if quietly, opposed him. That means that the path of a Trump presidency could be channeled in an unexpected direction, as the adherents of other foreign-policy schools—including, conceivably, schools from the left—clamber aboard. As they say in DC, “personnel is policy.” 
Still, Trump has a strong personality, and it’s entirely possible that, as president, he will succeed in imprinting his unique will on his appointees. (On the other hand, the career government, starting with the State Department’s foreign service officers, might well prove to be a different story.) 
Looking further ahead, as a hypothetical President Trump surveys the situation from the Sit Room, here are nine things that will be in view: 
1. 
Trump will recall, always, that the Bush 43 presidency drove itself into a ditch on Iraq. So he will surely see the supreme value of not sending U.S. ground troops—beyond a few advisors—into Middle Eastern war zones. 
2. 
Trump will also realize that Barack Obama, for all his talk about hope and change, ended up preserving the bulk of Bush 43’s policies. The only difference is that Obama did it on the cheap, reducing defense spending as he went along. 
Obama similar to Bush—really? Yes. To be sure, Obama dropped all of Bush’s democratic messianism, but even with his cool detachment he kept all of Bush’s alliances and commitments, including those in Afghanistan and Iraq. And then he added a new international commitment: “climate change.” 
In other words, America now has a policy of “quintuple containment”: Russia, China, Iran, ISIS/al-Qaeda, and, of course, the carbon-dioxide molecule. Many would argue that today we aren’t managing any of these containments well; others insist that the Obama administration, perversely, seems most dedicated to the containment of climate change: everything else can fall apart, but if the Obamans can maintain the illusion of their international CO2 deals, as far as they are concerned all will be well. 
In addition, Uncle Sam has another hundred or so minor commitments—including bilateral defense treaties with countries most Americans have never heard of, along with special commitments to champion the rights of children, women, dissidents, endangered species, etc. On a one-by-one basis, it’s possible to admire many of these efforts; on a cumulative basis, it’s impossible to imagine how we can sustain all of them. 
3. A populist president like Trump will further realize that if the U.S. has just 4 percent of the world’s population and barely more than a fifth of world GDP, it’s not possible that we can continue to police the planet. Yes, we have many allies—on paper. Yet Trump’s critique of many of them as feckless, even faithless, resonated for one big reason: it was true. 
So Trump will likely begin the process of rethinking U.S. commitments around the world. Do we really want to risk nuclear war over the Spratly Islands? Or the eastern marches of Ukraine? Here, Trump might well default to the wisdom of the realists: big powers are just that—big powers—and so one must deal with them in all their authoritarian essentiality. And as for all the other countries of the world—some we like and some we don’t—we’re not going to change them, either. (Although in some cases, notably Iraq and Syria, partition, supervised by the great powers, may be the only solution.) 
4. 
Trump will surely see world diplomacy as an extension of what he has done best all his life—making deals. This instinct will serve him well in two ways: first, he will be sharply separating himself from his predecessors, Bush the hot-blooded unilateralist war-of-choicer and Obama the cool and detached multilateralist leader-from-behind. Second, his deal-making desire will inspire him do what needs to be done: build rapport with world leaders as a prelude to making things happen. 
To cite one immediate example: there’s no way that we will ever achieve anything resembling “peace with honor” in Afghanistan without the full cooperation of the Taliban’s masters in Pakistan. Ergo, the needed deal must be struck in Islamabad, not Kabul. 
Almost certainly, a President Trump will treat China and Russia as legitimate powers, not as rogue states that must be single-handedly tamed by America. 
Moreover, Trump’s deal-making trope also suggests that instead of sacrificing American economic interests on the altar of U.S. “leadership,” he will view the strengthening of the American economy as central to American greatness. 
5. 
Trump will further realize that his friends the realists have had a blind spot of late when it comes to economic matters. Once upon a time—that is, in the 19th century—economic nationalism was at the forefront of American foreign-policy making. In the old days, as America’s Manifest Destiny stretched beyond the continental U.S., expansionism and Hamiltonianism went together: as they used to say, trade follows the flag. Theodore Roosevelt’s digging of the Panama Canal surely ranks as one of the most successful fusions of foreign and economic policy in American history. 
Yet in the past few decades, the economic nationalists and the foreign-policy realists have drifted apart. For example, a Reagan official, Clyde Prestowitz of the Economic Strategy Institute, has been mostly ignored by the realists, who have instead embraced the conventional elite view of free trade and globalization. 
So a President Trump will have the opportunity to reunite realism and economic nationalism; he can once again put manufacturing exports, for example, at the top of the U.S. agenda. Indeed, Trump might consider other economic-nationalist gambits: for example, if we are currently defending such wealthy countries as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Norway, why aren’t they investing some of the trillions of dollars in their sovereign-wealth funds into, say, American infrastructure? 
6. 
Trump will also come into power realizing that he has few friends in the foreign-policy establishment; after all, most establishmentarians opposed him vehemently. Yet that could turn out to be a real plus for the 45th president because it could enable him to discard the stodgy and outworn thinking of the “experts.” In particular, he could refute the prevailing view that the U.S. is, and always must be, the benign hegemon, altruistically policing the world, while allowing its allies, satellites—and even rivals—to manufacture everything and thereby generate the jobs, profits, and knowhow. That was always, of course, a view that elevated the ambitions and pretensions of the American elite over the well-being of the larger U.S. population—and maybe Trump can come up with a better and fairer vision. 
7. 
As an instinctive deal-maker, Trump will have the capacity to clear away the underbrush of accumulated obsolete doctrines and dogmas. To cite just one small but tragic example, there’s the dopey chain of thinking that has guided U.S. policy toward South Sudan. Today, we officially condemn both sides in that country’s ongoing civil war. Yet we might ask, how can that work out well for American interests? After all, one side or the other is going to win, and we presumably want a friend in Juba, not a Chinese-affiliated foe. 
On the larger canvas, Trump will observe that if the U.S., China, and Russia are the three countries capable of destroying the world, then it’s smart to figure out amodus vivendi among this threesome. Such practical deal-making, of course, would undermine the moralistic narrative that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are the potentates of new evil empires. 
8. 
Whether or not he’s currently familiar with the terminology, Trump seems likely to recapitulate the “multipolar” system envisioned by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. Back then, the multipolar vision included the U.S., the USSR, Western Europe, China, and Japan. 
Yet multipolarity was lost in the ’80s, as the American economy was Reaganized, the Cold War grew colder, and the Soviet Union staggered to its self-implosion. Then in the ’90s we had the “unipolar moment,” when the U.S. enjoyed “hyper-power” primacy. 
Yet as with all moments, unipolarity soon passed, undone by the Iraq quagmire, America’s economic stagnation, and the rise of other powers. So today, multipolarity seems destined to re-emerge with a slightly upgraded cast of players: the U.S., China, Russia, the European Union, and perhaps India. 
9. 
And, of course, Trump will have to build that wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. 
♦♦♦ 
Some might object that I am reading too much into Trump. Indeed, the conventional wisdom, even today, maintains that Trump is visceral, not intellectual, that he is buffoonish, not Kissingerian. 
To such critics, this Trump supporter feels compelled to respond: when has the conventional wisdom about the New Yorker been proven correct? 
It’s not easy to become president. In all of U.S. history, just 42 individuals have been elected to the presidency—or to the vice presidency and succeeded a fallen president. That is, indeed, an exclusive club. Or as Trump himself might say, it’s not a club for dummies. 
If Trump does, in fact, become the 45th president, then by definition, he will have proven himself to be pretty darn strategic. And that’s a portent that bodes well for his foreign policy.

17625,"A Florida of Sun, Sky, Sea and Mind - The New York Times","GULFThe Making of an American SeaBy Jack E. DavisIllustrated. 592 pages. Liveright. $29. 95. SUNSHINE STATEEssaysBy Sarah Gerard359 pages. Harper Perennial. $15. 99. Florida is a place and a state of mind. As the former, it’s lovely but afflicted, like Fay Wray in the hands of King Kong (developers). As the latter, it leaves much to be desired. I went to high school in southwest Florida. The malcontents pronounced it  . Florida is a supposedly fun place that has a lot of sadness clinging to it, like barnacles to a boat’s hull. The novelist Cynthia Ozick is not someone I can imagine enjoying blender margaritas down at the beach bar, with sand in her toes. Yet Ozick was not far off, in her short story “Rosa,” when she wrote: “The whole peninsula of Florida was weighted down with regret. Everyone had left behind a real life. ” One of the themes of “Sunshine State,” Sarah Gerard’s striking book of essays, is how Florida can unmoor you and make you reach for shoddy,    solutions to your psychic unease. Gerard grew up in Clearwater, a beach city near Tampa. She writes about how her otherwise incredulous parents (they met in a biker bar he was wearing a   Jimmy Buffett  ) fell into New Thought, a   movement. Almost as bad, they signed on with Amway. That company,   by the    of Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, can, many have argued, resemble a pyramid scheme. Gerard decides that dabbling with Amway was, in her perfect phrase, a form of “achievement tourism. ” She writes, “We left reality for a moment and believed the impossible was possible. ” Gerard’s essay collection is one of two new books that examine the Florida experiment. The other is Jack E. Davis’s “Gulf: The Making of an American Sea,” a sensitive and sturdy work of environmental history. Obviously, the Gulf of Mexico does not belong solely to Florida. It is the   body of water in the world. It touches several other countries  —   indeed, it is named for one of them  —   as well as other American states. But Davis lives in Florida, and that state’s wet western edges run along a vast amount of the Gulf’ like salt on the rim of a cocktail. He can’t help but dwell often upon his home place. Thanks to books by John Jeremiah Sullivan (“Pulphead”) and Leslie Jamison (“The Empathy Exams”) and a handful of other young writers, the essay collection has new impetus and drama in American letters. The essay has gained ground on the short story. “Sunshine State” deserves to be talked about in this company, even if its essays are   . When Gerard is on, she is really on. She’s the author of one previous book, the novel “Binary Star” (2015). The first essay is a knockout, a lurid red heart wrapped in barbed wire. It’s called “BFF,” and it’s about the author’s intense friendship with a girl who grew up to become a stripper and who spent time in shelters for battered women. This essay is about attraction and betrayal, and has the sinister propulsion of a Mary Gaitskill short story. “You shinier,” Gerard writes about her friend. “You prettier. You taller. You thinner, more popular. In middle school, you had friends and I had you. ” They’d had tattoos on their hips that read, when they stood side by side, “Forever    ever. ” Their eventual split was devastating. The author had the means to get out of town the friend did not. Gerard catalogs the lies her friend told her, then she lists her own. She writes about her damage, splitting her face open while jumping from a train. This essay draws blood. Many of the essays in “Sunshine State” fall somewhere between memoir and journalism. Two of the longer pieces, about work to care for the homeless in Florida and about a troubled bird sanctuary, are serious and impeccably reported. But the author’s voice is lost in the telling. She’s best when her evocations of the frenzy that is Florida are personal. Historians, inspired by Fernand Braudel’s epic 1949   study of the Mediterranean Sea (1949) have written books about most of the world’s important bodies of water. Davis’s “Gulf” is the first comprehensive history of the Gulf of Mexico, a place that tends to be, he persuasively argues, “excluded from the central narrative of the American experience. ” Texas and Louisiana also have a great deal of   real estate, and Davis’s book does not skimp on their histories. But since Gerard, Davis and I each grew up staring at the same   water off Florida, I will stick with Florida in this review. Davis carefully relates its history, from the state’s native people and its earliest European explorers, through the early history of the United States and the arrival of tourists, developers and those who would fish and hunt Florida to depletion. The author has a   mind, and frequently views the history of the Gulf through the prism of artists and writers including Winslow Homer, Wallace Stevens, Ernest Hemingway and John D. MacDonald. His prose is supple and clear. About the arrival of motorized shrimp boats on the Gulf, he writes: “They pushed farther out into the Gulf, the classical music of a   sea passage drowned forever by the heavy metal of internal combustion and snorting exhaust. Fishers discovered that if they worked past sunset, their trawls were filling with a new kind of shrimp, browns, which rose near the surface at night. ” Davis’s book functions, as well, as a cri de coeur about the Gulf’s environmental ruin. His book runs up through the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. That event aside, he writes, “Every day in the Gulf is an environmental disaster, originating from sources near and far, that eclipses the spill. ” “Goodbye North, Hello South,” Bessie Smith sang in “Florida Bound Blues. ” “It’s so cold up here that the words freeze in your mouth. ” The words in Gerard’s and Davis’s books are   and, in their way, optimistic. Both writers make the effort, essential to any form of love, to see their state plain.",0

17627,"Matteo Salvini: Europe ’Soft’, Islam Incompatible with Our Values","“If you want to live in peace, you have to prepare for war” Lega Nord leader Matteo Salvini has said, stating that Europe must rethink its migration policies following the terror attack at a Christmas market in Berlin. [The head of the Italian Eurosceptic party also told Die Welt he’s proud to be a populist and, noting that Europe has never been so “soft” warned that the continent is in danger of losing its identity and values.  Speaking to the German broadsheet, Salvini said the charge of populism is nothing to be ashamed of, and confirmed his status as a fan of   Donald Trump. The Lega Nord (Northern League) leader said accusations of populism are a “compliment” and a “reason to be proud”. “I have a shirt [emblazoned on which are the] words ‘I am a populist’” he revealed, dismissing Die Welt’s assertion that the term is an insult. “Originally, the term meant one who is close to the people, and speaks the common language,” Salvini added. The mass sex attacks by mobs of migrants in Cologne last New Year “were in a sense a forewarning” of the truck attack in Berlin that went unheeded, the Italian politician said. “We are being attacked and so must resolutely expel all those who have no right to live [in Europe]” he said, and argued that Germany’s lacklustre response to the mass sexual assaults was a mistake. “If you want to live in peace, you have to prepare for war,” the Lega Nord leader added. “Europe is losing its values and identity, it’s lacking security and has lost its sense of pride” Salvini said, and spoke of a “culture war” taking place on the continent. “Christmas is Christmas because Jesus Christ was born. Why should we be ashamed of our traditions?” the populist Italian said, and criticised how, in many Italian schools, Christmas festivities have been replaced with multicultural ‘peace’ festivals. Salvini said there should be no room for “fanatics” in Europe, and noted that “only the law of Allah is valid” for a number of Muslim migrants who reject secular laws. “The problem is not with individuals but the culture of Islam” the   migration politician stated, adding: “It’s backward, and not compatible with our society. ” Noting that 95 per cent of the new arrivals in Italy are economic migrants from Africa, Salvini said the money Italy is spending on putting them up in hotels is being “thrown out of the window”. Far better, he asserted, that the money go towards deals with African governments in which Italy invests in infrastructure in return for an end to migrant flows and easy return of illegal infiltrators. More than half a million migrants arrived in Italy by boat in 2016. In response, the globalist, social democratic government has seized hotels across the country, using them to house migrants against the wishes of their owners. In November, Breitbart London reported on how locals in Turin were left terrified when migrants squatting in the city’s former Olympic village, now a hotbed of crime, took to the streets to protest “racist Italians”. Screaming threats and throwing projectiles, the migrants hailed the Bataclan massacre, in which 89 people were murdered, as a “revenge of the excluded”.",0
17628,Hillary Clinton Finally Weighs In On Dakota Access Pipeline,"Hillary Clinton Finally Weighs In On Dakota Access Pipeline Response comes the same day militarized police forcibly cleared hundreds of water protectors from protest site. Be Sociable, Share! Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland. 
No longer able to sit on the sidelines and remain silent about the battle raging in North Dakota over Indigenous rights to clean water and sacred land, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released a statement on Thursday about the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) fight—and it says “literally nothing.” 
The statement was delivered via email to a handful of Indigenous journalists and news outlets and was said to be in response to a letter that Native leaders had sent to the former secretary of state asking for her help, as the Indigenous water protectors and their allies have faced tanks, militarized police forces, mace, and attack dogs as they’ve stood their ground in protest of the tar sands pipeline. 
Fed-up about her months-long silence , Indigenous youth from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes also demonstrated outside Clinton’s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday asking for some sort of acknowledgement. 
But coming the same day that over 300 police officers in riot gear and armored vehicles—brandishing pepper spray, percussion grenades, sound cannons, and non-lethal shotguns, according to observers— forcibly cleared hundreds of water protectors from the frontline camp recently reclaimed through eminent domain , the response struck many as non-committal and lacking appropriate “outrage.” 
The statement from director of coalitions press Xochitl Hinojosa, who oversees Hispanic, black, and women’s media for the Clinton campaign, reads in full: We received a letter today from representatives of the tribes protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. From the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects. Now, all of the parties involved—including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes—need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens, it’s important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators’ rights to protest peacefully, and workers’ rights to do their jobs safely. 
“What a crock,” said Ruth Hopkins, a Dakota-Lakota Sioux writer for Indian Country Today Media Network . 
“Hillary Clinton managed to make a statement about the Dakota Pipeline that literally says nothing. Literally,” 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben tweeted in response. 
“Kind of a BS statement by the Clinton camp on #NoDAPL, frankly,” wrote MSNBC host Joy Reid. “The outrage taking place out there cries out for outrage.” 
Others noted that the statement “is the most Clinton thing of all times,” as Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting journalist Adam Johnson put it . 
In a lengthy Twitter thread , anonymous commentator @ActualFlatticus breaks down what they say is the campaign’s “triangulation” of the protest. In other words, you're going to protest by our rules. You're going to do it as we tell you. Or you can't protest. 
— Alan Smithee (@ActualFlatticus) October 28, 2016 No part of this statement is concerned with the safety of the water protectors in any way. But the workers are in danger? How, exactly. 
— Alan Smithee (@ActualFlatticus) October 28, 2016 The corporations (her donors) have a right to push their pipeline through sacred land (never mentioned). Despite the treaties we made. 
— Alan Smithee (@ActualFlatticus) October 28, 2016 And what makes it all so unbelievably offensive? Is we all know Hillary Clinton didn't write this. Not a word. She approves, that's it.

17630,"For Donald Trump’s Big Speech, an Added Pressure: No Echoes - The New York Times","CLEVELAND  —   Until Monday night, Donald J. Trump’s biggest concern about his convention speech was how much to reveal about himself and his family in an address that is often the most personal one a presidential candidate delivers. But the political firestorm over his wife’s speech, which borrowed passages from Michelle Obama’s convention remarks in 2008, raised the stakes exponentially. Mr. Trump’s speech on Thursday night cannot merely be his best ever. It also has to be bulletproof. By Tuesday morning, word had spread throughout his campaign that any language in Mr. Trump’s address even loosely inspired by speeches, essays, books or Twitter posts had to be either rewritten or attributed. Mr. Trump’s chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, reassured colleagues that the acceptance speech was wholly original, according to two staff members who spoke with him and described those conversations on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Miller also told campaign aides that he had looked closely at passages that Mr. Trump had contributed  —   handwritten on unlined white pages  —   and was confident they contained no problems. (Mr. Miller declined an interview request.) Even so, one of the staff members downloaded   software and ran a draft of the speech through the program. No red flags came up. The intense scrutiny of Mr. Trump’s words added new pressure to a speechwriting process that has been one of the most unpredictable and   in modern presidential campaigns. A month ago, Mr. Trump began giving dictation on themes for the speech, and he tossed ideas and phrases to Mr. Miller or other advisers on a daily basis. On printed copies of each draft, he circled passages he liked, crossed out or put question marks beside lines that he did not favor and frequently suggested new words or phrases. “I’ve been amending the drafts ” Mr. Trump said in an interview in his Manhattan office before the convention. “I get ideas from a lot of different places, a lot of smart people, but mostly I like language that sounds like me. ” Yet in the aftermath of Melania Trump’s speech, campaign advisers have fretted that they do not know for sure where Mr. Trump gets his ideas and language  —   whether they are his own, in other words, or are picked up from Twitter, television, or, say, a best seller by Bill O’Reilly of Fox News, a commentator whom Mr. Trump likes. Borrowing or adapting may not always be tantamount to plagiarism, but several Trump advisers, who also insisted on anonymity, said that after the furor over Ms. Trump’s remarks, the campaign cannot allow a similar blowup. Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist who is advising a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Trump, said that the candidate could not afford any mistakes. “His speech is the whole game,” Mr. Rollins said. “Viewers have to watch it and say, ‘There is the next president of the United States. ’” In the interview, Mr. Trump said his speech would center on his vision of a strong and secure America that “once existed and no longer does, but can again under a Trump administration. ” His greatest challenge, he said, was “putting myself in the speech”  —   discussing his upbringing and early experiences and relating them to the hopes and aspirations of other Americans. “I was never comfortable getting personal about my family because I thought it was special territory,” Mr. Trump said, glancing at a picture of his father on his desk. “It can feel exploitative to use family stories to win votes. And I had a very happy and comfortable life growing up. I had a great relationship with my father. But my focus needs to be on all the Americans who are struggling. ” He said he was unsure if he would discuss his older brother Fred, who died as an alcoholic in 1981 at 43  —   and whom he has described as an example of how destructive choices can damage lives that seem golden. “Without my brother Fred I might not be here,” Mr. Trump said. “He was really smart,  . I don’t drink or smoke because of what happened to him. I focused on building my business and making good choices. I may talk about that, but I don’t know if I should. ” Acceptance speeches seldom seem complete without anecdotes about personal trials and triumphs: Mitt Romney, trying to persuade voters to see him as more than a rich businessman, devoted about a fourth of his 2012 address to his parents’ unconditional love, his Mormon faith and reminiscences about watching the moon landing. In 2008, Barack Obama described how his grandfather benefited from the G. I. Bill and how his mother and grandmother taught him the value of hard work. And Bill Clinton’s 1992 speech vividly recalled the life lessons he learned from his mother about fighting and working hard, from his grandfather about racial equality  —   and from his wife, Hillary, who, Mr. Clinton said, taught him that every child could learn. Mr. Clinton finished his speech with a   line tying his Arkansas hometown to the American dream. “I end tonight where it all began for me,” he said. “I still believe in a place called Hope. ” James Carville, a senior strategist for Mr. Clinton’s 1992 campaign, said that if Mr. Trump hoped to change the minds of those who see him as divisive or bigoted, he would need to open himself up to voters in meaningfully personal ways in his speech. “If he’s really different than the way he seems in television interviews or at his rallies, Thursday’s speech will be his single greatest opportunity to show voters who he really is,” Mr. Carville said. Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, said that Thursday’s speech would be “very much a reflection of Mr. Trump’s own words, as opposed to remarks that others create and the campaign puts in his mouth. ” “He’s not an editor  —   he is actually the creator of the speech,” Mr. Manafort said. “Mr. Trump has given Steve Miller and I very specific directions about how he views the speech, what he wants to communicate, and ways to tie together things that he has been talking about in the campaign. The speech will end up being   because the speech’s words will be his words. ” Mr. Trump prefers speaking off the cuff with handwritten notes, a style that has proved successful at his rallies, where he has shown a talent for connecting with and electrifying crowds. But his adjustment to formal speeches remains a work in progress: He does not always sound like himself, and reading from a text can detract from the sense of authenticity that his supporters prize. One question is whether, or how much, he will  . He has sometimes seemed unable to resist deviating from prepared remarks, often to ill effect  —   ranting about a mosquito, or joking that a passing airplane was from Mexico and was “getting ready to attack. ” “  is instinct, all instinct,” Mr. Trump said. “I thought maybe about doing a freewheeling speech for the convention, but that really wouldn’t work. But even with a teleprompter, the speech will be me  —   my ideas, my beliefs, my words. ”",0

17632,The Only Way to Save the World is to Save Yourself,"The Only Way to Save the World is to Save Yourself Nov 11, 2016 0 0 
“We are not here to save the world. We are here to save ourselves, but in doing so, we save the world.” ~ Joseph Campbell 
As I write this, some shit is probably going down at Standing Rock . For anybody awake to the tyranny at hand, the events of the last few months have weighed heavily on our hearts. But the thing people need to remember is this: We’re all Native Americans. If you were born in the USA, and you love the land you were born on (which includes the entire fucking planet, by the way!), you are a Native American. You are a Native Earthling, for shit’s sake. It’s all connected. Their fight is our fight. Skin color is irrelevant. Where you were born or where you migrated to is irrelevant. The only thing relevant is this: are you for freedom, life, cooperation, and love; or are you for statism, profit, divisiveness, and violence? As Derrick Jensen said, “We are the governors as well as the governed. This means that all of us who care about life need to force accountability onto those who do not.” 
The media (even the alternative media, mind you) is trying to spin this as a land issue, or a Native American issue. But it’s not. This is a freedom versus tyranny issue. This is an anarchy versus statism issue. This is a life versus entropy issue. All land is free. We just need to quit focusing on imaginary lines and think cooperation first, competition second. All human beings are free. We just need to quit being obsequious to state-driven authority and start asking (and answering) the tough questions. 
The only way to save the world is to save yourself. The only way to save the land from being poisoned is to save yourself from being poisoned (and from poisoning the land, yourself). The only way to save the environment from pollution is to save yourself from pollution (and from polluting the environment, yourself). In other words: The only way to save the Crashing Plane that is the Human Race is to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before attempting to put it on anybody else, and especially before attempting to right the plane. The oxygen mask, if you haven’t gathered already, is a metaphor for health, awareness, and truth. Save Yourself 
“Only the individual can rise to the heights of consciousness and awareness. The more you belong to the crowd, the deeper you fall into darkness.” ~ Osho 
Saving yourself is putting on the oxygen mask of health, awareness, and truth. But what does that mean? It means questioning yourself to the nth degree , to the point of self-interrogation, and then questioning some more. It means psychosocial upheaval. It means getting uncomfortable. It means admitting you are wrong. In short: It means pain, existential pain of monumental proportions. 
Why is it so painful? Because much cognitive dissonance must be navigated. Everything that you’ve taken for granted as a fundamental truth must be turned inside out and given proper scrutiny. After such scrutiny, you will likely find that you were wrong about a great many things. But the only tool you need to weigh yourself against your deep questioning is the following anonymous quote: “When an honest man realizes that he is mistaken, he will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest.” 
The question is: Do you have the courage to be honest with yourself? Because if you honestly choose the moral side of freedom, life, cooperation, and love, then you’re going to have to admit that statism provides none of these. It only sells the illusion of these. 
Statism is about profit, ownership, divisiveness, and violence. It steals people’s freedom by enforcing, and profiting on, outdated and unjust laws (but only if the person believes in the law). It stifles life and human flourishing through calculative debt slavery and by convincing people into believing in an illusory debt. It creates physical divisiveness by drawing imaginary lines in the sand and declaring them “borders.” It creates psychological divisiveness through xenophobic nationalism and conditioned flag worship, setting up an us-versus-them mentality. When, really, the only us-versus-them mentality that holds any moral weight and intellectual validity is the freedom versus tyranny position. 
Statism is tyrannical. There’s simply no way to wiggle out of this fact. It teaches authoritarianism and oppression. It teaches the individual to oppress and to tyrannize him/herself and others. It teaches people to blindly follow and obsequiously respect authority. It teaches extortion and violence. For if the authority of the state is not obeyed, or its many outdated and immoral laws are not followed, the individual is forced, violently if need be, to acquiesce. Comply or die, is what it comes down to. Either that or your freedom is taken away from you. 
So, when it comes down to it, saving yourself is, first and foremost, waking yourself up from the spell that statism has over you . And then it’s breaking that spell. Break that particular spell, and freedom is at hand. Break that particular spell, and ( your ) life begins. Break that particular spell, and you free yourself to learn how cooperation and love actually work, because you will finally begin taking responsibility for your own shit. No Masters. No rulers. That means taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions as a social creature on an interdependent planet. No more leaning on the crutch of authority. No more codependence on the state. Saving yourself is choosing freedom. Save the World 
“The modern hero, the modern individual who dares to heed the call and seek the mansion of that presence with whom it is our whole destiny to be atoned, cannot, indeed must not, wait for his community to cast off its slough of pride, fear, rationalized avarice, and sanctified misunderstanding. ‘Live,’ Nietzsche says, ‘as though the day were here.’ It is not society that is to guide and save the creative hero, but precisely the reverse. And so, every one of us shares the supreme ordeal––carries the cross of the redeemer––not in the bright moments of his tribe’s great victories, but in the silences of his personal despair.” ~Joseph Campbell 
So, you’ve saved (freed) yourself from the grip of the state. What comes next? Freeing others, of course. But not so fast. Just because you’re free from the state, doesn’t mean the state isn’t still there, rearing its ugly head. It is still there, oppressing and extorting. It is still there, tyrannizing and destroying the planet under the guise of progress. It’s still there, trying to suck you back in. It is still Goliath and you are still David. And just because you recognize statism as tyranny and oppression, doesn’t mean that others do. Remember: most people are devoted statists who don’t even realize they are statists. Yes, the ignorance is that thick. But, I digress… 
You’ve secured your “oxygen mask” on the crashing plane that is the human race. Now it’s time to start helping others to secure their own masks. The problem here is: you can’t control other people. And, really, you don’t want to. You want people to be free, after all. That means you’re going to have to convince them . You’re going to have to be creative. You’re going to have to use your imagination and come up with novel ways to persuade them into being healthy. Yes, sadly it has come to that. The only way to bring health to those who are all-too-well-adjusted to a sick society, is to sell it. 
The real kick in the pants is: most people don’t want to hear what you have to say. People are wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance. People are caught up in their own state driven conditioning and brainwashing. Those cops “serving and protecting” the enforcement of the unhealthy, unsustainable, climate changing (game ender) North Dakota pipeline , are all wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance, conditioning, and brainwashing. They’re simply losing their own inner battle and coming up with the only thing they know: the cowardice and violence of a statist. 
So, it comes down to this: What do we (those who are already free and have their oxygen mask securely fastened) do against the cowardice and violence of the inured statist? We teach. We use our imagination to persuade them away from the unhealthiness of the state and toward the healthiness of freedom. We lead by example, influencing them with our courageous words and our actions. We coax them into freely putting their own oxygen mask on. For we know that volition is paramount if freedom is to be had. Force is the way of the state. Violence is the way of the state. A free human being helping others to be free must never use force or violence, lest they wish to be a tyrant. An authentically free human being wishes other human beings to be just as authentically free. 
But, and here’s the rub, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, “Your right to waive your fist ends one inch from my nose.” 
This means that when our health and freedom are under attack, we are morally justified to defend ourselves. And so, the most important thing we can do as free people, as individuals who have our oxygen masks securely fastened, is to stand our ground. To protect ourselves. Which, by extension, means protecting that which immediately sustains us: water, and the land that grows our food. The worst thing we can do is back down and play the pacifist. Like Derrick Jensen said, “ Love does not imply pacifism.” The Goliath that is the state will trample all over pacifism. Indeed, the road to an unhealthy, unsustainable, immoral, and violent world is paved with pacifism. It’s paved with people turning a blind eye. It’s paved with the inaction of people who recognized evil and did fuckall with it. 
At the end of the day, Goliath (the state) is going to be Goliath. But Goliath is only Goliath because people believe in it. We dismantle goliath by convincing people not to give into Goliath’s unhealthy and unsustainable song and dance. First, we extract ourselves from being Goliath by transforming ourselves into courageous Davids. Then, we attempt to extract others from being Goliath. And if we cannot, we stand our ground and point out their cowardice and violence as unacceptable. We draw a line in the sand. We stand our ground. We protect our water. We declare, right in the face of the Goliath state, these courageous words by Thoreau : “I was not designed to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest.”

17633,Why Hillary Won't Unleash World War III - Pepe Escobar,"  RT 
The record shows Hillary “We Came, We Saw, He Died” Clinton is the ‘Queen of War’. 
She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/”humanitarian” imperialist axis. 
On the opposite side, for all his personal pathology problems and incoherent twitter-mouth ramblings, Donald Trump seemed to be on the money when he said that if elected, Hillary would use Syria to unleash WWIII. 
To check out if that holds, let’s start with an essential backup. 
The ‘Queen of War’, at the final US presidential debate in Las Vegas: ""A no-fly zone [in Syria] can save lives and hasten the end of the conflict."" 
The ‘Queen of War’, in one of her 2013 speeches to Goldman Sachs, published by WikiLeaks: a no-fly zone would ""kill a lot of Syrians.” 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: a no-fly zone in Syria “would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia."" why_hillary_won_t_unleash_wwiii_-_rt_op_edge.png 
Predictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillary’s no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war. 
Pass the missile launchers, please 
Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted – as she already was in the past – when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler. 
I have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon – reflecting Dunford’s comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens “consequences.” 
The Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two “existential threats” to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear “first-strike”– which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine. 
The relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual – terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust – exactly because Washington refuses to back down from “first-strike”– only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them. 
What Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved “moderate” Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control – with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences. 
That’s exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions, “things could get out of hand.” 
Also expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed ‘mothership’ of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition. 
And if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s own pivot to China. 
Say hello to my new Sarmat 
A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton – as in Obama III – presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence. 
A Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russia’s financial “weakness.” 
The national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP. 
Besides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks. 
Moreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals – such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2. The Sarmat delivers monster warheads of 40 megatons; boasts a top speed of seven kilometers per second; and is able to outfox any anti-missile shield system anywhere.",0
17634,God Issues Apology For 2016 Celebrity Cull,"November 15, 2016 
In an official statement released this afternoon, God has apologised for the ongoing massacre of talent this year, blaming it on recent pressure to beef up Heaven’s on-site entertainment. The statement, published on the Vatican website, claimed that the deaths were needed to shake-up a flagging variety line-up currently dominated by tambourine-heavy U2 tribute acts and weak parable-based comedy sketches. 
‘Have you any fucking idea how boring Christians are?’ said one Archangel,who asked to remain anonymous. ‘Sure, they mean well but they don’t half know how to suck the life out of everything. Bowie, on the other hand, has already released a version of ‘Kum Ba Yah’ that sent shivers down my spine, and Prince’s rendition of ‘All Things Bright and Beautiful’ had the cherubs dry-humping their harps.’ 
Speaking directly to reporters outside the Pearly Gates, God acknowledged that the deaths had compounded the misery of one of the worst years in decades but called it a ‘necessary evil’. ‘I appreciate it sucks for you guys but, seriously, have you any idea how good our nativity play is going to be this year?’ He said. 
‘We’ve already got Alan Rickman signed up to play Herod, naturally, and I almost shat myself laughing when Gene Wilder started doing his Archangel Gabriel. There was a bit of a bun fight over whether Mary would be played by Victoria Wood or Caroline Aherne, but that’s the price you pay for having so much talent available. Leonard Cohen and Robert Vaughn are sadly now joining the cast to beef up the wise men. You’re lucky we don’t have any wildlife up here,’ he added, ‘otherwise Attenborough would have been underneath a bus months ago.’ Charlie Stuart",0
17635,Obama Ban: Religious Foreign Aid,"Obama Ban: Religious Foreign Aid November 01, 2016 A worker secures relief aid to be transported to a devastated area after Hurricane Matthew passed, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, October... 
U.S. Gov. to Strip Federal Contracts from Organizations that adhere to Scripture on the LGBT issue. 
The Obama administration announced a rule last week that threatens to strip federal contracts from religious relief organizations and charities that adhere to traditional views of gender and sexuality, continuing a trend of governmental hostility toward religion. National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice said the rule prohibits organizations that contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the administration of aid. 
“The United States also needs to do more to institutionalize efforts to promote LGBT rights,” Ms. Rice said in a speech at American University last week on the state of gay rights around the world. 
“As part of that commitment, I’m pleased to note that just yesterday a new rule went into effect that explicitly prohibits discrimination by USAID contractors. This rule means that any organization that contracts with USAID must ensure that all people can benefit from its federally funded programs, regardless of race, religion, disability — or sexual orientation and gender identity,” she said. 
“It’s a major step toward ensuring that American assistance is provided in a fair and equitable manner,” she said. 
Roger Severino, director of the Heritage Foundation’s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, said the rule will create more problems than it solves. U.S. groups advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights lauded the move which affects more than $20 billion in aid programs in over 100 countries. In 2014 The United States cut aid to Uganda in response to a Ugandan law that imposed harsh penalties on homosexuality.",0

17637,"On an East Side Corner, a Christmas Tree Vendor Offers Familiarity (and Spirits) - The New York Times","As temperatures in New York City dip from cold to   Christmas tree vendors have bundled up and hunkered down in the safety of their vans and temporary shacks. But on the southwest corner of 57th Street and First Avenue, Gilles Berube, a vendor from Quebec, works only in jeans, a scarf, a knit jacket and a hat. He does not hide from the cold, but wards it off with shots of vodka and rum. “I was born in a snowstorm,” he says, by way of explanation. Last Friday, in the kind of cold that numbs the toes, the presence of liquor attracted a few customers who stopped to have a drink with him, clinking little snifters of brown and clear alcohol. In a city where the business of selling Christmas trees can become contentious, and occasionally litigious, Mr. Berube is a welcome sight for many in this Manhattan neighborhood, where he has peddled trees for nearly two decades. Because permits are not required to sell Christmas trees in New York, the city does not keep a tally of how many vendors set up shop here each year or how many trees are sold, but the number of trees collected after each season might be some indication. The city’s Sanitation Department estimates it collected 214, 000 trees from curbsides last year, in addition to some 30, 000 taken to mulch events hosted by the parks department. Hugh Whaley, a spokesman with the National Christmas Tree Association, wrote in an email that New Yorkers tend to get attached to their local vendors, most of whom come from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Canada. “It is a very longstanding tradition to sell real Christmas trees from the same location year after year,” Mr. Whaley wrote. It’s Mr. Berube’s 19th winter on this corner. The vendor, who says he is “around 55,” begins the season with about 300 trees from a farm in North Carolina. On this particular cold afternoon, nine days out from Christmas, it’s not exactly a mad dash for trees once the sky darkens. After minutes of careful deliberation, a man buys a small   tree. As children whiz by on scooters and women rush past clutching shopping bags, most find a spare second to call out to the Christmas tree man, who responds, “Bonsoir!” For others, he offers an opening line: “Do you want vodka?” Many turn him down, but Maria Opris and her daughter, Maria Iordache, are drawn in by the invitation, and begin to haggle with Mr. Berube over a small tree. “It’s fresh,” he says, bouncing the Fraser fir against the pavement for emphasis. “Normally, $2, 000. For you? $50. $45?” The trio eventually settles on $40 and a kiss on the cheek. For Ms. Opris, buying a tree and having a drink with Mr. Berube has become a family tradition. “When my son comes, they always have a bit of vodka,” Ms. Opris says. “Sometimes he brings a bottle of vodka and stays. ” Mr. Berube, who arrives in New York City about a week before Thanksgiving to set up shop, works with two assistants. One is sleeping nearby in a van. The other, Courtney Thompson, 22, from the Bronx, is trying to impress Mr. Berube by sweeping pine needles from the sidewalk and rushing deliveries to and fro in a shopping cart. It’s his first day. “He said no at first,” Mr. Thompson says. “But then he said he’d give me a chance. ” Things seem to be working out well so far in this profession  —   and this brutal weather  —   good help is hard to find. Mr. Berube, who works as a traveling photographer much of the year, says he catches a few hours of sleep a night in the van during the height of tree season. On this corner, he says, he has met travel companions, photography subjects and even a girlfriend  —   a woman he saw among the trees over a decade ago. He showers at a recreational club nearby or at his girlfriend’s apartment, “when she’s not mad at me. ” The big sale of the evening comes when an older couple, Anne and Richard Murphy, approach the tree stand and pay $160 for a fluffy Fraser fir. Mr. Berube helps them stuff the hefty tree into a grocery cart, attaching shopping bags to the front with zip ties, creating a makeshift bumper. “He has beautiful trees,” Ms. Murphy, 85, says. “You get trees and kisses. ” Ms. Murphy and her husband share a snifter of rum as they prepare to make the   journey back to Sutton Place and string white lights on their tree. Of course, this is still New York. Faster walkers mutter unkind words at the people who have dared to stop and enjoy themselves on the sidewalk. But Ms. Murphy doesn’t notice. She presses her face to the pine needles, closes her eyes and inhales. Mr. Berube will tear down the display late on Christmas Eve. “The next day,” he says, “it’s like nobody was here. ”",0
17638,New Poll Just Confirmed Nobody Cares About Hillary’s Emails Except Trump Fans,"Comments 
After the reignition of the Hillary Clinton ’email scandal,” the polls indicate that 63% of Americans still don’t give a damn about Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
The House Republicans’ final gambit is the worst example of grasping at straws, and only days later yet the American people are signaling that yet another attempt to revive the Clinton email non-scandal has failed, miserably. 
Recent reports say 21 million early votes have already been cast in this year’s election, which represents roughly 1/6th of the total cast in the 2012 general election and none of those votes will be impacted by the FBI Director’s memo. 
Today, The Guardian reports that voters’ minds are already mostly made up about Clinton’s emails, and recent disclosures are having more impact among Republicans and other groups already not pre-disposed to vote for the Democratic nominee. 
“About a third of likely voters say they are less likely to support Clinton given FBI director James Comey’s disclosure,” said pollster Gary Langer . “Given other considerations, 63% say it makes no difference.” 
Many loyalists are convinced the latest trove of emails, discovered on equipment shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, are an irrelevance. Even if some show more classified information passed its way through the private server, it should not change the FBI’s earlier decision that a criminal charge would be unfair without evidence of intent or coverup. But so long as this is not categorically established, there may be a nagging doubt in some minds that the FBI suspects otherwise. 
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders destroyed the issue of Hillary Clinton’s emails early in the Democratic primary campaign, noting that they’re a giant pile of minutiae and that the American people are more concerned about economic fairness, trade policies and the corrosive effect of Citizens United on our politics. Famously, he said: 
Let me say something that may not be good politics, but the Secretary is right. People and America are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. 
The American people aren’t buying Trump’s lies about the FBI Director’s vague memo – written entirely without actual facts – signifies anything other than a DC game being played by House Republicans. Even CNN’s New Day plainly says at the start of this video plainly that, “Trump is Lying.” 
Republicans are in familiar territory after having run a divisive and needlessly incendiary political campaign this year, and stuck focusing on literally any little thing they can find about the Democratic nominee to distract voters from the real issues. 
It didn’t work during primary season and it’s not likely to work now. 
Watch Bernie Sanders debunk the Republican email spin machine in one minute here:",0
17639,BRUTAL Cartoon Shows EXACTLY What Trump is Up Against This November,"Pinterest 
Seth Connell reports that a new video released from Project Veritas provides evidence that Hillary Clinton herself worked in the operation to rig the election to ensure a win. 
This video is the third installment from Project Veritas, which has released two previous undercover videos showing Democratic operatives discussing highly unethical and illegal campaigning activities. 
The videos revealed such damaging information that two top Democratic operatives were released from their position; when people from the Clinton camp step down, you know it’s bad . BREAKING: Rigging the Election – Video III: Creamer Confirms @HillaryClinton Involvement https://t.co/ozb1frZ7rR #Veritas @PVeritas_Action 
— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 24, 2016 
This third installment includes a shocking number of insights into how the Democratic Party has been running the Clinton campaign. Several of the most memorable quotes from the video include: 
“Nobody is really supposed to know about me.”-Aaron Black 
“So Brad, and Bob, and Lux, and myself are all part of the old school method where, it doesn’t matter what the freakin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf**ker.” -Aaron Black 
(In regards to the “Donald Duck” characters showing up at Trump events): “Skalar [Clinton operative] had gone to some buddy of his who is one of her body people and she explained the idea to Hillary. And Hillary just loved it. Let me tell you something, I think she has the right instinct here. This thing is working, is resonating but that story is not exactly what you want to hear about how presidential decision-making happens.” -Robert Creamer 
The coordination between the Clinton Camp, the DNC, and Americans United for Change is a rather obvious violation of federal campaign finance laws regarding expenditures. DNC chair Donna Brazile was also involved in the coordination with the Clinton Camp as well. 
Additionally, Robert Creamer discussed why the Donald Duck idea had to be owned by AUFC and not by the DNC. 
“The duck has to be an Americans United For Change entity. This had to do only with some problem between Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. That’s why. It’s really silly.” 
Later in the video Creamer revealed why that is the case: 
“Donna Barzile had a connection with them and she didn’t want to get sued.” 
And finally, an explicit admission about Hillary’s desires, straight from Creamer himself: 
“We originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck.” 
Watch the full video below: 
This certainly seems to be illegal campaigning, based on these videos. One of the interns even stated that there was a whole slew of reasons why responsibilities had to be divvied up, because the whole scheme was a mess. And why is that? Because they are violating campaign coordination law, so they have to. 
It’s truly unbelievable. A plethora of revelations now show us how corrupt Hillary Clinton and the DNC are, yet there are still millions of people that support them. If these revelations continue, and they still support her, what can you really say? 
When corruption penetrates this deeply, and when the citizens still wholeheartedly back those who are driving the corruption, the country is in serious danger. 
God help us.",0
17640,The World Is Full of Dogs Without Collars - The New York Times,"MONTAGUE, Mass.  —   Think of all the dogs out there: labradors and poodles and labradoodles huskies and westies and dogues de Bordeaux pit bulls and spaniels and lovable mutts that go to doggy day care. Add them up, all the pet dogs on the planet, and you get about 250 million. But there are about a billion dogs on Earth, according to some estimates. The other 750 million don’t have flea collars. And they certainly don’t have humans who take them for walks and pick up their feces. They are called village dogs, street dogs and   dogs, among other things, and they haunt the garbage dumps and neighborhoods of most of the world. In their new book, “What Is a Dog? ,” Raymond and Lorna Coppinger argue that if you really want to understand the nature of dogs, you need to know these other animals. The vast majority are not strays or lost pets, the Coppingers say, but rather superbly adapted scavengers  —   the closest living things to the dogs that first emerged thousands of years ago. Other scientists disagree about the genetics of the dogs, but acknowledge that   of a billion dogs are well worth studying. The Coppingers have been major figures in canine science for decades. Raymond Coppinger was one of the founding professors at Hampshire College in Amherst, and he and Lorna, a biologist and science writer, have done groundbreaking work on sled dogs, herding dogs,   dogs, and the origin and evolution of dogs. “We’ve done everything together,” he said recently as they sat on the porch of the house they built, set on about 100 acres of land, and talked at length about dogs, village and otherwise, and the roots of their deep interest in the animals. Both had dogs as children. Lorna had several kinds. An uncle brought Ray his first dog, a pup from a female that hung around a loading ramp at a chemical plant in Cambridge, Mass. “He lived to be 17  —   he looked like any other village dog in the world,” he said. After they graduated from Boston University, where they were both undergraduates in the late 1950s, they continued to keep them. “I gave her a dog for a graduation present,” he said. It was reputedly a   mix. After they both graduated, they moved to the Amherst area, where Lorna taught Russian and received a master’s degree in wildlife biology and Ray pursued a Ph. D. in zoology, both at the University of Massachusetts. They did field studies together, but on different subjects, and then dove deeply into the canine world. A neighbor raced sled dogs, and one thing led to another until Dr. Coppinger started racing them himself and they had a hundred dogs housed in cement dens on a hill behind his house. In 1969, he joined Hampshire College as part of the founding faculty, and continued researching energy expenditure in the dogs. He also developed a winning strain by hybridizing Alaskan village dogs with Border collies. For the first time in their lives together, the Coppingers are now without any dogs at home, and they talk with some nostalgia, more about the bad dogs than the good. Like Jane. “Worst dog I ever had,” Dr. Coppinger said. “I could tell you a thousand bad stories about Jane. ” “But,” he said, “put her on a mountain pass behind 3, 000 sheep, and she’d worry them all the way up the mountain and pick up the strays and everything. ” They don’t miss having dogs by the score, but Ms. Coppinger said, “I miss the pet dogs. ” The last, who died in 2013, was Poppyseed Shackleton, a Jack Russell terrier who belonged to their grandchildren, but lived with them. One benefit, however, is that they are enjoying observing a flood of wildlife that avoided their land when so many dogs were around  —   vultures, foxes, deer and other animals. In the early 1970s, they began studying   dogs and traveled around the world finding dogs that sheep herders used. They brought some home and helped develop the Anatolian shepherd breed in the United States, and started a livestock   project at Hampshire to study how effective dogs were in protecting sheep and other livestock. In 2001, their book “Dogs: A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior  Evolution” challenged the way scientists thought about the beginnings of dogs. They argued against the widely held view that one day a   grabbed a wolf pup from a den and started a breeding program. Instead, they argued, dogs domesticated themselves. Some wild canines started hanging around humans for their leftovers and gradually evolved into scavengers dependent on humans. Not everyone in canine science shares that view today, but many researchers think it is the most plausible route to domestication. During their travels over the years  —   to look for sheepdogs, to introduce them to sheep farmers who hadn’t used dogs, to attend conferences  —   they noticed dogs in the street wherever they went, and after a while they began to think about the dogs’ lives. “They were so much more interesting than what we’d ever done before,” Dr. Coppinger said. “Here were animals that had their own unique kind of social behaviors. So we started to study them. ” That was in the early 1990s. He worked with Luigi Boitani of La Sapienza University of Rome, who was studying urban dogs that lived off garbage. “I taught classes in the Mexico City dump,” Dr. Coppinger said. And the Coppingers continued to observe village dogs around the world. They argue in their new book that these dogs “are not mongrels or strays,” as is often assumed. Some lost pets do wander into groups of village dogs. But by and large, these dogs are much the same around the world, whether in Africa, Mongolia, China or the Americas. Dr. Coppinger said he was once told by a Navajo sheep herder that a good herding dog was “not too big and not too small,” which perfectly describes village dogs, too. They are larger in colder climates, but in the tropics, he said, a     dog is the norm. They are completely polygamous. “There can be as many fathers to a litter of puppies as there are puppies to a litter,” Dr. Coppinger said. And after about 10 weeks, the puppies fend for themselves. Most of the pups don’t survive, as is the case with many wild animals. They have remarkably varied connections to human beings. Some live completely on their own at dumps. Some are neighborhood dogs, recognized and perhaps given handouts by people who live in a certain area. Others may feed and breed on their own, but spend nights at the homes of people. Sometimes they are adopted by people. But really, Dr. Coppinger says, it is the dogs who adopt humans. The number of dogs that can survive in a city or a neighborhood or at a dump is determined by the available garbage. The Coppingers calculated that in the tropics it takes about 100 people to produce enough garbage to support seven   dogs. There is precious little funding for studying these dogs, except in the context of preventing rabies, which is an enormous problem, with close to 60, 000  human deaths a year, mostly from dog bites. But some scientists have tracked their behavior. Sunil K. Pal in India has studied them and written a number of papers on their social lives and behavior. The Coppingers were joined for the recent conversation at their home by Kathryn Lord, a former student of Dr. Coppinger and now a researcher at Hampshire College, who studies the development and reproductive behavior of dogs, including village dogs. She shared her insights on what makes a dog a dog, and not a wolf, for example. Wolf puppies depend on their parents and other adults regurgitating partly digested food. “This is all but lost in dogs,” she said. It does happen, but reports suggest that in village dogs it may occur several times a week. Among wolves in the wild, she said, “it’s seven times a day,” and it is an uncontrollable reflex. In one experiment, she tried testing adult wolves by putting them into a pen with unrelated pups after a big steak meal. “They’d actually run around with their heads in the air to avoid the puppies,” she said. “Eventually they’d lose their lunch. ” At which point they would run off and let the youngsters have at it. The point the Coppingers and Dr. Lord make about these behaviors is not that dogs are somehow less caring or noble than wolves, but how perfectly adapted they are to the lives they lead. They don’t need to be big and strong to bring down prey. They don’t need the kind of parental care and hunting instruction that wolf pups get. As Dr. Lord said, dog pups don’t need to catch and kill anything. “They need to walk up to a rotten melon and eat it, which they can do at 10 weeks. ” Puppies, after they are weaned, cannot compete with adults, so unless disease or dogcatchers have put a dent in the adult population, most of them starve. They have a true superpower in reserve, however, that can help them escape their fate. They can convince a human to feed them. Dr. Coppinger recalled a woman in South Africa who had many dogs in and around her house. He asked her how it happened that she had so many dogs. “I don’t know,” he recalled the woman saying. “They just keep coming. ” But what are village dogs? Are they a breed, or a superbreed apart? Or are they just a mixture of many breeds with origins too messy to trace? Adam Boyko, a biologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, who was inspired to pursue canine science by the Coppingers’ 2001 book, has also compiled DNA from village dogs around the world. One of his research papers concluded that village dogs in Mongolia are at the center of dog diversity. That suggests that they are geographically nearest to the place where dogs first evolved. Other evidence has suggested that dogs originated in Europe or China, however, and Dr. Boyko is one of a number of participants in a major study being led by Greger Larson at Oxford to use ancient DNA and fossils to clear up some of the confusion about the origins of dogs. And other village dogs seem to have different genetic makeup. For example, Dr. Boyko and his colleagues analyzed DNA samples from village dogs on remote islands in Fiji and French Polynesia that he hoped would show a historical pattern of migration as people and their dogs moved from place to place. “Almost without exception the dogs were 99 percent European,” he said, meaning their ancestors were dogs on European ships that came to Pacific islands ages ago. Dogs in other places, like Borneo, he said, show almost no trace of European breeds. In a study published last fall, Wieslaw Bogdanowicz at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw led an international team of scientists in analyzing the DNA of   dogs in Eurasia. He concluded that these dogs were different from purebreds and mixed breeds. “I would like to call them a superbreed,” he said. He also found that modern European street dogs trace their ancestry to East Asian dogs that migrated with humans to Europe. Earlier studies place that migration sometime between 4, 000 and 11, 000 years ago. Beyond that, however, lies the ultimate origin of dogs, which is still clouded in mystery. The consensus among scientists is that dogs evolved from ancient wolves, perhaps ones not found in the fossil record, 15, 000 or more years ago. Dr. Coppinger has suggested that dogs evolved after the invention of agriculture, perhaps around 8, 000 years ago, and that today’s village dogs are the closest to these first dogs. But this idea has little support from other scientists. The Coppingers’ main goal is to draw attention to the world’s vast majority of dogs that are hidden in plain sight. They represent a treasure trove of scientific information. Although the Coppingers recognize the social cost of animals that are unvaccinated and running free, they argue that killing the dogs, as some countries do during rabies epidemics, does not help. It’s impossible to kill them all, and because they breed rapidly, the population quickly rebounds. Nor do the Coppingers have any sympathy for rescue groups that, as Dr. Coppinger puts it, “kidnap and mutilate” street dogs from the Caribbean and elsewhere to bring them to American shelters to live as pets, “where they are made totally dependent and entirely restricted. ” This is supposed to benefit the dogs, but Dr. Coppinger argues that they are taken from a rich social environment, with many dogs, to lives of relative isolation. What to do? The Coppingers suggest a simple answer. One way or another village dogs depend on garbage. If society wants fewer dogs in the street, there’s a surefire solution. Less garbage.",0

And the list goes on…(Proverbs 24:21; Hebrews 4:13) Now Hillary and the foreign agent in the people’s White House, Barack Hussein Obama, are being exposed for voter rigging . Obama has been visited 45 times out of his 340 visits to the White House by election rigging guru and former prison inmate Robert Creamer . The new scapegoat for Obama and Clinton is Russia. They are now being blamed for the crime when it is Clinton and Obama who are literally exposed in their own corruptions. America, do not be diverted from these diplomatic magicians from hell (John 8:44-45). The Clintons have been selling uranium ore to the Russians . This is now World Wrestling Entertainment on a global scale, as they continue to play off of each other. They are not archenemies. They are allied in crime together, period. Furthermore, like that of the Bushes, China, Russia and America, as well as the Pope, they are all calling for the new world. They are allied with the covenant of Hell, which I remind you disannulled (Isaiah 28:15-18). Many are wondering why Hillary Clinton is even up on the platform during debates. It comes to this, the American people have been soft on these corrupt criminals, and have been soft on themselves. However, God will not be soft (Nahum 1:3), and these corrupt individuals have been encouraged to act out in a more corrupt manner. Americans have also allowed the appeasers that identify themselves as prosecutors and government oversight to talk big . Yet, they produce nothing when it comes to justice (Amos 5:7). They are the fox in the chicken coop, acting as if they actually mean what they say. They are protecting themselves as much as the establishment in which they are a part. Then there are those who pose as some sort of patriotic representatives when, in fact, they are the same people that have given Barack a pass every step of the way.

17642,A Big Test for Big Batteries - The New York Times,"ESCONDIDO, Calif.  —   In Southern California in the fall of 2015, a giant natural gas leak not only caused one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation’s history, it also knocked out a critical fuel source for regional power plants. Energy regulators needed a quick fix. But rather than sticking with gas, they turned to a technology more closely associated with flashlights: batteries. They freed up the utilities to start installing batteries  —   and lots of them. It is a solution that’s audacious and risky. The idea is that the batteries can store electricity during daylight hours (when the state’s many solar panels are flooding the grid with power) then release it as demand peaks (early evening, when people get home). In effect, the rechargeable batteries are like an   power plant, and, in theory, able to replace an actual plant. Utilities have been studying batteries nationwide. But none have moved ahead with the gusto of those in Southern California. This idea has   potential. But the challenge of storing electricity has vexed engineers, researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs for centuries. Even as countless technologies have raced ahead, batteries haven’t yet fulfilled their promise. And the most powerful new designs come with their own risks, such as fire or explosion if poorly made or maintained. It’s the same problem that forced Samsung to recall 2. 5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in September because of fire risk. After racing for months, engineers here in California have brought three   sites close to completion to begin serving the Southern California electric grid within the next month. They are made up of thousands of oversize versions of the   batteries now widely used in smartphones, laptop computers and other digital devices. One of the installations, at a San Diego Gas  Electric operations center surrounded by industrial parks in Escondido, Calif. 30 miles north of San Diego, will be the largest of its kind in the world, developers say. It represents the most crucial test yet of an   technology that many experts see as fundamental to a   future. Here, about 130 miles southeast of Aliso Canyon, the site of the immense gas leak in 2015  —   the   equivalent of operating about 1. 7 million cars over the course of a year  —   19, 000 battery modules the size of a kitchen drawer are being wired together in racks. They will operate out of two dozen beige,    trailers. Made by Samsung, the batteries are meant to store enough energy to serve as a backup in cases of fuel shortages. They are also designed to absorb   energy, particularly solar power, during the day and feed it back to the grid after dusk. They in effect can fill in for the     plants that might lack the fuel to fully operate because of the disastrous leak. “California is giving batteries the opportunity to show what they can do,” said Andrés Gluski, chief executive of AES, which is installing the storage systems. AES is installing a smaller array for the electric utility in El Cajon, a suburb east of San Diego. And separately Tesla, the company perhaps better known for its electric cars, has built an array for a different utility on the grid, Southern California Edison, near Chino, Calif. The stakes are high for both energy storage companies. If their projects struggle or fail, it could jeopardize not only the stability of Southern California’s grid but also interest in the technology over all. After a smaller, but pioneering battery project at a wind farm on Oahu in Hawaii went up in flames in 2012, investment in battery storage all but dried up for a few years. That installation, which used 12, 000   batteries to help even out fluctuations in the power flow, caught fire three times in its first 18 months of operation. The storage developer, Xtreme, eventually went bankrupt. The wind farm turned to a different technology to smooth its output. Keeping a close eye on the Southern California battery efforts is Susan Kennedy, who helped shepherd California’s energy policy for more than a decade as a state utility regulator and   operative for two governors  —   Gray Davis, a Democrat, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. She now runs an energy storage   one not involved in the   response to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. “The moment one fails,” Ms. Kennedy said of the big bet on batteries, “they won’t build any more. ” As soon as AES’s chief executive, Mr. Gluski, learned last June that San Diego Gas  Electric had awarded AES the big battery contract, he leapt out of his chair and interrupted a meeting in his board room at the company’s headquarters in Arlington, Va. As employees watched in astonishment, he barreled down two flights of stairs, grabbed a mallet and, with a ceremonial flourish, banged a gong that one of his executives kept on hand for big news. Mr. Gluski had not had much occasion to celebrate since he had taken the AES reins five years earlier. The company was struggling with debt and trying to coax profits from     projects around the developing world that are buffeted by instability in politics, currency and commodity prices. His first steps included an austerity program in which he gave up many of his own executive perks: No more   membership. No more corporate Audi A8, with driver. But the more   part of his plan would be AES’s battery division, which was then fledgling. The unit had roots in two midlevel executives who had been speculating about a   future over beers. Those two men, John Zahurancik, a science fiction fan, and Chris Shelton, a former physics teacher, had started talking about batteries a decade ago, before electric cars became fashionable or even feasible. In 2006, Mr. Shelton had come across a professor’s paper that predicted a future dominated by electric cars that, when parked, could be connected to the power grid so their batteries could act as storage devices to help balance electricity demand. He and Mr. Zahurancik bounced the idea off some AES colleagues, who said it was at least theoretically feasible. So the two continued their bull sessions but decided that stationary battery arrays may make more sense than relying on electric cars. At the time,   batteries, the standard in consumer products, were widely in use in the transportation and power tool industries, but no one had paired them with the technology necessary to serve the power grid. Earlier   experiments with   and other types of batteries worked only for a year or two before conking out. A different technology, “flow batteries,” which use chemicals dissolved in liquids in tanks, were considered even more experimental. But lithium packs more energy per weight than other metals, offering the promise of greater energy density and longevity. The trick would be to figure out how to harness all that power, which creates heat, while avoiding the fires such batteries have caused in any number of vehicles and gadgets, including Teslas, HP computers, hoverboards and, most recently, Samsung Galaxy Note 7s. The two hit upon a design and persuaded executives to begin a pilot project in 2008. That eventually led to the first commercial   battery on a grid. Mr. Zahurancik, who owns the gong, is now president of AES Energy Storage. Mr. Shelton is now the company’s vice president and chief technology officer. AES does not actually make its batteries but buys them, along with other equipment, from manufacturers like Samsung, LG Chem and Panasonic. It designs and assembles the arrays, stacking the boxy batteries into racks inside   containers. In Escondido, where local radio stations still carry public service announcements about the   shortage, the AES battery packs are being installed at a critical spot on the regional electrical grid: the place where the giant wires from power plants and wind and solar arrays connect to the network of local wires. The batteries are intended to relieve the pressure on the system. Mainly, they will serve as a kind of sponge, soaking up excess or   solar energy during the day and then squeezing it back into the grid in the evening, when demand surges as the sun sets. There is enough capacity in the containers full of batteries to power about 20, 000 homes for four hours. The idea is that they help the utility lessen its dependence on the type of natural gas plants known as “peakers,” which can turn on and off quickly to meet sudden peaks of demand but are generally used only for short periods and at great expense. And peakers, by burning fossil fuel, are also at odds with California’s   goals. The project is also being watched closely by advocates for renewable energy. The reason: If   battery installations work as designed, they would help wind or solar generators to act more like conventional power plants by working steadily even when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. “Energy storage is really the tool to do renewables integration for a utility infrastructure company like us,” said Josh Gerber, advanced technology integration manager of SDGE, as workers smoothed the   concrete pads that support the containers at the Escondido site. “Without it, you have more risk that the variability of renewables is going to cause reliability problems. ” Under the contract, AES is responsible for making sure the batteries perform for 10 years, after which SDGE will take over. One potential downside is that if the batteries are fully charged and discharged each day, they could degrade more quickly. The executives involved expressed confidence in the design and reliability, despite Samsung’s recent smartphone problems. Not only are these batteries a different configuration than the smartphone units, executives said, but the larger footprint allows for the inclusion of sophisticated monitoring as well as industrial safety and cooling and ventilation equipment. The project, along with the smaller array AES has installed in El Cajon, could provide the    leap Mr. Gluski has been striving for. AES has a deal for an even bigger installation in a $1 billion project in Long Beach with Southern California Edison that is not part of the Aliso Canyon remediation effort it is projected to go online by the end of 2020. The electric company plans to use batteries as part of a plan to replace an aging gas plant along the San Gabriel River. Long term, Mr. Gluski plans to shift the company’s   portfolio  —   still heavily based on coal and natural gas  —   toward more renewable energy. He sees the storage systems as vital components in turning solar and wind energy into a dominant power source in the parts of Latin America, Asia and Africa where AES is active. Whatever progress it has made, AES still has its share of problems, with $20 billion in debt and a stock price less than   the value that it had at the start of the century. It faces wary, if not outright skeptical, treatment by Wall Street utility analysts and energy experts, who say the technology AES is peddling on such a large scale in California remains untested and financially risky. “The problem comes if there is a hiccup with the battery storage business in California,” said Charles Fishman, a utilities analyst at Morningstar. “You don’t have the   parent that can push money to it and keep it out of trouble. ” Despite all the battery activity in California, executives around the utility industry remain cautious. “The reason we don’t have widespread batteries on our system is because it is not   for us,” said Alice Jackson, vice president for strategic revenue initiatives at Xcel, a giant electricity and gas utility serving eight Western and Midwestern states. Xcel has been testing batteries about as long as AES, but almost exclusively in small pilots. “It’s fair to say we don’t have   experience with this technology to say that it is perfect, or a nirvana,” Ms. Jackson said. “It’s something we’ll observe as California goes through its experience. ” California’s latest experiment with batteries is but the latest bout in the state’s long struggle to match its energy needs with its environmental sensibilities. In the early 2000s, after market deregulation and Enron’s notorious manipulation of gas supplies led to blackouts and financial instability among the power companies, state officials decided to lessen reliance on natural gas by encouraging the development of wind and solar. Under Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was governor until 2011, officials pushed through a raft of overlapping regulations that created a boom in renewables, especially solar. But that upended the traditional patterns of supply and demand, making the overall energy system technically and economically difficult to manage. Batteries were the logical solution. But the technology wasn’t fully developed and was still too expensive. In order for companies to make the necessary investments, they needed a signal that there would be a big enough market for their products. So in 2010, the state approved one of the first   mandates, ultimately requiring utilities to install some form of storage equipment in their territories. That set off a flurry of new investment and innovation and, after the sudden closure of the San Onofre nuclear plant on the coast in northwest San Diego County in 2012 when a steam generator tube sprung a leak, new contracts for battery installations. But the Aliso Canyon accident, which began on Oct. 23, 2015, when the Southern California Gas Company first detected the leak, put that process on  . The   gas and intermittent oily mist that spewed forth over almost four months traveled into the surrounding neighborhoods on the strong winds that sweep down from the Santa Susana Mountains. At the same time, it forced the battery strategy into its most   test yet. Now it’s showtime, and the pressure to succeed is high all around. For AES, it could signify an important step for a     relic that is seeking to revitalize itself as a powerhouse in battery storage and other advanced technologies. For   advocates  —   including residents of the Porter Ranch section of Los Angeles, so   that Steven Spielberg chose it as the setting for the 1982 movie “E. T.,” but where many still complain of the rashes, headaches and other debilitating symptoms that drove thousands from their homes during the leak  —   it could be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep the gas depot closed. But the pressure may be highest for the Southern California utilities, their reputations still blackened by waves of forced electricity cuts that followed the Enron debacle. No one wants to contemplate a repeat of that chapter, when blackouts affected factories and even some hospitals. “When the power goes out, people die,” said Ms. Kennedy, the former state official. “Failure is not an option here on any level. ”",0
17643,California Today: How Do Top Newspapers Line Up on the Election? - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) If it were up to California’s newspapers, Donald J. Trump would face a virtual shutout on Tuesday. Of dozens of dailies in the state, only The Santa Barbara   has backed the Republican presidential nominee, Politico reported. But how do the publications line up on the rest of Tuesday’s ballot? Research has shown that even in the digital age, endorsements by newspaper editorial boards still sway some minds. Their influence is greatest when the choice is unexpected, such as when The San Diego   came out in favor of Hillary Clinton, the first Democrat to be backed for president in the paper’s   history. In such cases, roughly 5 percent of readers can be persuaded to switch their votes, said Brian G. Knight, a professor of economics at Brown University, who has studied newspaper endorsements. The effect is also likely amplified on questions further down the ballot, Dr. Knight said. For Californians overwhelmed by 17 statewide initiatives, along with choices on everything from school board candidates to complicated stadium plans, guidance from a newspaper can go a long way. We took a look at how six of the state’s leading newspapers by number of subscribers  —   The San Diego   The Orange County Register, The Los Angeles Times, The Mercury News, San Francisco Chronicle and The Sacramento Bee  —   lined up on some propositions. • Proposition 56 (increases tobacco tax) Yes: 5 (  Times, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 1 (Register) • Proposition 58 (restores bilingual education) Yes: 4 (Times, Register, Chronicle, Bee) No: 2 (  Mercury) • Proposition 61 (changes drug pricing) Yes: 0 No: 6 (  Times, Register, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) • Proposition 62 (abolishes death penalty) Yes: 6 (  Times, Register, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 0 • Proposition 63 (tightens gun control) Yes: 5 (  Times, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 1 (Register) • Proposition 64 (legalizes recreational marijuana) Yes: 5 (  Times, Register, Mercury, Chronicle) No: 1 (Bee) • Proposition 67 (bans plastic bags) Yes: 5 (  Times, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 1 (Register) Tuesday is Election Day.

In 1991, when Magic Johnson stunned America with the news that he had H. I. V. many figured he had little time left. “All of us thought it was a death sentence,” Pat Riley, the former Lakers coach, told The Times’s Harvey Araton years later. But in 2016, Johnson is, of course, very much alive. It was 25 years ago today that Johnson, then 32, told reporters at the Forum that he would leave the Lakers because of the diagnosis and dedicate himself to raising awareness about H. I. V. prevention. “I think sometimes we think, well, only gay people can get it  —   ‘It’s not going to happen to me,’” he said. “And here I am saying that it can happen to anybody, even me, Magic Johnson. ” Johnson mounted a pair of comebacks in the 1990s, but faced resistance from some players, notably Karl Malone, who expressed fears about playing with him. Johnson settled into a new life as a philanthropist, businessman and, in recent years, part owner of the Dodgers. His Magic Johnson Foundation funds prevention of H. I. V.  and other charitable goals. Johnson has said he has to remind people that he is not cured, but managing the infection with a cocktail of drugs. More than 1. 2 million people in the United States live with H. I. V. according to government data. During the 1991 news conference, Johnson told reporters, flashing his trademark smile, “I plan on going on living for a long time, bugging you guys like I always have. ” This year, Johnson turned 57.

17644,Sports Media and Gay Activists Blast Cardinals for Inviting Lance Berkman to ‘Christian Day’ at Busch Stadium - Breitbart,"The St. Louis Cardinals have found themselves in the crosshairs of the LGBT community for inviting former Cardinal Lance Berkman to the team’s annual Christian Day event. [Berkman’s presence sparks controversy amongst the gay community because of his role in the fight against the transgender bathroom ordinance, aka the “Equal Rights Ordinance,” in Houston in 2015.  Pride Center of St. Louis issued this highly critical statement of the Cardinals decision to invite Berkman: “Pride St. Louis is disappointed by the decision of the St. Louis Cardinals to provide a public platform for Berkman, an individual whose words and actions towards the LGBTQ+ are divisive and demeaning. ” The group initially released the statement to Outsports, an SB Nation website which prioritizes news involving the LGBT community and sports. According to the St. Louis   “On its own, Outsports has called Berkman a “bigot” and “an outspoken opponent of the LGBT community” who was “one of the faces of the campaign against Houston’s   ordinance” in 2015. ” Despite the backlash, as of this writing, the Cardinals remain committed to having Berkman attend “Christian Day. ” The team issued their own statement in response to those troubled by the move: “The Cardinals have hosted a Christian Day at the ballpark for nearly three decades. Lance Berkman participated in Christian Day when he was a Cardinals player, and we welcome him back this year to discuss his faith. ” The Cardinals also said they plan to host an event in support of the LGBT community at some point later in the season. Nonetheless, the team makes a good point here. Berkman has attended and spoken at these events before when he, presumably, held the same views towards transgender bathroom laws that he does now. So, what’s the problem? Since it’s likely that the bathroom issue never would have come up on a night dedicated to celebrating the Christian faith, does the LGBT community really want to put the idea out there that they’re fine with tolerating and accepting all things unless Christianity is involved? In his article on the Cardinals invitation to Berkman, Bill Baer wrote that Berkman “foolishly advocated against public accommodations for transgender people to use public bathrooms. ” What was foolish about this? The part where he exercised his constitutional right to express an opinion in a free country? It seems like Bill Baer’s attitude toward tolerance and acceptance is much the same as Outsports and the LGBT community’s attitude: acceptance and tolerance for all  …    unless they disagree with me.

17645,Russia as It Actually Exists Couldn't Be More Different From the One Imagined in the West - Natylie Baldwin,"Politics Russia as It Actually Exists Couldn't Be More Different From the One Imagined in the West 
Real Russia -- a country nobody knows anything about because they're busy dreaming up a brutal 'Putin's Russia' in its place Originally appeared at Consortium News 
In February, the Obama administration announced that it was quadrupling funding for a major increase in NATO troops and weaponry in the countries of Eastern Europe on the border with Russia. Diplomatic relations have faltered between the two countries over Syria. 
And the corporate media in the U.S. and U.K. have again stepped up their demonization of all things Vladimir Putin – he’s corrupt, he personally orders hits on people, is facilitating war crimes in Aleppo, and wants to invade Europe. The media also pushes the idea that Russia is an uncivilized and backwards cesspit. 
Considering that Russia is a nuclear superpower, the largest country geographically in the world, and is the sixth largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (and projected to be number six in 2021 in terms of GDP), the U.S. relationship with Russia is one of the most important and delicate. 
In order to have any chance of conducting this relationship in a rational manner, an accurate and nuanced understanding of the country itself and the history of post-Soviet U.S.-Russia relations is essential. This requires cutting through the misinformation and distortion that saturates much of our mainstream news and political discourse. 
It’s important to keep in mind that Russia has a 1,000-year history of authoritarian rule and only started its climb out in the late 1980s. It is a transitional society, with elements of both authoritarianism and democracy. Putin, along with Dmitri Medvedev and Mikhail Gorbachev, is the least authoritarian leader that Russia has ever had. 
Considering that the U.S. has supposedly been an established democracy for over 200 years, we Americans should consider a few significant problems we still have in order to gain some perspective. Only 55 years ago, African-Americans could not vote and could even be murdered with impunity in many parts of the country. 
Today, we have an epidemic of militarized police officers who are shooting first and asking questions later; more and more people on death row are turning out to be innocent; rising inequality threatens our stability; and, a system of deep corruption in terms of campaign financing has compromised our democracy – corruption that is so profound that two political science academics have recently quantified the ways in which we are now officially an oligarchy. 
Is this any better than Russia’s corruption because it has been folded into our legal system? We certainly have our own “oligarchs” in the form of the Koch brothers, Bill Gates, and the Walton family. Perhaps we can concede that it’s not very useful to beat on Russia for not being Switzerland after only 25 years. 
Russian Sentiment 
A recent poll by the independent Levada Center revealed that 66 percent of Russians feel free and 68 percent don’t believe it is likely that Russia will revert back to dictatorship. To understand why Russians may see themselves as fairly free, it is important to understand not only their history of authoritarian rule but also some facts and observations about Russia that run counter to the narrative often presented in our mainstream corporate media, which is owned by those same oligarchs that have captured our political system. 

When I visited Russia last autumn, one of the first things I observed was that the police in both Moscow and St. Petersburg did not carry guns, only batons. I asked some Russians about this and was told that if an officer had a special assignment, he/she might carry a gun but that generally they did not. This is not consistent with the characterization that most Americans have about Russia being a police state or autocracy. 
Speaking of guns, Russian citizens have to abide by much stricter gun control laws than in the U.S. These include the requirement for gun owners to obtain a five-year renewable license. Before the first license is issued, attendance in a firearms safety class and the passing of a federal safety exam is required as well as a background check. 
One example of how the Russian gun control laws have helped to prevent the deadly types of mass shootings seen in the U.S. is the hate crime against patrons of a gay club in Yekaterinburg that occurred shortly after the Orlando massacre. Due to the fact that Russians don’t easily have access to (illegal) assault weapons, no deaths occurred as a consequence of the violence perpetrated against the patrons by a group of Russian hoodlums who only had small, pneumatic weapons. 
Russia has also had a moratorium on the death penalty since 1999 and its high court has upheld it, while Putin has publicly supported it, even in the face of popular sentiment for bringing back executions for certain crimes. Russia’s murder rate is still higher than the U.S., but it is important to understand that there is a pattern of major improvement since the Wild West days of the 1990s when journalists who covered Russia, like Angus Roxburgh, acknowledged that people being gunned down in the streets of Moscow was reminiscent of an episode of The Untouchables and was a fairly regular occurrence. 
In my visit last year, another woman and I traveled together and encountered no problems or threats, even when we walked from the Metro station to our hotel after dark in Moscow. I felt no less safe than I feel walking around after dark near where I work in San Francisco. 
Although the visa application to travel to Russia is more stringent than for other European countries, I traveled freely when I was there, took photos wherever I wanted, and went through a similar airport security procedure as in the U.S. The vast majority of people I encountered in Russia were friendly, curious or neutral. 
Recession and Resilience 
While Russia has suffered from a recession since 2014 and has seen economic gains for its population suspended since the combination of low oil prices and sanctions, there was plenty of food in the markets and people said that the main hardship was inflation, though that has been coming down and is now at an annualized rate of 6.9 percent. The import substitution policies have shown success in theagricultural sector and are just starting to show promise in the industrial sector. 

The sense I got from the Russians whom I spoke with was that they’d weather this storm and come out stronger and wiser for it – as they’d had to do in far worse conditions in their history. In spite of the recession, people generally looked healthy, were dressed in Western attire, and young people had their smartphones. In many ways, these people looked indistinguishable from those you’d see in any American city or suburb. 
Prior to this economic downturn, Russia had enjoyed consistent increases in quality of life after “the lost weekend” of massive poverty, crime and exploding mortality rates that the Russian people had suffered during the Yeltsin years – giving Boris Yeltsin the distinction of being the least popular leader among Russians of the last 100 years. 
As Victor Kramarenko, an engineer and foreign trade relations specialist during the Soviet period and, more recently, a years-long executive with a major American corporation in Moscow, summed up the Yeltsin era: “The Russian economy was devastated. We went from being an industrial power that defeated the Nazis, showed resilience, rebuilt quickly, and had great achievements in aviation and space to a place where morale collapsed and a lack of trust and a pirate mentality emerged.” 
Why Is Putin Popular? 
The devastation of the Yeltsin era was the state of the nation when Vladimir Putin took the helm in 2000. Having to navigate among ruthless oligarchic clans that Yeltsin had left behind, with no political party to support him and a very real possibility of overthrow or assassination if he wasn’t careful, Putin began to surround himself with people he’d trusted throughout his career. This included, among others, some people from the security services. 
As for the epithet that “once a KGB man, always a KGB man,” Putin was actually not some James Bond-style assassin during his time with the spy agency. He served as a mid-level analyst in Dresden for the bulk of his career. Upon his return to Moscow from East Germany in 1990, he turned down a promotion to the agency’s foreign intelligence operations division, opting to re-settle his family in St. Petersburg instead. His increasing dissatisfaction eventually led him to resign from the KGB. 
Putin then went to work as a foreign affairs adviser to Anatoly Sobchack in May of 1990. Sobchak, a professor of economic law at Leningrad State University, had emerged in the Gorbachev era as a popular democratic reformer and major critic of the KGB’s abuses. He had just been elected Chairman of the Leningrad City Council. 
The following year Sobchak became mayor and appointed Putin as his deputy. According to Allen C. Lynch in his scholarly 2011 political biography, Vladimir Putin and Russian Statecraft, in this position, Putin coordinated relations with the military, police, district attorney, customs officials and NGO’s and handled diplomatic matters. 
In the six years he served in this capacity, Putin had many impressive achievements, including attracting several Western corporations to the city, signing thousands of joint ventures with foreign companies, establishing a substantial foreign banking presence, legalizing the sale of land, allowing for free privatization of residential property, opening an international trade center, and strengthening municipal banks – which contributed to their remaining solvent in the face of the 1998 financial meltdown. 
During the 1991 attempted coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Putin found out that the Leningrad KGB, which supported the coup, planned to arrest Sobchak when he returned to the airport from out of town. Putin quickly gathered a group of trusted men and rode straight up to the plane to protect his boss, a challenge the local KGB chose not to press. 
The Corruption Claims 
Despite Western assertions of Putin’s corruption, with questionable evidence to support these charges, there is evidence pointing in a very different direction about Putin’s honesty. Sharon Tennison – author, program developer and my travel companion in the country – personally interacted with Putin when he reviewed a program proposal for her at Marienskii City Hall in 1992. Although, it was impossible to know who he would go on to become, Putin made an impression on her at the time as the only Soviet/Russian official in her experience who had not asked for a bribe or favor. 

Tennison also developed extensive contacts with young entrepreneurs throughout the country, including in the St. Petersburg area. Several of these entrepreneurs stated that Putin was the only local bureaucrat who had never charged a bribe for registering their businesses. 
This general picture of Putin’s honesty is buttressed by biographer Lynch as he addresses Putin’s time as deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, stating: 
“For much of this time, given Sobchak’s frequent and protracted absences and his preoccupation with national affairs, Putin assumed the functions of acting mayor. He supervised the drafting and implementation of countless international business deals and policy reforms. These transactions did not always go according to plan, and no doubt many profited handsomely from Putin’s admitted inexperience in these matters. 
“During his attempt to establish municipal oversight over a series of casinos, for example, the city was cheated. In another case, the city was fleeced for $120 million for two shipments of cooking oil. Although during this period his mother bought a choice apartment at an exceptionally low price at a city auction, Putin didn’t seem to enrich himself personally. In the one specific public charge of corruption that was brought against him, Putin sued in court for slander and won.” 
Lynch sums up Putin’s character as follows: 
“Putin was not corrupt, at least in the conventional, venal sense. His modest and frankly unfashionable attire bespoke a seeming indifference to personal luxury.…Putin was honest, certainly by Russian standards. He lived simply and worked diligently.” (Lynch, pp. 32-33) 
Richard Sakwa, a British scholar specializing in Russia, has written perhaps the most comprehensive political biography of Putin, covering all three of his presidential terms and how the Russian political system has evolved under his watch, both the positive and the negative. Sakwa interviewed numerous people who have worked with Putin throughout his career, including many who vouched for his honesty and relative sense of decency when handling political reassignments and other delicate internal matters. 
Under Putin’s leadership as either president or prime minister from 2000 to 2012, Russian citizens saw incomes increase five-fold, the poverty rate cut in half, consistent economic growth, and a safer country. Moreover, Russians enjoy universal health care, one of the highest rates of education in the world (54 percent of Russians have a college degree), and 140 days of paid maternity leave for women. And despite the misinformation regularly put out by Washington, including by President Barack Obama himself, Russia’s average life expectancy is now 71 and has been increasing consistently for several years, rebounding from a stunning decline during the Yeltsin years. 
Gradual Improvement 
Tennison, who lives part-time in St. Petersburg, has been traveling throughout Russia since 1983, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, and has established a wide network of relationships and connections over three decades. He made the following observations in 2014 on the changes she has seen in Russia since 2000: 

""During this time, I’ve traveled throughout Russia several times every year, and have watched the country slowly change under Putin’s watch. Taxes were lowered, inflation lessened, and laws slowly put into place. Schools and hospitals began improving. Small businesses were growing, agriculture was showing improvement, and stores were becoming stocked with food. 
“Highways were being laid across the country, new rails and modern trains appeared even in far out places, and the banking industry was becoming dependable. Russia was beginning to look like a decent country — certainly not where Russians hoped it to be long term, but improving incrementally for the first time in their memories.” 
She goes on to describe similar developments further out from the major cities, including in the Urals, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and Perm. New museums, municipal buildings and supermarkets, well-maintained streets, modern street lights and regular snow plowing in the winter were all observed. 
During this period, Russia also became a creditor nation with relatively low foreign debt, substantial foreign and gold reserves, and a rainy day fund built up during the prosperous years. These are some of the reasons why Putin has consistently had approval ratings between 60 percent and his high of 89 percent in late 2015. 
The vast majority of Russians credit Putin with taking a nation that was on the verge of being a failed state, turning it around and creating concrete improvements in their lives. In my many conversations, Russians described him as a leader possessing patience, organization and determination. Overall, they believe his good qualities outweigh his flaws. 
Russians also expressed support for his handling of foreign affairs. More specifically, they see him as standing up to numerous provocations from the U.S. and its NATO club. 
Russian Interests 
Putin is first and foremost a Russian patriot and pragmatist whose priorities, in addition to raising Russians’ living standards, are the security and stability of the country. 
Russia has a long history of invasions from all directions due to its lack of natural barriers like oceans and mountain ranges. In the Twentieth Century, it was invaded twice within a 25-year period by Germany. Some 27 million Soviet citizens, including 19 million civilians,perished in fighting off the Nazi Wehrmacht, leaving one-third of their country destroyed. By comparison, the U.S. lost approximately 405,000 and suffered no fighting or damage on its homeland. With this background, Soviet leader Gorbachev was understandably hesitant to allow a reunified Germany into NATO at the close of the Cold War. 
By the time of the Malta meeting between Gorbachev and George H.W. Bush in December of 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen and Washington had promised it would not “take advantage” of Gorbachev’s decision to eschew using force to maintain control of Central/Eastern Europe. Two months later, Bush’s Secretary of State, James Baker, negotiated a gentleman’s agreement with Gorbachev that, in exchange for allowing a reunified Germany as a NATO member, NATO would not expand “one inch to the east.” 
Baker’s argument was that NATO membership would have a restraining influence on a unified Germany as opposed to a militarily independent state. According to Viktor Kuvaldin, an adviser to Gorbachev at the time, the Soviet leader did not press for the agreement in writing because he trusted Washington to abide by its promise. 
Research by academic Mary Sarotte, published in the Diplomatic History Journal in 2010, which included interviews with participants and review of notes and other documentation from the meetings, indicates that American politicians’ subsequent denials that such an agreement was made are disingenuous. A November 2009 investigation by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel came to the same conclusion. 
After the Cold War, France and Germany believed that the best way to bring Russia into the Western fold and encourage its evolution as a democracy was through cooperation and gradual integration. But the U.S., which saw an intense lobbying campaign by the military-industrial complex and political pandering to certain constituencies, soon began pushing for NATO expansion as well as imposing neoliberal economic reforms, i.e., privatization of the economy and shrinking of the social safety net. Both policies were carried out under the pretext of spreading democracy and both have elicited strong resentment in Russia. 
Overtures to the West 
During Putin’s first two terms as president, he made overtures to the U.S. and NATO in the hopes of some reciprocity and acknowledgment of Russia’s interests. For example, after the 9/11 attacks, Putin was the first world leader to call President George W. Bush to offer his condolences and support. His reasoning was two-fold: one, he saw the U.S. and Russia as having a mutual interest in fighting Islamist terrorism; second, he knew that he had a tall order in successfully addressing the many profound problems facing Russia at the time. 

He would need to put as much time, energy and resources as he could muster into the project of rehabilitating his country, which meant not wasting them on unnecessary conflict with the world’s lone superpower. Going against the advice of most of his security team, he provided logistical and intelligence support as well as access to military bases on behalf of the U.S. operation in Afghanistan. 
In return for this assistance, Putin received the equivalent of a swift kick in the shins from the neoconservative Bush administration in the form of a unilateral withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to pursue a “missile defense shield” in 2002 and the accession of seven more nations of Eastern Europe into NATO in 2004. (Three others — Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic — had joined in 1999) 
Seemingly undeterred, in 2008, Putin ordered the Russian Foreign Ministry to draft a proposal that Dmitry Medvedev took to Brussels, outlining a security plan that would cover all of the Euro-Atlantic community and Russia, obviating the need for NATO’s continued existence, much less its expansion. 
The preamble stated that: “the use of force or the threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other way inconsistent with the goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations is inadmissible in their mutual relations, as well as international relations in general.” 
It also reiterated the intent to cooperatively address any security concerns that may arise among members. The body of the document contains mechanisms for how concerns or breaches of security could be handled. This proposal was sent to the leaders of relevant nations as well as the heads of European Union, NATO and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, emphasizing that Russia was open to suggestions and negotiation on the plan. 
Putin and Medvedev heard crickets in response to their proposal. 
Ratcheting Up Tensions 
Not long afterward, Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili, egged on by elements in Washington, staged a military incursion into South Ossetia, killing Russian peacekeepers and prompting a strong military response by Russia. The 2009 E.U. fact-finding report on the war between Georgia and Russia does not support the insistence by Washington and the corporate media that Russia started the war. 

Five years later, Ukraine, a country where the southeastern area had historically been part of the Russian Empire and the central and western areas part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, became the flashpoint. The E.U., led by Germany, recklessly tried to pressure Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich to sign an Association Agreement that contained terms that would be unwise for the leader of an already poor and divided nation on Russia’s border to agree to. These included requirements that would result in major economic losses and a security clause that implied integration with NATO. 
Again, elements from Washington engaged in provocations. A leaked phone call between Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland (a neoconservative from the Bush years whose rise at the State Department was facilitated by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) and U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt revealed them discussing who would take over Ukraine’s leadership several weeks before Yanukovich was illegally overthrown in a violent putsch on Feb. 22, 2014. Footage of Nuland handing out pastries to the protesters also surfaced. 
Contrary to repeated claims by the West that the violence on the Maidan, especially sniper fire that killed both police and protesters on Feb. 20, 2014, was the result of Yanukovich’s forces or even Russian provocateurs, several credible sources indicate that neo-fascist forces, such as Svoboda and Right Sector, had hijacked the Maidan movement and were the responsible parties. 
The first source is Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet during an intercepted phone conversation dated Feb. 26, 2014 in which hereports to then-E.U. High Commissioner Catherine Ashton that his on-the-ground sources told him: 
“What was quite disturbing, the same oligarch told that well, all the evidence shows that the people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among policemen and people from the streets that they were the same snipers, killing people from both sides. … So that and then she [Dr. Olga Bolgomets] also showed me some photos, she said that as medical doctor, she can, you know, say that it’s the same handwriting, the same type of bullets, and it’s really disturbing that now the new coalition they don’t want to investigate what exactly happened, so that now there is stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition.” 
This assessment was later supported by an April 2014 investigation by Germany’s ARD TV. An even more in-depth forensic investigationundertaken by Dr. Ivan Katchanovksi, a Canadian academic whose family originally hails from western Ukraine, also concluded that neo-fascist elements of the Maidan movement were culpable. 
These extremists had refused to abide by a Feb. 21, 2014 agreement hammered out by Poland, France, Germany and the Yanukovich government in which the latter had agreed to reduced powers and early elections. Interestingly, these European countries have never publicly explained why they abandoned their role as guarantors of the agreement as the violence of Maidan escalated when the putsch occurred the following day. 
Considering that none of these three sources can plausibly be accused of being Putin apologists, it casts the West’s whole narrative of “Putin aggression” in a very different light, including the subsequent referendum in Crimea in which 96 percent of the voters favored seceding from Ukraine and rejoining Russia in spring 2014. 
View from Crimea 
When I visited the three Crimean cities of Simferopol, Yalta and Sevastopol, I had conversations with a cross-section of people, from cab drivers and bus riders to small business owners and participants in what is variously referred to by the locals as “The Crimean Spring” and “The Third Defense of Sevastopol.” I came away with three conclusions. 

The first is that Crimeans, who are mostly ethnic Russians who speak Russian, were genuinely alarmed by the ultra-nationalist rhetoric and violence coming out of Kiev, which resulted in what they viewed as an illegal coup by extremist elements of the Maidan movement, supported by Washington. 
As Tatyana, a professional tour guide in Yalta told me: “No one asked us if we wanted to go along with Maidan. There are Russians as well as people who are a mix of Russian and Ukrainian here. We are not against Ukraine as many of us have relatives there, but Maidan was not simply a spontaneous protest. We are aware of the phone call with Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt, we saw the photos of her with Yatsenyuk, Tiagnibok [leader of Svoboda, the neo-fascist group that was condemned by the E.U. in 2012], and Klitschko on television. We saw the images of her handing out cookies to the protesters.” 
These extremists had attacked ethnic Russians from Crimea who had participated in anti-Maidan protests and the attackers were reportedly on their way into the Crimean peninsula. As a result, Crimeans began to organize self-defense units to protect their communities. 
Secondly, Crimeans did not necessarily think Russia would accept their requests for help. Crimea had been part of Russia from the time of Catherine the Great’s reign in the Eighteenth Century. But during the Soviet era, Premier Nikita Khrushchev gifted Crimea to Ukraine. 
Since both Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union at the time, this was not a problem. However, when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Crimea remained in Ukraine as an autonomous region, while the naval base at Sevastopol was retained by Russia via a lease with the Kiev government. Between 1991 and 2013, Crimeans had voted several times to be reunited with Russia, only to have their requests ignored. 
Putin, as any Russian leader would have, viewed the events of February 2014 as a threat to Russia’s naval base and only warm water port. Knowing that the Crimean population had repeatedly expressed its desire to be part of Russia, Putin decided on an operation to assist the native Crimeans in blocking both marauding ultra-nationalists and representatives of the coup government from interfering in activities that would facilitate Crimea’s quick reintegration into Russia. 
Support for Reunification 
Crimeans told me that they knew the so-called “little green men” were Russian soldiers legally stationed at the naval base who had donned unmarked uniforms. They also told me that they viewed them as protectors who allowed them to peacefully conduct their referendum, not as invaders. Suggestions that these Russian soldiers had pressured them to vote at gunpoint were dismissed as ridiculous. 

Third, Crimeans were very happy to be part of Russia. Though they acknowledged that there was still a lot of work to be done, they viewed the future with hope. Thesesentiments have been borne out in several Western opinion polls (Gallup, Pew, GfK, and Levada-Open Democracy) over the past two years. 
When the topic of sanctions came up during a meeting with small business professionals in Simferopol, one of them stated, “We are suffering under the sanctions, but the sanctions will not make us go back to where we don’t want to be. There are still many Crimeans willing to fight if it were to become necessary.” 
In a similar vein, one participant in the self-defense forces of Sevastopol, Nicolai Kachin, told me: “Sevastopol was the first city to rise up in Crimea. If residents hadn’t stood up to defend themselves, war would be raging in Crimea worse than in the Donbass.” 
The Donbass is a region of southeastern Ukraine where Russian speakers had similar concerns. The West has typically characterized the Donbass rebels as puppets of Russia with no legitimate grievances or indigenous support. However, American Russia scholar Nicolai Petro, who spent a year in Ukraine and was in country when the upheaval occurred, has cited sociological surveys of Donbass residents from March, April and May of 2014 in which the results show that majorities considered the Right Sector to be dangerous and influential and the Maidan protests to be illegal and representing “an armed overthrow of the government, organized by the opposition, with the assistance of the West.” 
Kiev’s subsequent decision to start an “anti-terrorist operation” against the Donbass region, instead of negotiating a resolution, has only hardened the view of Crimeans that their reunification with Russia was correct and saved them from a similar fate. 
Alternative Approaches 
One is left to wonder if this could have all been avoided if the West had engaged Russia in good faith on its proposal for a pan-western security architecture in 2008, instead of pushing what amounts to a very dangerous zero-sum game in Russia’s backyard. Attempts to press for the eventual inclusion of Ukraine (and Georgia) into NATO have been ongoing since at least the George W. Bush administration when Condoleezza Rice had a heated discussion with Putin about it during a meeting in 2006. 

When Rice tried to assert that each country had the right to decide for itself which alliances to join, Putin explained that Ukraine had many ethnic and political divisions and that such a move could create instability in the country. Polling had reflected that the majority of Ukrainians at the time did not favor joining NATO. This, of course, was in addition to the fact that having a hostile military alliance right on its Western border was understandably perceived as a national security threat to Russia. 
These points were reiterated in a conversation between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and then-Ambassador to Russia William Burns as reflected in a confidential cable to Washington from February 2008 titled “Nyet Means Nyet: Russia’s NATO Enlargement Red Lines.” 
In the cable, Burns states that Russia warned that pushing Ukraine into NATO could provoke a civil war and that Russia would consequently have to decide whether to intervene or not – a decision Lavrov emphasized Russia did not want to be faced with. 
At a minimum, Washington needs to recognize what America’s preeminent Russia expert, Stephen F. Cohen, has noted. That is that we need a pragmatic partnership with Russia if we are to have any hope of addressing the most pressing challenges facing humanity: nuclear disarmament, catastrophic climate change, terrorism and global inequalities that have become destabilizing. 
If one studies Putin’s speeches, along with major interviews, which are available in good English translations on the Kremlin website, one can deduce that Putin is an intelligent and rational actor who could be a partner to Washington in areas of mutual interest – as he has indeed demonstrated with respect to eliminating the Syrian government’s chemical weapons and assisting in the Iran nuclear deal. 
Putin has been clear and consistent for years that he requires Russia’s interests to be taken into account, including its security. And this is as it should be. He was elected to represent and pursue Russia’s interests, not to serve Washington if he gets nothing in return. Unfortunately, Western corporate media routinely quotes Putin out of context or pretends that it is impossible to understand him because of their cartoonish characterization of him as a “thug.” 
Challenges for Russia 
Corruption 
Corruption has been an intractable problem for centuries in Russia since the administrative state and its attendant tribute paying and harsh bureaucracy were established by the Mongols in the Thirteen Century. 

Indeed, it is one of the major issues Putin has publicly admitted he has failed so far to adequately resolve. Although there has been some progress as is reflected in Russia’s rapid rise in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business scores and the Coopers Waterhouse findings for 2016 that Russia has reduced economic crime by 12 percent in the last two years, it is recognized by both Putin and the Russian public that substantially more needs to be done. 
Political and Civil Rights 
Russians can travel freely as long as they can afford it. Orthodox Christians, Muslims, Jews and Buddhists are generally free to worship as they please. There is little overt censorship and all the Russians I spoke to said they had access to Western media through both satellite and the Internet, although they all found it to be very distorted and inaccurate in its portrayal of their country and their leader. There is a variety of opinion represented in print media, and even on pro-government Russian TV it is not unusual for a pro-Western viewpoint to be included on political talk shows. 
There is still considerable room for improvement for journalists in Russia. However, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, deaths of journalists have actually gone down in the Putin era of governance compared to the Yeltsin era. One would be hard-pressed to know that judging by the way Western politicians and media have undertaken an over-the-top vilification campaign against Putin but gushed that Yeltsin was a “democrat.” 
As for the fate of Anna Politkovskaya, the idea that Putin was behind her murder has been promiscuously bandied about in the West, but no evidence has ever been presented. Moreover, her employers at Novaya Gazeta believe the Chechen leadership was behind her death, not the Russian government. Those who carried out the murder have been convicted in Russian court and are now in prison, but it is troubling that whoever ordered it remains at large. 
Civil society development has had a setback with the foreign agents law. While some civil society activists whom I spoke to acknowledged that Western provocateurs were a problem, there were many authentic NGO’s that were being caught in the dragnet and the law is consequently viewed among them as a mistake that needs to be rectified. The Russian population in general is divided on this legislation. In response to some of the criticism, in May of this year, the Duma amended the law to exclude charities and cultural organizations. 
There have still been some openings for modest civil society development. For example, an independent organization of citizens called the Public Council has developed since 2014 in the city of Krasnodar. It has successfully worked to get the local authorities to start taking the needs and desires of citizens into account when making decisions and enacting policies. 
Among other things, they have stopped the destruction of old trees, buildings and parks as well as networked with youth groups and infrastructure specialists, including foreign experts in urban planning, public arts, transportation and city marketing. They have organized periodic cleanup and renovation days sponsored by local businesses that donate equipment, and are working to connect the city’s hiking trails and protect its 16 lakes. 
Not only have they received no opposition from Russian authorities, they have begun to gain positive recognition as well as interest from other Russian cities looking to replicate their model. 
Another example is a civic education program to teach democracy skills to Russians designed by an independent American named Charles Heberle. The program has been under implementation in a province near St. Petersburg and has had the quiet backing of the Putin government since the early 2000’s. 
As the French and Germans wisely recognized at the end of the Cold War, it would serve the goal of encouraging Russia’s evolution toward more openness and democracy if their deep and historical fears of hostility, invasion and exploitation are not provoked. If given the time and space, without U.S. meddling, Russia will address its own internal problems and evolve into a system that will reflect its unique geography, culture and political history.  ",0
17646,"Petraeus: U.S. Facing ‘Unprecedented Threat’ from China, Russia","WASHINGTON D. C.  —   The “open, free, and   international” order led and created by the United States is “under unprecedented threat” from Iran, Russia, China, and Islamic extremist groups, former CIA Director and retired Gen. David Petraeus told House lawmakers during a hearing aimed at assessing the state of the world. [John McLaughlin, a former deputy and acting director of the CIA who testified before the House Armed Services Committee alongside Petraeus on Wednesday, added North Korea to the list of threats facing the United States.  North Korea “probably presents the most pressing   concern and this administration and Congress will face a decision predecessors have not had to confront with the same urgency: how to protect against or neutralize its nuclear and missile capability,” testified McLaughlin, now a    at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). McLaughlin said a series of developments in the last few years, including nuclear advances to its missile technology, has moved North Korea to near the top of America’s “nightmare list,” adding that the Communist country is “now clearly within reach” of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) able to reach U. S. soil. Both Petraeus and McLaughlin prepared a written testimony for the House panel hearing, titled “The State of the World: National Security Threats and Challenges. ” “Compounding the danger posed by revisionist forces are technologies that are eroding America’s conventional military edge,” declared Petraeus. He explained: Among the   tools in their [Iran, Russia, China] arsenals are   area denial weapons that will complicate our ability to project power into vital regions and uphold our security commitments increasingly complex   for employment alone in attacks on infrastructure or in influence campaigns, or in supporting conventional and unconventional force operations, including   hybrid warfare a renewed emphasis on nuclear weapons and threats to U. S. primacy in space —  a vital sanctuary for U. S. military power that is increasingly contested. Petraeus pointed out that revisionist powers, or nations dissatisfied with the status quo, have embarked on an effort to establish a sphere of influence in and around their territory, which includes areas of “vital strategic importance” to the United Staes as well as territory that belongs to allies that America is bound to protect by shared interests and values. He went on to highlight Islamic extremism as another form of revisionist power threatening the open, free, and rule of   U. S.  international order. “A very different, far more radical revisionist force threatening the international order is Islamic extremism —  the ideology that animates the Islamic State and al Qaeda,” noted Petraeus. “The greatest weakness of Islamic extremism is also its greatest strength —  which is its protean ability to exist and indeed thrive without inhabiting a conventional  . What it lacks in traditional power terms, it compensates for in conviction, resilience, resourcefulness, and ferocity. ” Gen. Petraeus referred to the jihadi threat as “unlike any adversary” the U. S. has ever faced. Despite the challenges, the United States remains in a commanding position to sustain and strengthen the international order it leads, noted the general. However, he warned, “Americans should not take the current international order for granted. It did not will itself into existence. We created it. Likewise, it is not naturally  . We have sustained it. If we stop doing so, it will fray and, eventually, collapse. ” “This is precisely what some of our adversaries,” namely Russian President Vladimir Putin, “seek to encourage,” he added. McLaughlin predicted the U. S. will no longer be the sole dominant power over the next couple decades, noting that the world is moving towards a   order. “We are witnessing a diffusion of power among nations. Over the next couple decades the world will be without a hegemonic power  —   that is, without a country so powerful as to exert dominant influence and advance policy with little reference to others,” he testified. “We remain the single most influential country and no major problems will be solved without the US   …     but the US cannot solve them alone. And others are competing for the preeminence we have long enjoyed,” he added. Petraeus identified a loss of   resolve, and strategic clarity on U. S. national security interests as a “more pernicious” challenge undermining the United States and its allies.",0
17647,Justin Trudeau Faces Criticism Over Fund-Raisers in Canada - The New York Times,"OTTAWA  —   When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prevailed in Canada’s election last year, he promised “sunny ways” and later pledged to hold his cabinet ministers to high ethical standards when it came to conflicts of interest and  . Now, after being the chief attraction at a   attended by wealthy businessmen, Mr. Trudeau himself is facing criticism from some who say he is not following his own rules. On Tuesday, The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper, reported that Mr. Trudeau spoke in May at a political   held in the Toronto house of the president of the Chinese Business Chamber of Commerce. Most of the 32 guests paid 1, 500 Canadian dollars, or about $1, 100, to attend. Among the nonpaying guests was Zhang Bin, president of the   China Cultural Industry Association, a promotional agency under the control of China’s minister of culture. Not long afterward, Mr. Zhang and his group’s honorary president made a joint donation of 1 million Canadian dollars, or about $741, 200, to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which includes Justin Trudeau’s brother among its board members, and the University of Montreal law faculty. The donation included funds for a statue of Pierre Trudeau, the former prime minister and Justin’s father, at the law school. The article was the latest in a series by The Globe and Mail that suggests, opposition members of Parliament say, that donors get privileged access to members of Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet in exchange for cash, which can sometimes be as little as 500 Canadian dollars, or $370. Mr. Trudeau has maintained that no rules have been broken or ethical boundaries crossed. On Thursday, the questions over the May   followed the prime minister to Liberia, where he was making a   visit. Speaking to reporters in Monrovia, Liberia’s capital, Mr. Trudeau rejected the idea that the large donation from Mr. Zhang and the Chinese association’s honorary president, Niu Gensheng, to the foundation named for his father could influence his thinking or the direction of government policies. Mr. Trudeau said he had cut all ties to the foundation, which promotes and funds academic research in the humanities and social sciences, when he entered politics. “I stepped down from any of my   responsibilities shortly after having gotten elected, in order to demonstrate that there is a tremendous separation there,” he said. Mr. Zhang did not respond to a request for comment. Efforts by Mr. Trudeau and his cabinet members to defend the   have not placated opponents. “Not only does this event break the prime minister’s own ethics rules, but it does not pass the smell test,” Rona Ambrose, the interim Conservative leader, told the House of Commons on Tuesday. “He could stop this right away. Why does he not?” Compared with the United States, Canada has severe limits on political donations. A   scandal in the late 1990s involving a Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien prompted changes that banned donations by unions and corporations and that limited individual donations to parties to 1, 525 Canadian dollars, or about $1, 130, a year. Only Canadian citizens may donate. After The Globe and Mail reported on   involving some members of Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet, Mary Dawson, the independent conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, told a House of Commons committee the sessions did not break any laws, but noted that she had repeatedly called for stricter rules. On the way out of the committee room Ms. Dawson told reporters that the   were “not very savory. ” Mr. Trudeau’s critics argue that even if the events break no laws, they seem to be in direct conflict with the stringent and much publicized ethics rules he set down for his cabinet. “There should be no preferential access to government, or appearance of preferential access, accorded to individuals or organizations because they have made financial contributions to politicians and political parties,” Mr. Trudeau’s rules state. When they were in power, the Conservatives held   that sometimes cast the party in an unflattering light. Lisa Raitt, a former cabinet minister from Toronto, became the subject of an investigation after a prominent lobbyist organized one of her   events. While Ms. Dawson cleared Ms. Raitt, she called for tighter rules related to   a request that so far remains unheeded. Ms. Raitt is now campaigning to lead the Conservatives. Mike Storeshaw, a spokesman for the Conservatives, said that when the party was in power, guest lists at   were vetted and anyone who did business with the government was asked not to attend. He acknowledged that the system was not always perfect. Since The Globe and Mail began publishing its articles, the Liberal Party decided to bar lobbyists from   attended by cabinet ministers they lobby. This month, the chairman of a large generic drug company based in Canada pulled out of a group organizing an event attended by the federal finance minister. In an editorial this week, The Globe and Mail proposed that Mr. Trudeau go much further and reduce individual donations to a mere 100 Canadian dollars, or about $74. “Dropping them to just $100 per person would price    fundraising out of business for good,” The Globe and Mail wrote.",0
17648,"The US, NATO and the Pope","Email 
At the branch office of the Pentagon’s US-NATO military alliance in Brussels there is a never-ending whirl of activity and apart from provoking Russia by announcing an aggressive military surge around its borders, its latest achievement was to have Belgium issue “a commemorative stamp depicting the new NATO Headquarters and its distinctive architecture.” 
On October 22 a ceremony was held to mark the new stamp, but no details were given about the price of the vast palace which will “ enable all Allies to have the space they require and [in which] there is also space for expansion should the need arise.” There is never any mention by US-NATO of the staggering cost overrun that took place, but two years ago Germany’s Der Spiegel revealed that it was more than double the original construction budget, at over a billion euros. 
Ten days before the stamp ceremony, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg left the Brussels Palace to visit a more modest one in Italy where he met Pope Francis. After his call, some observers were unkind enough to express surprise that Mr Stoltenberg could spare the time for such an appointment, but all was made clear when it was announced that the meeting took place in the sidelines of his visit to Rome to celebrate the establishment anniversary of the NATO Defense College, an institution that has contributed generously to the Italian economy. 
His Holiness the Pope did not of course make a public statement about the meeting, but the NATO publicity machine (the large and remarkably expensive organization that also arranges stamp issue ceremonies) made up for the omission by announcing that he and his illustrious visitor 
discussed global issues of common concern, including the conflicts in Syria and the wider Middle East, the importance of protecting civilian populations from suffering, and the importance of dialogue in international affairs to reduce tensions. The Secretary General also stressed that climate change could pose a significant security risk. 
It is remarkable that His Holiness engaged in such deliberations with the titular head of an enormous nuclear-armed military alliance, and it would be interesting to know if the Pope mentioned that he did not always agree with the policies espoused by Mr Stoltenberg and his directors in Washington, as he averred earlier this year. 
It will be recollected that in February 2016 Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church met with Pope Francis in Havana and that Western media headlines included “Pope Francis Handed Putin a Diplomatic Victory” which was as absurd as it was trivial. But even The Economist headline was similarly slanted and amusingly asked “Did the Pope Just Kiss Putin’s Ring?” This set the tone for other comment, but one thrust of its reporting was especially revealing, as it pointed out in shocked — shocked — tones that the Pope had “made clear in his interview before the meeting that on certain issues he agrees with Mr Putin and disagrees with America and its allies.” 
How truly dreadful that the Pope dares to be impartial and ventures to disagree with America and its allies about international affairs. 
The Economist further noted that “On Libya, where Western powers helped to bring down former dictator Muammar Qaddafi, the pope was explicit: ‘The West ought to be self-critical.’ And he continued that ‘In part, there has been a convergence of analysis between the Holy See and Russia’.” The Economist did not mention the unpalatable fact that the ‘western powers’ — the US-NATO military alliance — bombed and rocketed Libya to a catastrophic shambles, resulting in anarchy and a base for Islamic terrorists. Perhaps the Pope had taken note of that merciless Blitz, and of the fact that under the dictator Gaddafi the Catholic community in Libya had lived peacefully while now it is suffering gravely. 
As recorded by Christian Freedom International , “The upsurge in attacks on Christians in Libya since the Obama/Clinton supported ouster of Gaddafi is of grave concern. CFI condemns these abductions, killings and attacks on Christian property in what is becoming an increasingly inhospitable region for Christians.” Perhaps Pope Francis raised this with the devout Mr Stoltenberg, a graduate of Oslo Cathedral School who was prime minister of Norway when its air force “ carried out about 10 percent of the NATO airstrikes in Libya” from March to July 2011. 
The news that the Pope has had the temerity and moral realism to “disagree with America and its allies” is not altogether surprising, but the report that “on certain issues he agrees with Mr Putin” must have shaken Mr Stoltenberg, whose fundamental stance is that “Russia is trying to kind of re-establish spheres of influence along its borders and for me this just underlines the importance of strong NATO, of strong partnership with other countries in Europe that are not members of NATO.” 
Mr Stoltenberg believes that because Russia wants to establish — or, more accurately, maintain — spheres of influence along its borders then it must be discouraged or even stopped from doing so. This is confrontational, and it is unsurprising that His Holiness has made it clear that the Vatican is not an unconditional supporter of Washington’s Pentagon and its palatial sub-office in Brussels. 
Mr Stoltenberg may not have read the address to the US Congress by His Holiness in 2015, when he said ‘We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the golden rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’.’ As reported , ‘The line drew instant, thunderous applause from Democrats, followed with some hesitation by Republicans, a pattern repeated throughout the address.’ 
In his talk to Congress Pope Francis eschewed the Stoltenberg line that Russia’s desire to maintain peaceful ‘spheres of influence’ around its borders must by definition be wrong and unacceptableand pointed out that ‘there is another temptation which we must especially guard against : the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners.’ 
As President Putin observed in an interview with Italy’s Corriere della Sera “we are not expanding anywhere; it is NATO infrastructure, including military infrastructure, that is moving towards our borders. Is this a manifestation of our aggression?” No, it is not — except in the eyes of such as the Pentagon and Mr Stoltenberg. 
Stoltenberg makes many visits round the world, including head-of-state-style attendance at the UN General Assembly in New York, where he had discussions with, among others, Ukraine’s President Poroshenko ( “Dear Petro, it’s great to see you again” ) and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon; and another recent stopover was in the United Arab Emirates on October 19. There, while committing NATO to an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program he “ praised the UAE for its role as a valuable NATO partner in projecting international security and stability: from Kosovo, to Afghanistan to Libya.” 
Perhaps Mr Stoltenberg’s meeting with the Pope affected his short-term memory. He ignores the unpalatable facts that in Kosovo, as Freedom House reports , there has been “little progress in strengthening its statehood,” while Afghanistan verges on total anarchy and, as noted above, US-NATO’s war on Libya destroyed the country. These are far from being examples of “security and stability” as Mr Stoltenberg would have us believe them to be, but self-delusion knows no borders. 
When Stoltenberg was made head of NATO, President Putin considered him to be a “serious, responsible person” but warned with prescience that “we’ll see how our relations develop with him in his new position.” Unfortunately that apprehension concerning future developments has been more than justified. During a trip to Washington in April, Stoltenberg told the Washington Post correspondent Karen de Young, that “NATO has to remain an expeditionary alliance, able to deploy forces outside our territory,” which is a plain unvarnished statement of expansionism. The Pope summed it up when he quoted the Bible’s advice to ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you,’ but it is unlikely that Mr Stoltenberg could ever bring himself to abide by such wise advice. More confrontation lies ahead.",0
17650,Video! Five Times Venezuela’s Dictator Maduro Danced on TV While the Country Burned,"Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro has plenty of problems on his plate  —   soaring   food and medicine shortages, the surging popularity of the opposition movement against him  —   and this year he has delivered at least one concrete plan to solve them: dancing. [Maduro, a former bus driver who served as his predecessor Hugo Chávez’s foreign minister, has long enjoyed using his television program In Contact with Maduro to broadcast his dance moves. As the current crisis in Venezuela intensified, however  —   with a ceaseless wave of protests beginning a month ago, in response to Maduro’s Supreme Court’s attempt to dissolve the National Assembly and install itself as the national legislative body  —   Maduro has appeared dancing on Venezuela’s airwaves with increasing frequency.  Below are five times this year  —   four times this month!  —   that the head of state of one of the world’s most volatile nations danced on television while his people demanded his ouster: May 3: Dance Celebration of Move to Draft a New Constitution, Narnia VS Venezuela pic. twitter.   —   Yusnaby Pérez (@Yusnaby) May 3, 2017,  On Wednesday, Maduro appeared before the National Election Center (CNE) to formally demand the establishment of a “Constituents’ Assembly,” which would draft laws in lieu of the   National Assembly and create a new national constitution from scratch. To celebrate his power move, Maduro danced before the head of the CNE on television, flanked by   officials. One video of this dance went viral on social media: a video apparently taken in Caracas of a television broadcast of Maduro’s dance, which then pivots from the television to the window, where armored tanks are visibly confronting unarmed protesters below: April 26: “Everyone Must Know How to Dance” During a national event last week, Maduro mandated that all Venezuelans dance as part of a political effort to construct a greater socialism. “The youth of the Revolution must know how to sing, love, and dance to construct a peaceful and happy Revolution,” he decreed. “We must all dance. Whoever does not know how needs to learn. ” The comments appeared to be part of a promotion of a new dance initiative meant to distract students from protesting Maduro’s government, which he had announced that week: April 23: The “Salsa and Urban Heart” Initiative to Bolster the Bolivarian Revolution, Maduro announced that initiative on Sundays with Maduro, his weekly television program. The initiative is meant to channel youth energy into frivolous dancing, rather than organizing an   movement on the streets. The nation’s student population has been at the heart of the opposition protests, as young Venezuelans who have lived most of their lives under socialism have largely rejected the destruction of their country under Chávez and Maduro. Maduro announced that the initiative was intended to provide opportunities to young students to “express themselves” in a healthy way. While the head of state typically dances salsa in public  —   he loves the genre so much he also hosts a radio program called Salsa Time  —   in this video, he attempted to dance to   music along with breakdancers: April 21: Dancing in Lab Coats,  On April 21, Maduro appeared on television wearing a lab coat and what appears to be a stethoscope dancing salsa with his wife, legislator Cilia Flores. This particular episode of his weekly program elicited severe criticism over Maduro’s mockery of the protesters, including a man who confronted an armored tank wearing nothing and holding a Bible and protesters who were forced to flee into a toxic sewer to avoid being attacked by military tear gas canisters in Caracas: February 18: Patriotic Congress of Youth Dance, Thursday afternoon in Caracas, and Maduro declares the start of Carnival  …    . pic. twitter.   —   Nathan Crooks (@nmcrooks) February 16, 2017,  In a less recent episode that appeared to embarrass his vice president, the   “drug kingpin” Tareck El Aissami, Maduro appeared on television to celebrate a socialist youth assembly meant to bolster loyalty for his dictatorship. Amid the celebration, Maduro announced the start of the national Carnival festivities. “We declare the launch of Carnival and we are going into the streets to dance,” he announced before the music began and he did as he promised.

Con el fin de estimular la revelación de exclusivas y premiar a los periodistas más incisivos, La Sexta pagará a todos sus redactores en función de los “zascas” que hayan propinado cada mes. Por “zascas” la cadena de Atresmedia entiende “cualquier dato, réplica o documento que ponga en evidencia a un político, opinador o medio de comunicación, demostrando que miente o que está equivocado”. 
Los “zascas” en Twitter, es decir, las respuestas a mensajes que dejen sin argumentos a sus autores, merecerán un plus de cien euros, al igual que los “zascas” que se conviertan en “memes” y los “zascas” en toda la boca. 
Una medida similar estaba aplicándose ya en El Huffington Post, donde los redactores cobran por cada artículo en el que no te vas a creer lo que ocurre a continuación. “Con seis artículos al mes en los que no te vas a creer lo que ocurre a continuación puedes sacarte un sueldo más o menos digno, especialmente si lo redondeas con un ‘zasca’ o recopilando los mejores ‘zascas’ de alguien”, explica un periodista del medio de Prisa. “Siempre hay alguna medusa rara o una anciana tomando droga caníbal con los que puedes redondear y llegar a los mil euros. No es fácil pero por algo estudiamos una carrera”, añade. 
El éxito de la revista Cuore, que lleva más de diez años pagando por “Arrggs”, confirma que este modelo de remuneración está sustituyendo las nóminas tradicionales. “Tenemos a los mejores buscadores de celulitis del periodismo español y eso se ha conseguido con un entorno de trabajo que fomenta la competitividad”, confirma la publicación. 
Los profesionales más veteranos, como Matías Prats, han criticado internamente este tipo de fórmulas de remuneración porque “erosionan la esencia del periodismo, basada en anuncios de ING Direct cada dos o tres piezas”.",0

I agree. Once a president takes the Oval Office, we witness them doing 180’s on some of their most passionate and popular platform promises. It’s so bizarre, I find it hard to believe it’s always deliberate on their part. Frankly, it’s scary to wonder what happens behind those closed doors. In Bernie’s case, he’s not taking any big money, so he’d go in without owing any favors to anyone but the American people. If the man who has been saying the same things for decades got in there and suddenly changed, I’d be concerned he’d been “replaced”. As for Bernie, he is not a dual citizen. He’s been asked and he answered. No one has produced any proof to the contrary; so your allegation is falling on deaf ears. Unless you have some means of proving this honest man is lying; I suggest you drop that argument. He’s the ONLY candidate who stood up for the Palestinian people during a Democratic debate (it’s being called “historic”) and some Israeli officials reacted with nasty verbal assaults. I’m familiar with the ATF bill and Paul eventually appreciated what Bernie did. If you listen to the entire statement by Paul, you’ll hear him explain the tremendous pressure being exerted against it’s passing. What Bernie did was compromise to save it from dying completely. He injected an amendment that even the president went along with and it was voted on and passed. Paul calmed down and realized that Bernie gave them something out of nothing, Sanders wasn’t dubbed the “amendment king” for no reason. When Rand Paul presented another ATF bill just a few months ago, Bernie voted with him, against the Democrats and the president’s wishes. Unfortunately it did not pass. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/10/ron-paul-backs-fed-audit_n_570487.html Paschn 
Bernie Sanders is, by virtue of his Jewish heritage, a dual citizen. The “right of Return” automatically extended to all Jews allows him to move about between the U.S. and Israel. As for “compromise”? Being one who will never accept the 2 party system when it comes to what is or is not good for ALL citizens, perhaps I judge his “compromise” too harshly. Even as a teenager I wasn’t able to grasp this idiocy of voting along the “party” lines. It’s either good or not. A person’ voting should have nothing to do with a party affiliation. It cripples the democratic process and benefits those holding title to “our” statesmen. Consider this, what type of honorable legislative branch would argue amongst themselves ending with the private FED RES being, yet again, shielded from transparency? Those foul dogs should be rising up as ONE demanding the FED RES charter be instantly rescinded and they, along with their PRIVATE collection agency, the IRS should be bodily thrown out of our nation right behind the Central Bank owned U.N.

17653,Please make it stop,"Posted on November 7, 2016 by Walter Brasch 
With less than a week until the election, just about every voter in the swing states has received dozens of robocalls, e-mails, letters, postcards, and exposure to almost-uncountable radio, TV, digital, satellite, and social media ads. Most are attack ads, with similar messages. 
The ads focus upon homeland security, taxes, immigration, pro-life/pro-choice, and bringing jobs back to America. The conservatives have thrown in the phrase “liberal extremists” in many of their ads in an effort to shock all America to believe that liberals are somehow tied to Muslim extremists. The liberals are pushing an agenda that defines the conservatives as greedy plutocrats who have little thought for the middle class. This election, from local offices to the presidency may be the dirtiest since 1800 when Thomas Jefferson challenged John Adams. 
Donald Trump, who has outsourced much of his clothing line and construction materials, now says if president he will bring jobs back to America, stop illegal immigration, defeat Isis, repeal Obamacare, lower taxes for families while miraculously raising the budget for defense, and perform myriad miracle acts that are not part of a president’s constitutional responsibility. 
On his march to the presidency, Trump has focused upon Hillary Clinton’s e-mails, a scandal that isn’t one. Congressional hearings and the FBI have cleared her; innumerable times, Trump has continued to attack her. Clinton has already apologized for using a personal e-mail server during her four years as secretary of state. What turned up among more than 30,000 e-mails is about 55 e-mails that received a “confidential” tag, the lowest of three classifications, with another 55 receiving “secret” or “top secret” classification. As a cabinet officer, and fourth in line of succession, she had the right to classify any message. A few of the messages came from other agencies. About 2,100 messages were classified retroactively. 
Clinton, still ahead in numerous polls, has attacked Trump for his crude behavior. One of her TV ads, which penetrates almost every TV show, is a fast-paced collage of his many comments; among them, Trump mocks a disabled reporter, uses obscene language, and treats women as chattel. 
Both candidates call each other unfit to be president, with Clinton asking voters if they really want Trump to be the person in charge of unleashing the nuclear arsenal, and Trump asking voters if they want a corrupt liar in the White House. Trump has also played upon Clinton’s 30 years of public service, linking her as an insider and him as an outsider to Washington, D.C., politics. The “outsider” label has been resonating with voters at all levels of the election campaigns as voters believe they are outsiders, alienated to government, and are willing to be led by insiders who claim to be outsiders. 
The cost of airing ads by both candidates for the presidency and members of Congress is more than $4 billion, and that doesn’t include the cost of producing them. More than $600 million, spread among all major Democratic and Republican candidates for the presidency, has been spent on broadcast TV ads, according to Borrell Associates. During the past 21 weeks, Clinton has spent about $211 million on broadcast TV ads; Trump has spent about $74 million, according to data compiled by BloombergPolitics. However, Trump has used both Twitter and free TV time, due to outrageous statements, to equal Clinton’s campaign. During the final week prior to the election, Trump will spend $25 million in broadcast TV ads. 
The Trump totals don’t include a $3 million TV ad buy from the NRA, which stokes the fire of fear that Clinton, if elected president, will violate the Second Amendment and take guns away from civilians, something a president cannot do. By Tuesday’s election, it will be doubtful that either Clinton or Trump will know how many ads were placed by their campaigns or by SuperPACs on their behalf that aired on broadcast television. 
There is one reality in all the advertising—negative ads generally don’t work, and exist only to reinforce a candidate’s base of support.

17654,Vermont Governor Pardons 192 for Marijuana Convictions - The New York Times,"Nearly 200 of the approximately 450 people who asked Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont to forgive their misdemeanor marijuana convictions had their wish fulfilled this week. In one of his final acts in office, Governor Shumlin on Tuesday pardoned 192 people convicted of marijuana possession, fulfilling a promise he made early last month to consider forgiveness for anyone who applied by Christmas. “While attitudes and laws about marijuana use are rapidly changing, there is still a harmful stigma associated with it,” Mr. Shumlin, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday. “My hope was to help as many individuals as I could overcome that stigma and the very real struggles that too often go along with it. ” Such charges can stand in the way of finding work, being accepted to college and traveling internationally. The pardons were limited to people who had no violent criminal histories or felony convictions, and who had not been found guilty of driving under the influence or reckless driving. People who did not apply for a pardon under Mr. Shumilin can still apply to have marijuana possession convictions expunged from their record through a court process established under a 2013 state decriminalization law. Mr. Shumlin cited that law and his own support for legalizing marijuana as the basis for the pardons. “Vermont should follow the many states that are legalizing and regulating the use of marijuana and put to an end the incredible failure that is the War on Drugs,” he said in the statement. His successor, Phil Scott, a Republican, has urged caution, though he has signaled he may be open to legalization eventually. He is scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday and has said that he supports the pardons, according to local news reports. Those who received the pardons ranged in age from 22 to 69, though most were younger than 40. All but 15 live in Vermont. In all, Mr. Shumlin has issued 208 pardons since taking office in 2010, more than any other governor in the history of the state, his office said.",0
17655,Dem Rep Grijalva: Trump’s ’Legitimacy Is in Question’ - Breitbart,"Monday on MSNBC, commenting on Rep. John Lewis ( ) saying  “I don’t see the   as a legitimate president,” Rep. Raúl Grijalva ( ) said   Donald Trump’s “legitimacy is in question” and that he will not attend the inauguration.  Grijalva  said, “I chose not to attend the inauguration. I really feel that since November 8, there are no signs that Trump is rising to the mantle of the office of a president. On the contrary, there’s been no efforts at reconciliation, the attacks on Representative Lewis is a prime example. ” He added, “I agree with John Lewis that the legitimacy is in question. And the person most responsible for the question of legitimacy, whether it is John Lewis’ or mine, is Donald Trump himself. His comportment and rhetoric during the election carried on afterwards, failing to understand after an election one of the biggest responsibilities a   has and incoming president has is to reassure the country that the transfer of power with it is going to come a full understanding of the reconciliation needed among the American people. He doesn’t understand that. And if there’s any question of his legitimacy, whether it is the hacking by the Russians, whether it is  international, whether it’s domestic that question that John Lewis has and I have and other people have has been brought about by his comportment and no one else. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
17656,Trump’s First Executive Order: ‘Ease Burden’ of Obamacare - Breitbart,"In his first executive order, President Donald Trump called for federal agencies to “ease the burden” of Obamacare. [Trump says in the order that he will be seeking “prompt repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. Pending full repeal, however, he will “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Act. ” He also says the executive order will give individual states “more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market. ”  The executive order continues: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under the Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications. According to Fox News, Trump’s chief of staff Reince Priebus also issued a memo that directs federal agencies to freeze all new regulations and those that may be in the pipeline until the Trump administration is able to review them. Republicans in Congress began the process of repealing Obamacare last week with an addendum to a budget bill.",0
17657,Confirmed: Public overwhelmingly (10-to-1) says media want Hillary to win,"Print 
[Ed. – Every now and then the facade cracks. Somebody asks a question the media haven’t intervened to spin yet, and a bit of truth peeks out about what the public really thinks. CNN is our poster child on this one, but it could be any number of them.] 
Two national polls released late last week confirmed the public widely recognizes the news media’s agenda in favor of Hillary Clinton and decidedly against Donald Trump, a reality documented in a NewsBusters study earlier in the week. 
“By nearly 10-1, all those surveyed say the news media, including major newspapers and TV stations, would like to see Clinton rather than Trump elected,” Susan Page and Karina Shedrofsky reported deep into a Thursday USA Today story on the latest USA Today /Suffolk University poll on the Clinton-Trump race. 
The October 27 article elaborated on how even a solid majority of Clinton supporters also realize journalists want Clinton to win: “That includes 82% of Trump supporters and 74% of Clinton supporters. Six in 10 Trump supporters say the news media is coordinating stories with individual campaigns, rather than acting on its own accord. Three in 10 of Clinton supporters feel that way.”",0
17658,"Awesome Video Shows The REAL Donald Trump, Presidential Candidate","Donald Trump is loud, rude, bombastic and just awful , right? 
That’s what the media is telling you. 
They’ll play the awful Billy Bush audiotape over and over again, repeat comments he made decades ago about women, and recycle his “What an awful woman!” comment during the debate. 
But that’s the side of Donald Trump the media wants you to see. 
Perhaps the real Donald Trump is soft-spoken, humble, thoughtful and intelligent. 
In a short video announcing the opening of his new hotel in Washington (a revitalization of the old Post Office in the district), Trump speaks about what it took to get the building remodeled. 
He used the work on the post office as a metaphor for rebuilding America. 
“This building is an historical landmark, a true American original,” he said. “It had all the ingredients of greatness, but it has been neglected and left to deteriorate for many, many decades. It sat there so beautiful and so empty and was falling into a very, very bad state of condition. 
It had the foundation for success. All of the elements were here. Our job was to restore it to its former glory, honor its heritage, but also to imagine a brand new and exciting vision.”

17659,Schiff Threatens to Violate Constitution--Twice--with Independent Counsel,"Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) threatened to have Congress appoint a special counsel, despite the Supreme Court’s decision that it is unconstitutional for Congress to appoint any federal official. This decision came from a case so famous that the lawmaker almost certainly learned it as a student at Harvard Law School. [Schiff tweeted Monday, “If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately   independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don’t waste our time”:  If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately   independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don’t waste our time.  —   Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) June 12, 2017,  The Harvard Law professors who taught the ranking member of the House Select Intelligence Committee are probably disappointed with their former student because the Supreme Court in 1976 unanimously said Congress would violate the Constitution by doing so. In the 1970s, Congress created the Federal Election Commission (FEC) which gave them the power to appoint two of its six commissioners, but the statute was challenged on several constitutional grounds. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution’s separation of powers requires that the only branch of government that can create a federal office —  Congress, through passing legislation —  is also the one branch that can never then appoint someone to fill the office it had just created. Congress must, instead, specify in the statute who can appoint someone to fill that office, choosing between the president, one of the president’s senior subordinates, such as the attorney general or other cabinet officers, or the courts. Quoting the rule from its 1926 case, Myers v. United States, the Court declared, “Legislative power, as distinguished from executive power, is the authority to make laws, but not to enforce them or appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement. ” Consequently, the Court in Buckley struck down that provision in federal law for violating the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. Following that decision, all FEC commissioners are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. That is precisely the issue here. Schiff is threatening to take action that the Supreme Court has clearly and repeatedly held unconstitutional. This sets aside the fact that the independent counsel statute —  the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 —  is unconstitutional, upheld by the Supreme Court in its 1988 case, Morrison v. Olson, over the dissent of Justice Antonin Scalia. But political dramas in subsequent years proved Scalia’s argument correct on why a prosecutor, fully independent from the elected head of the executive branch, is incompatible with the Constitution’s structure of American government. Now, many leading liberal judges agree that while the Constitution allows special counsels, it does not allow independent counsels. In other words, Schiff is threatening to violate the Constitution not once, but twice, one in open defiance of the Supreme Court. This is all political theatre. Given these Supreme Court cases, Congress would never pass such a statute. If it did, President Trump would promptly and properly veto it, and there is zero chance that even a   Congress could muster a   supermajority to override the veto. Schiff should know all this, leading skeptics to conclude his entire threat should be chalked up as more evidence of Democrats’ exacerbation of partisan tensions in the nation’s capital.

17660,Investing in an Emotional Trust Fund for Your Children - The New York Times,"PARENTS think a lot about what their money might one day do for their children. Will it give them options in life to accomplish something meaningful, or rob them of ambition? Or will a lack of family money leave them at a disadvantage? Of course, there are a lot of other outcomes. But fear about the bad things that money can do to children sends some    parents to lawyers and advisers to create trust documents with rules stating what children need to do to obtain the money. Even parents of modest means are encouraged to own life insurance policies in trusts to inhibit their children from getting all the cash at once should the parents die. These are necessary in certain cases. But long before children are aware of what they might inherit, there are more foundational conversations that parents should have. What if parents thought about the capital  —   yes, financial, but also emotional and intellectual  —   that they were spending on their young children as assets in an “emotional trust fund” with trustee duties inherent in it? That’s the concept being advanced by Jacalyn S. Burke, a former nanny, a commentator on parenthood issues, and the author of “The Nanny Time Bomb: Navigating the Crisis in Child Care” (Praeger, 2015). She argues that thinking in financial terms when it comes to parental choices could make a difference in shaping children who grow up to live meaningful lives  —   regardless of whether any money comes to them. The essential components of an emotional trust fund are analogous to those of a conventional one  —   cash, stocks, bonds and property as the holdings, with trustees directing the investments in each, with an eye toward the recipient’s best interest. How investments in those assets are divided up, though, is what matters. “That same structure we use for our financial lives could be applied to how we raise our children,” Ms. Burke said. “The different components could relate to a child’s life. A nanny comes in as a massive part of that portfolio, particularly if they work with them 9 to 5 and sometimes longer. ” Nannies and child care workers more broadly are the stocks in the emotional trust fund. Their influence on children is a bet on the future, and just like stocks, no one makes a selection thinking it will underperform. Like stocks, some nannies do well from the start. Others pay dividends over time. And then there are the ones that seem like   but prove to be disappointments. Ms. Burke said this is where her thinking started, largely because she found parents not putting enough time into selecting someone  —   or enough money into paying such a crucial person in their children’s development. Cutting corners and hiring a disengaged nanny early on, she said, could hurt a child’s ability to form relationships over the long run. To choose well, she said, parents need to do their due diligence. “For someone who you’re employing for the majority of the time when you’re out of the home, you should go back and see how that stock has performed in the past,” she said. “Did it perform well for six months or for 10 years? A reliable performer is someone with various credentials who shows up each week  —   that’s a solid stock that’s not going to wobble. ” Karen Kaufman, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan, who also wrote the preface to Ms. Burke’s book, said distracted nannies can inflict lasting damage on children. (The same goes for parents.) “Just about every nanny I see is on the phone,” Dr. Kaufman said. “They’re distracted. It’s all these little tiny disruptions that make kids question if they’re enough. ” Separating good from bad nannies is as difficult as trying to select a stock. Ms. Burke recommends detailed background checks but also visiting the nanny at home or where she was last working, to gauge her interaction with that family. This also serves to make sure the nanny is telling the truth. “I was routinely asked by other nannies to pretend I was a parent and be a reference,” she said. For people who have consistently chosen nannies who didn’t work out, Ms. Burke suggested finding a consultant to work with the family on finding the right fit, much as one would go to an adviser to help with selecting securities. And as with stocks, trustees need to be dutiful managers  —   in terms of nannies’ work but also their happiness in their jobs. “When nannies got together and complained, you’d think the No. 1 complaint would be the awful wages they got paid,” Ms. Burke said. “It wasn’t. It was the lack of respect. ” Of course, it may take time before parents can judge how well their child care money was spent  —   or they may have an anchoring bias that keeps them with a mediocre nanny for fear that others will be worse. Enrichment activities are different. They’re the bonds in the portfolio. Just as analysts following the declining prices of municipal bonds knew Detroit and Puerto Rico were headed into trouble long before a crisis hit, parents can measure their children’s responses to enrichment fairly quickly. Ms. Burke said she is not focused on the number or kind of activities for a child, but on how those activities are inspiring or hurting a child. “There is so much value in doing something outside their school curriculum,” she said. “There’s a consummate value in enriching your children but not overextending them. ” Community, broadly defined, is the property component of the emotional trust fund. “A cloistered sense of the world does not do them well,” Ms. Burke said. “At the weekends, walk the dog around the neighborhood, have pancakes, play ball in your neighborhood, get involved in your church or synagogue. It gives your kid a great grounding in life. ” How parents spend time with their children is the cash in the emotional trust fund. It can be spent wisely to maximum benefits or it can be squandered on things that don’t matter or could do harm. In some ways, spending that cash carelessly dovetails with too much enrichment  —   activities scheduled throughout the weekend keep families apart. Instead, Ms. Burke calls for parents to spend their emotional cash on experiences  —   sitting, playing, baking, talking  —   and not on more things. “Cash is switching your phone off and doing things with your children,” she said. “What I hear from children is they just want down time with their parents. I can’t tell you how many extremely wealthy children say ‘I just want to play ball with Dad. ’” Like any trust fund, an emotional one needs a balance between what the trustees  —   the parents  —   are doing and how those actions are received by children  —   the beneficiaries. “The nannies can provide a tremendous amount of education,” Dr. Kaufman said. “But the main theme is no one is as important as the parents. It’s encouraging parents to be more physically present, not to be on their devices, to make eye contact. ” None of this is to say that parents can substitute an emotional trust fund for talking to their children as they grow up about wealth and the responsibilities that come with it. “Financial wealth is not a free ride  —   it’s a powerful tool,” said Kristen Armstrong, a wealth dynamics coach with U. S. Bank’s Ascent Private Capital Management. “In high school, having some conversations about being a family with significant wealth and being a family who has some opportunities is important. ” Given the amount of time and money parents spend on their children today, the emotional trust fund is an interesting concept. If nothing else, thinking in these terms might reframe how people spend time and money in their family.",0

A newlywed couple have claimed their big day was ruined when a man burst inside the church shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ and then started tearing down wedding decorations. 
Groom Marcel Lohbeck, 35, and bride Friederike were celebrating their wedding with 90 guests in the Karmel Church in Duisburg, a city in western Germany. 
Lochbeck said: ‘At the beginning of the ceremony, a man with a thick jumper and a hat on came into the church and sat in the back row. 
‘Shortly afterwards, he stood up and wandered around the candles. He laughed in a disturbing manner and then fondled the statue of Mary. 
‘He had been speaking in Arabic and partly English. He then started destroying the flowers and kept shouting “Allahu Akbar”.

17663,Why’d You Do That? How The Times Decides to Send News Alerts - The New York Times,"News alerts and push notifications regularly draw questions from readers. So I sat down with Eric Bishop and Michael Owen from the news desk at The Times to answer some of my questions  —   and hopefully yours  —   about how the newsroom approaches this area. Last month, The Times announced it was dividing its email alerts into two channels: Breaking News gives readers developing stories as they happen and Top Stories gives subscribers breaking news plus special reports, investigative stories or live events in sports or politics if The Times deems them important. Soon, subscribers to mobile push notifications will get the same choice. Liz: So tell us more about these changes. Why do this? Michael: One of the big objections people have to alerts is that they’re not “breaking news. ” Even though we no longer advertise them as only for breaking news, I think that’s still an expectation people have  —   that people will only be interrupted for really big stuff. But we’ve discovered that both as a way of amplifying our work and as a way to engage people, and get them into the app, there’s actually a pretty big appetite for things that are not breaking news. We’ve found that many people do want the sort of    New York Times stuff of investigations and major enterprise. So we wanted to be able to send those things but also give them an option if they just want to know when there’s some big disaster going on. Eric: And so in addition to that, we also have topical channels that users can opt into. That’s Politics, Sports, New York and Business. And we also had an Olympics channel during the Games that users could opt into. On those channels, you’re also going to get a mix of breaking news from those worlds  —   Politics or Sports  —   but also get some alerts of our best enterprise coverage. Liz: These alerts, through email or mobile, seem like they’re becoming a new home page through which a large audience enters into the vast work of The New York Times. I wonder how you try to engage this audience. What does this audience look like from your vantage point: Who are you trying to pull in, and what are you trying to achieve strategically? Eric: The point you make about this being a new home page is exactly right for a lot of people. I’ve had friends of mine say to me they would not have sought out our app and read this story had we not pushed it to them. But as far as strategy goes, that’s a question we’re beginning to confront a little more aggressively. I think in the past the stories have been the driver of notifications  —   where, say, we’ve got a great story, so what should the audience be for this? Now we’re starting to think a little more about whether there are audiences that The Times wants to reach but isn’t. Is there a way to reach them through Push that satisfies our goals and also clues them in to content that they might want to read? Michael: With increasing granularity we can choose the target for a particular story. And it really helps us as journalists to think about, from the moment a story is conceived, who is it for and how is it going to reach them? That’s a sea change to not just be broadcasting it into the dark. The ethos of The Times is never going to be “We’re writing stories for one particular audience. ” The generalist blood runs through our veins. But there’s a great power in being able to say we think some people are going to be particularly enthusiastic about a particular story. Liz: What tools do you have at your disposal now that can help you identify specific users or demographic groups and allow you to watch their patterns? For example, if you watch and see that I open up a lot of politics, or lifestyle stories, are you guys at a place where you can respond to that behavior and dish up more of what I want?  Michael: I think we’re at the very beginning of it. We can segment audiences, and for people who have opted in to particular channels for breaking news, we can target within that. There’s no way for us to say systemically, “   is going to get more music articles. ” Instead, we say, we have this one Arts article we want to send an alert about. Who should we target? We’ll target people who’ve read X music articles. Liz: And you’re doing that now? Michael: Yes. Liz: O. K. interesting. So let’s talk about some questions I get from readers. As the public editor, my predecessors and I receive a regular stream of complaints or questions about alerts. And I’d say they fall into two categories  —   either people are concerned about an alert that wasn’t sent out, or they’re concerned about an alert that was sent. I imagine it’s a complicated calculation, but can you talk about how you make these evaluations?  Michael: These decisions are made on the news desk, based on each case, for a given notification. Whoever is supervising the desk has the ultimate call, but every potential notification is deliberated on by multiple editors in every case. Sometimes those editors include the masthead [the top editors in the newsroom]. These are the same editors who are involved in what goes on the front page of the newspaper. It’s part of the same overall news judgment and process. As such, it’s susceptible to all of the classic pitfalls of news judgment. Sometimes we’re wrong, sometimes we don’t have all of the information we need to make a decision so we have to put it off, and sometimes there’s a quite a torturous conversation about whether we should send a given alert or not. And there’s no objective measure of what is newsworthy and what our audience is going to be most interested in, so we just have to make a judgment call every time. Eric: And given you really only have 125 characters, every word counts. So the language is often very heavily deliberated on. Liz: Along these lines, I wanted to ask you about a question I got this week where someone asked about alerts on terrorist attacks. He noted that there was a suicide attack perpetrated by a    that killed 50 people in Turkey: no notification. When there was a priest in his 80s in France, you sent a breaking news alert. And the reader is asking: “Why the disparity? And what efforts are being done to consider balancing unnecessary alarm with equal coverage of terrorism globally?” Do you recall anything about that decision?  Michael: I was there for the priest one. This is such an articulate form of this question. Every time we debate this, it’s like this incredible confluence of so many factors. Like: What is the news temperature of the day, what else is going on? Have we sent other alerts already? Do we anticipate that there is going to be big news later in the day? Are there other big running stories? How does this compare to the most proximate events that we’ve dealt with? And so those are the internal factors, and then: Do our journalists have direct access to what’s going on, can we make informed and reasoned evaluation about it? Sometimes it’s just not clear what’s going on. We’re really cautious, I would say, in breaking news situations exactly because we don’t want to veer into alarm. Those are really the most tense moments on the news desk. Liz: What about when some other prominent news organization has a big story but you don’t yet have the reporting yourself? You can’t confirm the story. Is that the kind of situation you struggle with?  Michael: Yeah, it drives us crazy. Because in some cases the second you hear it you know that it’s going to be an alert but you don’t have the same level of sourcing that we would have before we would publish something. Liz: Do you have a number, an average range per day, that you aim for in sending out alerts? A number where you think, more than that is too annoying and less than that is not enough? Eric: We usually send to the Top Stories channel, I would say, an average of one to three a day. Which does seem to be on the low end. Liz: Yeah, I would have thought it was more than that.  Michael: If it’s a big news day and there’s a lot of different things happening and we have sent a lot of alerts we are more conservative about sending alerts at a certain point because a) we don’t want to be bugging people but b) we don’t want to be in any way compromising our credibility and seeming to just jump on everything that happens. So it’s an incredibly delicate balance. When there’s a big multiday running story, you almost can’t push too much. We see huge engagement every time we send out an update. I mean, I don’t want to say we have a sixth sense, because it’s not magical  —   but we’re paying attention to a lot of signals in terms of what we alert and what we don’t. Eric: And it’s not just per day, it’s often per hour. Did we just send something 10 minutes ago? That might influence a decision about whether to send something. Liz: So let me ask you one last question. Can you cast into the future a bit and tell us where you think this area  —   news alerts, push notifications  —   is going? Eric: There’s a lot that could happen. For one, I think we’ll see more personalization. Liz: And what might that look like?  Eric: Well, right now, and Michael touched on this, we are sending notifications to targeted groups, but we’re only doing that a little bit. We could probably be doing that more if we had more sophisticated tools, more editor bandwidth to do this type of thing. We’re still trying to figure out the best way to get reader feedback about these, though so far the feedback we’ve heard has been pretty good. That will inform how aggressive we get with more targeted alerts. I think another thing we aim to explore is the capacity to make these more of a   communication channel, and if we can figure that out, then they aren’t just push notifications, but more units of interaction with our audience. Liz: Hmm. What might someone who subscribes say back to you?  Michael: Historically, The New York Times was this thing we printed and sent out to everybody and was largely a   interaction. Now, I think both the great opportunity and the difficulty of messaging is that it gives us a chance to take this   way of interacting and put it in the realm of    relationships. That’s kind of the dream that messaging promises. Eric: And in the more immediate future, moving beyond just text, the new Apple iOS will allow photos and videos to be pushed right on the lock screen, so that could be a very rich way of communicating and delivering the news and stories to people. *** Thanks to Michael and Eric for taking the time to talk. I hope we answered some of your questions. If we didn’t, feel free to write my office or share your comments on this article.",0
17664,Hamas Threatens Israel After Assassination Of Senior Military Official,"Hamas’ prime minister in the Gaza Strip Ismail Haniyeh vowed “divine punishment”on Saturday for the assassins of   military wing operative Mazen Faqha last week, and said his group was preparing “radical measures” against Palestinians caught collaborating with Israel. [Haniyeh said, “These murderers and their dispatchers will not escape divine punishment, punishment by the people and punishment by the resistance organizations. ”  “Assassinations do not frighten us,” he added, according to a report on Channel 2 news. The terror group has accused Israel of killing Faqha on March 24. Faqha was a Hamas operative released as part of a prisoner exchange that secured the release of IDF soldier Gilad Schalit from Hamas captivity. Faqha was shot dead by men using guns with silencers near his home in southwest Gaza City. According to the Palestinians, he was shot four times in the head. Israel did not comment on his assassination. Haniyeh pledged that “every hand that hurt the martyr Mazen   …     will be cut off. ” The Hamas Interior Ministry, meanwhile, said, “Vigorous steps will be taken against the agents and collaborators of Israel in coming hours and days. ” Iyad   the Palestinian ministry’s spokesperson, said the measures may include arrests, trials and even executions. On the Sunday after the assassination, the terror group established roadblocks near the Erez Crossing with Israel. On Monday, the roadblocks were opened for people entering Gaza City but remained closed for Palestinians wishing to leave the coastal territory. Hamas was reportedly looking for the assassins, believing they never left Gaza. On Wednesday, the group posted a video showing Israeli politicians and military figures with cross hairs on their faces. The officials shown included Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, IDF chief of staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan and others. Faqha, 38, was released after serving nine life sentences for his role in planning a terror attack in 2002 in which nine Israelis were killed and 52 were wounded.

In the schoolyard of American politics, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stood tall Tuesday as he fired back at Vice President Joe Biden for a slam Biden sent his way last week.
“The press always asks me: Don’t I wish I were debating him? No, I wish we were in high school — I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish,” Biden said last week while attacking him for comments that surfaced from Trump’s past.
Trump commented on that remark Tuesday during a rally in Tallahassee, Fla.

17667,Limbaugh: Democrats would 'destroy Jesus Christ',"Actor Jim Caviezel portraying Jesus in “The Passion of the Christ.” 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth is not the Republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
But if He were, Democrats would try to “destroy” Him in the same manner they’re attacking the 2016 GOP candidate, Donald Trump. 
That’s according to radio host Rush Limbaugh, who hypothesized what this year’s race would look like if the Son of God were at the top of the Republican ticket. 
Should President Trump try to prosecute Hillary? Sign the hottest petition in America now to show your support! 
“It doesn’t matter who the Republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment Trump’s getting. It wouldn’t have mattered,” Limbaugh said Wednesday. 
“They would go out of their way to find ways to destroy Jesus Christ if he could be nominated as a Republican. The Democrats would do everything they could, include calling Him a liar, the Bible a fake book, whatever it took.” Rush Limbaugh 
And despite the fact the Bible never indicates Jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, Limbaugh suggested Democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of His offspring: 
“They would scour the historical record looking for children He had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit Jesus. That’s who they are. That’s what they would do.” 
Limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that Republicans would never escape “this kind of media assault based on who we nominate.” Donald Trump’s RNC acceptance speech (Photo: Screenshot from RNC live feed) 
“I say this because a lot of you Never Trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like Trump. No, it’s exactly what you get when you nominate a Republican. Whenever there is any opposition to the Democrats, this is what they do. It doesn’t matter. They’re gonna do it. They did it to Romney … 
“I’ve made this point ’til I blue in the face. They turned Romney, who is mild-mannered Mr. Gosh, Can’t Even Get Noticed into the biggest walking Satan, El Diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick So this is why I think Trump has so many people supporting him. He’s fighting back against it when most Republicans haven’t and don’t.” 
As an example of how media treatment of Republicans has not changed, Limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from CBS. Commentator Bill Moyers characterized the race before it was known that Republican Ronald Reagan would easily defeat Democrat Jimmy Carter. Moyers stated: 
“Those of you who might speak Spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember,” said Carter, “who’s been your friend.” And there under the California sun in San Diego at a shopping center, Ronald Reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which he’s been a master since his days at Eureka College. Suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their ERA signs. Reagan took his cue and snapped back, “Aw, shut up!” 
And thousands of supporters roared their approval. Those are the people for whom Ronald Reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. Jimmy Carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. Reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, “Enough’s enough.” 
“Does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world?” Limbaugh asked. “Not an iota!”

17668,"El turismo, un filón que florece pese al bloqueo imperial, por Luz Marina Fornieles Sánchez","El turismo, un filón que florece pese al bloqueo imperial por Luz Marina Fornieles Sánchez Como para el resto de las esferas de la vida socio-económica de Cuba, la Revolución significó un vuelco rotundo para el turismo. Con el Primero de Enero de 1959 comenzaron a borrarse de un plumazo las secuelas de actividades que caracterizaron al sector: carreras de caballos, drogas, casinos y prostitución, entre otras.
Socios | La Habana (Cuba) | 28 de octubre de 2016 En el territorio presentado como el paraíso del libertinaje, se dio paso a las expropiaciones, nacionalizaciones de hoteles y otros inmuebles, y quedaron atrás las discriminaciones raciales y las playas fueron para el pueblo.
Fue así que el 20 de noviembre del 59 surgió el Instituto Nacional de la Industria Turística (INIT), primer organismo especializado en el ramo creado por la Revolución y su Presidente, el por entonces Primer Ministro Fidel Castro .
Una de las tareas acometidas rápidamente resultó la estructuración de un giro del ocio que respondiera a los valores culturales, históricos y sociales de la nación.
Como era de esperar frente a la magnitud de los cambios, el sector prácticamente desapareció de la escena antillana, debido principalmente a las consecuencias del bloqueo de EE.UU. , que desde entonces y hasta hoy se erigió en freno para las aspiraciones de la ínsula de abrirse al mundo.
La actividad turística foránea solo pudo resucitar a partir de 1974, y en 1975 ya se recibieron seis veces más visitantes que en el ejercicio antecedente. Con tal impuso continuaron los años 80, cuando surge el Campismo Popular (1981) y se aprueba la legislación para las empresas mixtas (1982).
Llegaron entonces los años 90 y hubo una explosión en la esfera. El fuerte período especial que vivía la nación era motivo más que suficiente para que el territorio antillano apostase por tal opción económica.
Cuando se ponderan las bondades del rubro, de inmediato se le reconocen sus significativos aportes monetarios, ser fuente de empleo y, a la vez, su accionar como motor impulsor para otro conjunto importante de ramas.
Para esa fecha los veraneantes que escogían este destino eran solo 327 mil, para quienes estaban alistados 12 mil cuartos; mientras que a partir del 2004, y de forma consecutiva, la Antilla Mayor rebasó la cota de los dos millones de arribos internacionales, y la tendencia alcista conllevó a números superiores en periodos subsiguientes.
Al cierre de 2015, por ejemplo, los flujos fueron de tres millones 524 mil 779 viajeros (17,4 por ciento de incremento)-, en tanto en el calendario en curso las previsiones apuntan a mucho más.
2016: RECORD HISTORICO DE TURISTAS
Cuba recibió recién la cifra de tres millones de visitantes internacionales en 2016, con 39 días de antelación a similar etapa del ejercicio precedente.
Con tal resultado el destino cubano refuerza su posicionamiento en el escenario turístico mundial, pese a persistir casi intacto el bloqueo económico, comercial y financiero, que mantiene ya por más de media centuria Washington sobre La Habana e impide a sus nacionales hacer turismo en su vecina ínsula al sur, lo cual viola la Constitución de La Unión.
Ello ha sido posible gracias a la labor de los trabajadores del turismo, a la cooperación de múltiples sectores de nuestra economía, al acompañamiento de los colaboradores internacionales, y muy especialmente al apoyo constante del Gobierno y su pueblo, protagonistas del desarrollo del giro en el país, según agrega la nota del Mintur.
DIFICULTA POLITICA DE BLOQUEO DESARROLLO DEL TURISMO CUBANO
El turismo en Cuba experimenta severas afectaciones a consecuencia del bloqueo impuesto por la Casa Blanca, según aseguran autoridades del propio MINTUR .
A consecuencias de tal yugo imperial solo en el período abril de 2014 a igual mes del 2015, las pérdidas ocasionadas a la actividad sin humo se estiman en 73 millones 416 mil 529 dólares, monto equivalente al programa inversionista de la industria nacional para el 2014.
El abastecimiento a la actividad constituye otra de las afectaciones registradas en el rubro a tenor con la criminal política, porque es imprescindible acceder a mercados lejanos- como Asia y Europa-, para garantizar suministros imprescindibles para el normal desenvolvimiento del ramo.
Considerado un sector estratégico para la reanimación de la economía autóctona, la actividad local de la llamada igualmente industria sin humo cuenta para su evolución con más de 62 mil habitaciones, 10 aeropuertos internacionales, una empleomanía bien capacitada e ingresos anuales por más de dos mil millones de dólares.
Los principales mercados son Canadá, EE.UU., Reino Unido, Francia, Alemania, España, Italia y por Latinoamérica, México y Argentina.
UN SECTOR ESTRATEGICO QUE JUSTIFICA TAL DESIGNACION
Augurios aparte, hablan por sí solas las imágenes de los muchos clientes en los diferentes destinos del patio (ya sean ciudades modernas o coloniales, balnearios, cayerías o entornos naturales) y la propia observación de esta redactora en sitios claves del panorama citadino, que ratifican a la industria del ocio como uno de los soportes más promisorios para la economía autóctona.
¿Será posible que este sea otro año récord para el turismo cubano? La respuesta a esta altura del almanaque es ya una rotunda afirmación. Con bloqueo o sin él, esta dinámica esfera seguirá ganando adeptos y continuará fiel a sus mercados tradicionales, aquellos que la han acompañado siempre, en las buenas y en las malas.

17669,Wells Fargo to Claw Back $75 Million From 2 Former Executives - The New York Times,"Wells Fargo’s board said on Monday that it would claw back an additional $75 million in compensation from the two executives on whom it pinned most of the blame for the company’s scandal over fraudulent accounts: the bank’s former chief executive, John G. Stumpf, and its former head of community banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. The clawbacks  —   or forced return of pay and stock grants  —   are the largest in banking history and among the largest in corporate America. A   committee of Wells Fargo’s directors investigated the extensive fraud. Wells Fargo’s board said in a report issued on Monday that Mr. Stumpf had turned a blind eye to the fraudulent accounts being created under his nose and that Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the branch system, had focused obsessively on sales targets and withheld information from her boss and the board. Wells Fargo’s misdeeds, which came to light in September, have at least temporarily become a more widely recognized symbol of the bank than its signature stagecoach. Bankers across Wells Fargo’s giant branch system were tacitly encouraged to meet their sales goals by committing fraud opening unwanted or unneeded accounts in customers’ names and, sometimes, moving money into and out of the sham accounts. While the amount of money customers lost was relatively small  —   the company has refunded $3. 2 million  —   the scope of the fraud was huge: 5, 300 bankers were fired for creating as many as two million unwanted bank and credit card accounts. In one detail revealed by the report, a branch manager had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts and a husband with 21. The warning signs were glaring and could be traced back at least to 2004, the investigators said. Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the national network of Wells Fargo branches, set up ruthless sales goals that even she acknowledged were unreachable. Mr. Stumpf, who had a long and trusting relationship with Ms. Tolstedt, left her on her own to run her department, the investigators said in the scathing   report. Neither Ms. Tolstedt, who was allowed to retire in July but was subsequently fired, nor Mr. Stumpf, who was permitted to retire in October after being castigated during congressional hearings on the scandal, was available on Monday to comment. Mr. Stumpf cooperated with the board’s investigation Ms. Tolstedt declined to be interviewed. All told, Mr. Stumpf will surrender $69 million, and Ms. Tolstedt will lose $67 million, including stock options that they forfeited last year. While those figures are bigger than any previous bank clawback, they fall far short of the largest clawback in corporate history. In 2007, William W. McGuire of UnitedHealthGroup was forced to give back $618 million over backdating options. Ms. Tolstedt’s lawyer, Enu Mainigi of the Washington firm Williams  Connolly, issued a statement challenging the board’s findings. “We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt,” Ms. Mainigi said. “A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion. ” The board’s report, compiled by the law firm Shearman  Sterling after interviews with 100 current and former employees and a review of 35 million documents, said it was obvious where the problems lay. Structurally, the bank was too decentralized, with department heads like Ms. Tolstedt given the mantra of “run it like you own it” and granted broad authority to shake off questions from superiors, subordinates or lateral colleagues. Many things collectively should have raised suspicion, the report said. Customers were failing to fund, or put money into, their new accounts at alarming rates. Regional managers were imploring their bosses to drop sales goals, saying they were unrealistic and bad for customers. Particularly in Arizona and Los Angeles, where the toxic culture was most pronounced, some managers explicitly told subordinates to sell people accounts even if they did not need them. Because of the bank’s decentralized structure, the problem went unnoticed for a long time. When it finally came to light  —   thanks in part to an investigation by The Los Angeles Times  —   the bank was slow to take action. Mr. Stumpf was warned as early as 2012 about “numerous” complaints about the company’s sales tactics  —   from both customers and employees  —   but he ignored growing evidence that the problem was pervasive, the board said in its report. Much of the   climate, the report said, stemmed from Ms. Tolstedt, who led Wells Fargo’s retail branch network for eight years. The report casts her as a powerful and insular leader who set unreasonable targets, castigated those who criticized them and actively ignored signs that some managers and employees were cheating to meet them. “She resisted and rejected the near unanimous view of senior regional bank leaders that the sales goals were unreasonable and led to negative outcomes and improper behavior,” the report said. Timothy J. Sloan, who succeeded Mr. Stumpf as chief executive, was largely exonerated by the report, even though he was also a career Wells Fargo executive. As president and chief operating officer, he became Ms. Tolstedt’s immediate supervisor in November 2015. At that point, the report said, he “assessed her performance over several months before deciding that she should not continue to lead the community bank. ” Mr. Stumpf, who retired in October, exercised all of his remaining options and converted them to stock  —   which he retained  —   in the months before Wells Fargo announced its $185 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Los Angeles city attorney in September. He held 2. 5 million shares as of late February, currently valued at $137 million. Asked about the timing of Mr. Stumpf’s options exercise, Stephen W. Sanger, the board’s chairman and the leader of its investigation, said at a news conference on Monday that it was a routine move that did not raise concern. The $28 million that the board is taking back from Mr. Stumpf  —   the proceeds of a 2013 equity grant  —   will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, Mr. Sanger said. Nearly all public companies have clawback provisions, but boards are typically loath to invoke them. Wells Fargo’s example may inspire future directors, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and an expert on corporate governance. “I welcome the move,” he said. “I’m a shareholder of Wells Fargo, and I’m glad they did it. ” Mr. Sanger took over as the board’s chairman from Mr. Stumpf. All four members of Wells Fargo’s independent investigation group were on the board before the settlement was announced. The report depicted the board as hoodwinked by bank executives who withheld important facts. It praised the changes the bank had made recently, which include ending sales goals for its retail bank employees. Such conclusions are unlikely to quiet the bank’s critics. Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that advocates stricter regulation of Wall Street, called the report a compendium of “    cosmetic actions” and called on shareholders to oust all of Wells Fargo’s board members at the company’s annual meeting on April 25. Two influential advisory firms have also recommended significant changes to the company’s board. Mr. Sanger said that the report issued on Monday concluded nearly all of the bank’s investigation and that no further terminations or clawbacks were expected. But other investigations  —   including criminal inquiries by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general  —   remain in progress, raising the possibility of criminal charges. The board’s law firm is still looking into reports that the bank retaliated against former employees who tried to blow the whistle on its wrongdoing. Last week, a federal regulator, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Labor Department, ordered Wells Fargo to rehire and pay $5. 4 million to a former employee who said he was fired after making internal complaints about wrongdoing that he had observed. The agency has also warned Wells Fargo that it is likely to order the bank to reinstate another worker who said she was fired in 2011 after trying to call her supervisors’ attention to accounts that she said had been fraudulently created. So far, Shearman  Sterling has found no evidence of retaliation, said Stuart J. Baskin, a partner at the firm. “We still have a few loose ends, but we don’t think it’s likely to change any findings,” he said. Wells Fargo is eager to put its sales scandal behind it, but customers are not quite so willing to move on. The number of consumer checking accounts opened in February dropped 43 percent compared with a year earlier, and credit card applications declined 55 percent. The financial damage caused to customers by Wells Fargo’s fraudulent acts was relatively minimal, but the issue has loomed large in the public imagination in part because the bank’s transgressions were so blatant  —   and so simple. “People getting accounts they didn’t sign up for?” said Stephen Beck, the founder of CG42, a strategy company that studies banks’ brand perception. “I don’t need an M. B. A. in finance to understand that’s wrong. Our expectation is that it is going to take quite a bit of time for Wells to recover. You can’t just advertise ‘Trust me,’ which is what they’ve tried to do so far. ” Mr. Sloan, the bank president, said at a news conference after the report was issued that he had some regrets about how the bank’s leadership  —   and he in particular  —   had handled the years of warnings. “In hindsight, I wish we would have taken more action and would have done things more quickly,” he said. The bank’s sales incentives should have been eliminated sooner, he said.",0
17670,"U.S. Starts Year With Job Surge, but Pay Gains Are Weak - The New York Times","If the surprisingly strong job gains in January revealed the economy’s resilience, they also exposed some of its stubborn weaknesses. Yes, the government’s report on Friday showed that employers fattened their payrolls by 227, 000 workers last month, an unexpectedly large increase. And yes, public optimism about economic prospects has persuaded a few hundred thousand Americans who had dropped out of the work force to return. But the very fact that so many sidelined workers could be lured back despite meager wage growth is evidence that the labor pool is not as shallow as some have argued. To the labor market bulls, consistently low official jobless rates have suggested that the economy is nearing capacity and that inflation lurks. Initial estimates released last month gave the impression that wages had taken a big step forward at the end of last year, lifting hopes that the momentum would continue, especially with a surge of local   increases taking effect across the country. Instead, the Labor Department’s latest figures showed baby steps  —   slower increases in earnings for December and January, bringing    average wage growth back down to its disappointing 2. 5 percent trend. “The increase in participation and drop in wages suggest we’re not at full employment,” James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said. Although officials at the Federal Reserve have said they expect to raise the benchmark interest rate three times this year in response to a strengthening economy, they made clear at their   session this week that nothing is guaranteed. “This is just what the doves at the Fed wanted to see,” Mr. Athey said, referring to those wary of raising rates and keen to keep the focus on fostering hiring rather than heading off inflation. “All of the numbers point toward it being more difficult to justify another hike in March,” when Fed members next meet. But just because the job market is not yet drum tight does not mean it is not improving. “The labor market started 2017 on the front foot,” said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “This is a good, good number. ” President Trump, who previously dismissed the jobs estimates as “phony numbers,” said on Friday that the latest report showed there was a “great spirit in the country right now. ” The averages the government reported mask how fractured the labor market is regarding skills and pay. Employers in many sectors have complained about the difficulty of finding and keeping suitable workers, which has driven up pay in several sectors. “We’re still continuing to see wage pressure as the candidate market continues to shrink,” said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing USA, which has 300 branch offices. In addition to the omnipresent hunger for engineers and other   workers, demand is strong for people with   trade skills like welding that fell into disuse during the recession, and for   warehouse and light assembly workers, Ms. Glaser said. “I’m definitely seeing a trend of employers targeting certain pools of workers like the disabled, retirees that may be looking to return to the work force, and    moms,” said Ms. Glaser, whose office is in Lexington, Ky. “Employers are getting very creative. Anything to get a competitive edge. ” David Nilssen, chief executive of Guidant Financial, a   financier based in Seattle, added 30 employees last year to his work force of 80. He said the trouble he has had recruiting and retaining staff members was echoed in a Guidant survey of about 2, 000 clients, who listed a shortage of qualified workers as their main challenge. Many American workers remain cut off from the competitive bidding that has emerged in the eighth year of the recovery. A mismatch of skills or location, the lack of support like child care and employer discrimination are some of the reasons that high school graduates,   factory workers, members of minorities, baby boomers and others have failed to find or regain a comfortable footing in the labor force. However strong (or weak) last month’s figures are ultimately viewed, they are a legacy of the Obama administration, since they are based on surveys before Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. Some employers may have made staffing decisions in anticipation of a Republican administration, but this report does not reflect any specific policy changes. (The way the government estimates the jobless rate does not change from one administration to the next.) Still, given the timing, the January job figures are one benchmark against which the new president’s stewardship of the economy will be judged. There are others. Economists at Moody’s Analytics said in a report this week that at least six other measures should be used to determine whether the economy has reached full employment. The list included the proportion of those not in the labor force who want a job, the size of the pool of   unemployed and the degree of wage growth. The share of   adults who are in the labor force, meaning they have a job or are actively looking for one, has been dragging along at historical lows, but it bumped up to 62. 9 percent in January, from 62. 7 in December, a sign that at least some people have returned and that still more might do so if prospects brighten. That growth in the work force raised the official unemployment rate to 4. 8 percent last month. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes the millions who are working part time but would prefer   jobs and those so discouraged by rejections that they have given up searching, also rose, to 9. 4 percent in January from 9. 2 percent in December. Revised estimates from December and November cut 39, 000 jobs from previous totals, although other routine adjustments by the Labor Department showed the overall job creation for 2016 was better than previously reported. Manufacturing jobs, which Mr. Trump has focused on, grew by 5, 000 in January, increases that were countered by a revised estimate that reduced December’s gains. The Department of Labor will issue one more revised estimate for December, and two more for January. At the lower end of the pay scale, state and local   increases  —   ranging from as small as 5 cents an hour in Florida and Alaska to $1. 95 an hour in Arizona  —   affected about 4. 3 million workers across 19 states in January. The widest impact was felt in Arizona, California and Washington, where more than 1 in 10 workers got a raise. Employees in Oregon, the District of Columbia and Maryland are scheduled to get an increase later this year. The disappointing overall wage growth can be traced in part to the financial industry, which had a 0. 1 percent drop in pay. Analysts, backed by research from the Federal Reserve, have been recalibrating their assessments of what constitutes a strong number of hires, given how far the official unemployment rate has fallen. Economists estimate that it takes 50, 000 to  110, 000 new jobs to absorb growth in the population and keep the jobless rate steady. The current   average is 183, 000. Mr. Trump, who ordered an    hiring freeze for the federal government last week, has pledged on the White House website to create 25 million jobs  —   a staggering number that would eclipse the total number of   jobs created during Ronald Reagan’s   tenure, George Bush’s   term and George W. Bush’s eight years combined.",0
17671,Football Fans Get Around Face Covering Ban by Wearing Islamic Niqabs,"Defying a new Swedish law that prohibits full face coverings at public events, such as political rallies and sports matches, keen football (soccer) fans donned Islamic garments at the game instead. [Members of the   AIK Ultras, the dedicated fans of Stockholm’s Allmänna Idrottsklubben (AIK) team, also unfurled a giant banner at the match in Sweden Sunday thanking the law for a religious provision loophole.  Swedish law specifically bans people in “a public place attending a public meeting under the Public Order Act” if there is a disturbance of the peace, or “immediate danger of such a breach”  —   making full face coverings generally illegal at football games. Those breaking the law can be fined or imprisoned for up to six months. Yet understanding of particular religious minorities in Sweden means the second paragraph of the face covering law created an exception: “The ban does not apply to covering the face for religious reasons. ” La Suède ayant interdit le port de masques et cagoules dans les stades, les ultras portent désormais des niqabs  …    . dont le port est légal. pic. twitter.   —   PassionFootball Club (@PassionFootClub) April 4, 2017,  Making the most of the new law intended to curb antisocial behaviour at football games, large numbers of AIK Ultra members were seen at the game wearing niqabs  —   the full face covering cloth which forms part of the Islamic hijab. The colossal banner held by fans in the stands made reference to the Swedish politician who introduced the ban, Anders Ygeman. It read: “AIK’s ultras are well meaning, we’re now wearing masks for religious reasons. Freedom for ultras is the goal, thanks Ygeman for the loophole. ” Speaking to bestselling Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet’s Sportbladet section, Minister of Home Affairs Ygeman said he found the episode “pretty funny” and said the fans clearly had a sense of humour  —   but said if fans continued to use the religious exception the courts may decide the legal loophole doesn’t apply on a    basis if they found   men up before them. The minister confirmed that police would not require football fans turning up to matches in niqabs to prove their religion on the spot.  While the Swedish mask ban was introduced to deal with particular problems, including violence at matches, this is not the first time European football fans have invoked Islam to make political points. Breitbart London reported in 2015 when Polish football fans unfurled a giant   ‘stand and defend Christianity’ banner at a premier league match. Running to thousands of square feet, the banner depicted an armed crusader standing over Europe repelling migrant boats carrying terrorists.  ",0

17673,Opps! German Magazine Uses ISIS Propaganda Video to Show All is Well in Mosul,"Taming the corporate media beast Opps! German Magazine Uses ISIS Propaganda Video to Show All is Well in Mosul 
Well they are on the same side, after all Originally appeared at Sputnik 
In an almost four-minute video, political editor of Spiegel Online Christoph Sydow tried to defend the editorial policy of his magazine regarding the developments in Aleppo and Mosul. However, the shots demonstrated in his video turned out to be the propaganda materials of Daesh terrorists. 
The video was supposed to be a response to critical letters of Spiegel Online readers and their comments on social networks. Many of them accused the magazine of spreading propaganda and presenting the situation in the Middle East in a biased manner. ""Again and again, readers have been accusing us of presenting the Aleppo siege as a bad one, and that of Mosul as a good one. That's not right. Political editor Christoph Sydow explains the similarities and the differences,"" Spiegel Online reported. In the video, Sydow explained the similarities and differences of both situations. ""Eastern Aleppo has been cut off from the outside world for months. There is no help coming to the city. People are starving. There is no drinking water, lack of electricity. In Mosul, the situation is different at the moment. The city can receive supplies; people have water, electricity, enough food. Nobody was starving to death there yet,"" Sydow said. To prove his point of view, the journalist referred to video footage showing that the situation in Mosul is not as bad as one probably imagined. But it turns out that the footage he used was Daesh propaganda material who currently keep Mosul under their control. 1046870142.png 
According to BILDblog, which sharply criticized the German magazine for the releasing video, the shots of the city were published by Daesh a few days ago to make a false impression that people in the city ""live a normal life,"" which in fact is not true. 
""This is the most recent Daesh propaganda video which was published online five days ago. It is supposed to show normal life in Mosul, happy people, who have everything they need. However, in fact, there is a lack of water, food, medicines and electricity. This is what people from Mosul tell their relatives in secret telephone calls,"" the ARD report said. 1046870197.png 
In the right upper corner of the video, near the logo of the Spiegel magazine, one can see ""an Amaq"" symbol — the logo of Al-Amaq news agency, a media outlet considered an official part Daesh's propaganda apparatus. ""This is the propaganda material of the so-called 'Islamic State' (Daesh),"" BILDblog wrote. 
Earlier, Germany's ARD TV channel used the same recordings in its report called ""Iraq: Inside Mosul"". However, in contrast to Spiegel, the ARD stated that the information was taken from Daesh propaganda sources.",0
17674,Fact Check: Trump Misleads About The Times’s Reporting on Surveillance - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In an interview with Time magazine on Wednesday, President Trump cited The New York Times as evidence of his claim, made in a series of Twitter posts on March 4, that President Barack Obama had wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. The F. B. I. director, other top intelligence officials and numerous Republicans have rejected this claim. Here’s an assessment of Mr. Trump’s references to The Times’s reporting. False. Mr. Trump was referring to an article published online on Jan. 19 and in print on Jan. 20 that disclosed that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of Mr. Trump. There were in fact two different headlines on the online and print versions of the article, which is typical. At no point was either headline altered. Times headlines often differ in print and online, in part because of variations in presentation and in part because of space. This disparity is always noted at the end of the web version and has been noted since the story was first published in print on Jan. 20. In this case, the article appeared in print with the headline, “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides,” followed by two subheadlines, “Examining Russian Ties” and “Business Dealings of Campaign Advisors Are Investigated. ” Online, the headline read, “Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates. ” As the conservative publication National Review has reported and as the Wayback Machine’s archive of the 336 caches of the story shows, the web headline has remained the same from initial publication. .. . ..to two days after Mr. Trump made his accusation on Twitter. .. . ..to Thursday, March 23, the day his interview with Time magazine was published. This is misleading. Neither the print nor online version of the article supports Mr. Trump’s accusation that Mr. Obama ordered surveillance on him. The Times reported that there were intercepted conversations involving Mr. Trump’s associates, but it did not report that they or Mr. Trump were the subject of wiretap orders. To date, The Times has not found evidence of that. Mr. Trump’s initial accusations specifically targeted Mr. Obama, whom The Times article does not mention. The independent   website PolitiFact rated Mr. Trump’s assertion False, and The Washington Post awarded the claim Four Pinocchios, its lowest rating, twice. “The bald assertion that Obama had Trump wiretapped is nowhere supported by the story. That is fiction,” said Jay Rosen, a media critic and professor of journalism at New York University. When asked if The Times article could give Mr. Trump a false impression that Mr. Obama wiretapped him, Mr. Rosen said, “It does not. No one reading it in good faith would say that. ’’ American intelligence agencies typically monitor the communications of foreign officials of allied and hostile countries, and so they routinely sweep up any conversations between American citizens and those officials  —   called “incidental collection. ” For example, it is routine for F. B. I. counterintelligence officials to keep the Russian ambassador under surveillance. Therefore, when Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, spoke on the phone with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition, the government intercepted that conversation because it was wiretapping the ambassador. This is misleading. Mr. Trump did put the word in quotes in two of his tweets, but explicitly accused Mr. Obama of wiretapping his phones. “I’d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter in an   post on March 4. Ten minutes later, he doubled down, writing, “How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is  . Bad (or sick) guy!” Again, there is no evidence that Mr. Obama ordered surveillance of Mr. Trump’s phones, nor can a president legally request wiretapping of an American.",0

17680,"Toots Thielemans, Who Won Jazz Renown With the Harmonica, Dies at 94 - The New York Times","Toots Thielemans, one of the only musicians to have a successful career as a jazz harmonica player, died on Monday in Brussels. He was 94. The death was confirmed by Mr. Thielemans’s agency, which did not specify a cause. Mr. Thielemans, who retired in 2014 for health reasons, had been hospitalized recently with a broken arm. That Mr. Thielemans played jazz on the harmonica was unusual enough. Even more unusual was how he first gained international attention: by playing guitar and whistling in unison. He introduced this approach in 1961 on his recording of the wistful but jaunty jazz waltz “Bluesette,” which he wrote. The record became an international hit, and the song was his signature. It also became a jazz standard, recorded by numerous instrumentalists, among them Chet Atkins, Tito Puente and Mr. Thielemans himself, who went on to record it several more times. It was also recorded, with lyrics by Norman Gimbel, by Sarah Vaughan and other singers. But his distinctive sound on the chromatic harmonica was Mr. Thielemans’s primary claim to fame and, especially, to fortune. Although his name was well known in the jazz world  —   he performed with greats like Ella Fitzgerald, Benny Goodman and Charlie Parker  —   it was relatively unknown to the general public his playing, on the other hand, was virtually ubiquitous. It can be heard on the soundtracks of movies including “Midnight Cowboy” and “The Getaway. ” It was featured in television commercials and on records by, among many others, Ms. Fitzgerald, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones, who once called Mr. Thielemans “one of the greatest musicians of our time. ” For more than four decades, it has been heard in the opening theme music of “Sesame Street. ”   Frédéric Isidore Thielemans was born on April 29, 1922, in Brussels, where his parents owned a cafe. He offered various explanations over the years for how he came to be known as Toots, sometimes saying he chose the name himself and at others saying it was given to him whatever the truth, the name was apparently borrowed from two American jazz musicians, Nuncio Mondello and Salvador Camarata, who both went by Toots. Musically inclined from an early age, he began playing the accordion at 3 and took up the harmonica in his teens. A few years later, inspired by Django Reinhardt, a fellow Belgian, he began playing guitar, as well. By the end of World War II he had become a   musician. In 1949, he shared the stage with Charlie Parker at the Paris Jazz Festival, and a year later he toured Europe as the guitarist in a sextet led by Benny Goodman. He moved to the United States in 1951 and eventually became a citizen. From 1953 to 1959, he was a member of the British jazz pianist George Shearing’s popular quintet. He mostly played guitar with Mr. Shearing, but his harmonica work was featured on at least one number at every performance. It was also showcased on the handful of albums he recorded as a leader in those years. After leaving the Shearing group, Mr. Thielemans became a busy studio musician, even spending a few years on staff at ABC. But he remained active in jazz, with the harmonica now his main instrument. He toured frequently, and occasionally recorded as the leader of a small group, for the rest of his life. Most of his albums presented him in a straightforward jazz context, but late in his career they took on a more international color. On “The Brasil Project,” released in 1992, and a   released the next year, he collaborated with Milton Nascimento, Gilberto Gil and other prominent Brazilian artists. And on the 1998 album “Chez Toots” he returned to his roots, leading a group of French and Belgian musicians in a program of French songs. Playing a set in New York a few months after turning 80, Mr. Thielemans “seemed dazzled by his glorious sunset, and found shelter under the umbrella of sophisticated schmaltz,” Ben Ratliff wrote in The New York Times, adding: “He’s in good shape, only losing wind at the end of a long string of notes but he finds   rhythms, attaining a little bit of freedom, knocking his instrument from side to side for tremolos. ” Albert II, then the king of Belgium, bestowed on Mr. Thielemans the honorary title of baron in 2001. The country’s prime minister, Charles Michel, said on Monday, “We have lost a great musician, a warm personality. ” The National Endowment for the Arts named Mr. Thielemans a jazz master for 2009, the highest honor that can be accorded a jazz musician in the United States. “I accept this distinction with pride and emotion,” he said at the time, adding that he had only “played at music” until a Louis Armstrong record in 1940 provided “instant contamination” and changed the direction of his life. Mr. Thielemans lived in La Hulpe, a suburb of Brussels. Information on survivors was not immediately available. In March 2006, Mr. Thielemans was the guest of honor at an   Carnegie Hall tribute concert, with the pianist Herbie Hancock and the clarinetist Paquito D’Rivera among the performers. Reviewing the concert for The Times, Nate Chinen praised both Mr. Thielemans’s “exuberantly expressive” playing and his infectious spirit. “No one stole the spotlight from Mr. Thielemans,” he wrote. “He was having giddy fun, and the feeling was contagious. ”",0
17681,Study finds that alcohol is worse for mental health than psychedelics,"Study finds that alcohol is worse for mental health than psychedelics Nov 15, 2016 1 0 
( Minds ) A study by the Research Council of Norway has concluded that psychedelics do not link to mental health problems or suicidal behavior. A study of roughly 130,000 adult citizens in the United States found no “evidence that psychedelic use is an independent risk factor for mental health problems.” 
Of the 135,095 randomly selected people, 19,299 of them had used either lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin or mescalin, and no links were found to “increased likelihood of past year serious psychological distress, mental health treatment, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans and suicide attempt, depression and anxiety.” 
Overall, the study concluded that “it is difficult to see how prohibition of psychedelics can be justified as a public health measure.” 
As information is allowed to run free through the internet, it has become openly apparent that many psychedelic drugs are not the danger the profit-driven media had portrayed them to be. Often, they are one of the greatest medicines to overcome addiction. There is, however, a direct link between alcohol abuse and suicide. 
According to the US National Library of Medicine, “Alcohol abuse may lead to suicidality through disinhibition, impulsiveness and impaired judgment, but it may also be used as a means to ease the distress associated with committing an act of suicide.” 
Renowned author, Sam Harris, discusses the virtures of some specific psychedelic drugs:

17683,#BoycottComedian…ROBERT DENIRO Wanted “To Punch Trump In The Face”…Supports Anti-Trump Rioters…Now Wants Americans To Support His New Movie [VIDEO],"Go to Article Donald Trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government. He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he’d like to, “punch him in the face.” Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,”Comedian”? 
Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how “depressed” the tycoon’s win in the presidential election had made him. 
The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film “The Comedian” in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump’s victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
“How am I doing? I’m very depressed,” the famously laconic “Raging Bull” actor told reporters. 
“We have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.” 
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday’s election, he replied: “Yes, absolutely. Things aren’t being done right.” 
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. 
In Manhattan, they held signs reading “Your Wall Can’t Stand in Our Way” — a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. 
De Niro hasn’t minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as “a punk,” “a pig” and “an idiot.” 
“I’d like to punch him in the face,” he said before the election. 
Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro’s grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. 
“If, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,” said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano. 
“The Comedian,” De Niro’s passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this year’s program for the American Film Institute’s annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles. – Yahoo

17684,Easy Natural Food Antidotes for Age Related Neurological Diseases,"by PAUL FASSA 
The old adage of an apple a day keeps the doctor away still has some validity. And new research has discovered apple juice three times a week helps prevent Alzheimer’s and heart disease. 
Dr. Thomas Shea, a neurobiologist, and his research team at the University of Massachusetts topped off 10 years of studying apples’ effects on brain health. They used test tubes, Petri dishes, and mice for years. Then finally they confirmed their findings with a human clinical trial . 
Twenty-one AD patients from ages 72 to 93 were fed four ounces of apple juice twice daily for thirty days. There were improvements with memory as well as the negative emotional moods normally associated with AD victims. 
Dr. Shea concluded that by drinking apple juice only three times per week, you would reduce your chances of Alzheimer’s by 75%. And there are other benefits. Other animal studies have demonstrated that apples protect the heart, increase lipid metabolism, and reduce inflammation. 
A Florida State University study by Dr. Bahram Arjmandi, involving several women aged 45 to 65, discovered that a heavy diet of apples reduced LDL in the women by 23% in six months. The women also lost three and a half pounds on average. How to Juice Apples Yourself 
Conventionally grown apples usually top the Environmental Working Group’s (EWG) “Dirty Dozen” list of excessively pesticide sprayed fruits and vegetables. Eat only organically grown apples or apples that are locally grown. 
Often locally grown small orchard apples are not sprayed, but they are not USDA certified organic. This is often due to the time and money it takes to get that approval. So locally grown could be a solution for less expensive non-toxic apples if you are assured they are not sprayed. 
Don’t bother with store bought pasteurized apple juice. Organic raw and unfiltered apple juice is better. But the best way to go is juicing just enough apples to drink at one sitting each time. Since Big Ag apples top the list of the “dirty dozen” (the 12 most sprayed foods), you should invest in organic apples. 
A slow speed masticating juicer is recommended. It can be single auger (masticating screw) or double auger. You can Google slow speed masticating juicers and shop for what works for you. This is a worthwhile investment if you intend to do any juicing. I’ve been very pleased with my Omega single auger juicer with its 15 year parts guarantee. 
This type of juicer eliminates the extra fiber that inhibits rapid absorption while concentrating the juice of several items in one drink and preserving the enzymes that a high speed juicer may destroy. And it’s easy to clean. 
Do not peel the apples. Cut them into pieces small enough for the juicer and include the core, seeds and all. Adding a small piece of peeled ginger root into the juicer adds more inflammatory protection. A freshly squeezed lemon can be added also. This should be done at least three times a week. Early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Symptoms 
It’s best to launch a three prong attack if confusion, fog, and memory loss is creeping in as a matter of daily life. The apple juice approach is good, but it may not be enough if AD symptoms have already set in. 
Orthomolecular medical doctors specialize in curing with high dose vitamin and mineral supplements, such as IV mega-dose Vitamin C. They have had a good deal of success with all types of brain issues using large doses of niacin, aka vitamin B3. It shouldn’t be buffered as niacinamide, it needs to be plain niacin. This helps generate ATP for cellular energy in the brain. Read more here. 
Consuming a tablespoon of pure cold pressed coconut oil twice or more daily has even reversed advanced Alzheimer’s. Dr. Mary Newport reversed her husband Steve’s advanced Alzheimer’s, which couldn’t be improved with pharmaceuticals, after discovering fresh virgin coconut oil has MCTs (medium chain triglycerides) that the liver can easily convert to molecular energy enhancing ketones . 
Some health experts are considering Alzheimer’s Disease diabetes 3. AD victims suffer from dysfunctional insulin in the brain, thus starving brain cells of glucose needed for cellular metabolism. But ketones replace the glucose that’s in short supply in an AD victim’s brain. 
Coconut oil also helps create “good cholesterol” that forms much of the tissue in the brain and also protects the central nervous system with a myelin coating . 
Repairing and protecting central nervous system tissue and providing easily produced ketone energy into brain cell to reverse Alzheimer’s is something Big Pharma cannot come close to claiming. Thus far Big Pharma’s solutions for AD have been ineffective with damaging side effects.

17685,"Congress’s Planned Parenthood Investigations Find Horrifying, Criminal Practices","There have been two recent congressional investigations into the Planned Parenthood selling baby parts scandal. [Both were prompted by the Centre For Medical Progress (CMP) undercover investigation, which caught Planned Parenthood officials discussing how to illegally profit from selling baby parts. The first report in December was by the Senate Judiciary Committee and now House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel has published its report. Neither investigation relied on the CMP undercover videos to come to their conclusions. They carried out their own investigations  —   interviewing officials and employees under oath and using the power of subpoena to get their records.  What they found is horrifying and criminal. It’s disturbing that the results have been virtually ignored in the mainstream media. So to fill this gap, here are the top eight horrifying facts the mainstream media doesn’t want you know about aborted babies bodies being sold for profit. 1) It’s wrong to say the   crowd don’t value the disabled. Advanced Biosciences Resources (ABR) had a “technician” embedded at a Planned Parenthood clinic who reportedly harvested and sold the skin of a Down Syndrome baby for $325. Yes, that’s correct, in America today, you can buy the skin of an aborted Down Syndrome child for $325. The same baby’s leg was sold for $325. 2) Selling baby parts is very profitable. To be clear, the law is unambiguous it is illegal to make a profit providing organs or any part of a human for research or medical treatment. But Planned Parenthood and their business partners made a lot of money selling aborted baby body parts, according to the report. The House investigation found one case where Stem Express harvested an intact aborted baby’s brain at a Planned Parenthood clinic. They reportedly paid Planned Parenthood $55 but sold the brain to a researcher for over $3000  —    that’s a 2, 800% profit. Planned Parenthood reportedly made their money on volume sales and “charitable donations” from these body harvesting companies. The Senate investigation published invoices which showed in June 2014 ABR bought a fetus from Planned Parenthood for $60. From that one fetus ABR “sold its brain to one customer for $325 both of its eyes for $325 each ($650 total) to a second customer, a portion of its liver for $325 to a third customer its thymus for $325 and another portion of liver to a fourth customer and its lung for $325 to a fifth customer. ” Then, the report says, they piled on fees for “disease screening” and shipping. That one aborted baby reportedly brought the company $2, 275. The House Investigative Panel found Stem Express generally marked up the baby parts by 400% to 600%. 3) A bountiful harvest, And “harvesting” is exactly what they were doing. The House investigation uncovered how “technicians” would look at the patient list in advance and try to sell the baby parts before the abortion. After securing the advance sale (with its massive profits) the technician would then be allowed to go and ask the pregnant woman to sign a consent form. This is a huge ethical breach. The person seeking consent from a vulnerable patient is supposed to be neutral in the process. In a letter to HHS last June, the panel wrote: “The fact that StemExpress was attempting to interest a customer in fetal body parts before an abortion had taken place raises serious concerns that there may have been coercion or undue influence upon the patient to consent to procurement” (their emphasis). 4) Sticks and stones, And like any other business, there can be frustrations between buyers and sellers. The House Panel uncovered an email exchange between an excited Stem Express “technician” and a researcher who wanted to know if she could expect some parts the next day because she needed to book time at a very expensive research machine. But a baby’s body is a frustratingly fragile thing. Rather apologetically, the Stem Express employee told the researcher he had a body but: “The calvarium [skull] is mostly intact, with a tear up the back of the suture line, but all pieces look to be there. The limbs, one upper and one lower, are totally intact, with one upper broken at the humerus, and one lower broken right above the knee. Please let me know if these are acceptable. ” They were. The deal was done and a baby’s body, complete with a  broken leg and arm, was shipped overnight to the researcher. 5) Kermit Gosnell was not alone. If there is one thing the abortion defenders agree on, it’s that mass murderer Dr Kermit Gosnell was a   an aberration. In a Supreme Court judgment referencing Gosnell, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg described him as “rogue. ” Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic explained most people believe “Gosnell is an aberration that says nothing larger about abortion in America. ” And Slate writer William Saletan described Gosnell as an “outlier. ” But then you read the House Investigation Report. They have interviewed, taken evidence, and secured affidavits from employees and patients of a Texas abortion doctor (whose name they have redacted). I have made a movie and written a book about Kermit Gosnell and his   killing spree, and the similarities with this Texas doctor are shocking. According to one employee, the doctor would perform around 40 late   or   abortions every week. Of these abortions, “three to four infants would show signs of life. ” And just like Gosnell, the doctor would immediately kill them, according to the testimony. The employee said he employed Gosnell’s techniques of “snipping the infant’s spinal cord with scissors. ” However, he reportedly also cut the neck with Sopher forceps: “twisting the infants head: using forceps  …     or his finger to crush the ‘soft spot’ of the infant’s head. ” Sometimes the doctor would also kill by crushing the stomach of the child or “inserting his finger down the throat,” according to the testimony. And just like Gosnell  —   the doctor reportedly would manipulate ultrasounds to make babies appear smaller so he could perform illegal   abortions. And just like Gosnell, he had unqualified staff administering drugs and carrying out abortions, according to the report. 6) Planned Parenthood HQ accused of conspiring to break the law. After the baby selling scandal broke, Planned Parenthood told the media they had a policy that prevented their affiliates from profiting from the process. But they didn’t mention that they had brought the policy in just as the CMP scandal developed. In fact, this report suggests a “criminal conspiracy” over their failure to have guidelines before this. According to the Senate Judicial Committee report, in 2001 Planned Parenthood did have a policy stating its clinics had to have an independent accountant verify they were not profiting from the sale of body parts. Those who did not follow these guidelines could be thrown out of the Planned Parenthood network, they were warned. In 2011, when they found their clinics were ignoring the guidelines, Planned Parenthood quietly deleted the guidelines from its requirements. By doing so, Planned Parenthood headquarters made it quite clear they would not stand in the way of their clinics profiting from the sale of baby parts. Or, as the Senate Committee put it, by behaving “in a manner that facilitated the continuation of those fetal tissue payments. Planned Parenthood and the affiliates actions may implicate the federal criminal conspiracy statute   371. ” 7) Privacy for thee and not for me, Planned Parenthood and the companies it was selling baby parts to fought tooth and nail against the investigations. They claimed privacy was an issue. But the House Investigation states they never cared about privacy when there was a lot of money to be made selling the body parts of their patients’ babies. They would regularly give confidential information about their patients to help the companies plan their harvesting in advance, the report says. And Stem Express would reportedly share this information with clients so they could look at what might be available and place advance orders. The committee said: “the [Planned Parenthood] abortion clinics did not have a valid reason to provide, patients’ PHI [Protected Health Information]. Instead the abortion clinics shared patients’ PHI with Stem Express in furtherance of contractual agreements that financially benefited StemExpress and the clinics. ” They recommended an investigation “and, if OHRP agrees that [privacy] violations occurred, to take all appropriate actions. ” 8) Planned Parenthood falsely claimed to help cure AIDS. Yes, you read that right  —   in order to convince women to allow them to harvest their baby’s body parts, the Planned Parenthood consent form told the vulnerable women that the parts had been used to find a cure for AIDS. As a Planned Parenthood official admitted under oath to the House investigation, “there is no cure for AIDS. So that is probably an inaccurate statement. ” They also reportedly misled clients about what they were actually harvesting. The consent form only described “pregnancy tissue”  —   not a baby’s arms, legs, eyes, brains, and skin.

17686,Gold And The Dollar Moving In Tandem?,"Financial Markets , Gold , Market Manipulation , Precious Metals GLD , Junior mining stocks , silver eagles , SLV admin 
One interesting occurrence that has not been written about in the precious metals alternative media or blog space yet is that gold has been quietly moving in tandem with the dollar over the past several trading sessions. It has been quite pronounced during the past four trading days, today inclusive. In the previous 15 years, gold’s best periods of return have occurred when gold and the dollar move in tandem higher for a brief period of time, followed by a period of time when the dollar heads south and gold continues higher. 
If you look at graphs of both gold and the dollar side by side, you’ll see that this occurred in late 2005 into early 2006, when gold moved higher until May while the dollar fell and again in late 2008. It’s too early tell if that will happen now, but suffice it to say that both are moving in tandem right now and it’s worth watching to see if it continues. My theory is that there’s flight to safety into gold and the dollar ahead of an adverse economic event. As the event unfolds, the dollar begins to sell off but capital continues to flow into gold as the ultimate wealth preservation asset. 
The above analysis is an excerpt from the latest issue of IRD’s Mining Stock Journal which was released last night. Earlier today, Bill “Midas” Murphy poked his head out of the New Orleans Investment Conference and asked me why the metals were acting “so goofy” this morning, to which I replied: Interestingly, gold and the dollar have been moving in tandem the past several days. Not perfect correlation but I bet its 80-85%. I discussed this in the latest issue of my Mining Stock Journal . Over the last 15 years, gold has had some of its best performance periods when it moved in tandem with the dollar for a bit then took off higher while the dollar sold off. It’s been moving in tandem with the dollar today as well. The manipulated correction is over. India and China are buying a LOT of gold right now. Two days ago nearly 100 tonnes were delivered onto the SGE. I don’t think the cartel can take gold lower and I think right now they are merely trying to keep the “beachball” from popping above the surface of the water. Every time gold pops up, they hit it, but gold bounces back like one of those punching clowns. At some point they are going to have to go back into “managed retreat.” Maybe once the election is over. 
You’ll note that there’s now been a complete reversal in the precious metals sector, with gold, silver and the HUI running higher and the SPX/Dow headed south. MSJ subscribers have been getting analysis like this since early March. In addition, my picks have been substantially outperforming the sector. MSJ is $20/month, with no minimum commitment period.

17687,Today’s Upside Move In Gold & Silver Is Nothing Compared To What Is Coming,"29 Views November 01, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
As the gold and silver markets stage a rally, today’s move in gold and silver is nothing compared to what is coming. 
A Terrifying Crisis John Embry: “Things are continuing to deteriorate across the globe. Now we are facing the very real possibility of another world war, and in a world with massive nuclear arsenals on both sides I find that to be terrifying… Continue reading the John Embry interview below… Advertisement To hear what billionaire Eric Sprott & Rick Rule are doing with their own money and which $7 billion company John Embry & Dr. Marc Faber oversee click on the logo: 
John Embry continues: “In my mind, that crisis dwarfs the economic and financial deterioration. 
On a separate note, I laughed when I saw the U.S. GDP number come in at 2.9 percent. That is totally at odds with important economic indicators such as freight traffic, industrial production, construction, oil consumption, etc. 
Along those same lines, the inflation rate published by the government sharply understates the true rate of inflation for the average U.S. citizen. The price of necessities — food, energy, housing, and healthcare, are all now rising much faster than the official inflation rate. And those are the primary items that the average consumers spend the bulk of their incomes on in the United States. 
The issue of Obamacare has become a national disgrace, with premium increases in 2017 to exceed double-digit percentages in virtually all constituencies. It will be interesting to see how this reality is reflected in voting patterns next week. Despite the mainstream press awarding the election to Hillary Clinton, there may be a bigger backlash coming from the voting public than anticipated. The public has become increasingly disenchanted with the establishment and what it has done to living standards for the average American. 
However, irrespective of who wins the election, I foresee a big upward price move in gold and silver that may have already started today, as there are no palatable solutions to the world’s massive debt problems. I have long believed that we are going to experience a global hyperinflation for the first time in history, and this represents the most disruptive social condition that can possibly occur. Eventually the debt will have to be dealt with but I suspect that will happen in the wake of the hyperinflation. At that moment the only refuges will be hard assets, with gold and silver at the front of the pack. Meaning, today’s upside move in gold and silver is nothing compared to what is coming.”

17688,"Trump Transition Team Demands List of Every Executive Order Obama Made on Immigration, Assets to Build Border Wall: Reuters - Breitbart","The Trump transition team wants copies of every single executive order and directive outgoing President Obama ordered on immigration since he took office, along with several other documents that will let them assess how to beef up border security, according to a Reuters exclusive. [Most famous among the executive orders: Obama’s unconstitutional shielding of illegal aliens from deportation in 2012, carving out exemptions for illegal aliens who arrived in the U. S. as minors. It granted a form of legal status and work permits to some 1. 4 million illegals who signed up —  and an “advance parole” that would let them claim U. S. citizenship, completely absent of Congressional oversight, let alone approval.  Trump transition officials also asked to see any illegal aliens’ records who had been changed to ensure federal workers were not altering them to help the illegals stay in the U. S. according to Reuters. The illegal aliens who signed up for amnesty freely gave the government their addresses, identities, and admission that they’re in the country illegally, meaning they could be the first in line when the deportations begin under a Trump administration. “Four years ago I pointed out the fundamental problem with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: Anyone who signed up for DACA would be adding their names to a list of   illegal aliens. Should a future administration decide that it would start enforcing the law, the DACA program would provide list of prime candidates for deportation,” writes John Miano at the   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). “At the time, this was so obvious that I was surprised anyone would be stupid enough to sign up for DACA and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans). Yet apparently hundreds of thousands of people did so anyway. ” Roughly one million of the illegal aliens who signed up for Obama’s amnesty are from Mexico, CIS added. There may be as many as thirty million illegal aliens living in America in defiance of U. S. law. Any and every illegal alien in the U. S. is subject to deportation, Trump said in a major policy speech given in Phoenix, Arizona, roughly two months before his election win. There will be “zero tolerance” for illegal immigration under a Trump administration. “Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation  —   that is what it means to have laws and to have a country,” Trump said. The Trump transition team also requested that the Department of Homeland Security ” assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction,” and look into expanding detention capabilities for illegal aliens and aerial surveillance of the U. S.  border: In response to the transition team request, U. S. Customs and Border Protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the U. S.  border, and about the same distance along the U. S.  border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters  …     One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was Operation Phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1, 200 Army National Guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration  …     Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11. 37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing. The meeting between transition team and DHS officials took place Dec. 5, Reuters said.",0
17689,"Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success - The New York Times","It is not an easy thing to be an independent   company these days. For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail. Lyft, the     company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces  —   but has found that its options are limited. The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties. Lyft’s discussions were most serious with G. M. which is one of the   company’s largest investors. Still, G. M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer. Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1. 4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity. Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the   market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While   companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly  . Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies. Tensions have escalated in the industry in recent months as some   companies have worked to figure out what to do with their most expensive operations. This month, Uber, which has raised far more money than Lyft, agreed to sell its Chinese subsidiary to Didi, the biggest   company in China. The deal freed Uber from a   battle for dominance in the Chinese market. But the move also disrupted a global alliance that Lyft had struck with Didi and others to fight Uber. Lyft has not said whether it will continue working with Didi, but the dissolution of a partnership could stymie Lyft’s growth prospects. Representatives from Lyft, Google, Amazon, Apple, G. M. Didi and Uber declined to comment on talks. The Information earlier reported on talks between G. M. and Lyft. Lyft, a    company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early     program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two   have said, was to create a new kind of social   an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity’s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation. That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide  —   like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber  —   look to upend the global transportation infrastructure. The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment. Lyft failed to find a buyer partly because of cost, the people said. Lyft was valued at $5. 5 billion after an investment round by G. M. and others in January, making it one of the more   unicorn companies in Silicon Valley. Any sale would most likely have to fetch a premium from Lyft’s last valuation to be desirable to the company and its investors. Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the   business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft’s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company’s financials. That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs. The economic realities of the industry have set in for a number of   players. Sidecar, an app that competed with Uber and Lyft, shut down in December, citing a “significant capital disadvantage” compared with others in the market. “One of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,” said Susan Shaheen,   of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. “Part of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that’s not an easy task. ” Lyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company’s finances. Yet it has a $1. 4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability. Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for   companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete. “There isn’t a single company that has all of this expertise  —   software, manufacturing,    —   under one roof,” she said. “That’s where acquisition comes in. ”",0

Palestinians know too well the threat to their own water supply …. 
As Native communities face an ongoing genocide and continue to resist the imperialist settler-colonial regime of the United States, Palestinians are too experiencing a genocide and ethnocide within our homelands from the settler-colonial state of Israel.” 
Image by Carlos Latuff “Water is life for all of us”: Palestinian activists join Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to protest DAPL Palestinians join Standing Rock Sioux to protest Dakota Access Pipeline 
Nadya Raja Tannous “Perhaps only in North Dakota, where oil tycoons wine and dine elected officials, and where the governor, Jack Dalrymple, serves as an adviser to the Trump campaign, would state and county governments act as the armed enforcement for corporate interests. In recent weeks, the state has militarized my reservation, with road blocks and license-plate checks, low-flying aircraft and racial profiling of Indians. The local sheriff and the pipeline company have both called our protest “unlawful,” and Gov. Dalrymple has declared a state of emergency. It’s a familiar story in Indian Country. This is the third time that the Sioux Nation’s lands and resources have been taken without regard for tribal interests. The Sioux peoples signed treaties in 1851 and 1868. The government broke them before the ink was dry. When the Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Missouri River in 1958, it took our riverfront forests, fruit orchards and most fertile farmland to create Lake Oahe. Now the Corps is taking our clean water and sacred places by approving this river crossing.” – Dave Archambault II , Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, opinion piece in the NY Times The Bakken formation in the northern United States and southern Canada is listed by US energy companies as one of the most promising options for national oil extraction, only surpassed in size by the oil fields in Alaska . The fields in North Dakota have been increasingly targeted for Bakken shale oil resources over the past years and they are quite familiar with public controversy: many of us remember the proposal of the infamous Keystone XL pipeline from 2008-2015, which was held in starkly low public opinion and struck down twice by the Obama administration . The proposed Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is not so different from its failed counterpart. It is mapped out for the same length of 1,172 miles as the Keystone XL and is targeting the same Bakken shale reserves for carry across the upper Midwest . The proposed $3.8 billion dollar DAPL would transport 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day across four states and cross the Missouri River itself. Parent company, Energy Transfer Partners is selling the pipeline as an economic booster, job creator , and sure investment for the future of the American people. Yet, who exactly are they referring to and who did they consult? In the hills outside of Bismarck, North Dakota is the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, sitting along the banks of the Cannonball River, a tributary to the Missouri River. The pipeline construction sites can now be seen from the reservation, but many people here saw the pipeline coming before it even arrived. Just as Energy Transfer Partners and TransCanada failed to consult Native Tribes who live along the planned pipeline route and whose sacred lands, ancestral lands, and main water sources will be compromised by construction, there has not been a single tribal consultation around the proposed DAPL. On April 1st , Sacred Stone Spirit Camp was erected on the bank of the Cannonball as a residence for water protectors, many whom came from within and off the reservation to stand against pipeline construction, call for water preservation, and call for recognition of the Federal treat ies held with the Great Sioux Nation. What started out as a few hundred people quickly increased into the thousands, stemming the creation of the Oceti Sakowin and Red Warrior Camps on the other side of the Cannonball. Protectors, support, and solidarity with Standing Rock are arriving from all edges of the world, many of them representing Indigenous Nations . My own caravan set out from California the 2nd week of September, preceding the Palestinian Youth Movement-USA Caravan that arrived soon after. As a contingent of Indigenous peoples in diaspora and recent settlers on Turtle Island , we attest that those standing at Standing Rock are standing for our present and future as well. We must in turn stand for each other against the present, future, and historical supremacies of erasure, the active legacy of settler-colonialism, and the viciousness of greed. The pipeline company seems to remain unconcerned by the risk of polluting the reservation’s main water source, the highly probable degradation of land and sacred sights, and their trespass against a series of federal laws , and they are becoming increasingly reactionary to the flow of protectors in and out of the protector camps and surrounding areas. Just a few weeks ago, on September 28th, alarming images and video were released of armed police and military-style vehicles cornering protectors holding a prayer ceremony at a North Dakota construction site. The video portrayed the intensity on the ground and just how vulnerable the protector camps are without the gaze of the public eye: “They are moving in” “They won’t let us leave. They have locked us in on both sides” “They’ve got their weapons drawn” “They’ve got snipers on top of the hill” “They’re blocking me on Facebook” “They are arresting everyone now. Everyone is running” “Share this far and wide” – Transcript of LiveStream video via Unicorn Riot The militarized forces blocked the only exit from the site to the public road before arresting 21 protectors . Other attendees posted photos of a crop dusting plane releasing a gas or chemical over the crowd. There has been little clarity thereafter of the makeup of the compound or the purpose of the spray. The participation and planning of direct actions against DAPL construction, however, are continuing, with over 100 cars caravanning out to 5 construction sites the week of October 3rd and successfully halting construction for the day. Local authorities, private security hires, and the National Guard are seemingly disturbed by the presence of protectors as well, and are going out of their way to restrict access in and out of the protector camp area and intimidate newcomers. Indeed my own caravan coming from California was discouraged from approaching the reservation on the main road running from Bismarck, ND due to the checkpoints erected by North Dakota authorities. Our longwinded encounter with the highway patrol on our way to North Dakota — who insisted on not only checking all of our IDs followed by standing on the side of the highway outside of the car for an hour but also “passed our information down the line to the authorities higher-up” including suspicions of illegal activity — seemed to be motivated to dissuade an influx of supporters into the area. Stories of license plate checks, racial profiling of Native and ethnic drivers and/or car passengers, as well as arrests at roadblocks, circulated through the camps. Democracy Now , The New York Times , Huffington Post , and many independent news sources also reported these same tactics. Why did I go in the first place? Because somewhere in the awkward power dynamic of being a US citizen, a non-native inhabitant of Turtle Island , and a Palestinian in the Diaspora, I saw the struggle for livelihood and culture, the struggle against settler-colonialism, the struggle to protect the sacred and maintain your own legitimacy, and the ever ominous force of erasure and historical amnesia. What I later saw at Standing Rock both embodied this and became bigger than it; as a Mohawk Elder said to me, “Without water, we [humans] are infertile dust”. At a council fire in Oceti Sakowin during my stay, 280 Indigenous Nations were thanked for their support and representation at the camps. Movement leaders at Sacred Stone Spirit Camp have repeatedly stated that the gatherings of different Indigenous Nations near Cannonball, ND is the largest in the past 150 years on the North American continent . The council fire sits at the mouth of the main entrance of Oceti Sakowin Camp, outlined by rows of flags representing many of the Indigenous Nations who have come to stand with Standing Rock. At the end of one of the rows is the Palestinian flag. Seeing it filled me equally with joy and sadness because it confirmed two things that I had pondered throughout the long drive from California to North Dakota: the first thought is that the power of collective resistance against greed and settler-colonialism is a mighty force. That thought was embodied by my joy to see a representation of will by the presently unseen Palestinian siblings who had come to take a stand against destructive powers. The second thought was embodied by sadness for, if the struggle for protection of water, culture, land, heritage, and livelihood is truly mirrored in Standing Rock and Palestine, then the struggle ahead is both vast and uncompromising. I spoke with many inspiring protectors from the Maori in New Zealand, indigenous representatives from Ecuador, Canadian representatives from the Blackfoot Nation who were longtime activists in the “Idle No More” mobilizations, and Dakota/Lakota/Nakota from Standing Rock and the neighboring reservations among so many others. From a variety of perspectives and personal stories, the same foundational message was repeated back to me: this stand isn’t just about standing for Native rights, it is about protecting the water, protecting our earth and securing the livelihood of our next generations. Water is life for all of us. Myself and fellow members of the Palestinian Youth Movement–United States Branch had reflected on the latter thought when we authored our statement of solidarity “with the Standing Rock Sioux, the Great Sioux Nation and our other native sisters, brothers and siblings in the fight against the DAPL”, circulated on September 7th. Segments read: “We condemn all forms of state violence against our First Nation siblings and denote that the undermining of their sovereignty and livelihood is a part of the continuing dialectic of settler-colonialism transnationally. Since the arrival of settlers on Turtle Island, First Nations have resisted genocide and displacement. From seizure of land to reservations, from boarding schools to massacres, the state has done everything in its power to erase and eradicate First Nation peoples. Yet, they are still with us today and they continue to resist. Protecting their land, people, and future generations from the DAPL is a testament to their strength and resilience. …. As Native communities face an ongoing genocide and continue to resist the imperialist settler-colonial regime of the United States, Palestinians are too experiencing a genocide and ethnocide within our homelands from the settler-colonial state of Israel.” The comparisons are uncanny. I had spent most of the hours on the road to North Dakota contemplating the connections between the obstacles and oppressions facing those in Standing Rock and the obstacles and oppressions facing we Palestinians under occupation and apartheid. However, upon arriving at Standing Rock, I no longer just thought about the similarities, I felt them in my bones. When protectors at Standing Rock asked me about what Palestinians experience in our own fight against settler-colonialism , oppression, and greed, I answered sometimes through the language of statistics. Yet, more often, I told them narratives of genocide, exile, delegimitzation, broken promises, and resounding resilience. Sitting around a fire, burning sage and cedar wood, Darlene Meguinis of the Blackfoot Nation in Canada reflected on the beginnings of the Idle No More movement, in which she is still an active organizer. She told me: “Everything must start with prayer and ceremony, especially organizing.” She reminded me that the founders of Idle No More , elders Nina Waste, Jessica Gordon, Sheelah Mcleen, and Sylvia McAdams, had rooted the movement in ceremony. The result of doing so, Meguinis maintained, was to center the focus of the collective actions for change. Native youth in the #NoDAPL Youth Council at Standing Rock reiterated similar ideas about DAPL actions. Two youth leaders recounted to me, “we are striving for the results that we want to see but are being directed by our ancestors. We are here, acting now, for our children.” Intention and prayer surrounded much of the daily camp life and easily dispersed the tensions outside, even as the DAPL Company and National Guard helicopters flew low over the camps each morning, afternoon and night (something that pointedly reminded me of life in Palestine). Some mornings along the bend of the Cannonball River, which delineates Oceti Sakowin/Red Warrior Camp from Sacred Stone Spirit Camp, Native artists reflected the beauty around them in paintings and art installations. One of the organizers was Albuquerque artist Monty Singer, whose picture is shown below. The time set out to create art and music, to gather around fires and drum circles, to participate in prayer and ceremony with each other uplifted the vibrant energy of the camps and the people within them. We cheered, prayed and supported the direct actions as best we could every day; donations from across the U.S. and internationally flooded into the main entrance in the afternoons and community kitchens and donation booths ran 24/7 to maintain the swelling of protector numbers. Hundreds of people ebbed and flowed into the camps every single day. The sheer power required to uphold the movement is sobering: in light of the failed injunction by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the US Army Corps of Engineers at the lower court level, a Federal Appeals court officially halted construction of the pipeline, underlining the same temporary hold parameters as the decree proposed on September 9th by the Department of Justice (DOJ ). That hold applies solely within 20 miles on either side of Lake Oahe near the Missouri River. Other locations on the planned pipeline route are still open for construction and, though direct actions at sites of DAPL construction have not wavered, they are increasingly receiving less and less media attention with increasingly severe charges being applied to protectors. For example, the 5 protectors who strapped themselves to bulldozers at an active DAPL construction site 100 miles down Hwy 94 from the reservation during my stay at Oceti Sakowin Camp were slapped with felony charges for “criminal trespassing”, the same charges outlined against Amy Goodman in her arrest warrant as a result of her coverage of the DAPL in early September (although her charges at the time constituted a misdemeanor and were thankfully dropped October 17th after a court hearing ). Some of those arrested were even extradited back to their home states to face their charges from North Dakota in addition to preexisting protest charges in other states. My last night in Standing Rock, I spoke with a woman by the name of “Terry”, a resident of Bismarck, ND. I asked her why I had met so few non-natives from the local area at Standing Rock. Her response was direct and had very little to do with the sheriff’s implemented checkpoints and roadblocks: “It is because of the media propaganda. For example, during the dog attacks, Bismarck news covered a worker’s injury at the site and the hospitalization of a guard. No one gave popular air time or writing space to cover the effects of the dog attacks on protectors.” She mentioned that an article in the conservative paper, Town Hall , soon after the attacks read: “ So dogs were unleashed on these protestors. Good ”. She and a few others from Bismarck came to the camps because they saw past the media pressure. “We understand that the fight for clean water and recognition of Native sovereignty affects everyone in the surrounding area”, she told me, which would become increasingly apparent if oil leakage wells up in the Bakken region. In Geneva, on September 20th, Dave Archambault II, Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, urged the UN Human Rights Council to stand with the tribe in opposing the DAPL project and advocate for the recognition of their sovereign rights, including the protection of water and sacred places . Protectors are remaining vigilant on and off site, many walking to pay respects to the graves of the Dakota/Lakota/Nakota ancestors that have been disturbed by construction. Martina Looking Horse, a longtime writer from Cheyenne River Reservation, has been camping at Standing Rock for over a month. She told me that she and her family plan to stay until the pipeline is defeated but stressed that the conditions at camp are not easy to live under. The torrential rainstorms, the swings of hot and cold, and the impending North Dakota winter discourage many from staying longer than a few weeks. Yet, Looking Horse affirmed her belief that she and many others will carry on, with or without the support of mainstream media. The hope, she reaffirmed, is that the national and international people of conscience will continue to support in all the ways that they can, hold the US government accountable to their promises, and not forget that the protectors are still there taking a stand. The day that I left, the PYM-United States Branch’s official caravan came into Oceti Sakowin, bringing supplies, people power, and small gifts for the tribal council as visitors to the land. They also read our statement at the tribal council fire and met many people, as I had, who stated how glad they were to see Palestinians supporting the front lines against movement suppression. The solidarity with Palestine for all of us who participated in caravans from PYM was overwhelming. What was supposed to be a few-day trip was extended into a week. Inspired by the stories, the people, the call to our moral responsibility to protect each other and the water that keeps us alive, we hope to return back to Standing Rock and bring supplies for winter. Friends of Sabeel North America also sent forward a statement of solidarity , in part remarking: “we know that settler colonialism depends on the exploitation of land and natural resources to the detriment of indigenous communities…Today, we see you, the Sioux nation and members of the other 280 Native American tribes who have joined you to protect the water of the Missouri River and stop the Dakota Access Pipeline, taking a stand for all life, the embodiment of resilience. As the Israeli occupation continues, Palestinian land is stolen, ancient olive trees are uprooted, and blood is shed, your struggle inspires our work and we redouble our efforts to witness and nonviolently resist. We stand in full support of indigenous sovereignty and self-determination.” The light of hope in Standing Rock is not fizzling out. Upon returning to the Bay Area, I came across many art builds and donation efforts, and have been seeing many more events publicized by friends and family in New York State, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona. Thanks to Caleb Duarte and the wonderful youth from Fremont High School in Oakland (recently arrived unaccompanied youth from Chimeltenango, Guatemala) who made this solidarity banner: Art build in Oakland, CA : Recent unaccompanied minors from Guatemala write “Water is Life” in Maya.

(Photo: Nadya Tannous) I remember thinking as I left Standing Rock to return to California: peoples suppressed by power and greed have strength when they rise together. There is a poignant uniting force through something as important as the world that sustains us. The river was quiet when I left, with lots of green and tall grass on its banks. The river flats lay muddy and fertile, the slow current reflecting the sky day and night, the water turning pink and orange by sunset. A water protector strapped to heavy machinery down the Hwy 94 shouted out , before being removed to jail, “This pipeline is a pipeline to the past. We need to be building sustainable infrastructure for the future, not destructive unsustainable industries that hurt land, that hurt water, that hurt people. Everything is wrong about this pipeline… We’re here standing in solidarity with millions of people from around the world that are against this pipeline.” (via Unicorn Riot) The collective call for justice is ringing loud and clear.

17691,Sheriff David Clarke: ’I Sense Pride in Our Nation I Have Found Lacking for the Last Eight Years’ - Breitbart,"Sheriff David Clarke began his closing address to CPAC 2017 as he knew everyone familiar with him would expect, by declaring “Blue Lives Matter in America! ”[“To what purpose did our Founding Fathers and the soldiers of our great Continental Army strive? Did they work to form the horrible mistake of what progressive Democrats call the Great Society  —   a place of    reliance on the benevolent providence of government as the father, the mother, the breadwinner, and the teacher?” Clarke asked as he settled down to the primary business of his speech.   “I think not,” he answered. “You see, General Washington was rightly and firstly proud of the nation that he believed lay within the grasp of the colonists, as they struggled to tear it away from the corpulent arms of an overbearing King of England. George Washington wrote to Benjamin Franklin that no country upon Earth had it more in its power to attain these blessings than united America. ” Clarke quoted extensively from Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, Ronald Reagan, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his address. His overall theme was a call to arms his closing request was for CPAC attendees to go out and fight. It was, in some respects, the type of closing speech one might have expected to hear if Republicans had lost the 2016 presidential election. Clarke’s purpose was to impress upon his conservative audience that they faced determined opposition from the Left, and would need to remain in fighting trim themselves if they wanted President Donald Trump to implement the policies they voted for. Clarke stressed that Washington and his revolutionaries “never intended to build a nation to be ruled from a throne room or a centralized government. ” “They weren’t building a land where Boston, or Philadelphia, or New York City, or even today’s capital city that bears his name would dictate terms and conditions to the American people,” he continued. “No, their efforts to secure the basic human rights endowed by the Creator and formation of a most limited government, instituted justly by men and deriving its limited powers from the consent of the governed. They embraced the concept of  . ”  “They fought the tyranny of the throne, it’s true. They fought to end the abuse of the colonies at the hand of an uncaring and unsympathetic master, but seemingly forgotten yet chief among the complaints outlined by Jefferson in his great Declaration was the refusal of the monarchy to craft and enforce needed laws  —   wholesome and necessary to the public good, said Jefferson, and of immediate and pressing importance, they told the king of England. They law, they said, a law that works, a respect and reverence to the rule of law,” said Clarke.  “These goals were as key at the founding of our great Republic as the need to satisfy our thirst for freedom and religion, and assembly, and a free and unfettered media that we keeping hearing about so much today,” he added wryly. Clarke used the Civil War as another example of the importance of law, making a compelling argument that passing and fairly enforcing good laws is as essential to the maintenance of liberty as repealing bad laws and scaling back the power of overweening government. “Lincoln knew the failure to adhere to that standard in our shared American life would surely result in our surrender  —   first to the immorality of convenience, then to the sloth of inaction, and finally to the shame of irrelevance,” he proclaimed. Clarke quoted from George Washington to support the idea that America has legitimate needs as a   and requires a certain degree of unity to endure, despite our many important differences: “We are either a united people or we are not. If it is the former, then let us in all matters of general concern act as a nation which has national objects to promote, and a national character to support. If we are not, then let us no longer act a farce by pretending to it. ” Clarke asked: I ask, are we now acting out the farce that President Washington predicted? We have matters under consideration in this capital city, most notably concerning immigration law and its enforcement, that even the most jaded among us would begrudgingly concede are of national importance to everyone. We have border states, most notably on our southern border, that have to date disproportionately borne the brunt and the burden of our failure to act over the past decades. But is there a state in this union in which the impact of that failure is not keenly felt by the American people? “Yet we seem to have fallen to a place and a time in our national discourse where even the mere restatement and affirmation of laws long ago crafted, and duly enacted by our Constitutional republic’s legislature  —   laws that were formed and codified in the people’s house, by the people’s representatives  —   is now considered controversial,” he observed. He went on: In the executive memoranda on immigration laws attested to this past week, no new laws were created. No group was put at risk without affording them due process. The rights of not one of our citizens, even in a land where president, senator, and farmer stand shoulder to shoulder as equals, was imperiled in the least. Instead, we merely restated the laws that were, what they have been, and voiced an intent to see them upheld fairly, impartially, and with a haste born of necessity. “And yet, in our modern times, that is viewed in some circles as oppressive, as controversial, and as wrong,” he noted, adding a sarcastic “Seriously?” He called it a “perversion of thought” to say that Americans are against immigrants. “Do some critics truly believe that we have become that Orwellian nightmare that views all Americans as equal, yet with some more equal than others? Come on now, seriously?” he asked. He said those who oppose the fair enforcement of duly passed immigration laws offer only “lawlessness, obstruction, and chaos” in other areas of American life as well. “They offer no morality, and certainly no courage,” Clarke said. “They offer only appeasement and the false currencies of concession and popularity over the virtues of morality and certainty. ” He drew a comparison between appeasement in foreign policy and appeasement to domestic lawlessness, warning we could not expect strong support for the rule of law from “liberal legislators” who “mark as their key data point in crafting policy how many Facebook likes their pages get, or what the latest Internet polling shows, or how many smiling emojis follow their every move. ” “I for one find no safe harbor or   view on the middle ground, wheedling or seeking for others to announce the virtue of my actions,” declared Clarke, whose history of boldly confronting controversy over his words and actions certainly support that claim. “You see I, like President Reagan, see things not only as Left and Right, but as forward and backward  —   swimming sometimes against a powerful tide, or simply treading water, fundamentally failing our duty to make any choice at all by voting ‘present. ’” This was an important part of his overall theme about keeping all hands on deck, and conservatism at battle stations, rather than allowing intense opposition from the Left and media to paralyze Congress and the administration. He emphasized the point with an especially apt Reagan quote the audience adored: “I suggest to you that there is no Left or Right, only an up and a down. Up to the maximum of individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. ” Clarke said that as a career police officer, he understood the importance of public servants respecting the public that grants them authority through the consent of the governed.  “We the people do not follow established rules simply because a law enforcement officer is present to enforce them, but because of our basic love of, trust of, and reliance on our fellow citizens,” he argued. He quoted Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter’s admonition that “if one man can be allowed to determine for himself what the law is, then every man can. That means first chaos, and then tyranny. ” “American law enforcement officers have always understood this simple truth,” Clarke said. “They spend their life’s work, as I have thus far, exemplifying my faith in, my belief in, and commitment to our American system of justice  —   a system renowned the world over for the provisions of individual due process as a right endowed in each of us by our Creator. ” “The rule of law doesn’t divide us,” he said. “It binds us together in our great American life with shared behaviors, beliefs, and manners. I call it, as do many of you, ‘American exceptionalism.’ We are a nation of limited government in which everyone willfully, and as a matter of civic duty, must obey the law. And the value derived for the small price paid of observance of the common law is the greatest treasure known to mankind: freedom. Sweet freedom. ” “Freedom is why we get up in the morning and tend the fields. It is why we stay up late at night watching foreign markets. It sustains us. It feeds us. And once we have tasted it, we can never have enough to be satisfied,” he said. “As a conservative I believe with all my heart, that in furtherance of the common good, freedom means you decide your destiny. You, your family, your household, your neighborhood, your small town, your state  —   and yes, in those few matters of national scope, your nation,” Clarke said. “To cede as a matter of simple course of expediency, to cede those powers too quickly or injudiciously to Washington D. C. is just plain wrong, and it always has been. ” He quoted Reagan again: “We have come to a time for choosing  …     either we accept the responsibility for our own destiny, or we abandon the American revolution and confess that an intellectual belief in a   capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan our own lives. ” Clarke exclaimed, winning the longest and strongest applause of the hour: How refreshing is that simple concept, that we who run our lives know the course of our own destiny better than some congresswoman from California, better than some judge from Joplin may know it sitting in a   office in Washington, making the decisions that can undermine all of our great efforts. How refreshing to see a return to that respectful thought of the importance of   and to turn away from the conceit and arrogance that was its predecessor at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue before January 20th, 2017! In President Donald Trump we have chosen a leader  —   a leader who I expect many of you in this room well know I both campaigned and vigorously supported for the highest office in this land. And he was a candidate that I’m certain many in this room also supported, and some may have at first opposed in some measure. That’s fine. That’s the great nature of this republic. We have choices, and we decide. However, in President Trump I sense a return now to those key virtues first extolled in that letter to a tyrant monarch in 1776. I sense a pride in our nation, and a voice to that pride that I have found lacking for the last eight years. “We were constantly told by former President Obama that America needed to humble itself. He told us humility is a virtue. But false humility is an affront to the senses, and pride in the greatness and might of our nation has never been a sin,” he argued.  “President George Washington himself observed, upon the occasion of his first inaugural, ‘There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness.’ Consider those words once more: ‘A rank due the United States of America.’ Allow me to translate that language from 1789 to 2017. It means: ‘Put America first,’” he said. Clarke faulted the mainstream media for “mocking and taunting” President Trump’s America First vision, portraying it as “dark and feral. ” He said: No, it’s not. Yet those who held the office before President Trump would rise up from their graves and nod in agreement with the importance of our shared effort and potential for reward that President Trump offered us when he said, ‘We the citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country, restore its promise not for an elite few, but for all of our people.’ He said together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many years to come. President Trump reminded us we will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done. Clarke said in closing: Ladies and gentlemen, today is our moment of truth, our point of no return. The choices we need make at this moment are opposed by entrenched interests. The ‘resistance’ looms. They attack our motives, they assail our beliefs, they decry our notion of justice, they proclaim the high ground of virtue, and they threaten upheaval if not given their way. What will history show we did with our moment of truth? Did we stand and fight, or did we cut and run? “Ladies and gentlemen, this is my challenge to you. These are your marching orders: Go forth to stand and fight,” he said.",0
17692,Obama Says U.S. Will Retaliate for Russia’s Election Meddling - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama said on Thursday that the United States would retaliate for Russia’s efforts to influence the presidential election, asserting that “we need to take action,” and “we will. ” The comments, in an interview with NPR, indicate that Mr. Obama, in his remaining weeks in office, will pursue either economic sanctions against Russia or perhaps some kind of response in cyberspace. Mr. Obama spoke as   Donald J. Trump on Thursday again refused to accept Moscow’s culpability, asking on Twitter why the administration had waited “so long to act” if Russia “or some other entity” had carried out cyberattacks. The president discussed the potential for American retaliation with Steve Inskeep of NPR for an interview to air on Friday morning. “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our election,” Mr. Obama said, “we need to take action. And we will  —   at the time and place of our choosing. ” On Friday morning, the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, batted away the warning. “It is necessary to either stop talking about it, or finally produce some evidence,” he told the Interfax news agency. “Otherwise, it all begins to look quite unseemly. ” The White House strongly suggested before the election that Mr. Obama would make use of sanctions authority for cyberattacks that he had given to himself by executive order. But he did not, in part out of concern that action before the election could lead to an escalated conflict. If Mr. Obama invokes sanctions on Russian individuals or organizations, Mr. Trump could reverse them. But that would be politically difficult, as his critics argue that he is blind to Russian behavior. On Thursday, pressure grew on Mr. Trump in Congress for him to acknowledge intelligence agencies’ conclusions that Russia was behind the hacking. But aides said that was all but impossible before the Electoral College convenes on Monday to formalize his victory. Mr. Trump has said privately in recent days that he believes there are people in the C. I. A. who are out to get him and are working to delegitimize his presidency, according to people briefed on the conversations who described them on the condition of anonymity. The  ’s suspicions have been stoked by the efforts of a group of Democratic electors, as well as one Republican, who called this week for an intelligence briefing on the Russian hacking, raising the prospect that votes in the Electoral College might be changed. In his Twitter posting on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested that the government’s conclusions on Russian hacking were a case of sour grapes by Mr. Obama. The   falsely stated that Mr. Obama had waited until after the election to raise the issue. “Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?” Mr. Trump asked, although the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. formally blamed Russia on Oct. 7 for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other organizations. In September, meeting privately in China with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Obama not only complained, the White House says, but also warned him of consequences if the Russian activity did not stop. Among those in his own party, Mr. Trump’s refusal to accept the evidence that Russia was the perpetrator was raising growing concerns, with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina saying he would not vote for Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, unless Mr. Tillerson addressed Russia’s role during his confirmation hearings. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump’s stated doubts about Russia’s involvement will subside after Monday’s Electoral College vote. He and his allies have been concerned that the reports of Russian hacking have been intended to peel away votes from him, although even Democrats have not gone so far as to say the election was illegitimate. “Right now, certain elements of the media, certain elements of the intelligence community and certain politicians are really doing the work of the Russians  —   they’re creating this uncertainty over the election,” Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, told reporters on Thursday after meeting with Mr. Trump. But many other Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, have publicly argued that the evidence leads straight to Russia. They have called for a full investigation, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged Mr. Obama on Thursday to complete an administration review quickly. Mr. Trump’s Twitter post was his latest move to accuse the intelligence agencies he will soon control of acting with a political agenda and to dispute the   conclusion that Moscow carried out a meticulously planned series of attacks and releases of information to interfere in the presidential race. But as he repeated his doubts, Mr. Trump seized on emerging questions about the Obama administration’s response: Why did it take months after the breaches had been discovered for the administration to name Moscow publicly as the culprit? And why did Mr. Obama initially opt not to openly retaliate, through sanctions or other measures? White House officials have said that the warning to Mr. Putin at the September summit meeting in China constituted the primary American response so far. When the administration decided to go public with its conclusion a month later, it did so in a statement from the director of national intelligence and the Homeland Security secretary, not in a prominent presidential appearance. Officials said they were worried that any larger public response would have raised doubts about the election’s integrity, something Mr. Trump was already seeking to do during the campaign when he insisted the election was “rigged. ” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, criticized Mr. Trump on Thursday for questioning whether Russia was behind the attacks, referring to Mr. Trump’s call during the campaign for Moscow to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, a remark his team has since dismissed as a joke. “I don’t think anybody at the White House thinks it’s funny that an adversary of the United States engaged in malicious cyberactivity to destabilize our democracy  —   that’s not a joke,” Mr. Earnest said. “It might be time to not attack the intelligence community, but actually be supportive of a thorough, transparent, rigorous, nonpolitical investigation into what exactly happened. ” While he declined to confirm news reports that Mr. Putin was personally involved in directing the cyberattacks, Mr. Earnest pointedly read part of the Oct. 7 statement that said intelligence officials believed “that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities. ” He said that language “would lead me to conclude that based on my personal reading and not based on any knowledge that I have that may be classified or otherwise, it was pretty obvious that they were referring to the   government official in Russia. ” In a conference call with reporters later on Thursday, aides declined to explain Mr. Trump’s position on whether Russia had been responsible for the breaches or to describe what he would do about the issue as president. Jason Miller, a spokesman, said he would let Mr. Trump’s “tweets speak for themselves” and added that those raising questions about the hacking were refusing to come to terms with his victory. “At a certain point you’ve got to realize that the election from last month is going to stand,” Mr. Miller said.",0
17693,Scientists Bristle at Trump Budget’s Cuts to Research - The New York Times,"Before he became president, Donald J. Trump called climate change a hoax, questioned the safety of vaccines and mocked renewable energy as a plaything of “ . ” So perhaps it is no surprise that Mr. Trump’s first budget took direct aim at basic scientific and medical research. Still, the extent of the cuts in the proposed budget unveiled early Thursday shocked scientists, researchers and program administrators. The reductions include $5. 8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health, which fund thousands of researchers working on cancer and other diseases, and $900 million, or a little less than 20 percent, from the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, which funds the national laboratories, considered among the crown jewels of basic research in the world. The White House is also proposing to eliminate climate science programs throughout the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency. “As to climate change, I think the president was fairly straightforward: We’re not spending money on that anymore,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said at a White House briefing on Thursday. “We consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that. ” While the budget is only a blueprint and is sure to face strong opposition from members of both parties in Congress  —   many lawmakers have already said that certain cuts, like those to the N. I. H. are nonstarters  —   policy makers expressed concern about what the proposal says about the administration’s commitment to science. “Do they not think that there are advances to be made, improvements to be made, in the human condition?” said Rush D. Holt, a physicist and the chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “The record of scientific research is so good, for so many years  —   who would want to sell it short? What are they thinking?” The American Society of Clinical Oncology, the leading professional society for cancer specialists, issued a statement warning that the proposed budget “will devastate our nation’s already fragile federal research infrastructure. ” “Now is not the time to slow progress in finding new treatments and cures for patients with cancer,” the group said. Others said the proposed cuts would motivate more scientists to become politically active. Referring to the budget released early Thursday, Dr. Caroline Weinberg, a public health researcher and one of the organizers of a protest march by scientists set for April 22 in Washington, said, “It is a   document detailing exactly why thousands of people around the world will join together to march for science. ” Some cuts were singled out for criticism. The proposed budget would eliminate the Fogarty International Center, an N. I. H. program focused on global health. The center, founded in the 1960s, has worked on H. I. V.  Ebola, diabetes, dengue, maternal mortality and numerous other health problems, and trains American and foreign doctors and researchers in developing countries. “The Fogarty Center advances United States national interests in a multitude of ways, and it would be terribly unfortunate for the institution to cease to exist,” said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a member of the Fogarty Center’s advisory board. “It has a high reputation outside our borders,” Dr. Morrison said of the center, which has had annual appropriations of about $70 million. “It’s a very tiny institution,” he added, in terms of the overall budget. Judith Enck, a regional E. P. A. official in the Obama administration and now a visiting scholar at Pace University School of Law, called the proposed science cuts in her former agency “nonsensical. ” Noting that one of the programs being cut monitors chemicals known as endocrine disrupters, she said, “Not having the latest science on endocrine disrupters will make more people sick. And that is not something the states will pick up. ” The administration proposal spares some programs. It would continue development of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s current generation of weather satellites, for example. NASA’s budget would be cut only slightly, by less than 1 percent, but the White House is proposing a shift in where the money would be spent  —   eliminating four earth science missions and the $115 million the agency is spending on education. Eliminating laboratory research on climate change, as the budget proposes, can have   effects, experts said, by making it harder to predict storms or other weather events that cause devastation and loss of life. “Cutting scientific research in E. P. A. and NASA and NOAA and other science agencies is not going to help us have more information on the causes and, more important, the effects of climate change,” said Vicki Arroyo, the executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center and a former E. P. A. official. The budget also calls for eliminating some programs that help bridge the divide between basic research and commercialization. Among the most prominent of these is the Advanced Research Projects Agency  —   Energy, known as   the Energy Department office that funds research in innovative energy technologies with a goal of getting products to market. Its annual appropriation of about $300 million would be eliminated. James J. Greenberger, the executive director of NAATBatt International, a trade group for the advanced battery industry, said   had been of enormous benefit to the industry. “We’re absolutely stunned by it,” Mr. Greenberger said of the agency’s potential elimination, which he announced to industry leaders gathered at his group’s annual conference in Arizona. “I don’t know what’s going through the administration’s head. It’s almost surreal. ”",0

You commit to treat everyone–regardless of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age–with respect, and without judgment or bias. 
— Airbnb’s new SJW diktat 
Short-term residential accommodation network Airbnb is forcing its providers to adhere to a new “nondiscrimination” policy , including a requirement to accept transgender people. The policy takes effect on November 1 and is accompanied by a slew of other recent or impending changes, which Airbnb says are designed to make its “community” more “inclusive.” Those who refuse to accept the main nondiscrimination policy will barred from listing their properties with Airbnb. 
The major problem with Airbnb’s new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemism—bowing to a customer’s feelings, rather than proven discrimination. The overall framework of the company’s policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it. This rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on Airbnb to generate an income. It also makes it very easy for certain protected groups, most notably transgender people, to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination, when, in fact, the issue is likely to be the prospective guest’s temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property. 
Secondly, the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like Airbnb. Accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes, or their sole investment property. Whereas hotels have round-the-clock staff, including security, Airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised. Providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences. Airbnb’s “Open Doors” policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth Brian Chesky must’ve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech SJW Jack Dorsey of Twitter. 
We’ll be implementing a new policy called Open Doors. Starting October 1st, if a Guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy – in trying to book a listing, having a booking canceled, or in any other interaction with a host – we will find that Guest a similar place to stay if one is available on Airbnb, or if not, we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere. 
— Brian Chesky, Airbnb CEO and co-founder 
In addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers’ properties, another one of Airbnb’s new policies, which is already in force, treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty. Rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred, Airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or, more strangely still, alternative accommodation outside its network. The second arm of this “discrimination response” will become very interesting indeed should privately-owned Airbnb decide to go public. It is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers third-party accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money. 
Airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it, too. On the one hand, it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible, now having providers offering 2,000,000 listings in 34,000 cities around the world. On the other hand, however, it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination, despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations. Airbnb are mere gatekeepers, providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers. These same providers should not suffer because of the company’s “thinly-spread” business model. Allegations of discrimination have been scant at best We don’t question the right of people to be selective about new housemates, so why not Airbnb providers and their guests? 
Various news articles reporting on the shift in Airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged , let alone proven discrimination. The best that SJW enablers can offer is a deeply flawed Harvard study, which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical African-American names like LaToya and Darnell were 16 percent less likely to be approved by the company’s accommodation providers. Considering that a guest’s profile provides a lot more information than just their name, the Harvard “research” leaves a lot to be desired. 
Moreover, names like “Cletus” and “Mary-Sue” would arguably garner even less approvals. Both these “white” names and the aforementioned African-American names usually dovetail with some of America’s least sophisticated and worldly types, the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someone’s home. It has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with run-of-the-mill decisions about how to safeguard one’s own property by entrusting it to the right people. Such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought, so why not with Airbnb? Has Airbnb signed its own execution order? . @bookingcom is better than @Airbnb : cheaper prices, always instant booking, tons of apartment listings, better interface, and no SJW crap.

Just as Roosh swears by Booking.com, there are plenty of other options you can take in avoiding Airbnb from now on. Like Twitter, the company is quickly falling under the spell of the SJW crowd. It seems certain that, minus a backtrack, Airbnb and its reputation will follow Jack Dorsey’s company into the abyss. Unlike Twitter, though, Airbnb may never make the jump to publicly-listed company. 
We live in very sad times for freedom. But there’s one freedom we can all exercise now–staying the hell away from Airbnb and its SJW madness.",0
17695,Ned Ryun: Trump WH Breaking into Two Factions -- National Populists vs. Liberal NYC Democrats,"Ned Ryun, founder and CEO of American Majority, discussed with Sirius XM host Raheem Kassam on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily what Kassam called “palace intrigue. ”[“Is Stephen K. Bannon marginalized? Is Jared Kushner leading the president into strange and unusual places? Is Reince, and is Sean Spicer, influential? Are they on their way out? In your opinion, what is going on here, what do we need to be wary of, what are we looking out for, who are the players, and how do they align with each other?” Kassam asked.  “Since inauguration, it was really about four camps,” Ryun replied. “It was the Kushner camp, it was the Bannon camp, it was the Reince camp, and it was the Pence camp. But I’m starting to think, based off what I was hearing from yesterday and then reading reports this morning, that this is becoming actually more of two camps  —   that it really is the national populists, really led by Bannon, versus, quite frankly  —   there’s no other way to describe them  —   the liberal New York City set that have come in. ” Ryun said the latter camp included “Gary Cohn, Dina Powell,” and others he described as Democrats, along with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. “God bless them, they’re part of the Trump family, but let’s not kid ourselves: they are part of the Manhattan liberal set,” he said of the latter duo.  “The question that I have as I’m reading these reports  —   and I think we should start asking questions  —   who are they really? What has been their experience? What is their worldview? Because I’m starting to suspect their worldview does not line up with the campaign promises that Trump was making,” Ryun said. “The people that voted for Donald Trump voted for very specific things,” he noted. “They do want to see a wall. They want to see immigration dealt with. They want to see healthcare reform. They want to see tax reform. They want to see all of these things. ” “Watching what’s taking place, I’m growing more and more concerned that some of the dynamics, some of the voices in Trump’s ear, some of the influences  —   we should start asking questions. Are they starting to steer him in the wrong direction, away from what got him into one of the most stunning victories in presidential history, got him into the White House?” Ryun asked. Kassam returned to Ryun’s description of the “liberal New York City set” and asked him to explain the importance of Dina Powell. Ryun noted Powell is a fellow veteran of the Bush White House. “I was at the White House before she was, but she came in she was head of presidential personnel. In fact, I think she was the   head of presidential personnel,” he said. He continued that after Powell left the Bush White House, she worked for Goldman Sachs in New York “and now has come back, really gotten involved with Ivanka Trump   Day. ” “I have real concerns, not only about the New York liberal set that has come into the White House.   …     I am more and more concerned about the Goldman Sachs people that have come into the administration,” Ryun professed.  He said they have a “different worldview than the American people that voted Trump in. ” “You’ve got that worldview, you’ve got the New York Goldman Sachs liberal set worldview, and the real question here is which one is going to win out, influencing the future direction of Trump,” he predicted. “I thought really yesterday, at first, initially, it was a reorganization by McMaster of some of these things,” Ryun said of the news that Steve Bannon has been removed from the principals committee of the National Security Council. “I’m a little more concerned that there is a serious power struggle going on. ” “I’ve got to tell you, my hope is that Trump will say, ‘I know what got me in. I know what brought me to the White House. Steve Bannon is really the lead cheerleader on that front. Keep Steve close. Listen to Steve. Keep pushing down this path,” Ryun advised. “If he does, there will be victory this year in regards to policy,” he anticipated. “He’s already going to have it this week with Gorsuch. I really do think we’re going to get something done with health care. There’s going to be a massive step in the right direction. I do think we’ve got a real shot at tax reform. ” “You get a couple of these victories under your belt. You keep going down this path. Then we’re going to start talking about what the second Trump term looks like,” he said. “But if he starts to stray, I’m concerned. ” Kassam asked where the Republican National Committee, its former chairman Reince Priebus, and Sean Spicer fit into this picture. “You know, I think they’re starting to realize that the New York set, they’re not their friends,” Ryun replied. “I think in a weird strange alliance that the RNC folks are realizing they’re basically going to become allies with Bannon. ” “This is all on the fly. This is all really the last 24 hours,” he added. “If the other guys win, I guarantee you Bannon’s out, Reince is out, Spicer’s out, the corporate New York set is in. ” “I think you’re going to see, internally, really kind of what I think are strange alliances. But in the short term, I think they’re going to be working together to push back on this New York set. Quite frankly, even though it pains me somewhat to say this, I hope that Bannon and the RNC guys, that alliance is successful,” Ryun said.

17696,Rodrigo Duterte Says Donald Trump Endorses His Violent Antidrug Campaign - The New York Times,"MANILA  —   President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said on Saturday that   Donald J. Trump had endorsed his brutal antidrug campaign, telling Mr. Duterte that the Philippines was conducting it “the right way. ” Mr. Duterte, who spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone on Friday, said Mr. Trump was “quite sensitive” to “our worry about drugs. ” “He wishes me well, too, in my campaign, and he said that, well, we are doing it as a sovereign nation, the right way,” Mr. Duterte said. There was no immediate response from Mr. Trump to Mr. Duterte’s description of the phone call, and his transition team could not be reached for comment. Since his election last month, Mr. Trump has held a series of unscripted calls with foreign leaders, several of which have broken radically from past American policies and diplomatic practice. A call on Friday with the president of Taiwan, Tsai   appeared to be out of sync with four decades of United States policy toward China and prompted a Chinese call to the White House. Mr. Duterte has led a campaign against drug abuse in which he has encouraged the police and others to kill people they suspect of using or selling drugs. Since he took office in June, more than 2, 000 people have been killed by the police in what officers describe as drug raids, and the police say several hundred more have been killed by vigilantes. The program has been condemned by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and others for what rights organizations have characterized as extrajudicial killings. In rejecting such criticism from the United States this fall, Mr. Duterte called Mr. Obama a “son of a whore. ” In a summary of the phone call with Mr. Trump released by Mr. Duterte’s office on Saturday morning, Mr. Duterte said the two had spoken for just a few minutes but covered many topics, including the antidrug campaign. “I could sense a good rapport, an animated   Trump,” Mr. Duterte said. “And he was wishing me success in my campaign against the drug problem. ” Mr. Duterte added: “He understood the way we are handling it, and I said that there’s nothing wrong in protecting a country. It was a bit very encouraging in the sense that I supposed that what he really wanted to say was that we would be the last to interfere in the affairs of your own country. ” Mr. Duterte, who has said he was seeking “a separation” from the United States, a longtime ally, and has threatened to bar American troops from his country, also said, “We assured him of our ties with America. ” He did not elaborate on that comment. Mr. Duterte also said that Mr. Trump had invited him to visit New York and Washington, and that Mr. Trump said he wanted to attend the summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations next year in the Philippines. Mr. Duterte has often been compared to Mr. Trump for his blunt speech and populist positions. “I appreciate the response that I got from   Trump, and I would like to wish him success,” Mr. Duterte said. “He will be a good president for the United States of America. ”",0

17701,Dogs Test Drug Aimed at Humans’ Biggest Killer: Age - The New York Times,"SEATTLE  —   Ever since last summer, when Lynn Gemmell’s dog, Bela, was inducted into the trial of a drug that has been shown to significantly lengthen the lives of laboratory mice, she has been the object of intense scrutiny among dog park regulars. To those who insist that Bela, 8, has turned back into a puppy  —   “Look how fast she’s getting that ball!”  —   Ms. Gemmell has tried to turn a deaf ear. Bela, a Border   shepherd mix, may have been given a placebo, for one thing. The drug, rapamycin, which improved heart health and appeared to delay the onset of some diseases in older mice, may not work the same magic in dogs, for another. There is also a chance it could do more harm than good. “This is just to look for side effects, in dogs,” Ms. Gemmell told Bela’s many  . Technically that is true. But the trial also represents a new frontier in testing a proposition for improving human health: Rather than only seeking treatments for the individual maladies that come with age, we might do better to target the biology that underlies aging itself. While the diseases that now kill most people in developed nations  —   heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, cancer  —   have different immediate causes, age is the major risk factor for all of them. That means that even treatment breakthroughs in these areas, no matter how vital to individuals, would yield on average four or five more years of life, epidemiologists say, and some of them likely shadowed by illness. A drug that slows aging, the logic goes, might instead serve to delay the onset of several major diseases at once. A handful of drugs tested by federally funded laboratories in recent years appear to extend the healthy lives of mice, with rapamycin and its derivatives, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for organ transplant patients and to treat some types of cancer, so far proving the most effective. In a 2014 study by the drug company Novartis, the drug appeared to bolster the immune system in older patients. And the early results in aging dogs suggest that rapamycin is helping them, too, said Matt Kaeberlein, a biology of aging researcher at the University of Washington who is running the study with a colleague, Daniel Promislow. But scientists who champion the study of aging’s basic biology  —   they call it “geroscience”  —   say their field has received short shrift from the biomedical establishment. And it was not lost on the University of Washington researchers that exposing dog lovers to the idea that aging could be delayed might generate popular support in addition to new data. “Many of us in the biology of aging field feel like it is underfunded relative to the potential impact on human health this could have,” said Dr. Kaeberlein, who helped pay for the study with funds he received from the university for turning down a competing job offer. “If the average pet owner sees there’s a way to significantly delay aging in their pet, maybe it will begin to impact policy decisions. ” The idea that resources might be better spent trying to delay aging rather than to cure diseases flies in the face of most   philanthropy and the Obama administration’s proposal to spend $1 billion on a “cancer moonshot. ” And many scientists say it is still too unproven to merit more investment. The National Institutes of Health has long been organized around particular diseases, including the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. There is the National Institute on Aging, but about a third of its budget last year was directed exclusively to research on Alzheimer’s disease, and its Division of Aging Biology represents a tiny fraction of the N. I. H. ’s $30 billion annual budget. That is, in part, because the field is in its infancy, said the N. I. H. director, Dr. Francis Collins. “I would resist the idea that we should shift funds away from cancer and diabetes and Alzheimer’s, where there are clear drug targets, and say, ‘We’re going to work on this hypothesis,’ ” Dr. Collins said. “If you had a lot of money for geroscience right now, it’s not clear what you would do with it that would be scientifically credible. ” Researchers in the field, in turn, say they might have more to show for themselves if they could better explain to Congress and the public why basic research on aging could be useful. “People understand ‘my relative died of a heart attack, so I’m going to give money to that,’ ” said Dr. James L. Kirkland, a Mayo Clinic researcher. “It’s harder to grasp ‘my relative was older, that predisposes them to have a heart attack, so I should give money to research on aging.’ ” Some companies have embraced the quest for drugs that delay aging. Google created Calico (for California Life Company) in 2013 with the goal of defeating aging. A   called Unity has said it will develop drugs based on new research on aging mice suggesting that purging certain cells can extend a healthy life span. And a group of academic researchers is trying to persuade the F. D. A. to recognize aging as a disease for which a drug can be marketed, which they hope will draw more interest from pharmaceutical firms. The agency recently greenlighted its proposed trial of a widely used diabetes drug, metformin, to see if it can delay the onset of other   diseases in older adults who have received a diagnosis of at least one, as one study suggests it might. But the group has yet to secure funding. One reason, the researchers say, is that the notion that aging is immutable is so deeply entrenched. “When I go out and try to raise money for this, the first thing people will say to me is, ‘Eh, we’re all getting older,’ ” said Steven Austad, a researcher at the University of Alabama. Most of us harbor the intuition that we age because our bodies, like our cars, our furniture, our patience, just wear out. But the best argument that life span is not   biologists say, has long been evident: Living things age at significantly different rates. “The squirrels in my neighborhood have a   life span, but they look like rats that live two years,” said Gary Ruvkun, a pioneer in aging biology at Harvard Medical School. “If you look at what nature has selected for and allowed, it suggests that you might be able to get your hands on the various levers that change things. ”  That aspiration gained traction in the 1990s and 2000s, when scientists, armed with new tools of molecular biology, homed in on the complex cellular pathways that regulate life span in many species. By removing genes that produced certain proteins, or adding genes that produced others, researchers found they could significantly extend the lives of simple laboratory organisms like budding yeast, roundworms and flies. “It’s not just wearing out, it’s a program,” Dr. Ruvkun said. “The genetics told us that. If you can modulate it with a few simple perturbations, that’s the definition of a program. ” Since genes cannot be so easily manipulated in humans, it was significant in 2006 when Dr. Kaeberlein and others demonstrated that rapamycin, the drug now being tested in dogs, suppressed one of the crucial proteins in yeast, resulting in a longer life span without removing a gene. The protein is known to be involved in cell growth. But just how its suppression works to extend life is still unclear, raising questions about potential unknown downsides. And it has not helped the field’s reputation that what emerged as a   hope for fighting aging, amplifying proteins called sirtuins, has not yet panned out. Initially believed to be activated by resveratrol, a substance found in red wine, sirtuins provided a seemingly excellent excuse to imbibe. But the pharmaceutical giant GSK, which had purchased a company for $720 million with the intention of developing a   drug, cut back its efforts in 2013 after the results of the original genetic experiments came under question. A year later, one of only two major foundations funding longevity research stopped making new grants in the field. Besides the standard scientific road bumps, biology of aging researchers say their field’s reputation suffers from its association with   peddlers selling   creams, hormones and fountains of youth, not to mention the likes of Dorian Gray, Voldemort and assorted Sith lords. Efforts to prolong life are often viewed as selfish or trivial. “It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer,” Bill Gates, whose philanthropy focuses on global poverty, said during a session on Reddit last year in response to a question about Calico, the Google spinoff. Coleen Murphy, a molecular biologist at Princeton who is studying reproductive age in women, said she had received hate mail accusing her of trying to overpopulate the earth. Critics of research on extending life span also worry that, rather than increasing   health span, which researchers say is their goal, geroscience will consign humanity to living longer in a compromised state. That is happening, with or without longevity research, thanks to advances in public health that have allowed life spans to increase.   of older Americans have multiple chronic conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and in just over a decade, a fifth of Europeans and Americans will be 65 or older. “If you go to a dinner party and you tell people you’re working on longevity, they say, ‘Oh that’s terrible,’ ” Dr. Murphy said. “I think if they just understood it’s a way to slow the whole process, instead of fighting it one disease at a time, they’d understand why we’re interested in this. ” Dogs age faster than humans, and bigger dogs age faster than smaller dogs. The 40 dogs that participated in the rapamycin trial, which just concluded its pilot run in Seattle, had to be at least 6 years old and weigh at least 40 pounds. Like Lynn Gemmell’s Bela, whose cholesterol was high, many of them were showing signs of aging: loose skin, graying muzzles, a stiffness in the joints. So were some of their owners. “How are you going to be sure people are going to be giving this to their dog rather than taking it themselves?” Ms. Gemmell, 58, joked with Dr. Kaeberlein on her first visit to the veterinary clinic, where Bela was given a checkup and an echocardiogram to measure heart function, a marker that could conceivably register an improvement over the 10 weeks that she would be given the drug. A research coordinator for human clinical trials at a hospital, Ms. Gemmell adopted Bela as a    rescue without realizing how much outdoor time she would need with her. Now divorced with two grown daughters, Ms. Gemmell dons a headlamp when she returns home in the dark, and takes Bela out with a     ball and a collar light. “I wish she could live forever,” she said. Over 1, 500 dog owners applied to participate in the trial of rapamycin, which has its roots in a series of studies in mice, the first of which was published in 2009. Made by a type of soil bacterium, rapamycin has extended the life spans of yeast, flies and worms by about 25 percent. But in what proved a fortuitous accident, the researchers who set out to test it in mice had trouble formulating it for easy consumption. As a result, the mice were 20 months old  —   the equivalent of about 60 human years  —   when the trial began. That the   mice survived about 12 percent longer than the control groups was the first indication that the drug could be given later in life and still be effective. Dr. Kaeberlein said he had since achieved similar benefits by giving    mice the drug for only three months. (The National Institute on Aging rejected his request for funding to further test that treatment.) Younger mice, given higher doses, have lived about 25 percent longer than those not given the drug, and mice of varying ages and genetic backgrounds have been slower to develop some cancers, kidney disease, obesity and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. In one study, their hearts functioned better for longer. “If you do the extrapolation for people, we’re probably talking a couple of decades, with the expectation that those years are going to be spent in relatively good health,” Dr. Kaeberlein said. Still, drugs that work in mice often fail in humans. It is also hard to ask rodents about their quality of life. The side effects, depending on the dose and duration, include mouth sores, cataracts, insulin resistance and, for males, problems with testicular function. No one knows if people, who already live a lot longer than mice, would see a proportional increase in life span. And some researchers say there would be serious concerns in testing rapamycin, or any drug, in healthy people just to slow aging. What if a drug lengthened life for some and shortened it for others? Could anyone ethically put a healthy person into a test that might actually shorten life span? “It’s not as simple as cancer, where patients are going to die anyway if they don’t get the drug,” said Andrew Dillin, a biology of aging researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who recently raised the questions in Nature, a scientific journal. Ethical concerns aside, such a trial would take decades. But what dog lovers have long considered the sad fact that their pets age about seven times as fast as they do, Dr. Kaeberlein knew, would be a boon for a study of rapamycin that would have implications for both species. An owner of two dogs himself, he was determined to scrounge up the money for the pilot phase of what he and Dr. Promislow called the Dog Aging Project. Last month, he reported at a scientific meeting that no significant side effects had been observed in the dogs, even at the highest of three doses. And compared with the hearts of dogs in the control group, the hearts of those taking the drug pumped blood more efficiently at the end. The researchers would like to enroll 450 dogs for a more comprehensive   study, but do not yet have the money. Even if the study provided positive results on all fronts, a human trial would carry risks. Dr. Kaeberlein, for one, said they would be worth it. “I would argue we should be willing to tolerate some level of risk if the payoff is 20 to 30 percent increase in healthy longevity,” he said. “If we don’t do anything, we know what the outcome is going to be. You’re going to get sick, and you’re going to die. ” For her part, Ms. Gemmell is not counting on anything. The other night, when she got home from work, she was ready to read her mail and have a glass of wine. But Bela greeted her as usual, ball in her mouth, ready to play. For now, she said, this is how they both plan to stay young.",0
17702,Snap Is Said to Pick Bankers for an I.P.O. - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   The newest generation of technology darlings has signaled that it is about to come of age: Snapchat, the messaging service beloved by teenagers, is preparing to step out into the public markets. The company  —   born only five years ago  —   may end up ushering in a wave of huge tech initial public offerings at a time when Wall Street has seen few such big deals. Snapchat’s parent, recently renamed Snap Inc. has hired the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, essentially firing a starting gun for a potential stock sale as soon as the first quarter of next year, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. Should Snap follow through on its plans, it would be the most prominent debut by the latest batch of “unicorns”  —   those private companies valued at more than $1 billion.

Many of those companies are already awash in cash they have raised privately from mutual funds, venture capital firms and hedge funds, money that once needed to be raised on the public stock markets. But an initial offering would represent a new level of status and legitimacy, placing them on the same level as Google and Facebook. A wave of unicorns hitting the public markets would help end what has been one of the bleakest times for tech initial offerings  —   and I. P. O.s in general  —   in some time. No tech companies went public in the first three months of this year, a drought that had happened only three times since the early 1990s. Over all, just 84 companies have gone public so far this year in the United States, according to data from Renaissance Capital, down nearly 42 percent from last year. Should it prove to be an outlier, a Snap offering would still be one of the technology world’s most awaited market debuts since Twitter’s in 2013 and the Alibaba Group’s a year later. Snap was most recently valued by private investors at about $19 billion. Among the problems that had bedeviled the market for new stocks was the ease with which tech companies like Uber have found cash from private investors, removing the need to go public anytime soon. The   companies that have gone public over the last 12 months have largely been smaller,   names like the communications service Twilio or the business software maker Atlassian. And public market investors like mutual funds have pushed back against the prices that   have demanded, often leading to fewer of the   stock debuts that Twitter and others enjoyed. But as the markets have stabilized,   and their backers have again resumed discussions about splashy market debuts. “In the last three months, a number of companies have started saying that it’s not all bad to be public,” Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said. “If you’re a mature company with more than $50 million in revenue, an I. P. O. is very much on your mind now. ” The prospect of a huge offering has had banks racing to seize a piece of it for some time. Beyond Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, Snap has also engaged a bevy of other banks  —   including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Allen  Company, Barclays and Credit Suisse  —   to help manage its stock sale, one of the people briefed on the matter added. Bloomberg earlier reported the selection of bankers. At the heart of the frenzy is Snap, born in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011. The company is known for its mobile storytelling and messaging app, which lets users watch videos and send photos and messages to friends. The company also makes sunglasses called Spectacles that are equipped with a video camera. Currently, Snap would be able to file its public offering documents confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission because the company now generates less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The company may ultimately decide not to file for an offering. Yet Snap may be in a better position to go public before some other highly valued private companies because it has comparatively few regulatory concerns that would be listed as risk factors in a prospectus. Uber and Airbnb, for example, are fighting legal battles in numerous cities around the country and the world. Even though all of these battles will most likely be resolved, a long list of outstanding litigation and regulatory uncertainties could create an additional hurdle for investors. And unlike those two companies, Snap isn’t based in Silicon Valley itself but in Venice, Calif. spearheading a nascent tech community in the Los Angeles area. Snap’s app Snapchat was an early hit with young users who liked the fact that their messages and photos disappeared. The company was criticized for making it easier to send inappropriate photos with fewer consequences. Yet the ephemeral nature of the platform also made it seem like a more authentic way of communicating. Snapchat was an online facsimile of a casual conversation while platforms like Facebook and Instagram were the equivalent of a permanent record. Snap eventually added in tools that let users tell stories about their days and augment their selfies with stickers and masks, which the company calls filters and lenses. It also introduced channels for professionally created content from media companies like CNN and Cosmopolitan magazine. As users continued to flock to the app, a year ago Snap began to monetize its growing audience by allowing advertisers to sponsor filters and lenses and run video ads between stories produced by media companies or made up of user photos and videos. Advertisers have been keen to reach the Snapchat app’s audience, which now includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 and 150 million daily users. At the moment, Snapchat is the trendiest, newest thing and advertisers want to be associated with it, Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands, said in an earlier interview. Snap has continued to build out content on Snapchat, the app has increasingly drawn comparisons to traditional television and is seen as an internet company that could someday draw ad dollars away from TV. This year, Snapchat is expected to generate nearly $367 million in ad revenue worldwide, according to data from the research firm eMarketer and that figure is expected to rise to nearly $1 billion next year. For now, nearly all of Snapchat’s revenue comes from the United States, according to eMarketer, but other markets should account for about a quarter of Snap’s revenue by 2018. Yet for all of the service’s phenomenal growth, Snapchat’s parent must still demonstrate to potentially skittish stock market investors that it has a path to profitability if its offering is to soar, analysts say. “Investors aren’t willing to buy growth at all costs,” Kathleen Smith, a   of Renaissance Capital, said.",0
17703,AT&T Secret Spy Program Unveiled: Project Hemisphere,"By Ryan Banister 
Project Hemisphere, a secretive program developed by AT&T, searches trillions of call records in order to analyze cell phone data, spying on the activity of private individuals in order to identify who they are speaking with and why, as well as GPS tracking on the location of each individual connected to the call, and it transmits this information to the Department of Justice (DOJ). 
In 2013, Project Hemisphere was shown in a PowerPoint presentation produced by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The New York Times reported this as a partnership between AT&T and the DOJ, primarily deployed for drug-enforcement task-forces. All information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the DOJ. 
AT&T specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the DOJ, who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers, using the taxpayers’ own money to spy on their every move. This is an invasion of privacy without a warrant. This is a federal spy program by proxy, working through corporations. 
AT&T promises law enforcement that it will not disclose Project Hemisphere’s involvement in active investigations that are made public. AT&T is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network. 
While it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you, there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private. 
News flash! It’s never been private. They have always wanted to use your information as a product to sell to the highest bidder. Your data is their product, and you are paying them to take it from you.",0

The book contains the descriptions of the cases, when the US-led coalition was committing ""errors,"" as John Kerry once said. However, those ""errors"" can be categorized as war crimes . The actions of the Syrian ""moderate opposition"" are also reflected in the document. The 'White Book"" also contains statistics about the successful operations of the Russian Air Force and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in Syria, about the number of the liberated settlements, destroyed militants, as well as about the number of refugees, who returned to their places of permanent residence.The ""White Book"" was prepared by the Defence Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Russia, as well as by specialists of the Institute for Oriental Studies.The ""White Book"" was translated into English and distributed for further reading.On 21 October the coalition attacked a funeral procession in near Kirkuk (Iraq). The pilots took the congregation of people for terrorists. As a result, dozens of civilians were killed. The recent attack of US pilots on the Syrian military near Deir-Ezzor also claimed the lives of dozens of soldiers. Later, US Secretary of State John Kerry, in a conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, said that it was a mistake, apparently believing that such a statement would be enough for an excuse.""We have repeatedly said that such deadly attacks on settlements that have all attributes of war crimes, have become almost daily routine for the international lcoalition,"" an official representative for the Russian Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov said commenting o the attack of the funeral procession in Iraq.

17705,Hillary Clinton Email: We Must Destroy Syria For Israel,"Share on Facebook A leaked Hillary Clinton email has now confirmed that the Obama administration, with Hillary directing policy, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel's geopolitical interests and stability. The new Wikileaks release shows that Clinton, then Secretary of State orchestrated the war in Syria to overthrow the government of President Assad, because it is “best way to help Israel”. Newobserveronline.com reports: The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498 , following the uproar over Clinton's private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012. The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel's interests. “The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying. Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran's “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel. She specifically links Iran's mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran's “atom bomb” program threatens Israel's “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East. If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel's interests. Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed. Iran's nuclear program and Syria's civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today. If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself. It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel's security. This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.” The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel's leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel's security, it would also ease Israel's understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly. Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted. Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do: In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria. With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's mind. The email proves—as if any more proof was needed—that the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to “protect” Israel. It is also a sobering thought to consider that the “refugee” crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. In addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq—all thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the “rebels” and stoking the fires of war in Syria. The real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton—whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people—could become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all. Clinton's public assertion that, if elected president, she would “ take the relationship with Israel to the next level, ” would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth.

17706,My Hajj Reading List: Preparing for Mecca - The New York Times,"Starting Saturday, about two million Muslims will participate in the hajj, an annual pilgrimage to holy sites in Saudi Arabia. I’ll be participating for the first time, and to prepare, I assembled an eclectic reading list including Islamic history, firsthand accounts of the hajj and spiritual meditations. I am rereading “The Autobiography of Malcolm X,” which culminates with one of the most meaningful passages I have ever encountered on the pilgrimage. Also, I revisited “The Sun Also Rises” by Ernest Hemingway, for his sharp prose and as a reminder that a journey can always be an adventure. I bought “Getting the Best Out of  ” by Abu Muneer Ismail Davids, a droll manual that includes invaluable advice, including where to camp at the plains of Mina, why you should bring an inflatable mattress, and what direction to walk to avoid being crushed by the crowds of pilgrims. I have already flagged many pages with   note reminders. Also on the list: • “Hajj: Journey to the Heart of Islam,” edited by Venetia Porter, to help me understand the spiritual importance of the hajj. • “The Siege of Mecca: The 1979 Uprising at Islam’s Holiest Shrine,” by Yaroslav Trofimov, about the great rupture almost 40 years ago between Saudi Arabia and Iran that played out at the hajj. • Finally, “Sea Without Shore: A Manual of the Sufi Path” by Nuh Ha Mim Keller, to immerse myself in some spirituality before I head to Mecca.",0
17707,Weiner Sexting of 15-Year-Old Girl Leads to New FBI Investigation of Hillary Emails,"Weiner Sexting of 15-Year-Old Girl Leads to New FBI Investigation of Hillary Emails   
The giant flaming garbage dump that is Clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the Weiner scandal and the Hillary email scandal. 
Yes Virginia, you can now have both of them in one. Like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one, they've been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic. 
The FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails – apparently during the probe of former Rep. Anthony Weiner’s sexting – in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. 
FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress Friday that the bureau has “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” 
Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced “in connection with an unrelated case.” 
An FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl. 
As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBI’s decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, “Good grief,” after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. 
Can't argue with her there. 
It would be hilarious if Anthony Weiner and thereby Huma Abedin led to the downfall of Hillary's lifelong ambition. You just know someone is going to ""commit suicide"" in a D.C. park. 
But does anyone in the Democratic Party really look forward to 4 to 8 years of this? This is how big of a mess Hillary is now. We've reached the point where her ongoing email scandal is now intertwined with a sexting investigation of a 15-year-old girl. And that's just during the election.",0
17708,"Among Travelers and Commuters, the Homeless Stop In and Stay - The New York Times","Wilson Silva said he knew the homeless situation at Pennsylvania Station had grown “out of hand” when he found a man in raggedy clothing sleeping on a couch inside the shop he manages, Drago Shoe Repair, in the rail terminal’s upper level. “There’s more homeless in the station than ever before  —   every day we get new faces,” Mr. Silva, 59, said as he watched his staff polish and buff the shoes on a row of   commuters. “I try to help them, but they harass the customers, and the police can’t do anything,” said Mr. Silva, whose shop looks out on dozens of homeless men and women who live in a waiting area for New Jersey Transit passengers. At New York City’s major transit hubs  —   its two railroad stations, the main bus terminal and its two airports  —   the persistence of homeless people seeking shelter among the blur of travelers has become a familiar sight. While the concentration of homeless people is uneven  —   relatively small numbers at La Guardia and Kennedy Airports and larger populations at Penn Station, Grand Central Terminal and the Port Authority Bus Terminal  —   they are a manifestation of an intractable homelessness problem in the city. “For us, the terminal is a default shelter,” said Phil Mellor, 55, who said he had largely relied on Grand Central for shelter since he lost his job as a security guard several years ago and his life began spiraling downward. Now, he said, he survives on “what the tourists throw out” and spends nights sleeping on the No. 6 train when the terminal is closed. The station’s dining concourse, on the lower level, with its popular food kiosks and ample seating, attracts diners as well as several dozen homeless people. At Penn Station, the busiest public transportation center in North America, serving more than 600, 000 passengers a day, some homeless people panhandle from Amtrak customers waiting for   trains to Washington and Boston. Others sell “loosies,” individual cigarettes, to one another outside an entrance on Seventh Avenue. And others try to nap on benches alongside waiting passengers. At the Port Authority Bus Terminal, homeless people fan out, seeking corners and   corridors to sleep without being rousted by police officers. This ad hoc shelter system has endured for decades with homeless people staying months or even years. Against the waves of purposeful travelers and suburban commuters, they sprawl on floors of cold tile, lit by the glare of fluorescent lights, with a constant soundtrack of   departures. They tote all they own in inelegant bags and pass the hours in cavernous passages between track gates or bus bays. Many seem to be grappling with mental health issues. Their presence in some of the country’s busiest transit hubs recalls a far grittier time in the city when violent crime was rampant and transportation stations were crowded with many more homeless people. Like many who live on the streets, the people in these hubs are what advocates describe as chronically resistant to offers of services, especially beds in shelters, which many homeless people say have too many rules and are rife with danger. Indeed, the city’s shelter system has been rocked by several episodes of violence recently, including the murders of six residents this year. New York City officials say about 58, 000 people are living in shelters, and that an estimated 3, 000 sleep on the streets or in the subways every night. The city does not have jurisdiction over the transit hubs, but officials from the Department of Homeless Services participate in monthly meetings to discuss the issue with the transportation agencies that run the terminals, their law enforcement officials and homeless advocates. Mayor Bill de Blasio has made tackling homelessness a top priority, improving security at shelters, expanding outreach to those living on the street and moving to increase transitional housing. Michael Polenberg, vice president for government affairs at Safe Horizon, a group that works with homeless youths, said the city’s transit terminals have become shelters out of necessity. “There aren’t a whole lot of options available,” Mr. Polenberg said, adding that the plan to open more supportive housing could help ease the problem. “It’s all going to help, but it’s not going to help tonight or tomorrow,” he said. “These things take time to get up and running. ” Nightly counts of the homeless people at Penn Station tally about 70 people, rising to 90 on particularly cold nights, said Muzzy Rosenblatt, the executive director of the Bowery Residents’ Committee, which is contracted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to offer shelter placements and other services to homeless people at Penn Station and Grand Central. No census is taken at Grand Central, he said. Though Mr. Rosenblatt said his group was limited by the number of available beds, the number of homeless people in transit terminals who have been placed in shelters or rehabilitation, psychiatric and other programs has increased over the last two years. Last year, 357 people were placed out of Grand Central, Mr. Rosenblatt said, compared with 292 in 2014. And 742 were placed last year from Penn Station, compared with 579 in 2014, he said. But given how widespread homelessness has become, Mr. Rosenblatt said, as soon as someone leaves the terminal, “somebody else is going to take their place. ” Port Authority officials said they do not conduct a homeless census at the bus terminal, but instead monitor the interactions of outreach teams from Urban Pathways, a group contracted to address homeless issues that offers shelter and other services. The number of daily interactions has declined by more than 20 percent over the past year, officials at the authority said. The situation at the two airports in Queens is somewhat different because they are not as easy to reach and they have tended to attract fewer homeless people. The news media, including The New York Post, described several dozen homeless people staying in La Guardia in December. But in January, the Port Authority, which runs the airports, started limiting the main terminal to passengers with tickets between midnight and 4 a. m. and now far fewer people remain. One is Christine, a woman in her 60s who said she had been waiting at the airport for several months to save enough money to buy a plane ticket so she could move to Florida. Mike, 38, a California native, said he had been living in the airport for five years, passing the days walking constantly through the main terminal. Mike and Christine refused to give their surnames. In the past, officials were often able to push homeless people out by setting strict rules and finding reasons to remove them. But over the years, advocates and civil rights groups have successfully challenged attempts to oust or block homeless people, calling those efforts discriminatory and selective law enforcement. Today, all parties accept that transit terminals are public spaces that homeless people have as much right to occupy as anyone else, provided they follow regulations. Restrictions must be enforced for all terminal users, not just for “people who some members of the public don’t want to interact with,” said Tina Luongo, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society. As Mr. Rosenblatt put it, “We don’t segregate public space by wealth. ” Homeless people must leave Grand Central and the bus terminal around midnight when the stations close for several hours. Penn Station is open 24 hours, but many homeless people there said they were not allowed to sleep on the floor or on benches overnight. The solution for many is to hop on a subway train, said Caryll Corlear, 48, a homeless man who called Penn Station “the nicest pit stop in the city. ” He has spent most of his time at the station ever since arriving there by train from Florida four years ago. “It’s clean and safe you have bathrooms, food stores and people who give you money,” said Mr. Corlear, who tows two large wheeled suitcases and often dresses in a   and shorts, since he rarely has to step outside. “I’ve never been in a shelter, but I’ve heard the horror stories,” he said. Several blocks north, at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, a homeless man who would provide only his given name, Mike, said he had learned to nap standing against the wall  —   part of his strategy to avoid ejection by Port Authority police officers. Mike, 51, who said he had stayed in the bus station for much of the eight years he has been homeless, wears a dark wool overcoat and carries a suitcase, which almost allows him to blend in. “If they see you laying down, they tell you to get the next bus out,” he said, referring to the police. Ramkarran Moteelall is part of a small group of scruffy men who spend days and nights lolling on the vents at the base of a huge glass facade inside Terminal 4 of Kennedy Airport. “If you don’t do nothing wrong, they don’t mess with you,” said Mr. Moteelall, 48, a Guyanese immigrant who has been living at the airport since December but who walks about two miles to his old Queens neighborhood to buy inexpensive meals. At Grand Central, in a cluster of tables in the station’s dining concourse, one of every three or four tables on a recent weekday was taken by people who appeared to be homeless, sharing the cavernous space with lunchtime office workers, passengers and tourists. The homeless people foraged through trash cans, including Mr. Mellor, who pulled discarded food from the garbage and ate it as he sat next to a table of teenage girls who were visiting New York to sing with their school choir at Carnegie Hall. His meal consisted of two slices of pizza and half of a $15 strip steak from the nearby   Grill. He washed down his scavenged meal with swigs of cheap vodka. “It’s a survival skill  —   you take a sip of vodka to kill any bacteria,” Mr. Mellor said. Nearby, a man was panhandling while holding a sign that read, “Give me a dollar or I’ll vote for Trump!” He settled into a table and starting napping next to a man in a business suit, who surveyed the tables of tourists interspersed with shabbily dressed homeless people. “The fact that they stay all day in a dining area, I guess, is not ideal, but I don’t see them bothering anyone,” said the man, Carlo Valladares, 22, of Long Island. Another school group, on a class trip from Odenville, Ala. noticed the homeless people at the food court tables. Lisa Mayhew, a chaperone, gave leftover food to some homeless people near her table. “We were surprised to see so many homeless here, with all the tourists and nice food places,” she said. “But I told the kids, this is part of New York City. ”",0
17709,Melania Trump Rips Kathy Griffin: Beheading Photo ’Makes You Wonder About Mental Health’,"First Lady Melania Trump has responded to Kathy Griffin’s   photograph of herself clutching Donald Trump’s bloody, severed head, describing the photo as “very disturbing” and “simply wrong. ”[A report Wednesday claimed that the First Lady’s    son, Barron Trump, was watching television when the image flashed up on the screen as part of the news coverage of the incident. The president’s son reportedly became “panicked” over the photo because he did not know who Griffin was or the context in which the photo was taken.  “As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,” Melania Trump said in a statement Wednesday. “When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it. ” The photograph, first published by TMZ Tuesday morning, shows the    My Life on the   comedian holding up a bloody, decapitated head meant to resemble that of the president, in a photograph reminiscent of horrific pictures taken by Islamic State terrorists to celebrate their atrocities. The photo was taken during a shoot with L. A.  artist Tyler Shields. The image went viral Tuesday, drawing strong condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as well as thousands of calls for a boycott of Griffin’s current   comedy tour.

I went way too far,” Griffin said. “The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny. I get it. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career, I will continue. ” The apology apparently did little to quell outrage over the image. On Tuesday, CNN  —   where Griffin has   a live New Year’s Eve broadcast with Anderson Cooper since 2007  —   said it was “evaluating” the comedian’s role in its future broadcasts. Home security services company ADT also announced that it would pull its advertising from the network over the incident. On Wednesday, the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque announced that Griffin’s upcoming show, scheduled for June 16, had been cancelled.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

Other reports says that she was yelling in a bizarre manner, but we are used to that. 
Perhaps most telling is her pre-speech behavior. 
She is clearly pacing and viewers are noticing a nervous smile, as if she cannot sit still and is trying to convince herself that everything is ok. If you watch closely, you will see her speaking, presumably to the people around her, then swatting one hand in the air in a strange way. 
It looks as if she is using all of her self-control just to keep it together. 
Watch and decide for yourself. Make sure to study her facial expressions and the swatting of her arm. 
It is easy to understand why she is stressed. The long, controversial Presidential Campaign of 2016 is winding down, the FBI is mounting multiple investigations of her and her family, and her best friend and top assistant, Huma Abedin, is likely spilling the beans on everything she knows. It is likely that Abedin and her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, are cutting some sort of deal with authorities. 
All the while, the FBI is digging through 650,000 emails.

In 2004, when Mr. Greengrass took over the series with “The Bourne Supremacy” (Doug Liman had directed “The Bourne Identity” two years before) his approach to action filmmaking felt distinctive and new. Now, his vigorous, rigorous style of shooting and editing  —   maximum speed and maximum chaos rendered with elegant, sometimes breathtaking coherence  —   has kind of an     vibe. The thrill isn’t entirely gone. It’s just a little more subdued. Mr. Damon, for his part, is as subdued as ever. Jason Bourne is a uniquely passive action hero, a man who runs on pure survival instinct as he tries to figure out who is after him and why. After so many years and so much running, his existential predicament has become a matter of routine. He knows that he knows some bad stuff  —   and his pursuers know it, too  —   but he’s not entirely sure what he knows or how he knows it. For him, the resulting confusion is harrowing. For us, it’s part of the fun, like the insidery frisson of hearing nuggets of spy jargon hissed by unsmiling people in dark suits. “Alpha team, I need a sitrep, stat!” The sitrep here is that Bourne, who has been pursuing his Plan B career as a   boxer in the wilds of Greece, is approached by his former colleague and fellow Company renegade, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). She has some information, harvested from a hacker camp in Iceland, concerning past Agency skulduggery involving Bourne’s father (Gregg Henry, in flashbacks). Nicky and Jason rendezvous in Athens in the middle of a riot, and the   chase commences, with Robert Dewey, the director of the C. I. A. (Tommy Lee Jones) and Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) one of his ambitious underlings, running the show amid the satellite feeds and data displays of suburban Virginia. Their main operational weapon on the ground overseas is a killer known only as the Asset (Vincent Cassel) who harbors a personal grudge against Bourne. This is perhaps the most striking feature of “Jason Bourne”: Virtually all the major characters  —   good, bad and    —   work for the same organization, at least on a consulting basis. There are dark whispers about external threats, and invocations of the tension between security and privacy in the digital age, but geopolitics and technology are scaffolding for what is essentially a movie about human resources challenges in a large bureaucracy. This chapter in the series, coming after the emergence of WikiLeaks and the growth of social media, takes passing note of contemporary realities. Edward J. Snowden’s name is dropped a few times, and there is a subplot about a young tech mogul named Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed) who is trying to extricate his company from Dewey’s pocket. Terrorism and surveillance are treated both as facts of life and as vaporous abstractions. When Dewey talks about protecting the homeland, or Kalloor speaks of the importance of protecting consumer data, the words carry no real conviction, on the part of either the characters or the filmmakers. There is also a rote quality to much of the action, an absence of passion, if not of skill. I suspect that some youngsters out there will complain that “Jason Bourne” is tedious and irrelevant. Without disputing the substance of that judgment, I can’t help taking it personally. The tedium, I would argue, is not incidental but essential, because this is not really a spy thriller or even a   and    action movie, but rather a somber meditation on the crisis of the   professional in the throes of middle age. I’m not casting shade on Mr. Damon, who at 45 looks terrific, with the complete opposite of a dad bod and a residual Will Hunting twinkle in his eye. But reflect for a moment on the character he plays, who must do his own   on the fly and under duress. Jason, for all his prodigious talent and carefully honed technique, finds himself permanently stalled on the career ladder, unable either to advance or to quit. To make matters worse, he is caught in a generational pincers grip, squeezed on one side by a   and sentimental   boss (Mr. Jones) and on the other by a   millennial rising quickly through the ranks (Ms. Vikander). Poor Bourne is burdened with inconvenient historical knowledge even as he must fight a perpetual battle against his own obsolescence. So I have to say I’m rooting for the guy. I doubt he’ll ever truly figure out who he is. But at least he can keep moving until his 401( k) is fully vested, and he can finally get around to writing that novel. “Jason Bourne” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). A modest body count by the standards of the genre. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.",0
17712,A Plan to Flood San Francisco With News on Homelessness - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   As the editor in chief of The San Francisco Chronicle, Audrey Cooper has overseen countless stories on homelessness. But the issue became personal three years ago when she was pushing her    child in a stroller through the city’s business district. A homeless couple in a tent on the sidewalk were having sex, tent flaps open, as their pit bull stood guard. Ms. Cooper expressed her outrage loudly and in colorful language. “I probably shouldn’t have started yelling at them,” she said in an interview in her fishbowl office in the heart of the Chronicle’s newsroom. “They let their dog loose. ” San Francisco residents have over decades become inured to encounters with the city’s homeless population, the clumps of humanity sleeping on sidewalks under coats and makeshift blankets, or drug addicts shooting up in full view of pedestrians. There are also the   but common scenes of mentally ill men and women stumbling down streets, arguing with imaginary enemies or harassing  . One particularly vocal group of residents, San Francisco’s journalists, say they feel a sense of urgency in addressing the problem. They are banding together in an exasperated, but as yet vaguely defined, attempt to spur the city into action. Next month, media organizations in the Bay Area are planning to put aside their rivalries and competitive instincts for a day of coordinated coverage on the homeless crisis in the city. The Chronicle, which is leading the effort, is dispensing with traditional news article formats and will put forward possible solutions to the seemingly intractable plight of around 6, 000 people without shelter. Representatives from Bay Area television and radio stations, The Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, Mother Jones and online publications, among others, met last month to figure out a plan to share resources and content. They agreed to publish their reports on homelessness on June 29. “We are all frustrated,” said Jon Steinberg, the editor in chief of San Francisco magazine, which is also taking part. “We are all fed up. We feel there is not enough movement and accountability on the issue. ” “We want the full force of the Fourth Estate to bear down on this problem,” he added. Thirty news organizations have confirmed their participation. KQED, a public television and radio station, is also taking a lead role in the campaign. The premise of the effort is to create a “wave” of coverage that will force politicians to come up with solutions, Ms. Cooper said. “You will not be able to log onto Facebook, turn on the radio, watch TV, read a newspaper, log onto Twitter without seeing a story about the causes and solutions to homelessness,” she said. At a time of tight budgets, collaboration has become increasingly common in the news business. This year’s Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism was won by a combined team from The Tampa Bay Times and The Sarasota   in Florida. Still, the San Francisco collaboration stands out for the number of organizations involved and, in the case of The Chronicle, the emphasis on proposing solutions. Ms. Cooper said The Chronicle will run a week of coverage, including four articles that she described as something akin to a science project: putting forth a hypothesized solution and investigating it. The first proposal is that the city build a mental health center large enough to treat the mentally ill on the streets. The article will explore the cost and the feasibility of institutionalizing people. “We need to be a hell of a lot more creative about how we solve this problem,” Ms. Cooper said. “And we are probably going to have to break some dishes to do it. ” The paper’s articles and photographs will be offered free to all participants. The paper will also run a   editorial with its conclusions on what solutions should be pursued. Advocacy is a longstanding taboo in American journalism, making reporters and editors wary of discussing solutions to the problems they highlight in their coverage. One rationale for this is that journalists who advocate causes might be selective in their reporting or biased in their coverage. In a city known for its liberal traditions, the question of whether San Francisco’s journalists are crossing into activism has not come up, at least not in the initial meeting of news organizations last month. “It was sort of shocking that there was no dissension,” said Holly Kernan, the executive editor for news at KQED, the public broadcaster that hosted the meeting. “On the contrary, the conversation was, ‘Let’s do way more. ’” Ms. Kernan said her station plans “blanket” coverage on June 29, but will not propose solutions. “I see what we are doing as pure journalism,” Ms. Kernan said. Aaron Pero, news director of   a Bay Area television news station, said he planned to have a report on homelessness each day for a week, possibly profiles of homeless people. “I wasn’t going to try to figure out how to solve the homeless problem,” Mr. Pero said. “My vision was to send a number of reporters out and to find a profile that we could do every single day. ” Mr. Pero said it was “really awesome that all these media outlets are coming together. ” “I don’t think it’s been done anywhere else,” he added. Only one local outlet, KCBS, a news radio station, declined to participate. “It’s not because of any lack of interest in the homeless or any perception that the story is unimportant to our listeners,” Jack Swanson, the director of news and programming at KCBS, said in an email. “Like many media outlets in the Bay Area we cover the homeless situation in our communities and will continue to cover it, on a regular basis. ” (A New York Times reporter also attended the meeting. While The Times is not participating in the coordinated coverage, it has and will continue to cover homelessness as a major issue in the city.) Proponents of   journalism are applauding the initiative. Andrew Donohue, a senior editor at the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit organization that partners with other media on reporting projects, said the   muckraking focus of some journalism has made the public more cynical. “There’s outrage fatigue,” Mr. Donohue said. “You can very easily leave people feeling helpless, which can then lead to being disengaged. ” Courtney Martin, a founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates journalism that covers solutions to social problems, said she was thrilled to hear of the San Francisco project. “This is the kind of thing that is music to our ears,” Ms. Martin said. “We have this bias in the media to think that our only job is the watchdog role. ” A journalist’s job, she said, “is not to pick a winner. ” “Your job is to investigate solutions,” she said. “People want to read about how to fix broken systems. ”",0
17713,Phony ‘Corruption’ Excuse for Ukraine Coup,"Phony ‘Corruption’ Excuse for Ukraine Coup November 2, 2016 
Exclusive: The U.S.-backed “regime change” in Ukraine — launching the New Cold War with Russia in 2014 — was rationalized by the need to rid Ukraine of corruption, but post-coup officials are busy lining their pockets, reports Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
If Ukraine becomes a flashpoint for World War III with Russia, the American people might rue the day that their government pressed for the 2014 overthrow of Ukraine’s allegedly corrupt (though elected) president in favor of a coup regime led by Ukrainian lawmakers who now report amassing, on average, more than $1 million each, much of it as cash. 
The New York Times, which served as virtually a press agent for the coup in February 2014, took note of this apparent corruption among the U.S.-favored post-coup officials, albeit deep inside a story that itself was deep inside the newspaper (page A8). The lead angle was a bemused observation that Ukraine’s officialdom lacked faith in the country’s own banks (thus explaining why so much cash). Ukraine’s anti-Russian President Petro Poroshenko speaking to the Atlantic Council in 2014. (Photo credit: Atlantic Council) 
Yet, Ukraine is a country beset by widespread poverty, made worse by the post-coup neoliberal “reforms” slashing pensions, making old people work longer and reducing heating subsidies for average citizens. The average Ukrainian salary is only $214 a month. 
So, an inquiring mind might wonder how – in the face of all that hardship – the post-coup officials did so well for themselves, but Times’ correspondent Andrew E. Kramer treads lightly on the possibility that these officials were at least as corrupt, if not more so, than the elected government that the U.S. helped overthrow. Elected President Viktor Yanukovych had been excoriated for a lavish lifestyle because he had a sauna in his residence. 
Kramer’s article on Wednesday tried to explain the bundles of cash as a sign that “many of the lawmakers and officials responsible for inspiring public trust in Ukraine’s economic and banking institutions have little faith that their own wealth would be safe in the country’s banks, according to recently mandated financial disclosures. … 
“Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, for example, declared over one million dollars in savings in cash — $870,000 and 460,000 euros — apparently shunning Ukraine’s ever-wobbly banking system. The top official in charge of the country’s banks, Valeriya Gontareva, who is responsible for stabilizing the national currency, the hryvnia, maintains most of her money in American dollars — $1.8 million. 
“A tally of the declarations filed by most of Parliament’s 450 members compiled by one analyst, Andriy Gerus, found that the lawmakers collectively held $482 million in ‘monetary assets,’ of which $36 million was kept as cold, hard cash. … 
“Some politicians seem to have approached the declaration as a sort of amnesty, revealing everything they have earned from decades of crooked dealings, in an effort to come clean. … One minister reported a wine collection with bottles worth thousands of dollars each. Another official declared ownership of a church. Yet another claimed a ticket to outer space with Virgin Galactic. … 
“Another theory making the rounds in Kiev — where people generally acknowledge the inventive, venal genius of their politicians — suggests that the public servants are padding their declarations,” so they can hide future bribes within their reported cash holdings and thus offer plausible excuses for luxury cars and expensive jewelry. 
Accessing More Money 
Ironically, passage of the law requiring the disclosures of what appears to be widespread corruption among Kiev’s officials unlocked millions of euros in new aid money from the European Union that then flowed to the same apparently corrupt officials. Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. 
However, because the Ukraine “regime change” in 2014 was partly orchestrated by U.S. and E.U. officials around the propaganda theme that elected President Yanukovych was corrupt – he had that sauna, after all – the continued corruption in the post-coup regime has been a rarely acknowledged, inconvenient truth. Indeed, some business people operating in Ukraine have complained that the corruption has grown worse since Yanukovych was overthrown. 
Yet, only occasionally has that reality been allowed to peek through in the mainstream U.S. media, which prefers to deny that any “coup” occurred, to blame Russia for all of Ukraine’s problems, and to praise the post-coup “reforms” which targeted pensions, heating subsidies and other social programs for average citizens. 
One of the rare deviations from the happy talk appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 1, 2016, observing that “most Ukrainians say the revolution’s promise to replace rule by thieves with the rule of law has fallen short and the government acknowledges that there is still much to be done.” 
Actually, the numbers suggested something even worse. More and more Ukrainians rated corruption as a major problem facing the nation, including a majority of 53 percent in September 2015, up from 28 percent in September 2014, according to polls by International Foundation for Electoral Systems. 
So, as the hard lives of most Ukrainians got harder, the elites continued to skim off whatever cream was left, including access to billions of dollars in the West’s foreign assistance that has kept the economy afloat. 
There was, for instance, the case of Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, who was regarded by many pundits as the face of Ukraine’s reform before departing last April after losing out in a power struggle. 
Yet, Jaresko was hardly a paragon of reform. Prior to getting instant Ukrainian citizenship and becoming Finance Minister in December 2014, she was a former U.S. diplomat who had been entrusted to run a $150 million U.S.-taxpayer-funded program to help jump-start an investment economy in Ukraine and Moldova. 
Jaresko’s compensation was capped at $150,000 a year, a salary that many Americans – let alone Ukrainians – would envy, but it was not enough for her. So, she engaged in a variety of maneuvers to evade the cap and enrich herself by claiming millions of dollars in bonuses and fees. 
Ultimately, Jaresko was collecting more than $2 million a year after she shifted management of the Western NIS Enterprise Fund (WNISEF) to her own private company, Horizon Capital, and arranged to get lucrative bonuses when selling off investments, even as the overall WNISEF fund was losing money, according to official records. Ukraine’s former Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko. 
For instance, Jaresko collected $1.77 million in bonuses in 2013, according to a WNISEF filing with the Internal Revenue Service. In her financial disclosure forms with the Ukrainian government, she reported earning $2.66 million in 2013 and $2.05 million in 2014, thus amassing a sizeable personal fortune while investing U.S. taxpayers’ money supposedly to benefit the Ukrainian people. 
It didn’t matter that WNISEF continued to hemorrhage money, shrinking from its original $150 million to $89.8 million in the 2013 tax year, according to the IRS filing. WNISEF reported that the bonuses to Jaresko and other corporate officers were based on “successful” exits from some investments even if the overall fund was losing money. 
Though Jaresko’s enrichment schemes were documented by IRS and other official filings, the mainstream U.S. media turned a blind eye to this history, all the better to pretend that Ukraine’s “reform” process was in good hands. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “ How Ukraine’s Finance Minister Got Rich .”] 
Biden’s Appeal 
Worried about the continued corruption, Vice President Joe Biden, who took a personal interest in Ukraine, lectured Ukraine’s parliament on the need to end cronyism. 
But Biden had his own Ukraine cronyism problem because three months after the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Yanukovych government Ukraine’s largest private gas firm, Burisma Holdings, appointed his son, Hunter Biden, to its board of directors. Vice President Joe Biden. 
Burisma a shadowy Cyprus-based company also lined up well-connected lobbyists, some with ties to Secretary of State John Kerry, including Kerry’s former Senate chief of staff David Leiter, according to lobbying disclosures. 
As Time magazine reported , “Leiter’s involvement in the firm rounds out a power-packed team of politically-connected Americans that also includes a second new board member, Devon Archer, a Democratic bundler and former adviser to John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. Both Archer and Hunter Biden have worked as business partners with Kerry’s son-in-law, Christopher Heinz, the founding partner of Rosemont Capital, a private-equity company.” 
According to investigative journalism inside Ukraine, the ownership of Burisma has been traced to Privat Bank, controlled by the thuggish billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, who was appointed by the U.S.-backed “reform” regime to be governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a south-central province of Ukraine (though Kolomoisky was eventually ousted from that post in a power struggle over control of UkrTransNafta, Ukraine’s state-owned oil pipeline operator). 
In a speech to Ukraine’s parliament in December 2015 , Biden hailed the sacrifice of the 100 or so protesters who died during the Maidan putsch in February 2014, which ousted Yanukovych, referring to the dead by their laudatory name “The Heavenly Hundred.” 
But Biden made no heavenly references to the estimated 10,000 people, mostly ethnic Russians, who have been slaughtered in the U.S.-encouraged “Anti-Terror Operation” waged by the coup regime against eastern Ukrainians who resisted Yanukovych’s violent ouster. Nor did Biden take note that some of the Heavenly Hundred were street fighters for neo-Nazi and other far-right nationalist organizations. 
But after making his sugary references to The Heavenly Hundred, Biden delivered his bitter medicine, an appeal for the parliament to continue implementing International Monetary Fund “reforms,” including demands that old people work longer into their old age. 
Biden said, “For Ukraine to continue to make progress and to keep the support of the international community you have to do more, as well. The big part of moving forward with your IMF program — it requires difficult reforms. And they are difficult. 
“Let me say parenthetically here, all the experts from our State Department and all the think tanks, and they come and tell you, that you know what you should do is you should deal with pensions. You should deal with — as if it’s easy to do. Hell, we’re having trouble in America dealing with it. We’re having trouble. To vote to raise the pension age is to write your political obituary in many places. 
“Don’t misunderstand that those of us who serve in other democratic institutions don’t understand how hard the conditions are, how difficult it is to cast some of the votes to meet the obligations committed to under the IMF. It requires sacrifices that might not be politically expedient or popular. But they’re critical to putting Ukraine on the path to a future that is economically secure. And I urge you to stay the course as hard as it is. Ukraine needs a budget that’s consistent with your IMF commitments.” 
However, as tough as it might have been for Ukraine’s parliament to slash pensions, reduce heating subsidies and force the elderly to work longer, that political sacrifice did not appear to extend to the officials making financial sacrifices themselves.

17714,Does Gold & Silver Care Who Wins?,"Financial Markets , Gold , Market Manipulation , Precious Metals , U.S. Economy gold coins , money supply , silver eagles , stock bubble admin 
Short answer: No. 
A local financial advisor texted me today asking what I thought gold would do if Hillary wins today. Obviously he’s been reading the pedestrian analysis on the topic that has flooded the mainstream media. 
But gold doesn’t care who wins. The United States is beset with unsolvable financial and economic issues that will require a systemic reset. The amount of funded Treasury debt outstanding since Obama took office has doubled to $20 trillion. So much for his claim that he reduced the spending deficit. But the result would have been the same if McCain had won in 2008 or if Romney had won in 2012. 
Stocks and bonds are historically overvalued. While the accounting standards have been substantially liberalized thereby enabling companies to artificially boost earnings with gimmicks, using comparable accounting rules to compare now to any other market top in history would show that current valuation ratios are significantly higher than at any other time in the history of U.S. markets. The bond argument is easy: interest rates are at or near all-time lows. Rates can only go higher which means bond prices can only go lower (unless artificially taken negative by the Fed, which would cause gold to go parabolic) . 
With fiat paper assets at historically overvalued levels, gold and silver are highly undervalued relative to financial assets and in relation to the quantity of paper money, where the quantity paper money is currency issued plus credit outstanding. The latter is included because debt functions exactly like currency until it’s repaid. Guess what? This country has not reduced the cumulative public and private debt outstanding in the post-World War Two period. The small “blip” indicating overall debt declined in 2010 reflects massive banking sector write-offs and debt-forgiveness, both of which were monetized by the Fed. As long as the level of debt increases, credit outstanding needs to be included in the money supply. 
The bottom line is that gold is going to move much higher in value relative to the dollar regardless of which candidate or which party controls the political process. The laws of nature and economics remain constant throughout history. When the Central Bank and Government market intervention eventually fails and these laws reassert their force – which they always do – the “money” that floods out of stocks and bonds will flood into physical gold silver.

[10/29/16] With furious Democrats – and the Clinton Campaign – now openly blasting the FBI’s reopened investigation (as Republicans take delight for once in having a government agency reinforce their side of events), the question turns to just what emails were found on Weiner’s laptop, and how damaging their contents are for the FBI to take the unprecedented step of “intervening” in a major political event just days before the national election. 
We first laid what was the most likely explanation yesterday , when we showed several examples of Huma Abedin emails being sent from her work email account to her personal account at , courtesy of a Judicial Watch FOIA release. Of the more than 160 emails in the latest Judicial Watch release, some 110 emails – two-thirds of the total – were forwarded by Abedin to two personal addresses she controlled. The Washington Times reported in August 2015 that the State Department had admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and Mills used personal email accounts to conduct government business in addition to Clinton’s private clintonemail.com to transact State Department business. 
One email from May 15, 2009, was sent by Abedin from her State Department email to her personal email. Abedin was archiving in her personal email account an email Hillary Clinton sent her from Clinton’s private email server at . Abedin was asked to print out attachments to an email Mills sent via a private address the previous day to Clinton involving “timetables and deliverables” for her review via Alec Ross, a technology policy expert who then held the title of senior adviser for innovation to Secretary Clinton. However, while forwarding Hillary’s emails to her personal email server for “convenience” is one thing, what is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account, which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiner’s computer: in the above example, the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted, with “PAGE DENIED” stamped across the first redacted page. 
An argument can be made that the extensive redaction confirms confidential material was part of the transmission. 
This is a nuanced point being pushed by Hillary Clinton supporters such as Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald, who in an article yesterday tried to make a case citing “sources” (even though the FBI said that nobody has seen the content of the Weiner/Abedin emails), that “ no emails being examined by FBI were to or from Clinton .” Post navigation",0

17718,Emmett Till’s Murder: What Really Happened That Day in the Store? - The New York Times,"THE BLOOD OF EMMETT TILLBy Timothy B. Tyson291 pp. Simon  Schuster. $27. The existence of racial terror is not a singular phenomenon in our country’s national archive. Consider 2015, a feverish June night in South Carolina, when Dylann Roof, feeding off racist conspiracy theories, walked into Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and murdered nine black parishioners. Then reach back almost 20 years before that, to 1998, when James Byrd Jr. a black man, was abducted by three white men and fatally dragged from the back of a pickup truck along unforgiving Texas asphalt. Then there is perhaps the most monstrous application of racial terror in our historical register: Aug. 28, 1955, when    Emmett Till was lynched. The events of that bitter morning, their motivations and ramifications, have found a meticulous, if not their most exhaustive, retelling in Timothy B. Tyson’s “The Blood of Emmett Till,” an account of absorbing and sometimes horrific detail. Comprehensive in scope, its final 60 pages alone are a catalog of notes and sources. Tyson is a senior research scholar at Duke University and the author of “Blood Done Sign My Name,” about the 1970 lynching of Henry Marrow in Tyson’s hometown, and he tracks Till’s life from Argo, Ill. to Chicago, to his last moments in Money, Miss. where  —   despite the hesitation of his mother, Mamie  —   Till had sojourned with relatives. On a Wednesday evening in August, Till allegedly flirted with and grabbed the hand of Carolyn Bryant, a white woman who worked as the cashier at a local market. According to recovered court transcripts released by the F. B. I. in 2007, he let out a “wolf whistle” as she exited the store to get a gun from her car. Bryant later informed her husband and his half brother, who proceeded to uphold a grim tradition: Till was abducted, beaten, shot in the head and thrown into the Tallahatchie River. A   gin fan was tied to his neck with barbed wire, with the hope that he would never be found. Black life in America has endured as little more than a fragile truth in the hands of white aggressors. And Tyson does well to remind us just how   racial terror can be when wielded with brute force: “Affronted white supremacy drove every blow. ” There are a number of facts to parse in this book  —   such as Till’s affinity for straw hats on churchgoing Sundays, and the sheriff’s belief that the body recovered from the river was part of an “N. A. A. C. P.  scheme” to disgrace Mississippi  —   but none perhaps more profoundly consequential than Bryant’s own admission to Tyson that the events that led to Till’s death didn’t happen as she had previously attested. Outside private correspondence with her attorney, trial testimony and her unpublished memoir, Bryant remained   about her interaction with Till. In 2008, in her only interview since that fateful season of death, Bryant admitted to Tyson that a crucial piece of her testimony in court was fabricated. Till never “grabbed her around the waist and uttered obscenities,” as she had avowed on the witness stand. “You tell these stories for so long that they seem true,” she confesses early in the book, “but that part is not true. ” And so we are left with a sobering certainty, one that even Bryant herself is forced to concede to Tyson, more than 50 years later: “Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him. ” The sum of history is made up of recurring patterns. Each new decade has brought past sins to the fore. From Emmett Till and Henry Marrow to Amadou Diallo, Rekia Boyd and Alton Sterling. These deaths,   lynchings that have taken new shapes, are simply the mores and modes of a   American custom: white supremacy. “The real horror comes when your dead brain must face the fact that we as a nation don’t want it to stop,” the novelist Chester Himes wrote to The New York Post upon hearing that Till’s murderers were acquitted. “If we wanted to, we would. ”",0
17719,Anti-Trump Marchers ‘Mostly White’ Women Who Need ‘Therapy’ After Clinton Loss,"The tens of thousands of women marching in the   Women’s March on Washington demonstration in Washington, D. C. Saturday are “mostly white” and experiencing “therapy” for their anxiety over Hillary Clinton’s election loss to Donald Trump in November, the Washington Post reports. [Planned Parenthood tweeted:  We stand shoulder to shoulder with all women in the struggle for equality  justice. #WhyIMarch   @womensmarch pic. twitter.   —   Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) January 21, 2017,  According to the Post: Marchers  —   mostly women and mostly white  —   said they came to take the most public possible stand against Trump, a candidate and now president whom they said routinely insults women and the issues they care about. But the gathering also provided therapy for many, the balm of immersing themselves in a   sea of citizens who had shared their anxiety and disappointment after Democrat Hillary Clinton’s historic bid for the presidency ended in defeat. The report notes some of the women are “sometimes sleeping on the couches of people they had never met before” due to the vast crowd participating in the march. “Organizers, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200, 000, said Saturday they now expect as many as a half million participants  —   potentially dwarfing Friday’s inaugural crowd,” the report says: 12 Ways You Can Fight Back Against All This Oppressive Crap In 2017: https:  .  via @buzzfeed #IDEFY,  —   Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) January 20, 2017,  The march’s central focus appears to be to protect abortion chain Planned Parenthood from taxpayer defunding, one of the stated goals of the Trump administration. Though cast as a “women’s rights” march,   women who attempted to register for the march were refused. “If you want to come to the march you are coming with the understanding that you respect a woman’s right to choose,” Linda Sarsour, a   Muslim racial justice and civil rights activist, and a chairwoman of the event, told the New York Times. Feminist Gloria Steinem and Planned Parenthood have partnered for the event, providing it with its decidedly   tone. On her website, Steinem says to her fans: We have all the powers we had [before Trump was elected] of lobbying and pressuring and making clear that the political consequences are great. We may look up and feel powerless and think there’s nothing we can do, but it’s not true. There are things we can do at each level. And there’s always civil disobedience. Trump is not my president. Steinem also recently said she would refuse to pay the full amount of her federal income tax if Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funds were eliminated. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said about the march: We will send a strong message to the incoming administration that millions of people across this country are prepared to fight attacks on reproductive health care, abortion services, and access to Planned Parenthood, as they intersect with the rights of young people, people of color, immigrants, and people of all faiths, backgrounds, and incomes. According to the march’s website, its mission is to “send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women’s rights are human rights. ” Democrat Sens. Patty Murray (WA) and Elizabeth Warren (MA) are supporting Planned Parenthood: Today, we stood with Planned Parenthood and the millions of women  men who don’t want to see their health care taken away.   pic. twitter.   —   Senator Patty Murray (@PattyMurray) January 20, 2017,  Despite its message of unity among all the left’s political identity groups, the Times previously reported the “Women’s March” has been anything but unified from its inception: On the march group’s Facebook page, it is easy to see how complicated the idea of the “women’s vote,” an already mythological concept, has become, and how difficult it might be for organizers to fulfill their aim of gathering women who remain fiercely divided on reproductive rights, gun control,   marriage and immigration, among other issues. Not everyone on the page believes, for instance, that Hillary Clinton would have made a good president, or that Stephen K. Bannon, a chief strategist under Mr. Trump, holds divisive views about minorities. Debates over both have sprung up in recent days. Bob Bland, one of the march’s organizers, said in an email that organizers in Maryland had to change a Facebook page from public to private to protect the safety of women who want to attend. Writing at the Week, abortion rights supporter Shikha Dalmia asserts the demonstration has already failed in its mission. “Demonstrations serve a useful function in a democracy  —   but only when they have clarity of purpose,” she writes, adding that the march is “shaping up to be a   exercise in search of a cause. ” Dalmia writes some of the “absurdity” related to the event stems from “the fact that they are billing this event as the voice of women when 42 percent of women (and 62 percent of   educated white women) actually voted for Trump. ” She also observes “the   progressive hysteria over the event’s name. ” The initial plan by the “three white women” organizers, she says, was to call the event the “Million Women March,” but the women were criticized for “cultural appropriation” for “allegedly poaching the heritage of the 1997 Million Woman March for black women. ” “Feminists are confusing the issue by making Trump’s threat about themselves,” Dalmia concludes. “If they really wanted to help, they would have kept their powder dry for now, rather than embark on this confused and pointless march. ”",0
17720,Pakistan declares nationwide bandh on November 9th in protest against 1-day ban on NDTV,"Pakistan declares nationwide bandh on November 9th in protest against 1-day ban on NDTV Posted on Tweet (Image via ndtv.com) 
Global terror hub Pakistan has called for a nationwide shutdown on the 9th of November, in what it terms a strong protest against the Indian Ministry of Information & Broadcasting’s 1-day ban on satire 
Pakistan Prime Minister Raheel Nawaz Sharif, after firing a stinging letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, highlighting India’s 24-hour ban on NDTV, which he termed a cold-blooded murder of democracy and free speech, officially made the announcement. “The people of Pakistan stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the employees of NDTV at this time. To make the world get an idea of what is happening in India as well as about how much dear NDTV means to us, the whole of Pakistan will shut down on the 9th of November. This will teach India a lesson,” Sharif stated. If rumours are to be believed, ORF chief Sudheendra Kulkarni and Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar are expected to join the agitation across the border. 
Sharif’s appeal found resonance not only among Pakistan’s citizens, but also among their terrorists. Leading the charge was JuD chief terrorist Hafiz Saeed, who announced a worldwide terror shutdown on the 9th. “Who does India think they are? After I mentioned that I am a big fan of Barkha Dutt, they go all coward and block her channel for 24 hours! I won’t take this insult to our Barkha lightly. I appeal to all my fellow terrorists in Pakistan and in all parts of the world, including the ones in India, to suspend all terror operations on that day to show our solidarity. This way, we will send out a strong message,” Saeed announced. 
The clarion call has been uniting all rival factions in Pakistan by the hour. While PTI chief and former cricketer Imran Khan announced that he would not look to marry anyone on the 9th of November, in complete solidarity with NDTV, former Pakistan External Affairs Minister Hina Rabbani Khar has announced that she would not be purchasing any Birkin bags on that day. 
The countries standing up for NDTV do not seem to be limited to Pakistan alone. According to NDTV’s Sreenivasan Jain, the Gaza administration has conveyed similar intentions to him. “I’m in Gaza right now and every citizen here, right from the safed dhaadis to the kaala dhaadis feel that this is no chota-mota matter. NDTV and I personally mean so much to these people. Even today, whenever people see me on the streets here, they laud my coverage of Snoopgate,” Jain told The UnReal Times . 
While a few journalists at NDTV are still shell-shocked and clueless over what to do during the day, journalist Sunetra Choudhury has signed up for an alternative reading class at JNU. NDTV India’s Ravish Kumar declared that he would cover himself up with the black screen he previously used, for the whole day, in protest against the government’s move. While Union I&B Minister Venkaiah Naidu is yet to comment on the issue, his predecessor Arun Jaitley is likely to go on leave on November 9th, according to Finance Ministry sources.

17721,California Today: A Gallery Flees and Neighborhood Activists Cheer - The New York Times," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. Often referred to as the Ellis Island of Los Angeles, the neighborhood east of downtown known as Boyle Heights has been the first stop for several waves of immigration. Since the 1940s, it has transformed into a largely   enclave and the center of Chicano culture and activism in the city. As other parts of Los Angeles have seen real estate prices climb steadily, many in Boyle Heights have expressed concern about gentrification, particularly after several art galleries moved into an industrial stretch. The battle between the galleries and activists reached a peak last fall when someone   a vulgar statement condemning “white art” on the door of one gallery and a   investigation was opened. Almost from the moment it opened its doors last year Pssst, a nonprofit gallery, and its creators, have been the focus of protests and criticism on social media. Last month, they announced they could no longer tolerate it. They were closing up shop. “This persistent targeting, which was often highly personal in nature, was made all the more intolerable because the artists we engaged are queer, women,   people of color,” they said on their website. “We could no longer continue to put already vulnerable communities at further risk. ” Defend Boyle Heights, one of the activist groups that has called for a boycott of the galleries, said that it considered the closing a victory and that it hoped other galleries would soon follow suit. The response has raised alarms for many of the other galleries in the area. Ethan Swan, one of the directors of 356 Mission, which has been there since 2013, said that he had tried to arrange a meeting with local activists, but that he had been repeatedly turned down. “We want to be thoughtful about our presence and what it was that we could do or how we could work together for a better future for this neighborhood and how it might shift,” he said. “But their position is an uncompromising one since they don’t see a solution unless we leave. ” Do you think the galleries should stay in Boyle Heights or leave?

17722,Scientists find 19 pieces of NON-HUMAN DNA in the Human Genome,"According to a new study, eight percent of our DNA is ALIEN. In fact, it is made up of NON-HUMAN, viral fragments. The new study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 
The recent study revealed that there is literally non-human DNA residing in modern humans’ genome. This study comes after a froup of researchers from Tufts and University of Michigan Medical School examined 2,500 people.
Experts discovered that our DNA is less human and that nineteen pieces of Ancient Viral DNA exist within our own genome.
Most strikingly, experts discovered the full genetic mockup for an entire virus within 2 percent of the people they examined. According to sciencedaily.com , whether or not the virus can be replicated or reproduced, isn’t yet known. But other studies of ancient virus DNA have shown it can affect the humans who carry it.
ScienceDaily reports that the study offers new insight on human endogenous retroviruses. HERV’s are actually antique diseases which possess eerily similar characteristics to human immunodeficiency virus, the precursor to AIDS.
Experts believe that this ‘Viral DNA0 has been passed down through thousands of generations of human beings. The study’s authors are still unsure whether the ancient strains of DNA could cause infections.
“This one looks like it is capable of making infectious virus, which would be very exciting if true, as it would allow us to study a viral epidemic that took place long ago,” says senior author and virologist John Coffin, Ph.D. of the Tufts University School of Medicine. “This research provides important information necessary for understanding how retroviruses and humans have evolved together in relatively recent times.”
“Many studies have tried to link these endogenous viral elements to cancer and other diseases, but a major difficulty has been that we haven’t actually found all of them yet,” says co-first author Zachary H. Williams, a Ph.D. student at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University in Boston. “A lot of the most interesting elements are only found in a small percentage of people, which means you have to screen a large number of people to find them.”
“This is a thrilling discovery,” says co-first author Julia Wildschutte, Ph.D., who began the work as a Ph.D. student in Coffin’s lab at Tufts. “It will open up many doors to research. What’s more, we have confirmed in this paper that we can use genomic data from multiple individuals compared to the reference human genome to detect new HERVs. But this has also shown us that some people carry insertions that we can’t map back to the reference.”

17723,Bruce Springsteen: ’I Was a Stone-Cold Draft Dodger’,"April 30 (UPI)  —   Bruce Springsteen says writing and performing “Born in the U. S. A. ” helped him reconcile the mixed feelings he has about decisions he made during the Vietnam War era. [“I had some friends, very close friends of mine  …     guys who came home in wheelchairs and, then, I didn’t go. I was a   draft dodger,” the New Jersey rocker said at a Tribeca Film Festival conversation with Tom Hanks at the Beacon Theatre in New York Friday.  “I pulled the whole ‘Alice’s Restaurant.’ ‘I’m sorry, sir. I don’t understand what you are saying because I am high on LSD.’ I did everything in the  ’s text book,” Springsteen recalled. “So, perhaps, I felt guilty about that later on. I had friends who went. I had friends who went and died. I had friends later on who were seriously hurt. And whether it was that or whether it was just the fact it was an event that defined a generation and if you were going to write about the world, if you were going to write about who we are at this this particular moment, if you were going to write about your place, if you were going to try to seize your little moment in history, which were all things I wanted to deliver to my audience, it was something that needed to be reckoned with.   …     And, so, it was something that I felt I had to come to terms with myself and I needed to sing about. ”",0
17724,DELINGPOLE: Why I Totally Hate Big Oil - And Why You Should Too...,"Did you hear the speech that Al Gore gave in Texas the other day saying that the oil industry should take climate change more seriously, that oil could peak in the next decade, that the “social acceptance” for oil was disappearing, that there needed to be a meaningful tax on carbon emissions and that he “strongly supported” the Paris climate agreement? [Oh no, wait. It wasn’t Al Gore. My bad. It was actually Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell speaking at an oil industry gathering at the U. S. oil capital of Houston.  Now do you see why I so hate Big Oil? Well, partly it’s bitterness. For many years now, I  —   and many sceptics like me  —   have been accused by climate alarmists of being “in the pay of Big Oil”. But even though we deserve it for promoting fossil fuels so enthusiastically and fighting their critics so heroically, few of us have ever received even a penny for our troubles. That’s because Big Oil is far too busy trying to greenwash its image  —   as Shell itself did by sponsoring the Guardian’s environment pages for many years  —   to waste time on the plucky, outspoken heroes who do a better job for Big Oil’s PR than the Big Oil’s paid PR departments do. Mainly, though it’s disgust. Big Oil has this public image of being an industry for fearless,   manly men who aren’t afraid of getting their hands dirty or braving the environmentalists’ wrath in order to do their ugly but important work supplying the world with   energy. Yet it’s an image almost entirely undeserved. Almost everyone at a senior level in Big Oil is a craven, simpering, politically correct, spineless,   corporate shill. They’re cowards who are scared of free markets, won’t speak up for capitalism, won’t even defend their core business. Typical of this attitude was the current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. One of his first moves on becoming CEO of Exxon in 2006 was to announce it would stop funding organisations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute “whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner. ” Unlike his punchier predecessor Lee Raymond, Tillerson clearly decided that discretion being the better part of valor, he would throw his industry’s supporters to the wolves. One of the first big energy stories I covered for Breitbart was the incredible true story of how Chevron Oil fought off a $9. 5 billion damages case filed on behalf of Ecuadorean natives whose lands had supposedly been polluted as a result of Chevron’s negligence. The truly incredible part of the story was that Chevron decided to defend the case. The more usual position of Big Oil is to surrender as soon as possible and settle out of court. If Big Oil won’t speak out for the oil industry, who will? Sadly, the burden invariably falls to that small group of maverick believers in free markets and honest science who don’t care about all the brickbats they get for being defenders of “dirty fuel” because they’d rather speak the truth than be popular. Among them is Steve Milloy who, May 2008, intervened in an Exxon shareholder meeting on behalf of all those shareholders who think that Exxon’s core business should be drilling oil and creating value for shareholders  —   not getting distracted by trying to make themselves look cuter for their Watermelon (green on the outside, red on the inside) critics. Follow this link and you can hear the huge round applause Milloy won from shareholders when he proposed that Exxon should amend its   so that it no longer had to waste time on politicised interventions from “nuisance shareholders”. Stock ownership has become politicized. Many shareholders own stock in   corporations for the sole purpose of advancing the shareholders’ own social or political agendas, while simultaneously assailing the corporations’ legitimate business operations. These activist shareholders are “nuisance shareholders. ” A primary tool of nuisance shareholders is the submission of   precatory (advisory) proposals for discussion and vote at annual meetings of shareholders. Proposals from nuisance shareholders can coerce management into making decisions not in the best interests of the Company and its bona fide shareholders, and turn the annual meeting into a   circus. You’d think Exxon would have been grateful for this fire support from their public. Not one bit. We can see this from Exxon’s response to a submission from Milloy that he intends to make a similar proposal at Exxon’s next shareholder meeting this May. They applied to the SEC to try to get Milloy’s proposal excluded. Happily, the SEC’s lawyer wasn’t having it.  It goes without saying that Exxon, like Shell, like most Big Oil companies, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is now using its influence to try to prevent President Trump to fulfil his campaign trail promise to withdraw the U. S. from the UN Paris Climate Agreement. Ostensibly their excuse is that it would be bad for US international relations and “send the wrong signals”. In reality, it’s for the worst of reasons. First, it’s because spinelessness is an integral part of their corporate culture: they’ve spent years surrendering to the green movement by paying it Danegeld and by paying lip service to its eco pieties  —   and they’re not about to grow a pair just because Donald Trump is president. Second, it’s because they’re so heavily diversified into   sectors like “renewables” and into unproven but lucrative technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage that they can’t afford the massive hit they’d suffer if Trump were to sever all ties with the Climate Industrial Complex. Big Oil is evil all right but not in the way the Greenies would have you think. It’s because, heeding the voices of the industry’s Wormtongues, Big Oil surrendered to the dark forces of Eco Mordor. It makes you hope that the smaller scale producers of the global fracking industry go from strength to strength  —   and make the politically correct Big Oil monoliths history.",0
17725,"Smiling, Even When the Oscar Race Is a Losing Marathon - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   Smiling and clapping through marathon   awards banquets. Week after week, month after month. Racking up   miles (New York to Los Angeles to London to Los Angeles) to woo Oscar voters at    sessions. Giving endless command performances to   reporters who ask the same five (three?) questions on loop. All the hair and makeup. All the gown fittings. And losing the whole time. Nicole Kidman, Naomie Harris, Michelle Williams and Octavia Spencer  —   each nominated for best supporting actress at the coming Academy Awards  —   know this drill all too well: It has been their lives (boohoo, I know) since November, when their fellow nominee, Viola Davis, started to vacuum up prize after prize for her    performance in “Fences. ” All told, Ms. Davis, who plays a   homemaker in 1950s Pittsburgh, has collected at least 29 trophies in recent months. (“Thank you to the Iowa Film Critics Association! ”) She walked to bellwether wins at the Golden Globes, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Screen Actors Guild. The oddsmakers at GoldDerby. com have her seizing the supporting actress Oscar in a landslide on Feb. 26. It’s the most   category there is: She’s winning. So why do the other contenders keep going through the motions? That question pops into my head almost every year around this time, when the gracious losing starts to seem like   performance art unto itself.   reporters do their best to keep the Academy Awards feeling like a contest, but at least one category is perennially no contest at all. In 2015, Julianne Moore won best actress on the September day when Hollywood insiders first saw her in “Still Alice” at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2012, Ms. Spencer similarly breezed to the Oscar lectern, collecting the supporting actress statuette for her portrayal of a maid in “The Help,” in which she starred with Ms. Davis. For answers, I spoke to longtime studio executives, publicists, agents and even a few of this year’s   nominees. And some of their responses were surprising. Joe Quenqua, who runs the entertainment practice at DKC Marketing and Public Relations, cleared up one thing right off the bat: No nominees, no matter what they say, concede they are losing until that golden envelope has been opened. “You can be the longest shot in the history of Oscar nominees,” he said. “You still have to think you have the teeniest, tiniest,    chance of winning walking into that room. ” Mr. Quenqua, who has worked on numerous Oscar campaigns, including one for “The Help,” said that there are multiple reasons that   contenders cling to hope. Aside from ego  —   and don’t underestimate that factor in Hollywood  —   actors and actresses, from their earliest days auditioning, don’t make it very far if they have a defeatist attitude. Upsets from past Oscars can also contribute to magical thinking nobody thought voters would select Marisa Tomei as best supporting actress in 1993 for her   girlfriend in “My Cousin Vinny,” but they did. And reporters may play a role. “It’s not like journalists single out the long shots and say, ‘Tell me how it feels to be losing,’” Mr. Quenqua said. “Instead, the question asked to everyone is always, ‘What are you saying in your acceptance speech? ’” Guilty as charged. Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hosts a luncheon a few weeks before its prize ceremony to celebrate all the nominees as a group, from major stars down to the sound mixers. The academy peppers the room with reporters. Since the event usually falls at a crucial time in the voting process  —   this year, a few days before ballots went out  —   nominees tend to be very chatty. One of my first stops was Ms. Harris, who played a   mother in “Moonlight” and is vying for best supporting actress against Ms. Davis. “Do you plan to write an acceptance speech?” I asked her. Ms. Harris smiled. “I’m going with Helen Mirren’s advice, which is to always have a speech, even if you know beyond a doubt that you’re not going to win,” she said. I knew I was pushing it, but I said it anyway: “How do you know that?” With a single facial expression, she seemed to toss all 29 of Ms. Davis’s trophies in my direction. In the end, the affable Ms. Harris offered some insight into how she has approached the Year of Viola Davis, who has never won an Oscar despite two prior nominations (for “The Help” and for “Doubt” in 2009) making her the most nominated black actress in academy history. “I’m so grateful for the acknowledgment, which has made a huge difference in my career already, in terms of scripts and projects coming to me  —   it’s quite extraordinary, actually  —   but I’m also happy to be able to come to these events and help get ‘Moonlight’ to a broader audience,” Ms. Harris said. “I feel a responsibility to get out there and do as much legwork as I can to promote the film. ” Perhaps her category mates had similar points of view. Ms. Kidman, nominated for her   adoptive mother in “Lion,” has certainly done her best, dating back to the September film festivals, to keep that     in the public eye. Ditto Ms. Williams, nominated for her heartbroken mother in “Manchester by the Sea. ” Before I could track them down, I stumbled across Ms. Spencer, honored for playing a NASA leader in “Hidden Figures. ” She caught my eye partly because she was not aggressively working the   room. “Can I ask you a question?” I said to her, after identifying myself as a reporter. “No,” she said, sitting down at her lunch table. Now it was my turn to make a face. “Well, you can ask me how my day is going,” she said quickly. “But I’m not doing any press. ” Maybe she just wanted to be left alone with her salad. Maybe she was worried that I might drag her into yet another discussion about the #OscarSoWhite controversy. Or maybe, just then, she had stopped going through the motions.",0
17726,Sean Spicer Scrambles to Correct Hitler Comments in White House Press Briefing - Breitbart,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer scrambled to correct himself during the daily press briefing after arguing that Syrian dictator Bashar   was worse than Hitler. [“Hitler didn’t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons,” Spicer said, trying to express moral outrage for Assad’s use of chemical weapons on his own people. Reporters reacted instantly to Spicer’s remarks on Twitter, pointing out that Hitler gassed millions of Jews during his dictatorship.  As Spicer continued his briefing, ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega asked him to clarify his statement. “I think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,” Spicer replied, adding that he appreciated the opportunity to clarify his statement. As White House reporters murmured, Spicer reacted, stumbling as he referred to Hitler’s concentration camps as “the Holocaust Center. ” “He brought them into the Holocaust center, I understand that,” Spicer said. “I appreciate the clarification. ” Later, Spicer further clarified his remarks in a statement to reporters. “In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. However, I was trying to draw a contrast of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on innocent people,” he said. The White House later sent an additional and expanded statement to the press to further clarify Spicer’s previous statements:  “In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers,” he said. “Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable. ”",0
17727,Duterte Threatens to Bomb Islamic State Hostages: ’Better Not Get Yourselves Kidnapped’,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte repeatedly threatened to impose martial law on his nation and threatened to killed hostages taken by Islamic State affiliate Abu Sayyaf to eradicate the jihadist group. [Duterte, who has called the observance of human rights norms in the context of a war on terror “bullshit,” has launched a new initiative against Abu Sayyaf, a radical jihadist group primarily concentrated in Duterte’s native southern Mindanao island. Abu Sayyaf has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.  Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Eduardo Año announced Tuesday that the military had six months to eradicate the terrorist group completely. “As pronounced by our president, we have a very tall order to do. And we have six months to totally decimate the Abu Sayyaf group and the other terror groups here in Western Mindanao,” Año told reporters. Duterte himself said on Saturday that Abu Sayyaf terrorists should not assume that their lives will be spared if they use hostages as human shields. “They say, ‘What about the hostage?’ Sorry, collateral damage,” he said. “Then if they are blasted everyday [sic] that [kidnappings] would stop   …     so, better not get yourselves kidnapped. ” Duterte had previously vowed to “eat” Abu Sayyaf terrorists “in front of people.   …     I will eat you alive, raw. ” He has also admitted that he has “cousins” who fight for the Islamic State, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and other terrorist groups in the area. The Philippine military issued a report in October estimating that Abu Sayyaf had generated $7. 3 million in kidnapping ransoms between January and June of 2016. While the Philippines has an official policy of not paying ransom to Abu Sayyaf, foreigners have paid to free their relatives, primarily Indonesian nationals. Duterte announced his plan to ramp up the campaign against Abu Sayyaf after visiting the wake of a Philippine soldier killed in a Special Forces operation against the terrorist group, leaving behind a    daughter. The soldier was the nation’s first military loss of 2017. While announcing the new initiative to eradicate Abu Sayyaf, a spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) clarified that Duterte had not given any orders to disregard loss of hostage lives in operations against the terror group. The presidential office also clarified that Duterte’s repeated mentions of martial law did not mean he intended to impose it. “The president has categorically said no to martial law. He even made a pronouncement saying that martial law did not improve the lives of the Filipinos,” Duterte’s spokesman Martin Andanar said this week, calling it “misreporting” and “the height of journalistic irresponsibility” to claim this. “If I have to declare martial law, I will declare it  —   not about invasion, insurrection, not about danger. I will declare martial law to preserve my nation  —    period,” Duterte had said on Friday night. “I will declare martial law if I wanted to. No one will be able to stop me. ” Multiple Philippine senators have implored Duterte to leave martial law off the table in the case of Abu Sayyaf. “President Duterte should just shut up on these martial law threats and just govern our country the way any responsible leader should,” Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV said on Monday, according to the Philippine Star. “There is no basis to declare martial law,” said Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto. “No foreign army is steaming toward our shores to invade us. And as the President himself likes to brag, crime is down and the people are safe in their homes and communities. ”",0
17728,The Path To Total Dictatorship: America’s “Shadow Government” And Its Silent Coup,"By John W. Whitehead
“Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by Congress, the President, or the people . Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system … a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state…. 
The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization… It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government…. This group … is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable. ”— Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech 
Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law.
Say hello to America’s shadow government.
A corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry.
No matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government— also referred to as “The 7th Floor Group” —may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year.
To be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments.
The first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a “catastrophe.” COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstances—a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdown—to bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law.
Yet it is the second shadow government —also referred to as the Deep State—that poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason “we the people” have no real control over our government.
The Deep State, which “ operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power ,” makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government.
So who or what is the Deep State?
It’s the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army. It’s the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. It’s the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice.
It’s the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. It’s the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances, “a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government.” It’s what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as “ a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies ”: the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees.
It’s every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the government’s power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.
These are the key players that drive the shadow government.
This is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day.
Just consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office.
Domestic surveillance No matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether you’re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alike—including homes. Coupled with the nation’s growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.
Global spying The NSA’s massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion “ espionage empire ,” will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSA’s Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the government’s attempts at political and corporate espionage .
Roving TSA searches The American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars’ worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers’ valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country.
USA Patriot Act, NDAA America’s so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected.
Militarized police state Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones.
Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, America’s law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens.
SWAT team raids With more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession.
Domestic drones The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones.
School-to-prison pipeline The paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a “schoolhouse to jailhouse track” by imposing a “double dose” of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court.
Overcriminalization The government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided.
Privatized Prisons States will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations, resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit. In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years.
Endless wars America’s expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour). The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.
Are you getting the message yet?
The next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from what’s really going on.
As Lofgren reveals, this state within a state, “concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue ,” is a “hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.”
The Deep State not only holds the nation’s capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (“which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater”) and Silicon Valley.
This is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds.
It is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats.
As Lofgren concludes:
[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change … If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda.
In other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officials—elected and unelected alike—are allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished.
So the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that it’s just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by America’s shadow government.

17729,"In Reversal, Marco Rubio to Seek Re-election to Senate - The New York Times","Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Wednesday that he would run for   abandoning plans to pursue a more lucrative career in the private sector and jolting a competitive race that is crucial to Democrats’ plans to retake control of the Senate. Mr. Rubio, 45, who had told associates of his reluctance to give up the high profile and political power that a Senate seat offers, will enter the race with the formidable advantages of incumbency, national name recognition and strong ties to the Republican Party’s donor base. But he faces numerous hurdles, the most difficult of which may be his history of talking down the Senate as unfulfilling and frustrating at times. He is also coming off a bruising run for president that ended with an embarrassing   loss to Donald J. Trump in his home state on March 15  —   a contest that focused in no small part on Mr. Rubio’s frequent absence from the Senate and from his duties in Florida as he campaigned nationally. In a preview of what is expected to be one of the most bitter and most expensive Senate races in the country, within minutes of Mr. Rubio’s announcement on Wednesday, Democrats accused him of political opportunism and hypocrisy. Mr. Rubio is not expected to have much difficulty in the Republican primary, where a few contenders have withdrawn, but he still faces several   opponents. In November he will probably be challenged by Representative Patrick Murphy, a    congressman whom Republicans have mocked as young, overambitious and lacking in accomplishment  —   attributes that Democrats have pinned on Mr. Rubio. Political handicappers have rated the seat as a tossup, though Mr. Rubio’s decision to run probably improved Republicans’ chances of keeping the seat and their control of the Senate. “He has breathed new life into the G. O. P. ’s chances of holding the seat,” said Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report. “But that doesn’t mean that he has become anything more than the very slightest of favorites in November. ” Mr. Rubio had been flirting with the idea of running for weeks amid intense pressure from Republican Party leaders, who assured him of their full political and financial backing. He finally declared his intentions on Wednesday, and later issued a statement acknowledging his   by saying, “In politics, admitting you’ve changed your mind is not something most people like to do. ” “I have often said that the U. S. Senate can be a frustrating place. And it’s true,” he added. But he said the Senate had the vital role of checking the executive branch. As for Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio said: “If he is elected, we will need senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him. I’ve proven a willingness to do both. ” Mr. Rubio has told colleagues and advisers that he is considering running for president again, in 2020 or 2024. And as he and his team weighed a   campaign, they debated how well situated he would be in once more seeking the presidency from the Senate. A highly strategic politician with a restless personality, Mr. Rubio worried about a diminished profile if he faded from national politics into a career of paid speechmaking, his advisers said. But he also considered how being a senator would constrain him if he ultimately decided to seek the presidency again. His duties in Washington restricted his ability to raise money and to campaign as much as did some of his rivals who were not current office holders, such as former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. And he frequently had to defend himself against accusations that he was furthering his aspirations at the expense of his constituents. For those reasons, a senior adviser argued Wednesday that Mr. Rubio’s decision should not be seen as motivated by national ambitions. “Marco’s decision to seek   is about wanting to serve Florida, not about presidential politics,” said Todd Harris, who has served on Mr. Rubio’s campaigns for Senate and president. “Because if anything, from a 2020 political standpoint, this creates more problems than opportunities. ” That concern was borne out quickly on Wednesday. American Bridge, a Democratic opposition research group, accused Mr. Rubio of “cutting corners and avoiding hard work” and said, “Florida won’t   him to continue skipping out on the job. ” Indeed, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days, Mr. Rubio was especially concerned about the effect that Mr. Trump’s candidacy could have on his chances of winning. A poor performance in the November general election by Mr. Trump against Hillary Clinton in Florida, with its large Hispanic population, could hurt Mr. Rubio. Like a political hall of mirrors, Mr. Rubio’s decision abruptly scrambled the political alignments that had taken shape during the Republican primary fight. Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Rubio once belittled as a con artist with small hands and an orange face, has endorsed his bid, writing last month on Twitter, “Run Marco!” Mr. Rubio has since said that he would support Mr. Trump and even speak at the Republican National Convention if asked. And another rival who fought bitterly with Mr. Rubio during the primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, on Wednesday greeted Mr. Rubio’s announcement by calling him “a powerful voice for the American dream. ”",0
17730,Presidential Debate: Here’s What You Missed - The New York Times,"We analyzed in real time the second presidential debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. Plus, here are our fact checks and email exchanges with William Weld, the Libertarian   nominee. The second presidential debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton began with explosive attacks and ended with a measure of graciousness, as the two candidates complimented each other at the request of an audience member. Mrs. Clinton said she admired the Trump children, while Mr. Trump called his opponent “a fighter. ” But the candidates savaged each other on the way to the finish, with Mr. Trump struggling mightily for much of the evening to address questions about his finances, policy ideas and treatment of women. In several tense exchanges, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he had avoided paying federal income taxes for years, called his taped description of sexual assault “locker  ” and accused Mrs. Clinton of victimizing women and carrying “hate in her heart. ” He also said that as president he would appoint a special prosecutor to pursue Mrs. Clinton. In a comparatively subdued performance, Mrs. Clinton hewed close to the basic arguments of her campaign: That she is an experienced public servant and Mr. Trump is unfit to be president. Mr. Trump, she said, “owes our country an apology. ” • An audience member asked the candidates to name one positive quality in their opponent. Mrs. Clinton jumped in first. “I respect his children,” she said. “His children are incredibly able and devoted and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. ” Mr. Trump, expressing gratitude for the compliment, offered his own. “I will say this about Hillary: She doesn’t quit,” he said. “She doesn’t give up. I respect that. ” The debate ended, and the pair shook hands. • Pressed on the 2005 recording which he seemed to boast of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Trump said he was “not proud of” the behavior, saying that he had apologized to his family and the American people. But he disputed that the recording amounted to bragging about sexual assault, calling his comments “locker room talk. ” “I have great respect for women,” he said. “Nobody has more respect for women than I do,” he said, adding, “I was embarrassed by it. ” • Mrs. Clinton, responding to Mr. Trump’s remarks about the recording, said that while she disagreed with past Republican nominees, “I never questioned their fitness to serve. ” “Donald Trump is different,” she said. She suggested that, despite Mr. Trump’s insistence that the recording did not reflect his character, “It’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. ” • Mr. Trump turned the discussion of his lewd remarks on Mr. Clinton, arguing that his “words” did not compare to Mr. Clinton’s history with women. “If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse,” Mr. Trump said. Mrs. Clinton did not address the attacks on her husband. “He gets to run his campaign any way he chooses,” she said. She paraphrased Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic convention to describe her approach: “When they go low, you go high. ” • Addressing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump said that if he wins, “I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,” citing her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton pointedly said she could not spend all of her time   Mr. Trump, advising viewers to go to her website to see his falsehoods. She said it was a good thing that Mr. Trump was not in charge of the laws in the country. “Because you’d be in jail,” Mr. Trump shot back. Cheers could be heard from the crowd. • Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump was plainly trying to divert attention from his own campaign  —   “the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. ” Mr. Trump asked a moderator, Mr. Cooper, why he had not spent more time discussing Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. (The other moderator, Martha Raddatz, had in fact brought it up moments earlier.) Mr. Trump was unmoved. “Nice, one on three,” he said, suggesting the moderators were teaming up on him. • Asked about how to stop Islamophobia, Mr. Trump said, “You’re right about Islamophobia and that’s a shame. ” But he pivoted immediately to a discussion of what he called “radical Islamic terrorists,” citing the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. and the attacks on the World Trade Center, among other atrocities. Mrs. Clinton suggested Mr. Trump’s statements throughout the campaign had been destructive. “We are not at war with Islam,” she said. “It plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. ” • Pushed repeatedly to answer whether his proposed ban on Muslim immigration still stood, Mr. Trump deflected, saying his plans amounted to “extreme vetting” and accusing a moderator, Ms. Raddatz, of favoring Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton said it was “important for us, as a policy” not to ban people based on religion. “How do you do that?” she asked. “We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. ” • After Mr. Trump said again that he opposed the war in Iraq, despite past public statements that contradict him, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that “we have it on tape” that Mr. Trump had not been against the war before it began. “It’s not been debunked,” he insisted, turning the issue back on Mrs. Clinton. “You voted for it and you shouldn’t have. ” • A black audience member asked if the candidates could serve as president for “all Americans. ” Mr. Trump said that he could, before moving quickly to a standard of his stump speech: wondering aloud what some voters “have to lose. ” “It can’t get any worse,” he said. After Mr. Trump again criticized Mrs. Clinton’s Senate tenure, she noted that she won   by a wide margin. She added, “If you don’t vote for me, I still want to be your president. ” • Mrs. Clinton was asked about a remark, leaked from a private speech, in which she seemed to stress the importance of keeping both a public and a private position on given issues as a political figure. She said she was following the example of Abraham Lincoln as he sought to convince lawmakers to ally with him. “Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln,” Mr. Trump said. “Honest Abe never lied. ” • Mrs. Clinton cited the specter of Russian hackers seeking to influence the election with strategic leaks, which she suggested were intended to help Mr. Trump. “Believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected,” she said. (She has spoken often of Mr. Trump’s kind words for Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president.) Mr. Trump claimed ignorance. “Maybe there is no hacking,” he said, adding, “I know nothing about Russia. ” • Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump tussled over taxes, touching on Mr. Trump’s efforts to avoid paying them given past losses. He was giving “zero for our vets, zero for our military,” she said. “That is wrong. ” Asked directly if Mr. Trump had used a    loss in the   to avoid paying taxes, he replied, “Of course I do. Of course I do. ” He accused Mrs. Clinton of not doing enough as a senator to reform the tax code. • Asked by an audience member about coarseness in the presidential race, Mrs. Clinton said it was “very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we’re good. ” She reminded the crowd of her campaign slogan, “Stronger Together. ” Mr. Trump, who before the debate appeared with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, said he broadly agreed with Mrs. Clinton. “I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country,” he said. • In response to a question on the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump called the program “a disaster. ” “You know it, we all know it,” he said. Mrs. Clinton was asked about recent remarks from her husband, in which he appeared to criticize Mr. Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He clarified what he meant,” Mrs. Clinton said. “If we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system,” she said. “But we have an   system. ” • Asked about the humanitarian crisis in Syria, Mrs. Clinton called the situation “catastrophic,” pivoting to criticize Russia and accusing the country’s leadership again of favoring Mr. Trump for president. Asked the same question, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton “talks tough against Russia, but our nuclear program has fallen way behind. ” When Ms. Raddatz, a moderator, brought up the remarks of Mr. Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, on Syria, Mr. Trump said, “He and I haven’t spoken and I disagree. ” • Mr. Trump attacked Mrs. Clinton for saying that half of Trump supporters could be placed in a “basket of deplorables. ” “Believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Cooper asked Mr. Trump if he had the discipline to lead, citing a recent “Twitter missive” in which he advised followers, without evidence, to “check out” a sex tape featuring a former pageant winner whose weight he had insulted in the 1990s. Mr. Trump denied that he had mentioned a sex tape. He also defended his favored social media practice: “Tweeting happens to be a   form of communication,” he said. “I’m not   of it. ” • Asked about the Supreme Court, Mrs. Clinton said she wanted “a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a women’s right to choose. ” Mr. Trump said he hoped to find judges “very much in the mold of Justice Scalia,” citing a list he has compiled of possible selections. • Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump took the stage without shaking hands.",0
17731,"As Support for E.U. Flags Elsewhere, Bulgaria Sees Its Benefits - The New York Times","SOFIA, Bulgaria  —   With Bulgaria in the grips of a bank run in the summer of 2014, Lyubomir Vassilev was panicking. Unemployed and living off a compensation package from a workplace accident, he had lost access to his bank account and joined others in street protests when a troubled lender went into bankruptcy, setting off a financial  —   and political  —   crisis. Months later, with his parents having had to borrow money from relatives to help him survive, Mr. Vassilev finally got his $6, 000 back. “After the bank went bankrupt,” he said, “I lost trust in the banking system. ” Mr. Vassilev blamed Bulgaria’s leaders and, like many of his compatriots, attributed the resolution of the crisis to the European Union. Across much of Western Europe, critics complain of distant and unfeeling technocrats in Brussels who enforce arcane rules to the letter, with little understanding of local nuances and needs. Britain’s vote in June to leave the bloc struck a stinging blow against regional unity at a time when confidence was already flagging in the European Union. But Mr. Vassilev and his fellow citizens paint a different picture  —   one of regional officials who hold domestic authorities to account, set higher standards and are more trustworthy than their local counterparts. Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, along with Romania. At the time, polling indicated that a slim majority of its population was in favor of membership, hopeful that it would strengthen the Balkan country’s economy and political institutions. In the years since, Bulgaria has remained the bloc’s poorest member state, with a per capita gross domestic product about half the regional average. Still, incomes have risen sharply, billions have been poured into infrastructure and surveys show Bulgarians are still convinced that joining was a step in the right direction. “Bulgaria has clearly benefited since it joined the European Union,” said Ruslan Stefanov, an analyst for the Center for the Study of Democracy, a   think tank. “We’re richer, with a wider choice in terms of jobs and education across the bloc. ” The average Bulgarian now earns 440 euros, or about $470, a month, twice as much as when the country joined. Trade has increased significantly, as companies have taken advantage of membership in the bloc’s single market. Exports to European Union countries have doubled in the years since Bulgaria joined, and sales to other member states now account for   of all exports. There have been other benefits. Tens of thousands of Bulgarians are studying elsewhere in the   European Union  —   a greater proportion of its population than comparably sized member states like Austria, the Czech Republic or Hungary (this is partly a result, however, of the poor quality of Bulgaria’s education system). Even more Bulgarians work and travel throughout the bloc, taking advantage of the region’s free movement of labor. That, according to Mr. Stefanov, has helped keep unemployment relatively low at around 8 percent  —   if Bulgarians cannot find jobs at home, he noted, they look abroad. The European Union has also pumped in billions of euros in aid to help the country build new highways and roads, develop agriculture and rural areas, and protect the environment. Regular reports published by the European Commission on corruption and organized crime  —   persistent problems in Bulgaria  —   have kept local politicians on their toes (though Sofia has made little progress when it comes to uprooting graft and reforming its judiciary). “The fact that Bulgaria is an E. U. member and there are a number of reforms on the way makes us believe that Bulgaria is definitely on the right track,” said Olivier Marquette, managing director for the Bulgarian operations of AES, a power company with its headquarters in Arlington, Va. AES began considering projects in Bulgaria in 2000, when the country was still only a candidate to join the European Union. In the years since, it has invested around €1. 6 billion in three projects here  —   a   thermal power plant, a wind farm and a waste disposal center. It has not always been smooth: It took two years to resolve a dispute with the   utility company, which owed €300 million. Mr. Marquette nevertheless says AES is happy with its bet on the country. A combination of European Union aid, guidance and oversight has meant that within Bulgaria, trust in the bloc and its institutions remains strong, and markedly higher than in most of the rest of the bloc. About 49 percent of Bulgarians say they trust the E. U. compared with 33 percent who do not, according to a 2016 survey by Eurobarometer, which carries out polling in the region. That is the   level of trust of any member state (behind Lithuania and Malta) and around twice as much trust as Bulgarians have in their own government, public institutions or legal system. “People don’t recognize the state as theirs and thus see Brussels as the external power on their side,” said Marin Lessenski, director of the European Policies and Civic Participation Program at the Open Society Institute. The heft of Brussels came into play in 2014. In June of that year, Corporate Commercial Bank, or K. T. B. experienced mass withdrawals after a feud between a local politician and the lender’s largest shareholder. As confidence flagged, a fifth of K. T. B. ’s assets were pulled within a week, and the bank was taken into central bank supervision. The panic soon spread and the next month, Bulgaria’s central bank said it would begin bankruptcy proceedings against K. T. B. Mr. Vassilev was one of many account holders whose lives were thrown into chaos. Lured by the promise of high interest rates, he instead lost access to his savings for months. More than two years on, an investigation into K. T. B. ’s collapse continues. “The mere existence of such a bank indicates some serious deficiencies of regulations and transparency in Bulgaria,” said Dimitar Bechev, the director of the European Policy Institute in Sofia. The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, and the European Banking Authority, a regional financial watchdog, repeatedly called on Sofia to fulfill a government guarantee on depositors’ savings. Both opened investigations into whether Bulgarian authorities had breached regional law by delaying payouts. Facing the prospect of formal charges, the government finally began paying back account holders in December 2014 (both inquiries have since been closed). Businesses also benefit from Brussels’s acting as a bulwark against Bulgaria’s politicians, as well as being able to gain access to the region’s single market, able to export their wares without restriction to the rest of the bloc. In recent years, several major manufacturers of vehicle components  —   with clients including Volkswagen, Daimler, Mercedes and Renault  —   have set up shop in Bulgaria. The number of companies in the auto parts sector has tripled since Bulgaria joined the European Union, now numbering around 120 businesses, and last year the industry accounted for 3. 5 percent of the country’s economy. A small   community is also being built, and two   funds have invested more than €20 million in around 200 companies over the last four years, thanks to a European   initiative. The businesses that have received funding include an online marketplace connecting small farms with potential customers a toymaker whose products use energy generated by children playing with them to activate lights and sounds and a company that has developed   and organization software. It is not just fledgling enterprises that see advantages  —   older ones do, too. “Since we joined the E. U. the country has become a more stable and less risky place to do business,” said Manol Peykov, who manages his family’s publishing house in Bulgaria’s   city, Plovdiv. “If it weren’t for E. U. directives and rules, Bulgarian politicians would be untouchable. ”",0
17732,New French Law Makes It Illegal To Contact Employees After Work Hours,"By Amanda Froelich at trueactivist.com
The new “right to disconnect” law mandates that a company with 50 employees or more cannot email an employee after typical work hours.
If you’ve ever been with friends or family members over the weekend then received an urgent email from work, you’re aware of the dread that fills your stomach and causes your mood to dip. Being unable to fully disconnect from work can have mental and physical health implications, which is why unwarranted contact by the workplace is soon to become illegal in France.

Already, the country gives its employees 30 days off a year and 16 weeks of full-paid family leave; this latest initiative is only making France more popular. According to BBC News , the new “right to disconnect” law will mandate that a company with 50 employees or more cannot email an employee after typical work hours. The amendment is largely a result of studies showing that people have an increasingly difficult time distancing themselves from the workplace.
Good relays that the law seeks to make sure the French citizens are able to fully enjoy their time off. Said Benoit Hamon of the French National Assembly:",0
17733,Wall Street Bonuses Are Expected to Sink for 3rd Straight Year - The New York Times,"Wall Street bonuses are expected to decline for the third consecutive year, reflecting a period of busted mergers, limited trading activity and muted hedge fund returns. The payouts are projected to be from 5 to 10 percent lower this year, according to an annual report to be released on Monday by Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm. Bonuses fell about the same amount last year from 2014. The projection confirms a report last month by the New York State comptroller that said firms set aside 7 percent less for bonuses through the first half of this year compared with last year. While mergers and acquisitions have been active (and even hit record levels in 2015) the bankers who advise on the deals get paid largely when the deals are completed. This year, antitrust officials thwarted a number of large mergers, including Halliburton’s $35 billion bid for Baker Hughes, as well as the consolidations of the health insurance companies Anthem and Cigna, and Aetna and Humana. Pfizer and Allergan abandoned their enormous deal after the Treasury Department announced new tax rules, killing  $200 million in fees that the bankers were supposed to collect. In addition, choppy markets damped stock trading activity and prevented skittish companies from making their debuts as public companies, except for a few prominent offerings. Investors dumped hedge fund holdings because of poor returns and high fees. Alan Johnson, the founder of Johnson Associates, describes this pattern as a “malaise,” and one that is unlikely to reverse itself anytime soon. “I don’t see it changing for the next year or two, either,” he said in a phone interview. “The pressures in the industry on profit and fees are going to continue, and I think pay will likely continue to decline in 2017. ” Even more than in past years, competitors and clients pressured banks to reduce fees, as there was more disclosure around what companies can and do charge clients, Mr. Johnson said. In March, the state comptroller’s office said that the average bonus for securities industry employees in the New York City area in 2015 was $146, 200, while the average salary was $388, 000. Both figures declined from 2014, but the compensation was still far higher than in any other industry in the area. According to the Johnson Associates report, some of the deepest cuts in bonuses this year will be among investment banking underwriting, hedge fund and equities professionals. Equity underwriting bonuses could be more than 20 percent lower compared with 2015. Within sales and trading, Johnson Associates said that there were lower levels of client activity, especially in equities, meaning bonuses could be from 5 percent to 15 percent lower than last year. Johnson Associates expects merger advisory bonuses to be about 10 percent lower. Nevertheless, there are more deals in the wings. Research by PitchBook found that through the third quarter of 2016, there was a record number of transactions valued at $10 billion or more. During the first nine months of the year, 31 such deals were signed, compared with 23 in all of 2015 and 16 in 2014. If this year’s deals have better luck with regulators, banks could enjoy a payout later this year or next. Private equity bonuses will be little changed this year, according to the report, as firms were able to increase their assets under management but experienced “mediocre returns. ” Retail and consumer banking was not quite as bleak. There, bonuses could actually gain as much as 5 percent over the previous year. That area of finance has benefited from deposit and loan growth as the economy recovers. Johnson Associates has been publishing its report annually for about 15 years. The consultants pore through public filings and interview from 30 to 50 clients to produce the results. Some of the challenges facing banks could soon reverse if interest rates go up meaningfully. With   rates for almost a decade, banks have been able to lend money inexpensively but with lower returns than they received historically. If that dynamic reverses, it could be a boon to the industry, as long as the broader economy remains intact. “It could be water on the fields for many of these businesses in isolation,” Mr. Johnson said. “Now the caveat is, what happens to the economy when rates go up?” Economic challenges are the reason European bank employees are worse off than American ones. And Britain’s vote over the summer to leave the European Union, known as “Brexit,” did not help European bank employees’ situation, Mr. Johnson said. A portion of a banker’s total compensation is based on how well his or her company has been doing in the stock market. The stock prices of some European banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, have declined about 50 percent each over the last year as they have grappled with government fines, increasing competition and greater regulation. Executives at those banks and others are talking about how to refocus their businesses to become more profitable. In New York, profit was not an issue. The securities industry generated $9. 3 billion in profit during the first half of 2016, the comptroller’s report showed, on track to surpass the $14. 3 billion made in all of last year. But with thousands of job cuts and lower compensation for those in securities, it has become clear that the focus of those profits is primarily preservation, rather than making bankers wealthier.",0
17734,Duterte Tells US Businesses to Quit Whining or GTFO,"In the name of the people. 
This is the only morality. 
Philippine Star : 
If his scathing and vulgar comments are causing consternation and worry among American investors and businessmen, President Duterte said yesterday they can always pack up and leave. 
Duterte was reacting to pronouncements from visiting US State Department Assistant Secretary Daniel Russel that his conflicting statements were causing jitters among US businessmen. 
âGo ahead. Pack your bags. We will sacrifice. We will recover, I assure you. We will live and survive. We have gone through the worst of times in this planet,â the President said in a press briefing at the NAIA Terminal 2 shortly before his departure for Japan. 
Russel on Friday said Duterteâs recent statements â especially his âseparationâ from the US â have ushered in a âclimate of uncertainty.â 
âThe succession of controversial statements, comments and a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippinesâ intentions have created consternation in a number of countries,â Russel told reporters Monday after meeting Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. in Manila. 
âNot only in mine and not only among governments, but also growing concern in other communities, in the expat Filipino community, in corporate boardrooms as well.â 
Duterte called the US official gago or stupid for asking him to tone down his anti-US rhetoric, saying it was Washington that started the rift between them. 
âI had a talk with Secretary Yasay and hereâs a guy his name is Russel, if you can just tone down our rhetoric. But I was not the one who started this rift. They are the ones who started it,â the President told reporters. 
He noted that during the campaign, Ambassador Philip Goldberg got his goat when the diplomat reacted to his joke about the rape-slay of an Australian missionary during a 1989 prison riot in Davao City. 
âRemember, it all started during the election. I made a comment in narration of an actual event which happened in Davao and which was covered by all media outlets there. The ambassador said something not very nice,â he pointed out. 
âYou are not supposed to do that because in an election of another country, you should be careful with your mouth,â he said, addressing Goldberg. 
KIKE Goldberg. 
In the final stretch of the campaign, Duterte joked about the rape and murder of Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill during a prison riot. He said Hamill looked like an actress and as mayor âhe should have been first.â His remarks drew condemnation from several quarters, particularly womenâs groups. 
The rising death toll in the Duterte administrationâs war on drugs has sparked concerns among Western countries, particularly the US and the European Union. 
For Duterte, Russelâs statement was an insult. âI said donât do that to me. Every time they threaten us, including the EU (European Union), they think they are brighter than us,â Duterte said. 
âThen they will say âbe careful, we will put you in prison.â Son of a w***e. Go ahead.â 
Duterte maintained he would never be subservient to the interests of the US or any other foreign country. 
âYou know before we can move forward, Mr. America, there are things â so many things â the massacre of the Filipinos before. These are historical hurts that would never go away,â he said. He had earlier called the attention of the US to the massacre by its soldiers of hundreds of Muslims in the early 20th century. 
âI am not also a lapdog of any country. Only the Filipinos can treat me as a lapdog. Period. Nothing else. 
âDo not make us dogs. Do not. As if I am a dog with a leash and then you throw bread far away that I cannot reach.â 
Duterte had previously branded US President Barack Obama a âson of a b***hâ and told him to âgo to hell.â 
Duterte also hit Russel for supposedly being too nervous about his recent state visit to China. 
âNow, what did I tell to China? I went there, just being nice,â the President said. âI am just a small person. How can I cause distress? You are nervous because you are guilty.â 
Duterte said his state visit to China last week triggered a lot of speculations. 
âNapakabilis ng malisya ng mga gago (These fools were quick to think maliciously). We did not talk about anything in China except to cook siopao and chopsuey,â the President said in jest. 
Duterte also scored Goldbergâs statement that the US remains committed to defend the Philippines. 
âThere will be no wars anymore. Who will wage war with us? China? What will they get? Japan? What defense? They want to talk about the boogeyman war,â the President said. 
âStop that s**t. Nobody is interested in wars anymore. And if there is a fight, you fight your wars. Do not include mine.” 
Pure shitlordery. 
So great to see. 
And just for those who don’t get it: Duterte is not “anti-American,” he is anti-ZOGmerican. Filipinos have no problem with the American people, they have a problem with being slaves to international kike financial institutions and then, as already enslaved through massive debt programs and foreign ownership of infrastructure, being told by the Jew globalists that they’re not allowed to slaughter drug dealers because it’s mean. 
Duterte is doing what every leader should be doing by default: defending the people from enemies foreign and domestic. 
He is creating a new model of governance in the post-industrial era.",0
17735,Pussy Riot Released The Perfect Nasty Woman’s Answer To Trump (VIDEO),"Pussy Riot Released The Perfect Nasty Woman’s Answer To Trump (VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey on October 26, 2016 Subscribe 
At the third presidential debate last week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made the mistake of calling Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman.” 
Just a couple of weeks ago, Trump was caught in some hot audio from an Access Hollywood bus in 2005. He famously said that he can “grab them by the p***y” because he is a star. 
The Russian band, Pussy Riot, has released a new song in response to Trump’s comment. It is called “Straight Outta Vagina.” It is a very feminist and body-positive song. As women, we should all be proud of our bodies. Perverts like Donald Trump love to abuse us, but we can be stronger. 
Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova told The Guardian : “This song could be considered an answer to Trump. But I believe the idea of powerful female sexuality is much bigger than any populist megalomaniac man … Vagina is bigger than Trump.” 
NSFW: Graphic content. 
Here are some of the lyrics: “Does your vagina have a brand? / Let your vagina start a band / If your vagina lands in prison / Then the world is gonna listen “My vagina is tough and dangerous / Shaking up the major labels / Vagina gonna take the stage / Cuz vagina’s got a lot to say “My pussy my pussy / Is sweet just like a cookie / It goes to work / It makes the beats / It’s CEO, no rookie / From senator to bookie / We run this shit, go lookie / “Y ou can turn any page, any race, any age / From Russia to the states / We tearing up the place.” 
I’ll warn you, the song is very catchy. Just watch who you sing it around. Rapists and abusers like Trump don’t realize just how strong we women are. This song is a great way to celebrate our bodies. 
Here is the video :

17736,"After Warily Circling, Trump and Angela Merkel Prepare to Meet - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   When President Trump welcomes Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to the Oval Office on Tuesday, their meeting will take on a symbolism unlike any he has held so far: The great disrupter confronts the last defender of the liberal world order. Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel are poles apart on issues like immigration and trade they have circled each other warily since the American presidential election. But both sides, officials said, are determined not to let this first meeting devolve into a clash of competing worldviews. Ms. Merkel has been studying Mr. Trump’s speeches to get an insight into the new president’s thinking. American officials said Mr. Trump would ask the chancellor for advice on how to deal with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom, after dozens of meetings over her 11 years in power, she knows better than any other leader in the West. The threat posed by Russia to Europe could give Ms. Merkel and Mr. Trump a sliver of common ground. The Trump administration is demanding that Germany and its other NATO allies increase their military budgets, a message the Germans appear to be taking to heart, even if their spending still falls well short of what the United States would like. “You might almost call it serendipity,” said Josef Joffe, the publisher and editor of the German newspaper Die Zeit. “Just as Trump is pushing the Europeans to shape up and pay up, the Germans have quite independently realized they are facing a strategic threat on their eastern border. ” But if Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel find common cause on NATO, they risk new tensions over trade. Administration officials have railed against Germany’s huge trade surplus with the United States. One of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, Peter Navarro, recently accused Germany of exploiting its trading partners by depressing the euro to boost its exports. Ms. Merkel plans to push back hard on what the Germans view as blatant protectionism. She is bringing a delegation of corporate chiefs from BMW, Siemens and other German companies with major American operations. They will talk about apprenticeship programs to train American workers. “The thing she’ll come back with is, ‘Do you know that there are thousands of Americans working for German companies in the U. S.?’ ” said Jackson Janes, the president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. Few leaders have displayed Ms. Merkel’s adroitness in handling swaggering, strongman leaders, whether it is Mr. Putin or Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. But in Mr. Trump, “she’s up against a different kind of   guy,” Mr. Joffe said. “Here is a guy who talked in the campaign as if he was going to put the ax to the liberal international world order. ” In an interview with a British newspaper in January, Mr. Trump said Ms. Merkel had made a “catastrophic” mistake in letting tens of thousands of refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East enter Germany. “I respect her and I like her, but I think it was a mistake,” he said. “People make mistakes, but I think it was a really big mistake. ” He declined to say whether he would support Ms. Merkel in running for a fourth term as chancellor  —   a position repeated by a senior administration official who briefed reporters about her visit on Friday. It was a stark contrast to Ms. Merkel’s relationship with President Barack Obama, one of his closest with any foreign leader. Ms. Merkel, however, also managed to have a productive relationship with President George W. Bush, even though he, like Mr. Trump, was deeply unpopular in Germany in the aftermath of the Iraq war. Some experts said that could be a blueprint for how she approached Mr. Trump. “It’s a tightrope walk,” said Jeffrey Rathke, the deputy director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “She needs a strong   relationship. ” But, he added, she “doesn’t want to be too close to the U. S. administration. ” Ms. Merkel has studiously avoided a confrontation with Mr. Trump. She said she would judge him by his actions rather than his words. And she has dismissed as absurd the suggestion that she was the last bastion of a liberal world order  —   a label that would put her at odds with Mr. Trump. When Mr. Trump first announced his temporary travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries in January, Ms. Merkel patiently explained to him over the phone that the Geneva Conventions oblige countries to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds. In their briefing on Friday, White House officials said they expected a “robust” exchange between Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel on issues ranging from the European Union and the financing of NATO to trade and the campaign against the Islamic State. There has been an unusual degree of preparation for this meeting, given that it is not expected to produce any significant announcements on economic or security issues. For the Germans, however, the Trump White House remains something of a riddle.   ideological players, like Mr. Navarro and the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, vie with more conventional, realist ones, like Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser. Mr. Navarro, for example, complains that Germany uses unequal treatment of a tax rebate on its exports to disadvantage American exports. Mr. Bannon told a visiting German diplomat that the White House viewed the European Union as a “flawed construct” and preferred to negotiate with Germany and other European countries one on one. The problem is that Germany, as a member of the European Union, cannot legally negotiate its own trade agreements with the United States. On Friday, another senior administration official who did not want to be identified conceded that point, saying that any new trade deal with Germany would have to be negotiated with the European Union. But that official also said Mr. Trump would raise Germany’s persistent trade surplus with Ms. Merkel. The chancellor is likely to make a fervent case for the European Union, not just as an economic bloc but also as a political project that has brought peace and prosperity to Europe. White House officials said Friday that Mr. Trump would not be shy about his views of Brussels, but that the United States wanted to keep a strong partnership with it. Perhaps the most delicate topic for the two leaders will be Russia. Questions about link between Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia continue to hang over him, while Ms. Merkel is preparing to run for   in a Germany that is fearful that the Russian government will meddle in its campaign like it did in the United States. German officials are encouraged that Mr. Trump has so far not radically tilted American policy toward Moscow. But they point nervously to Breitbart, the   website until recently run by Mr. Bannon, which is setting up an outpost in Germany and could seek to influence the vote. Russia, they note, can cause plenty of mischief, even without help from the United States. “I think they’ll skirt around the Russia issue,” Mr. Janes of Johns Hopkins said. “They’ll stay at 30, 000 feet. ”",0
17737,Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30? - The New York Times,"Editor’s note: This article first ran on July 13, 2012, but we’re running it again because the topic is timeless. IT was like one of those magical   scenes out of a Hollywood   without the “rom. ” I met Brian, a New York screenwriter, a few years ago through work, which led to dinner with our wives and friend chemistry that was instant and obvious. We liked the same songs off Dylan’s “Blonde on Blonde,” the same lines from “Chinatown. ” By the time the green curry shrimp had arrived, we were finishing each other’s sentences. Our wives were forced to cut in: “Hey, guys, want to come up for air?” As Brian and his wife wandered off toward the No. 2 train afterward, it crossed my mind that he was the kind of guy who might have ended up a groomsman at my wedding if we had met in college. That was four years ago. We’ve seen each other four times since. We are “friends,” but not quite friends. We keep trying to get over the hump, but life gets in the way. Our story is not unusual. In your 30s and 40s, plenty of new people enter your life, through work, children’s play dates and, of course, Facebook. But actual close friends  —   the kind you make in college, the kind you call in a crisis  —   those are in shorter supply. As people approach midlife, the days of youthful exploration, when life felt like one big blind date, are fading. Schedules compress, priorities change and people often become pickier in what they want in their friends. No matter how many friends you make, a sense of fatalism can creep in: the period for making B. F. F. ’s, the way you did in your teens or early 20s, is pretty much over. It’s time to resign yourself to situational friends: K. O. F. ’s (kind of friends)  —   for now. But often, people realize how much they have neglected to restock their pool of friends only when they encounter a big life event, like a move, say, or a divorce. That thought struck Lisa Degliantoni, an educational   executive in Chicago, a few months ago when she was planning her 39th birthday party. After a move from New York to Evanston, Ill. she realized that she had 857 Facebook friends and 509 Twitter followers, but still did not know if she could fill her party’s invitation list. “I did an inventory of the phases of my life where I’ve managed to make the most friends, and it was definitely high school and my first job,” she said. After a divorce in his 40s, Robert Glover, a psychotherapist in Bellevue, Wash. realized that his roster of friends had quietly atrophied for years as he focused on career and family. “All of a sudden, with your wife out of the picture, you realize you’re lonely,” said Dr. Glover, now 56. “I’d go to salsa lessons. Instead of trying to pick up the women, I’d introduce myself to the men: ‘Hey, let’s go get a drink.’ ” In studies of peer groups, Laura L. Carstensen, a psychology professor who is the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity in California, observed that people tended to interact with fewer people as they moved toward midlife, but that they grew closer to the friends they already had. Basically, she suggests, this is because people have an internal alarm clock that goes off at big life events, like turning 30. It reminds them that time horizons are shrinking, so it is a point to pull back on exploration and concentrate on the here and now. “You tend to focus on what is most emotionally important to you,” she said, “so you’re not interested in going to that cocktail party, you’re interested in spending time with your kids. ” As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity repeated, unplanned interactions and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added. In the professional world, “proximity” is hard to maintain, as work colleagues are reassigned or move on to new jobs. Last year, Erica Rivinoja, a writer on the NBC series “Up All Night,” became close with a woman, Jen, when they worked together on a pilot. Almost instantly, they knew each other’s exercise schedules and food preferences. Jen could sense when Ms. Rivinoja needed a jolt of caffeine, and without asking would be there with an iced tea. “But as soon as the pilot was over, it was hard to be as close without that constant    interaction,” said Ms. Rivinoja, 35. They can occasionally carve out time for a quick gin and tonic, she said, but “there aren’t those long afternoons which bleed into evenings hanging out at the beach and then heading to a bar. ” The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues, Dr. Adams said. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins. Differences in professional status and income also complicate matters. “It really does get weird when your friends are making tons more than you, or tons less,” said Adriane Duckworth, a former marketing executive now working as an artist in Hamilton, Ontario. She recently welcomed a promising new couple into her circle of friends, but they quickly turned people off with their obsession with money. “At our wedding, other friends of ours who were seated with them actually complained to us afterward about the couple who was asking everyone how much money they made,” said Ms. Duckworth, 32. “People who made less felt uncomfortable discussing it, and people who made the same or more just felt it was weird to talk about it so nonchalantly. ” Once people start coupling up, the challenges only increase. Making friends with other couples “is like matchmaking for two,” said Kara Baskin, a journalist who works in Boston. “Not only are you worrying about whether the other woman likes you, you’re also worrying if her husband likes you, if your husband likes her, if your husband likes him. ” Not long ago, she invited her husband’s new work buddy over for dinner with his wife. But the wife was visibly unimpressed by Ms. Baskin’s   home (they had just moved in) and   spaghetti dinner. “It was basically clear that his wife had been cajoled into attending,” said Ms. Baskin, 33. “She settled on to our rickety Ikea kitchen chairs like she was lowering herself into a coal mine. ” The couple departed quickly after dessert. The next day at work, the husband made an excuse about his wife being tired. “But it was unspoken that we wouldn’t be seeking their company again,” Ms. Baskin said. ADDING children to the mix muddles things further. Suddenly, you are surrounded by a new circle of parent friends  —   but the emotional ties can be tenuous at best, as the comedian Louis C. K. related in one   routine: “I spend whole days with people, I’m like, I never would have hung out with you, I didn’t choose you. Our children chose each other. Based on no criteria, by the way. They’re the same size. ” Even when parent friends develop a bond, the resulting friendships can be fleeting  —   and subject to the whims of the children themselves. Caryl Lyons, an event planner in Danville, Calif. and her husband found a budding friendship with a   couple hit a roadblock when their young sons, who had been close friends, drifted apart. When the families planned a barbecue together, her son would say, “Can I have my other friends over?” said Ms. Lyons, 44. External factors are not the only hurdle. After 30, people often experience internal shifts in how they approach friendship.   gives way to   so you become pickier about whom you surround yourself with, said Marla Paul, the author of the 2004 book “The Friendship Crisis: Finding, Making, and Keeping Friends When You’re Not a Kid Anymore. ” “The bar is higher than when we were younger and were willing to meet almost anyone for a margarita,” she said. Manipulators, drama queens, egomaniacs: a lot of them just no longer make the cut. Thayer Prime, a    strategy consultant who lives in London, has even developed a playful   scale (100 being “best friend forever”). In her mind, she starts to dock new friend candidates as they begin to display annoying or disloyal behavior. Nine times out of 10, she said, her new friends end up from 30 to 60, or little more than an acquaintance. “You meet someone really nice, but if they don’t return a call, drop to 90, if they don’t return two calls, that’s an immediate 50,” she said. “If they’re late to something in the first month, that’s another 10 off. ” (But people can move up the scale with nice behavior, too, she added.) Having been hardened by experience, many people develop a more fatalistic view of friendship. “When you’re younger, you define what it really means to be friends in a more serious way,” said my screenwriter friend, Brian. (His full name is Brian Koppelman, and he wrote and is a   of “Solitary Man,” a 2010 film starring Michael Douglas about a   man trying to reconnect with friends and family.) “My ideas of friendship were built by ‘The Godfather’ and ‘Diner,’ ” he said. “Your friends were your brothers, and anything but total loyalty at all costs meant excommunication. As you get older, that model becomes unrealistic. ” By that point, you have been through your share of wearying or failed relationships. You have come to grips with the responsibilities of juggling work, family and existing friends, so you become more wary about making yourself emotionally available to new people. “You’re more keenly aware of the downside,” said Mr. Koppelman, 46. “You’re also more keenly aware of your own capacity to disappoint. ” “I haven’t really changed my standards for what it means to actually be friends,” he concluded. “It’s just that I use the word ‘friends’ more loosely. Making the real kind, the brother kind, is much harder now. ” Some, like Ms. Degliantoni, the   executive, simply downsize their expectations. “I take an extremely efficient approach and seek out   folks to fill very specific needs,” she said of her current strategy. “I have a cocktail friend and a book friend and a parenting friend and several basketball friends and a neighbor friend and a workout friend. ” “It’s much easier filling in those gaps in my life,” she added, “than doing an exhaustive approach for a new friend. ” Or, they hit rock bottom and turn back the clock to their breathlessly social 20s. After a move to New York in his 30s, Dave Cervini, a radio station executive, was so lonely that he would walk his cat in Central Park, hoping to stoke conversations. Finding only curious stares, he decided to start the New York Social Network, an activities group for people to find friends by hanging out at Yankees games or   mixers. The company now counts 2, 000 members, most in their 30s. He considers 200 of them close friends. “It takes courage for people to take the first step,” he said. “Hopefully, I make it easier, having been there myself. ”  In that spirit, I recently called Brian. We joked about our inability to find time to hang out, and made a dinner date at the next available opening. It is three months from now.",0

17739,Comment on 4 Fascinating Things Quantum Physics Does In Nature by para kazanmak,"4 Fascinating Things Quantum Physics Does In Nature By Michael Danielson on November 9, 2015 Subscribe 
Quantum Physics is a subject that is often discarded by everyday people as too esoteric or too new-agey (depending on which kind of QM you read about) to be useful in everyday life. We have all been introduced to QM as “the science of stuff too small to really matter to everyday life.” But recent developments in biological science have revealed that life itself puts powerful quantum mechanical principles to use as an everyday part of its function. “Quantum Biology” is one of the forefronts of modern science. Quantum Physics in Bird Navigation 
We’ve known for decades that many species of birds migrate each year, most famously from north to south as the temperature drops in the temperate zones. But how they navigate during those migrations has always been a mystery. The magnetic field the Earth produces is terribly weak compared to the other forces that act on an animal’s body. Furthermore, biologists knew from studies that birds’ compasses are light-dependent, and that they detect magnetic fields relative to the surface of the planet, not the poles. 
It wasn’t until the rule of quantum entanglement developed that we began to develop a theory of how bird compasses worked. Without delving too far into the science, the theory is that bird’s eyes contain a protein that itself contains millions of entangled electrons. When light enters the bird’s eye, it knocks some of those entangled electrons loose, but leaves others attached to the protein molecules. 
The “loose” electrons are much more dramatically affected by the Earth’s magnetic field than the bound ones are, but the entanglement means the bound electrons move the same way. The subsequent “wiggling” of the protein that the bound electrons are attached to can be perceived by the bird’s retina and translated by its brain into a “picture” of the magnetic field it’s flying through. Quantum Physics in Photosynthesis 
Plants, it seems, use quantum mechanics for one of the most important aspects of life on Earth: turning sunlight into the power that life runs on. The biggest mystery of photosynthesis for as long as we’ve understood it is “how is photosynthesis so efficient?” Our best machines achieve efficiencies of upwards of 30% — photosynthetic transfer of energy is upwards of 99% efficient. There are so many directions a photon could travel once it gets captured by a molecule of chlorophyll that science had no idea how such a high proportion of photons made it to the “reaction center” where they were used in building new molecules. 
The answer turns out to be quantum coherence , the ability of a quantum particle to act like a wave until something “decoheres” it. The theory is that photons enter plant cells, are captured by chlorophyll, and rather than traveling in a particle-like manner, they travel as waves , and the “reaction center” has the ability to decohere those waves back into particle (photon) form. Quantum Physics In Your Digestion 
Enzymes are catalysts — chemicals that trigger other chemical creations. But for decades, scientists have been unable to determine how enzymes can speed up reactions so much: up to a trillion times faster than they would naturally occur. Recent research has shown that enzymes may be a trigger of quantum coherence — as above — using the “wave side” of the wave-particle quality to cause electrons and even protons to simply “teleport” from one atom to another, bypassing the need for time, heat, and all of the other factors that enable or speed up classical chemical reactions. Quantum Physics In Your Sense of Self 
Finally, worthy of a mention in passing is the theory being debated right now by many scientists: that quantum mechanics are fundamental to our consciousness . For centuries, humans have proposed “second processing systems” in the brain or body that run parallel to our normal neuron firings, and that these overlapping systems are what give rise to our ability to mentally separate ourselves from our circumstances — what we call “being conscious.” 
Recent evidence has come up that the cytokine in the brain — what we used to think of as the “brain’s skeleton,” holding it all together — is in fact a massive quantum processor. Laced with what the scientists call “microtubules” that vibrate at incredible speeds, the cytokine system appears to be operating on the quantum level as a “trinary” computer — able to hold values of ‘on,’‘off,’ and the quantum superposition of being both on and off at the same time. 
What exactly this would enable our “secondary processing system” to accomplish is currently being explored — but the results, if we find them, are bound to change a lot of our fundamental assumptions about what we, as human beings, are capable of.

17740,Limbaugh: ’It Isn’t Unreasonable at All for Donald Trump to Suspect That He’s Being Tapped’ - Breitbart,"Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh addressed President Donald Trump’s tweets over the weekend accusing the Obama administration of wiretapping Trump Tower before the presidential election.  Partial transcript as follows: RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST: Let me ask you a question. Is it unreasonable, is it unreasonable that President Trump would suspect he’s being spied on? It’s not unreasonable, is it? Telephone calls that he’s made to presidents of other countries have been leaked, transcripts have been leaked  …     So a lot to try to explain here today, and it all makes sense when it is explained in not just necessarily a timeline format, but just when you provide and when you learn the information of things that are going on, all of this makes sense. It all seems reasonable. It all seems like it could be happening. We know, for example, that there has been an effort on the part of what I’ve been calling the deep state, this is embedded Obamaites that are in the bureaucracy that have been trying to sabotage and undermine the Trump administration ever since he was elected and through the transition into the inauguration and up to now. I mean, this is undeniable. These various leaks, many of them are criminal. How are people getting this information? How are people acquiring the information that they are disseminating? I have here, ladies and gentlemen, I went and looked and I’ve got a copy here of the actual New York Times front page on January 20th of this year. And the primary story, the lead story, “Trump Arrives, Set to Assume Power. ” But right next to it is this headline: “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides. ” Well, the New York Times has a story back in January admitting that wiretapped data has been used in an inquiry of Trump aides. And this article goes on to say “intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House. ” So it isn’t unreasonable at all for Donald Trump to suspect that he’s being tapped, that his aides are being tapped, at Trump Tower. We know that there were two FISA warrants that were issued starting last summer and then another one in October, and I want to walk you through those as the program unfolds today. It’s kind of unsettling. I mean, you don’t want to think things like this happen, but you know that they do, and so you have to face it. And we are in a polarized circumstance in our country. We are really divided, and the gap is wide. The partisanship is profound and it’s worsening here, to the point that there isn’t any common ground and crossing the aisle and shaking hands and cooperating. This is a war that’s going to result in somebody winning and somebody losing, within a political context, of course. And what’s new about this one is we have a Republican president for the first time in my lifetime fighting back. Well, I can’t exclude Ronald Reagan from that. And I actually think a part of this  —   and I can’t substantiate this, ’cause it goes to motive  —   but I think part of what President Trump is doing by tweeting out on Saturday that he believes the Obama administration’s wiretapping him, I think he’s not just tweeting to the American public and tweeting to the news media. I think Trump confounds these people because he’s always a step or two ahead. Trump plays the long game. And I think in addition to whatever else these tweets are intended to accomplish, it’s also a direct line to the Democrat Party and Obama and members of the Obama administration that Trump is signaling, “You don’t face the usual feckless bunch of opponents who never fight you back. You’ve got me here, and if you’re gonna start lying about me, if you’re gonna keep lying about me, I’m not gonna sit here and take it. ” Now, why might Trump think that he’s been bugged? Why might he believe that Trump Tower has been bugged? Well, folks, from the moment that Donald Trump won the election back in November, there have been leaks, illegal leaks that were no question hopefully damaging. There has been a sabotage effort to undermine Trump and his administration since the election. We’ve talked about it ever since it began. I’ve had various names for it, the deep state, Friday called it silent coup or whatever, but there isn’t any doubt in my mind that this is going on. The media is complicit in it, that there is an effort to undermine the Trump administration. We have these     protests that come up out of nowhere, and they appear instantly. So I think it’s totally reasonable to believe that something like this could be happening. It would be unreasonable to think that this is crazy, unreasonable to think that this is absurd, unreasonable to think that this is nothing more than a big batch of conspiracy theories stitched together for whatever purpose.

17741,A “Veteran FBI Spy” Just Confirmed Trump’s Shocking Russian Ties,"Comments 
Republican Donald Trump has denied Russian business ties throughout his entire campaign for President, even after confirmed videos (below) show him bragging adamantly about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
However, Mother Jones just reported that Trump actually maintains a mutually beneficial, direct relationship with Putin, which is why the FBI has been conducting an inquiry into Trump’s campaign management since August. The entire report proves Trump’s Russian connection and was provided to the FBI in August by a “veteran spy”— and publicly revealed this afternoon . Here’s the conclusion: 
“Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.” 
The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos—some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says. 
“This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former intelligence officer comments. “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.” 
The above bombshell has been confirmed by the federal government. The western spy revealed that the Kremlin began working with Trump up to five years ago. 
Ultimately, this western spy went to the FBI due to the seriousness of the information that he had uncovered. 
A senior US government official not involved in this case but familiar with the former spy tells Mother Jones that he has been a credible source with a proven record of providing reliable, sensitive, and important information to the US government. 
A former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump—and that the FBI requested more information from him. 
In June, the former Western intelligence officer—who spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients—was assigned the task of researching Trump’s dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm. This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project’s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) “It started off as a fairly general inquiry,” says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, “there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.” 
This was, the former spy remarks, “an extraordinary situation.” He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative—without the permission of the US company that hired him—he sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified. (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was “sufficiently serious” to share with the FBI. 
This newest Mother Jones report is chilling news, implicating the Trump campaign in the kind of high level dirty politics that the Republican’s political hero Richard Nixon would’ve found awfully familiar –only with a bizarre Russian twist. Nixon resigned in disgrace after an investigation found evidence that he’d ordered a break-in to the Democratic National Committee’s offices at the Watergate Hotel seeking information to swing his election. Trump doesn’t look like he will get that opportunity, but might face just as much public scrutiny in the wake of election day due to his Russian ties. 
Donald Trump is the first American politician in history to openly beg Russia for help in an election, let alone in a presidential campaign. The Republican certainly has benefitted from a string of stolen email releases, which has strangely only afflicted Democrats — and not a single Republican.

17742,What Is Lost by Burying the Trans-Pacific Partnership? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Congressional leaders confirmed this week what seemed inevitable with the triumph of Donald J. Trump: The   trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim nations that President Obama hoped to leave as a major legacy, but which Mr. Trump called “a terrible deal,” is dead. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, told labor leaders on Thursday that the pending   Partnership, the largest regional trade agreement in history, would not be approved by Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said   “no” when reporters on Wednesday asked whether the agreement would be considered in the   Congress that convenes next week  —   its last legislative chance, given the opposition from the  . Mr. Trump, whose invectives against trade agreements were central to his appeal to disaffected   voters, will have the authority as president “to negotiate better deals, as I think he would put it,” Mr. McConnell said. Yet there is little likelihood of Mr. Trump seeking a new agreement. That reflects not only his campaign statements, but also his yearslong hostility to past trade accords as well as the sheer difficulty of renegotiating a Pacific pact that was seven years in the making, entailing compromises among a dozen countries including Australia, Canada, Chile and Japan, but excluding China. Another broad trade deal still being negotiated, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between Europe and the United States, is a likely casualty of the Trump election and a global backlash against trade. The discussions “are dead, and I think everybody knows it,” Matthias Fekl, the French secretary of state for trade, said Friday as trade ministers met in Brussels. “Globalization has created lots of losers, lots of difficulties. ” Mr. Obama faces the prospect of many of his signature achievements dying or being pared back dramatically during the Trump administration. The   and congressional leaders have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of last year’s Paris climate agreement and kill off Mr. Obama’s global warming regulations. The   law regulating Wall Street could be carved up. But the   Partnership, painstakingly negotiated but little understood, will be buried with few in either party to mourn it. It was hailed by its negotiators as the most sophisticated such deal ever, establishing the rules of commerce that would rope both sides of the Pacific together into a   economy, while cementing the United States’ alliance with Asia. Which raises the question: What would be lost by abandoning it, for the nation and for specific industries from Hollywood to America’s ranches and farmlands? Its specifics were mostly ignored in the political attacks from both parties. Instead, for many voters the Pacific agreement was simply a lightning rod for their broader discontent with stagnant wages and job losses blamed on globalization and past trade agreements. The other parties to the agreement are Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. “Popular understanding of the T. P. P. is very low,” Kevin G. Nealer, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a postelection analysis on Thursday. With its abandonment, he added, “The risk to America’s role as trade policy leader  —   and therefore to the global economy  —   is real and immediate. ” Mr. Obama and his team likewise emphasized the potential geopolitical blow, even as they promoted the economic benefits the trade agreement would offer American exporters by eliminating thousands of tariffs and other trade restrictions in the other countries. Forsaking the agreement, the president insisted, would undercut the United States’ standing in the     region as a reliable counterweight to an expansionary China, economically and militarily, for America’s allies there. The other countries have approved the pact or are in the process of doing so, but without the approval of the United States, it does not take effect. That tension could well be evident later this month, when Mr. Obama and his trade representative, Michael B. Froman, attend the annual   Economic Cooperation summit. The Americans will have to explain their failure on the trade agreement to foreign leaders gathered in Lima, Peru, while China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is there seeking progress toward an emerging alternative to the   Partnership  —   the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, known as R. C. E. P. which includes China, Japan and 14 other Asian countries but excludes the United States. “In the absence of T. P. P. countries have already made it clear that they will move forward in negotiating their own trade agreements that exclude the United States,” Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers wrote days before the election. “These agreements would improve market access and trading opportunities for member countries while U. S. businesses would continue to face existing trade barriers. ” One example is a bilateral agreement between Australia and Japan, which gives Australian beef exporters a price advantage over American producers whose exports are subject to higher Japanese tariffs those tariffs would ultimately have been removed under the Pacific agreement. “We are experiencing lost sales without T. P. P. ” of about $400, 000 a day as a result, said Kevin Kester, a California cattle rancher and vice president of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. “Multiply that over several hundred more products and several dozen more   relationships,” Mr. Froman said in an interview. The T. P. P. would have phased out some 18, 000 tariffs that the other 11 countries have on imports from the United States, thus reducing their cost to foreign buyers. Beyond such typical trade actions, it also would have established a number of precedents for international trade rules dealing with digital commerce, intellectual property rights, human rights and environmental protection. A number of countries had agreed to copyright protections, benefiting sectors like the film industry. The agreement would have assured an open internet among the 12 nations, including in   Vietnam, encouraging digital trade and serving as a contrast to China’s walls to internet traffic. It included commitments against wildlife trafficking  —   Vietnam, for example, is a major market for rhino horns and ivory  —   and against subsidies in that country and others on both sides of the Pacific that encourage overfishing. For the first time in a trade agreement,   businesses like those in Vietnam and Malaysia would have had to comply with commercial trade rules and labor and environmental standards. The agreement would have committed all parties to the International Labor Organization’s principles prohibiting child labor, forced labor and excessive hours, and requiring collective bargaining, a minimum wage and safe workplaces. While unions and human rights groups remained skeptical about enforcement, the United States reached separate agreements with Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam in which the three countries committed to specific labor changes, under penalty of the United States’ restoring tariffs for noncompliance. Those side agreements will fall along with the overall trade pact.   antitrade politics aside, the biggest hurdle to Republicans’ consideration of the Pacific pact was objections from some  —   led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the committee responsible for trade  —   to   provisions that would have limited monopoly protections for   pharmaceutical companies’   biologics. Those are advanced drugs used, for instance, in cancer treatments. The Obama administration  —   pressed by nearly every other nation, the generic drug industry and nonprofit health groups like Doctors Without Borders, all of which wanted quicker access to affordable lifesaving drugs  —   had agreed that drugmakers could keep production data secret for five to eight years, fewer than the 12 years in federal law. Mr. Hatch had demanded 12 years. But administration officials were hindered in how far they could go to appease Republicans given strong opposition in other countries to any change. Without the trade agreement, however, drug companies have no monopoly protections for biologics data in some countries. Democrats, organized labor and the Ford Motor Company were especially opposed to the trade agreement because it did not include what they considered enforceable protections against other countries’ manipulation of their currency’s value to gain price advantages for their products. The pact did have a side agreement that, in another first for trade accords, included the parties’ “joint declaration” against currency manipulation, required them to report interventions in exchange markets and set annual meetings to discuss any disputes. Another innovation in the T. P. P. was provisions to help small businesses, which lack the resources of big corporations, to navigate export rules, trade barriers and red tape. Opponents on the left were especially critical of the agreement for opening the door to more foreign subsidiaries being able to go to special trade tribunals to sue to block local, state or federal policies  —   environmental or consumer safety rules, say  —   on grounds that the rules conflict with corporations’ rights under the trade pact. The administration, however, countered that the trade agreement actually reformed the     Dispute Settlement tribunals, which are a longstanding feature of trade policy. It called for changes responding to criticisms that the tribunals favor corporations and interfere with nations’ efforts to protect public health and safety.",0
17743,Emmanuel Macron Inaugurated as France’s New President - Breitbart,"PARIS (AP)  —   France’s new President Emmanuel Macron is formally taking power Sunday during a ceremony at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris. [His predecessor, Francois Hollande, is to welcome him in the courtyard in front of hundreds of journalists. The two were meeting in the president’s office before Hollande’s departure, taking a last few minutes to discuss the most sensitive issues facing France, including the country’s nuclear codes.  Macron takes charge of a nation that, when Britain leaves the European Union in 2019, will become the EU’s only member with nuclear weapons and a permanent seat on the U. N. Security Council.  Macron will then make a speech in the Elysee reception hall in front of about 300 guests, officials and family members, including his wife Brigitte Macron. She will be wearing a lavender blue dress by French designer Nicolas Ghesquiere for Louis Vuitton. Macron will be wearing a dark suit from French brand Jonas and Cie, a tailor based in Paris, that cost 450 euros ($491) his team said. Following the ceremony and military honors at the Elysee palace, Macron will go the Tomb of the Unknown soldier, at the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the   Avenue, a tradition followed by all heads of states in France’s modern history. Macron will also meet with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo later Sunday. His first visit abroad will be to Germany on Monday, to visit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. He will have to name his prime minister and form a government in the following days. A former economy minister, Macron quit Hollande’s Socialist government last year to launch his independent bid. He is the first French president who doesn’t originate from one of the country’s mainstream parties. He has promised to reinvigorate French politics by bringing in new faces. His Republic on the Move movement has announced an initial list of 428 candidates for the 577 seats up for grabs in France’s lower house of parliament in June. Macron is seeking a majority of lawmakers so he can pass his programs. Many of the Republic on the Move candidates are newcomers in politics. Their average age is 46, compared to 60 for the outgoing assembly. Half of them are women. Only 24 are lawmakers running for   all Socialists.

17744,"Hillary Clinton Struggles to Gain Traction in Florida, Despite Spending - The New York Times","TAMPA, Fla.  —   Hillary Clinton has vastly outspent Donald J. Trump on TV ads in Florida. Her 57 campaign offices dwarf Mr. Trump’s afterthought of a ground game. And Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among Hispanics, who account for nearly one in five Florida voters. Despite these advantages, Mrs. Clinton is struggling in the Sunshine State, unable to assemble the coalition that gave Barack Obama two victories here, and offering Mr. Trump a broad opening in a road to the White House that not long ago seemed closed to him. Mr. Trump is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently. Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton is not earning the same support among Hispanics, young people or white voters that Mr. Obama captured when he eked out a Florida victory four years ago in the country’s most   swing state. Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose here and still find other routes to victory. Mr. Trump’s electoral map is narrower he must have Florida in his column. But as the most populous and one of the most racially diverse battleground states, Florida is also a bellwether for the nation: a candidate’s struggles here often are mirrored elsewhere. Polling in swing states that Mrs. Clinton once led, prompting predictions a month ago of an Election Day romp, now show Mr. Trump closing the gap or slightly ahead, including in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. “If she underperforms what Obama did in ’12, she’s not going to carry Florida,” said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist in Miami. A poll his firm conducted for Univision, released last week, showed Mrs. Clinton winning 53 percent of Florida Hispanics, compared with the 60 percent who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. After several weeks in which Mr. Trump attempted to sand off some of his rough edges and attacked Mrs. Clinton for portraying half his supporters as “deplorables,” the share of Florida voters who view the candidates unfavorably is now the same for Mr. Trump as for Mrs. Clinton, according to a   poll. In Miami on Friday, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton’s bodyguards should disarm and “see what happens to her,” a comment that could renew voters’ doubts about his fitness for the presidency. The Clinton campaign maintains it always expected the Florida race to be tight. “Two months before the election, Hillary Clinton is within a couple of points of where President Obama ended on Election Day with Hispanic voters, while Donald Trump has been drastically underperforming Romney by 10 points or more,” John Anzalone, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster for Florida, said in a statement. With 20 million people and 10 major media markets, Florida is a place of vast diversity and contrasts that is a challenging puzzle for any statewide campaign. The traditional playbook has been for Democrats to run up the score in South Florida, with its large nonwhite population, and for Republicans to rack up votes in the conservative panhandle. That leaves Central Florida, and especially Tampa on the Gulf Coast, as one of the state’s most contested swing areas. The booming region has the largest share of registered voters statewide, with one in four voters in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, registered as independents. “The old saying is: ‘As goes Hillsborough County, so goes Florida,’ ” said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Within this swing region, an epicenter of swing voters is the explosively growing New Tampa. It is a community of affordable subdivisions reached by grandiose landscaped entrances off a   highway, attracting young professionals with families. In interviews, undecided voters there seemed uncertain if they would cast ballots at all. Kish Nathan, 45, a computer professional born in India, voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. He has ruled out Mr. Trump, but is unenthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton. “I might not even vote,” he said. Leo Lewis, 51, was reading political news on a laptop outside a Starbucks. Mr. Trump scares him, Mr. Lewis said. Mrs. Clinton, he believes, is dissembling about her health. He, too, is considering sitting out the election. “The world has gotten so bad no matter what you do, no one’s going to fix it,” he said. Some strategists believe the pool of persuadable voters this year is shallower than in the past, which may explain why the tens of millions in TV ads run by Mrs. Clinton and her allies in the state have failed to give her a noticeable advantage. (Mr. Trump and outside supporters have spent about $8 million.) Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, said recently that the Clinton advertising push was a failure. “You give us $22 million, and I’ll produce more votes for you than a damn television ad,” Mr. Hastings told a meeting of Democrats, arguing that television does not reach young voters. Mrs. Clinton’s bulwark is her vast organizing effort, currently focused on registering new voters and signing up volunteers. But Republicans have not been idle: Field teams working for the Republican National Committee and state party have cut the Democrats’ advantage with registered voters in half since 2012. It is now just 258, 000 active voters. The Florida Democratic Party pointed out that of the 146, 000 newly registered Hispanic voters this year, only 15 percent are Republicans. “I want to make sure I give my vote to Hillary,” said Valesca Barilles, who registered for the first time with a Clinton volunteer outside a Dollar Tree store in Tampa last week. Born in Honduras, Ms. Barilles, an assistant bank branch manager, said of Mr. Trump, “I love the U. S. A. and I don’t think we need someone to come and ruin it. ” After poor   efforts during the primaries, Mr. Trump seems to be belatedly getting a ground game together. When he spoke in Pensacola, where the crowd was asked to text “Trump” to a number, some 3, 500 followed up on a reply message about how to check their voter registration, according to the campaign, and 1, 400 signed up to volunteer. “There is an army of R. N. C. volunteers and Trump volunteers crawling every part of this state every day,” said Susan Wiles, Mr. Trump’s state director. Mr. Trump must find a way to turn out a wave of white supporters who are infrequent voters. The campaign concedes that Mitt Romney’s field staff members four years ago drove conventional white turnout in Florida about as high as possible. In this state of   contests, every small demographic shift is closely watched. Mr. Obama won 37 percent of the state’s white vote in 2012. Mrs. Clinton is falling short of that number in    polls with Mr. Trump. “If she’s getting 34, 33, 35 among whites in Florida, I’m going to start to buy a lot of antacids,” said Steve Schale, who ran Mr. Obama’s Florida race in 2008 and was a senior adviser in 2012. Mrs. Clinton could make up for the erosion among whites by gaining with Hispanic voters. But so far, polls show Mrs. Clinton falling short of Mr. Obama’s 60 percent share of Florida Hispanics in 2012. “Against the candidate perceived to be the most hostile to Hispanic voters in modern presidential politics, why is she not exceeding where Barack Obama was?” Mr. Amandi, the Miami pollster, asked. He criticized the Clinton campaign for beginning   advertising only this month and for not doing a forum during the general election campaign with either Univision or Telemundo. “I think it’s too early to hit the panic button, but if these numbers by   aren’t at or slightly above where Obama was, there’s reason to be concerned,” he said. “She’s going to need all these votes to carry Florida. ” And Florida, he added, “is the whole enchilada. ”",0

WikiLeaks’ dump of messages to and from Clinton’s campaign chief offer an unprecedented view into the workings of the elite, and how it looks after itself 
The Guardian T he emails currently roiling the US presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta. The U.S. Justice Department official Peter Kadzik in charge of of the probe into Hillary Clinton’s and Huma Abedin’s emails sent Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta a ‘heads up’ about a congressional hearing into her secret server last year. Wikileaks reveals Podesta responded by looping senior campaign staff into the conversation and said the hearing would provide ‘additional chances for mischief.’ 
They are last week’s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. 
The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn’t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent. Is Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton’s Secret Weapon Or Her Next Big Problem? 
They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves. 
Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone’s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people’s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn’t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don’t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren’t. 
With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty. Bill Clinton now leads a sprawling philanthropic empire like no other. And yet it’s hard to shake the sense that it’s not all about saving the world. 
The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement. 
Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary’s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. Citigroup bank chose Obama’s 2008 cabinet – WikiLeaks 
In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, appear to name President Obama’s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery). 
The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to “learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action”). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley’s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be: 
“… spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.” 
(Hilariously, in another email chain , the Clinton team appears to scheme to “hit” Bernie Sanders for attending “DSCC retreats on Martha’s Vineyard with lobbyists”.) 
Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta – the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite – for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony. 
Scandal at Clinton Inc. 
This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. 
Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should “come from the industry itself”. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. 
Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another’s careers, constantly. Architects of “Regime Change” Wars 
Everything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the “ Global CEO Advisory Firm ” that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation. Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup. There are honors. Venture capital. Foundation grants. Endowed chairs. Advanced degrees. 
For them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary. 
But the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, it’s all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you aren’t part of this happy, prosperous in-group – if you don’t have John Podesta’s email address – you’re out.

17746,New Project Veritas Release: Rigging the Election - Video IV: $20K Wire Transfer From Belize Returned | Agriculture,"(Before It's News)
In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money.

17747,Turkish Parliament Approves Stripping Lawmakers of Their Immunity - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   Lawmakers from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s governing party pushed through an amendment to the Turkish Constitution on Friday that would strip members of Parliament of their immunity from prosecution, a move that is likely to lead to the ouster of Kurdish deputies. After months of fierce debate  —   including a brawl in Parliament that left one deputy with a dislocated shoulder  —   376 of the 550 deputies voted in a secret ballot to approve the constitutional amendment, allowing it to pass without a public referendum. Mr. Erdogan is certain to approve the change. The contentious amendment was proposed after Mr. Erdogan called for members of the Kurdish People’s Democratic Party, or H. D. P. to face prosecution for alleged ties with Kurdish militants who have carried out a    insurgency against Turkey. “This is a historic vote,” Mr. Erdogan said on Friday, speaking in his hometown, Rize, on the Black Sea coast. “My people do not want to see guilty lawmakers in this Parliament, especially the supporters of the separatist terrorist organization. ” The H. D. P. is the   party in Parliament with 59 seats 50 of those lawmakers face prosecution. Under the new amendment, they can be prosecuted for a number of charges, including some for terrorism, and will effectively be removed from Parliament. Mr. Erdogan’s governing Justice and Development Party could then call early elections that would help him establish an executive presidency and consolidate more power. “We view this motion as a political coup attempt to completely destroy the separation of powers by subordinating the legislative to the executive and leaving the former to the mercy of a thoroughly politicized and biased judiciary,” the H. D. P. chairmen Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag wrote in a letter to members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. “This coup would be a most crucial step for Erdogan to replace Turkey’s parliamentary democracy, which he has twice declared ‘de facto over,’ with an absolutist presidential system in which the legislative, executive and judiciary powers are virtually monopolized by the president himself,” they added. The constitutional change could complicate Turkey’s relationship with the European Union, and jeopardize a deal agreed in March that renewed talks for Turkey to join the bloc and allowed Turkish citizens to travel in Europe without visas in exchange for Turkey’s help in stemming the flow of asylum seekers to the Continent. Kurdish politicians warned that their exclusion from Parliament could exacerbate tensions in Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish southeast, where the Turkish state has been fighting a counterinsurgency campaign against the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P. K. K. since the group ended a   last July. “Taking Kurds out of politics and shutting down the political channels to resolve this conflict will only disenfranchise Kurdish youth further and push them toward a radical path in the fight toward great autonomy,” said Kubra Demir, a Kurdish activist in the southeastern city of Sirnak. Analysts who have watched the debate over immunity in Parliament in recent weeks have likened it to a period in 1994 when Kurdish deputies from the Democracy Party, or D. E. P. were imprisoned on terrorism charges, which led to one of the most violent periods in the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds. “It took Turkey almost two decades to recover from that,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “To repeat the same mistake would set back Turkish democracy for quite some time. ” She added: “This will neither solve the Kurdish situation or help Turkey’s territorial integrity in the long run. I worry that Erdogan’s zeal and constant targeting of H. D. P. for this is paving the path for actual division of the country further down the road. ” The change to the Constitution will not just apply to members from the Kurdish party as many as 138 Turkish lawmakers from all parties now find themselves vulnerable to prosecution. Several members of the main opposition Republican People’s Party face charges for insulting Mr. Erdogan, including the party’s leader who called the president a “political and sexual pervert. ” In a statement earlier this week, the H. D. P. said that none of the investigations into its parliamentary deputies were about concerns over corruption, bribery or theft. “They are all about freedom of expression,” the party said in a statement posted on Twitter.",0

17749,"Los emails de Hillary Clinton y la Hermandad Musulmana, por Thierry Meyssan","Los emails de Hillary Clinton y la Hermandad Musulmana por Thierry Meyssan La investigación del FBI sobre los emails privados de Hillary Clinton ya no está relacionada con una negligencia en materia de normas de seguridad sino con un complot tendiente a sustraer a los servidores del gobierno federal todo rastro de su correspondencia. Esto parece incluir intercambios de mensajes sobre financiamiento ilegal o la corrupción de terceros vinculados a las relaciones del matrimonio Clinton con la Hermandad Musulmana y los yihadistas.
Red Voltaire | Damasco (Siria) | 1ro de noviembre de 2016 ελληνικά English français Türkçe русский Deutsch Hillary Clinton y la jefa de su equipo, Huma Abedin. La reactivación de la investigación del FBI sobre los mensajes privados de Hillary Clinton ya no tiene que ver con un problema de seguridad sino con una serie de manejos que pudieran llegar incluso a caracterizarse como crímenes de alta traición.
Técnicamente, en vez de utilizar los servidores de seguridad del Estado federal, la secretaria de Estado usó un servidor privado que había instalado en su domicilio para poder utilizar internet sin dejar rastros en una máquina del gobierno federal. El técnico privado de la señora Clinton había limpiado ese servidor antes de la llegada del FBI, de manera que ya no era posible saber el por qué de la instalación de ese dispositivo.
El FBI observó inicialmente que el servidor privado no garantizaba el mismo nivel de seguridad que el servidor del Departamento de Estado. Por tanto, la señora Clinton había cometido una falta en materia de seguridad. Pero el FBI confiscó posteriormente el ordenador del ex miembro del Congreso estadounidense Anthony Weiner, el ex esposo de Huma Abedin, la jefa del equipo de trabajo de Hillary Clinton. Y en ese ordenador aparecieron una serie de correos electrónicos de la ex secretaria de Estado.
Anthony Weiner es un político judío, muy vinculado a los Clinton, que ambicionaba ser alcalde de Nueva York. Pero tuvo que dimitir como consecuencia de un escándalo esencialmente puritano: Weiner había enviado SMS eróticos a varias mujeres. Huma Abedin se separó de él oficialmente, pero en realidad no lo dejó.
Huma Abedin es estadounidense y se educó en Arabia Saudita. Su padre dirige una revista académica –en la que la propia Huma fue durante años secretaria de redacción–, publicación que recoge regularmente las opiniones de la Hermandad Musulmana. Su madre preside la asociación saudita de mujeres miembros de la Hermandad Musulmana y trabajaba con la esposa del presidente egipcio Mohamed Morsi, otro representante de la Hermandad Musulmana. Su hermano Hassan trabaja para el jeque Yusuf al-Qaradawi, el predicador y consejero espiritual de Al-Jazeera.
Durante un viaje oficial a Arabia Saudita, la secretaria de Estado visita el colegio Dar al-Hekma con Saleha Abedin –la madre de Huma– quien preside la asociación de Hermanas miembros de la Hermandad Musulmana. Huma Abedin es actualmente un personaje central de la campaña electoral de Hillary Clinton, junto a su director de campaña, John Podesta, quien fue jefe de personal de la Casa Blanca bajo la presidencia de Bill Clinton. Podesta es además el agente de influencia encargado de promover los intereses de Arabia Saudita en el Congreso de Estados Unidos, tarea por la cual percibe mensualmente la módica suma de 200 000 dólares. El 12 de junio de 2016, la agencia de prensa oficial de Jordania publicó una entrevista del príncipe heredero de Arabia Saudita, Mohamed Ben Salman, quien defendía la modernidad de su familia argumentando que la familia real saudita financió –ilegalmente– en un 20% la campaña electoral de Hillary Clinton… a pesar de tratarse de una mujer. Al día siguiente, la agencia anulaba el despacho que contenía esa información y afirmaba que su sitio web había sido pirateado.
Según un despacho de Petra, la agencia oficial de Jordania, fechado el 12 de junio de 2016, la familia real de Arabia Saudita ha financiado ilegalmente un 20% de la campaña electoral de Hillary Clinton. Huma Abedin no es la única persona de la administración Obama vinculada a la Hermandad Musulmana:
 El medio hermano del presidente, Abon’go Malik Obama, presidente de la Fundación Barack H. Obama, es también tesorero de la Obra Misionaria de la Hermandad Musulmana en Sudán. Abon’go Malik Obama se halla directamente a las órdenes del presidente sudanés Omar el-Bechir.
 Un miembro de la Hermandad Musulmana es miembro del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional estadounidense. Desde 2009 hasta 2012, fue Mehdi K. Alhassani. No se sabe quién lo sustituyó, pero la Casa Blanca negaba que hubiera un miembro de la Hermandad Musulmana en el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, hasta que se supo que Alhassani era efectivamente miembro de la cofradía.
 Rashad Hussain, embajador de Estados Unidos ante la Conferencia Islámica, también pertenece a la Hermandad Musulmana.
 Otros miembros de la cofradía debidamente identificados ocupan cargos menos importantes en la administración Obama. Pero vale la pena mencionar en particular a Louay M. Safi, actualmente miembro de la Coalición Nacional Siria y ex consejero del Pentágono.
El presidente Barack Obama recibe a su medio hermano Abon’go Malik Obama en la Oficina Oval de la Casa Blanca. Abon’go Malik Obama es el tesorero de la Obra Misionera de la Hermandad Musulmana en Sudán. En abril de 2009, dos meses antes de pronunciar su famoso discurso en El Cairo, el presidente Obama recibió secretamente una delegación de la Hermandad Musulmana en la Oficina Oval. Anteriormente, había invitado a su investidura a Ingrid Mattson, la presidenta de la Asociación de Hermanos y Hermanas Musulmanes en Estados Unidos.
Por su parte, la Fundación Clinton empleó como responsable de su proyecto «Clima» a Gehad el-Haddad, uno de los dirigentes mundiales de la Hermandad Musulmana, quien había sido hasta entonces responsable de un programa de televisión coránica. Su padre fue uno de los cofundadores de la Hermandad Musulmana en 1951, cuando la CIA y el MI6 decidieron reactivarla. Gehad dejó la Fundación Clinton en 2012 para convertirse, en El Cairo, en vocero del entonces candidato a la presidencia de Egipto Mohammed Morsi, y posteriormente pasó a ser vocero oficial de la Hermandad Musulmana a escala mundial.
Sabiendo que todos los líderes yihadistas del mundo provienen de la Hermandad Musulmana o de la orden sufí de los Naqchbandis –los dos componentes de la Liga Islámica Mundial– sería interesante tener un poco más de información sobre las relaciones de la señora Clinton con Arabia Saudita y la cofradía.
Resulta, por otro lado, que en el equipo del adversario de Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, está el general Michael T. Flynn, quien trató de oponerse a que la Casa Blanca creara el Emirato Islámico (Daesh) y dimitió de su cargo de director de la Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA, la Agencia de Inteligencia del Departamento de Defensa) en señal de protesta. Y junto a él, también como miembro del equipo de Trump, figura Frank Gaffney, un « cold warrior » histórico, actualmente catalogado como « complotista » por haber denunciado… la presencia de miembros de la Hermandad Musulmana en el gobierno federal.
Por supuesto, desde el punto de vista del FBI, todo respaldo a las organizaciones yihadistas constituye un crimen, sin importar la línea política de la CIA. En 1991, el FBI –y el senador John Kerry– provocaron la quiebra del BCCI –banco pakistaní registrado en las Islas Caimán y ampliamente utilizado por la CIA en todo tipo de operaciones secretas con la Hermandad Musulmana, el mismo esquema que esa agencia estadounidense de inteligencia suele emplear con los cárteles latinoamericanos de la droga.

17750,Prince’s Old Band Resurrects Him Through His Songs - The New York Times,"MINNEAPOLIS  —   On April 21, as news spread that Prince had been found dead at his Paisley Park compound in Chanhassen, Minn. a crowd began to gather 21 miles away at First Avenue, the Minneapolis club where he had filmed the concert scenes for the 1984 film “Purple Rain. ” Thousands of fans flocked to what became a giant   block party memorial, and local acts took the stage to play covers of Prince’s songs. On Thursday night, Prince’s band the Revolution arrived on that stage for the first time since 2012 to honor, and grieve for, one of their own. For three months after his death, the group had remained silent about details of a reunion, finally confirming a   stand (which grew to include a third) in early July. “I need this as much as you,” the bassist Mark Brown, a. k. a. Brownmark, wrote on Facebook at the time of the announcement. “Sharing the music with you is what will heal. ” Thursday night’s show, the first of the brief run, offered the crowd of 1, 500 the chance to experience Prince’s music as performed by the musicians who helped define it: Wendy Melvoin (guitar) Lisa Coleman and Matt Fink (who’s called Dr. on keyboards) Mr. Brown (bass) and Bobby Rivkin, known as Bobby Z (drums) as well as the   André Cymone and the lead guitarist Dez Dickerson, who had played with Prince in the years before the Revolution. The group had previously reunited at First Avenue for a benefit for Mr. Rivkin after he had a heart attack in 2012, and according to Nathan Kranz, the club’s general manager, Mr. Rivkin did most of the legwork in staging the current reunions. Mr. Dickerson said there was talk of getting back together at the Los Angeles memorial for Prince in May: “Things were being sorted. ” The shows were finally booked in  . “Look at those smiling faces! That’s what we want to see,” Ms. Melvoin said from the stage on Thursday night, perhaps trying to nudge the mood toward celebration from something more somber, before the band surged into its opening song, “Let’s Go Crazy. ” She added, “I expect to hear everyone singing. ” She got her wish, on and off the stage. With no Prince anchoring the band, group vocals  —   harmonies,      —   were plentiful, and Ms. Melvoin stepped up front for rockers like “Let’s Go Crazy” and “Raspberry Beret. ” With Mr. Cymone and Mr. Dickerson joining the band, they recreated “1999,” alternating singers on each opening line. Mr. Cymone took lead on “Little Red Corvette,” and a quick survey of the club showed that most everyone in it was singing along ditto, later, for “Kiss,” which the Revolution played in a way that was close to the original recording, unlike their boss, who had constantly changed the arrangement. A number of guests bolstered the show. The RB singer Bilal was a welcome surprise, having not only aced the BET Awards’ Prince tribute but also one at Carnegie Hall in 2013. At First Avenue, he proved a mellifluous falsetto for hire, especially on “The Beautiful Ones,” whose climax he lifted with his nimble squall. Fans spied other familiar faces onstage: Susannah Melvoin (Wendy’s sister, Prince’s former girlfriend and the lead singer in the Family, a band he masterminded) Omar Baker, Prince’s brother (resplendent in a white fedora and   shoes) the “Purple Rain”   Apollonia (who introduced the encore by tossing gold hoop earrings to the crowd, a motif in the movie) and Prince’s   Mayte Garcia. The crowd members were largely in their 40s and 50s, many from out of town. One of the first in was Scott Bogen, a Twin Cities native who once won $1, 000 impersonating Prince for First Avenue’s     contest. He has lived for the last two decades in Big Sur, where he is a volunteer firefighter, and came back here for the reunion. “We’ve been fighting the fire for five weeks straight,” he said, referring to the West Coast wildfires. “My property burned, but my house survived. ” Mr. Bogen said it was fortunate that the fire didn’t claim the tambourine Prince signed for him in 1981. There were mementos available at the Revolution’s merchandise table  —   four   two hoodies  —   where a line of a dozen that had assembled by 7:13 p. m. had tripled by 7:20. (The club’s doors had opened at 7.) But many in the audience were wearing two   that weren’t for sale: designs featuring a list of the Revolution members’ names or the contents of a lunchbox in “Starfish  Coffee,” a song on Prince’s 1987 double album, “Sign o’ the Times. ” It’s hard to imagine the Revolution tribute’s taking place anywhere other than First Avenue. Prince had used the club as a home performance base since 1981, and it was the spot where he debuted the song “Purple Rain” in 1983, before it made many memorable appearances in the film the following year. A replica of the motorcycle from the movie stood where pinball machines once did. A few fans wore   of Prince’s “Purple Rain” trench    look. Much of Ms. Melvoin’s stage patter revolved around the idea of the show’s being not just in Prince’s memory, but for his heavenly delectation. After a cheer following “America,” she focused on the crowd. “Everybody hear that?” she asked. “Let’s help him hear this. ” When Ms. Melvoin and Ms. Coleman played “Sometimes It Snows in April” as a duo, quiet and acoustic, Ms. Melvoin struggled to keep her composure it was a clear highlight, particularly when she sang, “Always cry for love, never cry for pain,” to some deeply felt shouts from the crowd. At the end of the night, one thing stood out  —   that the band didn’t even try to copy Prince’s singular guitar solos, in particular for “Let’s Go Crazy” and “Purple Rain,” the inevitable show closer. The lack of flash for “Purple Rain” wasn’t total (there were actual lighters in the air) but it nevertheless gave the song a rawer charge than usual. It was stark, yet fitting. Who could ever replace their man?",0
17751,"Army Triumphs at Last, Ending Navy’s 14-Game Streak in Rivalry - The New York Times","BALTIMORE  —   Tradition at the   game calls for each team’s players, at the game’s end, to stand in front of their fellow students and sing their alma mater, with the winning team singing second. On Saturday, for the first time since December 2001, Army sang after Navy did. Army had pulled off a      victory that ended a     losing streak to Navy. And when the game ended, with Army running out the clock in front of a capacity crowd announced at 71, 600 at MT Bank Stadium  —   a crowd that included   Donald J. Trump  —   thousands of members of the   Corps of Cadets jumped over the fence to flood the field. Which, in turn, made for a pretty loud backup chorus. “I can’t put words to it,” said Edgar Poe, a senior wide receiver who finally learned what it feels like to beat Navy. “It’s surreal. It doesn’t even feel like it’s for real. ” The winning touchdown was a thrilling one: The junior quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw scored on a   run with six minutes to play, putting Army back ahead after it had squandered a   halftime lead. Navy still holds a   edge in the series, which dates to Nov. 29, 1890, and also includes seven ties. And although they were severely   in this game because of injuries to top players, the Midshipmen ( ) made Army ( ) earn the victory. Which it did. “We’ve heard for a long time about the streak and all that,” said Army Coach Jeff Monken, who is in his third season at West Point. “It was good to be part of the team that put that to an end. ” Army’s fumbles helped Navy climb back into the game in the second half, and when Navy quarterback Zach Abey broke three tackles early in the fourth quarter on an option keeper that turned into a swerving,   touchdown run, the Black Knights trailed for the first time all day. But Army, suddenly down by   immediately responded with a     touchdown drive that ate up 6 minutes 42 seconds and ended with the touchdown run by Bradshaw, who had thrown an interception and lost a fumble earlier. “I told the guys to just be prepared  —   they may try to make us do something foolish to draw a flag,” Bradshaw said. “I told them to keep their composure, to protect the ball  —   to focus on ourselves. ” After Bradshaw scored, a determined Army team held Navy to 6 yards on three plays, forcing a punt. The Black Knights then pushed through for two first downs to end the game. “We persevered through everything,” Andrew King, an Army senior linebacker, said of the game and the season. “We fought hard, executed, and most of all, we finished. ” Brandon Jackson, a sophomore cornerback, had been killed in a   accident after Army’s second game of the season. On Saturday, his mother, Morna Davis, made her first appearance at a game since his death, Monken said. Afterward, she was with the team in the locker room for the celebration. “To share that victory with her, and for her to see how much she means to these guys, was really special for all of us,” Monken said. For a half, it seemed as if Army was going to break the losing streak with ease. Just a week earlier, in a   loss to Temple in the American Athletic Conference championship game, Navy had lost quarterback Will Worth and slotback Toneo Gulley to   foot injuries on the same play. The damage from that loss seemed to hang over Navy as Army turned an early fumble by Shawn White into a     scoring drive that concluded when fullback Andy Davidson plunged in from the   line. Later, after a   Navy punt, Army went ahead,   as another   run by Davidson capped an   drive. As for Trump, he waved to the crowd and pumped his fist as he arrived during the first quarter and then watched the game from two luxury suites, one linked to Army, the other to Navy. At halftime, he appeared on the CBS television broadcast of the game, said he was “absolutely neutral” and suggested that the quality of the game might not be the best but that the spirit was. After Trump left the broadcast booth, the second half began, and the momentum swung abruptly when Bradshaw quickly lost a fumble at the Army 32. Abey completed a screen pass to White that picked up 16 yards and then muscled into the end zone on a keeper that cut Navy’s deficit to   less than four minutes into the half. The Midshipmen picked up a   field goal by Bennett Moehring and took the lead on Abey’s touchdown run. But Army found a way when it really mattered. Asked how he felt about ending the streak, Rhyan England, a junior free safety for Army, said, “The biggest thing is relief. ” Poe, his teammate, found himself searching for something beyond the appropriate words after it was all over: his helmet. But the victory he will have forever.",0
17752,US Media Weaponizes “Economic Outlooks” | New Eastern Outlook,"Country: Thailand Thailand is currently undergoing a sensitive period with the passing of the nation’s long-lived, revered head of state, King Bhumibol Adulyadej . Indeed, the mood across the country is somber, however, the actual business of the nation continues on with many Thais realizing that moving forward is the best way to honor their late king. And despite Thais continuing to work, factories continuing to produce, agricultural goods continuing to be cultivated, processed, and shipped domestically, regionally, and internationally, the Western media – driven by corporate-financier and political special interests – has attempted to upend confidence in the Thai economy by suggesting that somehow toned-down entertainment venues will overturn the entire economy. And some in the Western media have attempted to claim the one year of official mourning in Thailand could even affect the rest of Asia. But back in reality, sound economic fundamentals and actual political stability determine a nation’s positive economic outlook – and Thailand possesses both. The Financial Times in an article titled, “Can Thailand’s economy handle a year of mourning?,” claims that: Many Thais are putting off weddings, vacations and other “joyful events” as the country begins a one-year period of mourning. This is in addition to a 30-day ban on “entertainment” that has forced infamous bar districts, like Bangkok’s Soi Cowboy, to pull down their shutters out of respect for the late king. Although some bars have resumed operations with workers dressed all in black, the nighttime landscape of the capital remains dramatically quiet. Even after the entertainment ban is lifted, it is hard to say how quickly the nation’s mood will bounce back. While Thailand is noted for its tourist and entertainment venues, they contribute a relatively small percentage (9-16% of GDP) to Thailand’s overall economic activity. Most tourist destinations in Thailand continue to operate as normal. And while the nation’s more infamous entertainment industry is indeed expected to see a downturn, the total number of people employed by it represents at most, only 0.5% of the nation’s total workforce. Attempts to claim that the year of mourning may lead to political instability are also questionable. The king’s heir and his decision to postpone ascending to the throne until the end of the mourning period next year is in fact a sign of confidence that the nation can safely mourn, without rushing the succession process. If political stability in Thailand is compromised, it will be because of external forces. The nation’s political opposition are a spent force, and US attempts to stir up division and chaos by intensifying violence in the nation’s deep south have so far been unsuccessful. Both the opposition and prospects of violence in the south expanding depend entirely on the US’ ability to support them both – and both Thais and foreign observers alike have become increasingly adept at exposing this foreign support. Weaponizing Economic Outlooks The Financial Times is not the only Western media source attempting to portray Thailand as looking into an economic abyss. The entirety of the Western media has also attempted to perpetuate this narrative, not because careful analysis has helped them arrive at this conclusion, but because of a concerted effort to use Thailand’s moment of perceived sociopolitical weakness to undermine the current political order and help return to power Western-backed political parties – more specifically – those allied to ousted ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The “weaponizing” of economic outlooks has long been employed by the Western media. Portraying a nation’s economy as faltering helps spread panic across fickle investors, encouraging them to invest elsewhere and drawing away much needed capital to sustain economic growth. However, despite this, Asia finds itself in a position where the majority of its economic activity is done regionally. What Western papers and news channels say is increasingly irrelevant to the plans and ambitions of these regional players. As for Thailand’s economy in particular, the current government is on track, repairing the agricultural industry after gross mismanagement by Shinawatra’s administration, including a devastated rice industry. It is also investing in the increased use of technology and innovation across all sectors of the economy. Beyond that, Thailand still serves as an attractive nation for companies to build and operate factories, and Thailand itself sees its own domestic industry maturing and increasingly exporting goods of their own abroad. Agriculture, industry, energy, education, and service industries – which employ the vast majority of Thais – have basic fundamentals that will remain unaffected by the nation’s year of mourning. The superficial examples the Western media cites are cited specifically to prey on the ignorance and misconceptions their ill-informed audiences have regarding Thailand and its economy.

17753,We Now Have Proof Obamacare Was Designed to Fail… and Here’s Why [Video],"Leave a reply 
Melissa Dykes – The oligarchy runs our society with Problem – Reaction – Solution. 
We all knew our government was disgustingly corrupt… but now it’s blatantly in-your-face written proof disgustingly corrupt at a time when most of us didn’t think it could get much worse. 

If anything, these leaks have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the two-party system is an illusion and the whole construct is one huge pay-for-play corporate sham. Obamacare was always meant to destroy the private health care system and usher in single-payer, government run socialist medicine. It was designed that way… and it’s “working”. 
Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton created Truthstream Media.com as an outlet to examine the news, place it in a broader context, uncover the deceptions, pierce through the fabric of illusions, grasp the underlying factors, know the real enemy, unshackle from the system, and begin to imagine the path towards taking back our lives, one step at a time, so that one day we might truly be free…

17754,Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence,"Email 
Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , “voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.” Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
“If anybody can sit there and say they don’t think this is a contentious election, then they aren’t paying much attention,” Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are “soft targets” that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … 
“There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn’t have 15 or 20 years ago,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. “ What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that’s certainly concerning.” 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … 
“We don’t want to lose an election because you know what I’m talking about,” Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. “Because you know what? That’s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .” 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
“I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,” Moynihan said. “You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.” 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesn’t look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats don’t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… 
“It’s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,” Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book “ Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,” previously told The Christian Science Monitor. “Voting was very, very dangerous. I don’t think anyone’s suggesting that we’re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.” 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

17755,How to Plan Your Next Vacation With a Chatbot - The New York Times,"Need to book a hotel on the go, or a friendly dinner recommendation while exploring a new city? There’s a bot for that. In fact, there are now chatbots for all kinds of things, from weather updates to health advice, as the popularity of smartphone messaging apps driven by artificial intelligence grows. Mobile messaging apps were used by 1. 6 billion people in 2016, and will reach two billion in 2018, or 80 percent of all smartphone users, according to the digital data researcher eMarketer. Another sign of their growing influence was evident last April, when Facebook announced it was opening its Messenger app to any outside company that wants to integrate its own bots into the chat program. Now, the booking services Expedia, Kayak, Skyscanner and many others are allowing potential customers to seek recommendations on hotel rooms and flights and book them via Facebook Messenger. Several other   bots have sprung up in recent months, providing services like bookings and tips for activities, with a robotic touch. The technology is young, and while most of these chatbots have yet to become viable alternatives to existing travel planning options like Trip Advisor and traditional guides, it could be only a matter of time before our   culture embraces booking by text. Here is what three of the more interesting options have to offer so far: SnapTravel aims to find you a hotel based on your budget and preferences via SMS, Facebook Messenger or Slack. It uses a combination of artificial and human intelligence to search Expedia, Priceline and more than 100 other sites for the best deal, and claims to have “secret deals” of its own. The bot first asks for your travel city and dates, whether you have a specific hotel brand in mind and if you have any neighborhood preferences in the city. I texted SnapTravel while I was looking to book a few nights in my hometown, Binghamton, N. Y. during Thanksgiving week. Based on my initial responses, SnapTravel gave me a cost estimate for   and   hotels in the area. After another series of questions regarding my budget, brand preference and more, I was told to hang tight and it would get back to me with hotel options within an hour. Seven minutes later, I was sent what it deemed my four best options, with photos and links to more details and booking options for each hotel, a link to a map with more options, and I was asked if I wanted to be put in touch with one of its travel agents (who can offer some human insight). The entire process from start to finish took 16 minutes. But it felt more like an automated phone call with a cable company than a typical text conversation. I thanked the bot, and was pleased that it did not bug me later on, something I had expected. The hotel recommendations were a mixed bag. I told the bot that I prefer Marriott hotels, and it included a Courtyard Marriott within my budget. The other three included a    a local resort and a Homewood Suites by Hilton. Points for variety, but another Marriott choice would have been nice. Meanwhile the map with more options had only two additional hotels. As far as the deals themselves, they seemed legitimate when compared with the prices seen on discount booking websites like Hotwire. com. When you click on the hotel’s link on SnapTravel, you get its rates, are told whether there is a cancellation fee and are given the opportunity to compare its rate for that hotel with other booking sites. While you won’t get a comprehensive list to shop from, SnapTravel mostly did what it claims it can do, and in a timely manner. A spinoff from the Hipmunk booking website and smartphone app, Hello Hipmunk offers up a cute chipmunk to help you book travel from Facebook Messenger, Slack or Skype. Just be careful what you ask for. You will need to be specific if you want to get relevant results. I used Messenger to converse with Hipmunk, and before I had a chance to say hello, the critter asked me what airport I usually fly from. I said La Guardia, assuming it would understand that I meant La Guardia Airport in New York City. But it came back with: “Looks like you’re planning a getaway from Laguardia, Spain. ” I tried again, asking for some flight deals from New York to Chicago for the next week. He came back with: “You’re looking for the best time to go from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL. Hold on, I’m digging through the data now. :)” Not really there, but we’re getting closer, and I appreciate the service with a smile. Next I tried: “I need a flight from New York to Chicago, leaving tomorrow and coming back on October 9. ” That seemed to do it. “Ready to jet? I’m finding you flights from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL, on October 05, coming back on October 09,” the Hipmunk bot said. “I searched 736 itineraries. The least agonizing itinerary flies from LGA to ORD. ” Below were nine itineraries, rated one to nine in order of “least agonizing” with times and prices. This bot is fun to play with if you have the time, but it has a ways to go in the accuracy department. For the business traveler, there is Pana, which, like SnapTravel, combines artificial and human intelligence to plan your trip. The human factor seems to play a more significant role than it did with the other bots I tried. You don’t need to be a business traveler to benefit, but you do need to be a   traveler to justify the cost: $49 per month ($499 annually) for its “concierge” plan. But there is a   free trial to start. The involvement of humans may have explained the short delay in Pana’s response to my initial text (three minutes felt like an eternity compared with the other bots) but it also ultimately led to better results. After signing up and giving some basic information, including your email and phone number, Pana asks you for a quick phone call to get to know you a little better. But in keeping with the spirit of avoiding as much human interaction as possible, I passed on that and sought out its A. I. guidance. Pana gives you three ways to start: through email, SMS or its app. I chose SMS and received an introductory hello. I then texted that I wanted to fly from New York to Chicago, leaving next Monday and returning Friday. I got a response from “Jo” and learned that she is “a Canadian transplant in Hong Kong, avoiding the snow and loving the urban island life. ” Jo promised to look into my flight options and send them to me shortly. About an hour later, I received four flight itinerary options, sorted by price from lowest to highest. This was as far as I took it, but Pana is designed to be a   relationship. Your virtual travel agent can check you into flights and suggest hotels, and then can pivot to   to recommend restaurants and activities in your destination city.",0
17756,Life: 5 New Emojis Apple Created Specifically To Shame Me For The Time I Backed My Car Into The Public Swimming Pool,"Apple is very cruel to taunt me about driving into a pool. I was already deeply embarrassed, and these new iPhone emojis are just salt in the wound. 1. My Car Falling Into The Pool 
The swimming pool near my house closes after the summer, so I decided to have one last splash in late September. It was a little cold to go swimming, but I didn’t want to miss out on the fun of the pool. Despite the chilly weather, I had a great experience, at least until it was time to head to my car and drive home. Leaving the parking space, I accidentally went backwards and drove my Honda right through a chain-link fence and into the pool. I can’t excuse this dumb mistake, but in my defense I was still soaking wet and shivering, and that distracted me from driving. When Apple released this emoji of my car going into the pool, I was mostly curious why they had singled my situation out for an update, but I have to admit I kind of deserved it. 2. Me In My Flooding Car 
I have always been a loyal customer of Apple’s technology products, which makes this second emoji feel like a betrayal. The first emoji of my car falling into the pool was perhaps deserved, because I was extremely clumsy and foolish, but a second emoji at my expense was completely uncalled-for. Worst of all, this emoji has now been embraced by teens to represent bad sex, and they tweet messages like “my Tinder date went well but [EMOJI] FML.” I am uncomfortable having my face seen by millions of people in this context. 3. The Lifeguard Calling Me A Dunce 
I am furious with this emoji because it is inaccurate as well as cruel. Unlike Apple, the lifeguard was nothing but polite as he helped me crawl out of my underwater car’s window, and at no point did he call me a dunce. The lifeguard did ask, “What the hell happened?” and I could tell he thought I was dumb, but he did not say the word “dunce” or any other insult. Not even once. If Apple wants to taunt me with their emojis, they can at least depict things as they actually occurred. 4. The Words “Wet Idiot” Beneath Me As I Swim Out Of The Pool 
Doesn’t Apple know I already feel bad enough about swimming across a pool in my street clothes? All the other swimmers had already evacuated the pool and were watching me with judgmental eyes as I flailed through the water in jeans and a polo T-shirt. My sneakers got completely soaked and still smell mildewy weeks after drying out. This humiliation is only mitigated by the fact that the wet-idiot emoji is now extremely popular among iPhone users in China, and millions of Chinese people use it in text messages to represent amazing sex. But still, I wish Apple had elected not to release any of these. 5. Me On The Bicycle I Must Ride Now That My Car Is Ruined 
Under normal circumstances, I would be thrilled and honored to have Apple turn my bicycle into an emoji. However, given the timing, it seems like Apple is poking fun at the fact that now this bicycle is my only mode of transportation. Perhaps losing a car to a swimming pool isn’t a big deal to a rich company like Apple, but to normal folks like me, a Honda is a major investment and I cannot afford to replace it at this time. What stings worst of all is that I find this emoji very handy, and I frequently text it to people to tell them I’m on my way. Unfortunately, despite Apple’s cruel mission to shame me, I find my iPhone too useful to stop using.",0
17757,Hillary Clinton to Portray Donald Trump’s Foreign Policy Positions as Dangerous - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton plans to deliver a scorching assessment of Donald J. Trump’s foreign policy prescriptions on Thursday, casting her likely Republican rival as a threat to decades of bipartisan tenets of American diplomacy and declaring him unfit for the presidency. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides said the speech, which she will deliver in San Diego, would be the start of a persistent assault to portray a potential Trump presidency as a dangerous proposition that would weaken American alliances and embolden enemies. The argument will include specific criticism of comments Mr. Trump has made about rethinking the United States’s support of NATO his proposal to allow Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons his vow to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States and his pledge to advance the use of torture and kill the families of suspected terrorists. But Mrs. Clinton will also invoke her experiences as secretary of state, including in 2011 when she supported President Obama’s decision to send Navy SEALs on a raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, to make the case that Mr. Trump does not have the temperament to make such decisions. “Donald Trump is unlike any presidential candidate we’ve seen, maybe ever, certainly in decades, in that he does not cross the threshold of fitness for the job,” said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton’s top policy adviser, who helped draft the speech. Mrs. Clinton will deliver the address on her final campaign swing before California holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday, when she is widely expected to reach the threshold of delegates needed to secure her party’s nomination. But in choosing to raise concerns about Mr. Trump’s foreign policy stances, she will be speaking to swing voters in general election battleground states who have doubts about a Trump presidency. While Mrs. Clinton must be cautious not to alienate liberal Democrats who oppose some of her hawkish foreign policy stances, her campaign says national security could be the catalyst that drives independents and wavering Republicans to support her this fall. Roughly 21 percent of independent voters and 32 percent of Republican voters said the most important issue this election was terrorism and national security, compared with 16 percent of Democrats, according to a Suffolk   Today poll conducted last month. At the same time, 61 percent of registered voters said a Trump presidency would make America’s image in the world worse, according to the latest New York   News poll. “There are many Republicans concerned about this,” R. Nicholas Burns, an American ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration who also served on Bill Clinton’s National Security Council, said of Mr. Trump. “They find his policy positions beyond the pale, and they’re also turned off by his vulgarity. ” To that end, the Clinton campaign and its outside advisers have embarked on an effort to reach out to prominent moderate Republicans who could endorse Mrs. Clinton, largely making the case for foreign policy  . Those calls have included to an aide of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and to Nicholas F. Brady, who served as secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, with plans to reach out to James A. Baker III, a White House chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state under President George Bush. In her debates with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has defended her foreign policy decisions, including urging the Obama administration to join a   coalition to oust Col. Muammar   in Libya and her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, which she later said was a mistake. In an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton’s early support for the Iraq war, which he said he opposed, and questioned her judgment in Libya. “Bernie Sanders said it and I’m going to use it all over the place because it’s true,” Mr. Trump said. “She is a woman who is   to be president because she has bad judgment. ” As each candidate argues the other is unfit to occupy the Oval Office, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are preparing to make a case against Mr. Trump that will be jarringly different from the sparring of past presidential campaigns over foreign policy. “It’s not like the campaign against McCain or Romney, which was two competing visions,” said Derek Chollet, a former White House and Pentagon official under President Obama. Instead, he said, Mrs. Clinton will remind voters that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean government of Kim   have expressed support for Mr. Trump, who has suggested a willingness to talk directly with Mr. Kim, a pariah worldwide. Mrs. Clinton will also accuse Mr. Trump of bluster and oratory that is in direct opposition to the bipartisan pillars of American diplomacy that every president has adhered to since World War II. Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pointed to Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the United States rethink its involvement in NATO, the   coalition of European nations. Mrs. Clinton, she added, needed to explain to voters that “every single president over the last couple decades has understood the value of alliances” and that “playing by the rules makes sense for all of us. ” Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was “fraudulent” in her misrepresentation of his foreign policy positions, explaining that he supported global alliances, but believed that the United States should shoulder less of the financial burden. “Our country can’t afford to protect the world anymore, and at least not get reimbursed for it,” he said. Mrs. Clinton has delivered a series of foreign policy speeches over the course of the nominating fight that included calling for accelerating the   operation to defeat the Islamic State, ending the economic embargo against Cuba, and pledging unwavering support of Israel. And she had already begun to lay the groundwork against what she called Mr. Trump’s “reckless actions” on foreign policy. The San Diego speech, to be delivered in a city known for its military presence at a time when Mr. Trump is facing scrutiny over his donations to veterans’ groups, will present a more sweeping  —   and fearsome  —   portrayal of Mr. Trump, one that the Clinton campaign will deliver like a drumbeat to voters in the coming months. “There’s not a lot of room left in terms of new proposals,” Mr. Sullivan said. “This is a speech about a vision and principle and purpose, not individual policy proposals. ” The prospect of a foreign policy debate not centered on policy differences has confounded Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, who in a more traditional election would be facing questions about Mrs. Clinton’s call for a   zone with coalition forces to protect Syrians or how she would handle the flood of migrants to Europe. But Mr. Trump, in addressing foreign policy, has largely relied on gut instinct and appealing to voters’ emotional concerns that America has lost its standing in the world. “You do get the sense that he’s in a dialogue with a part of the electorate  —   and I consider it a minority  —   that couldn’t be less interested in facts or realities,” said Daniel Benjamin, coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department under Mrs. Clinton. “That’s a really challenging task that most of us were unprepared for in many ways. ”",0

17759,UK May Prosecute Top Banking Officials in Public Sham,"UK May Prosecute Top Banking Officials in Public Sham   27, 2016 
Imagine Jailing the Central Bankers Who Saved the world … The U.K. may be on the verge of an unprecedented experiment in public accountability. The courts may soon be invited to consider the following question: Should government officials face prosecution if the actions they took to support the financial system during the credit crisis stink in hindsight? – Bloomberg 
Finally central bankers are going to be investigated. But the investigation won’t involve the system itself or why central banks are given monopoly powers to print money. 
According to this Bloomberg article, banks and central bankers have been facing a potential day in court because banking officials coordinated monetary giveaways in 2007-2008. 
Say what? With all the immense corruption surrounding central banks, what’s under investigation has to do with whether banks were pressured to behave in a certain way so as to avoid public panic? 
More: 
In late 2007 and early 2008, with markets in a meltdown and the health of British banks under relentless scrutiny, the Bank of England belatedly pumped money into the financial system. 
With money markets seized up and liquidity hard to find, banks were invited to trade assets for central bank cash. 
At issue is whether officials nudged, steered or ordered — take your pick — financial firms to act in unison, ensuring that no single bank looked more desperate for assistance than its peers. In other words, were these transactions rigged? 
This is a truly incredible question. The world’s monetary system is rigged from top to bottom and thanks to central bank monetary manipulation is basically in an almost decade-long quasi-depression. 
Worse, most of the world’s central banks are doing something that’s never been considered in the history of money: either charging negative interest rates or seriously considering it. 
When central banks get through adjusting interest rates to even more thoroughly distort economies, they can move toward banning cash, worldwide, something that needs to be done in concert with negative interest rates. 
A ban on cash has never been tried in the whole of history. But these central bankers and their handpicked government officials are an ambitious bunch. Uruguay, for instance, has already banned cash for gasoline purchases and several European countries are embarked on even more ambitious programs. 
How about the fiddling relative to money metals? Central banks surely collude to reduce the price of gold and silver as regards other currencies. Also, many Western countries claim to have gold and silver that they evidently do not actually possess. 
Interest rate malfeasance? Savers and investors have lost trillions because of determinedly low interest rates. How about suing bankers for monopoly money manipulation? 
Or how about suing to bust-up the obvious monopoly regime exercised out of Switzerland where the Bank for International Settlements meets regularly with top central banks representing most of the money in the world. 
Put China, the US, Britain and the European Central Bank around a conference table and you’ve maybe 70 percent of the world’s money supply represented. Decisions taken at that table can change the direction of world history – and probably do on a regular basis. 
Sir Paul Tucker, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, was interviewed this year as part of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Times reported this week … 
Dan Davies, a senior research adviser at Frontline Analysts, [says]: “It’s a disproportionate amount of effort to put into a ‘crime’ that was not only victimless but socially useful.” 
Middle classes in the US supposedly have about $1,000 on hand in savings and well over $100,000 in debt. And surely the same sort of situation is present in Europe. 
Since the beginning of the Federal Reserve in 2013, the US dollar has been virtually destroyed: It’s reportedly only worth some two cents of its original value. Other major currencies are similarly debased. 
The world is facing a series of catastrophes that are much greater than a secret orchestration of banks so that one banking problem didn’t seem greater than another. 
The debt levels of countries, industries and individuals is so high that the William White – a former top official for the BIS – said early this year that there was no way out of a global default. What was necessary, he said, was a debt jubilee similar to ones that have taken place in the past. 
But British officials are worried about whether British banks and the Bank of England secretly colluded to avoid a public panic. This is the best they can come up with regarding central bank criminality? 
It’s a kind of meme, in fact. Propaganda. With the world’s economy in shreds, British bank officials are supposedly worried that their central bankers did things that “stink” in order to stabilize – “save” – the system. 
People are supposed to look at this investigation and conclude that there is no other criminality worth investigating and that in any event British officials are indeed serious about holding banks responsible for some sort of wrongdoing. 
What will be broadcast, if there is a trial, is the concern of bankers and central bankers that public panic be damped at the source – for the good of the public. 
In fact, one can visualize a scenario where any bankers brought up on these charges will look sympathetic to the public because their actions were supposedly taken to stabilize public perceptions and avoid a panic. 
Economies around the world are melting down. They are one market-crash away from nearly universal bankruptcy. The system has bestowed literally trillions of dollars of wealth on a handful of global central bank controllers while stripping almost everyone else of solvency. 
But the best British officials can do is investigate central bankers for supposedly trying to avoid making individuals banks the target of bank runs. 
The reality of central banking and its ongoing horrendous destruction will likely never be subject to real criticism until it’s too late. This sort of investigation illustrates this exactly. 
Ironically, when the world is decimated and millions, or even billions, starve due to a breakdown of the monetary economy, the same individuals now “investigating” the manipulation of public banking will suggest a global consolidation of the system. 
Conclusion: The goal is to make central bankers look endlessly sympathetic and caring to the general public. When the catastrophe finally occurs, suggestions will be made to repose even more power in these same individuals and institutions. This investigation is nothing more than a public relations sham, It is probably designed to elicit public sympathy for those it indicts, if it comes to that.",0
17760,Fate of U.S.-Cuba Thaw Is Less Certain Under Donald Trump - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama said on Saturday that the death of Fidel Castro was an occasion for Americans to “extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people” and acknowledge the “powerful emotions” the revolutionary leader had evoked in both countries, seeking to use Mr. Castro’s fraught legacy to underscore his own efforts to bury decades of bitterness between the United States and Cuba. “History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,” Mr. Obama said in a statement that neither criticized nor praised Mr. Castro. “The Cuban people,” he added, “must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America. ” The death of Mr. Castro, the embodiment of decades of suspicion and enmity between the two countries, has the potential to hasten Mr. Obama’s goal of cementing the historic rapprochement that he hopes will be a signature part of his legacy. But with Donald J. Trump, who has been critical of the détente, set to succeed Mr. Obama, the fate of the thaw between the United States and Cuba is far from clear. Mr. Trump’s initial response on the matter Saturday morning was a   post on Twitter. “Fidel Castro is dead!” he wrote. A few hours later, in a statement issued by his transition team, Mr. Trump called Mr. Castro a “brutal dictator” who had oppressed his own people for decades and left a legacy of “firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. ” “While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,” Mr. Trump said. “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. ” The statements from the president and the   were remarkable both for their differences and their similarities. While Mr. Obama steered clear of disparaging Mr. Castro, in keeping with his efforts to essentially defang a   mutual grudge, Mr. Trump condemned him. But both also described Mr. Castro’s death as a potential turning point for Cuba, and both appeared to accept as fact that its prospects for freedom and prosperity are bound up with that of the United States. During the campaign, Mr. Trump sent mixed signals about how he intended to approach American policy toward Cuba, even as Mr. Obama was using the final months of his presidency to try to codify as much of the opening as possible. While Mr. Trump said during the Republican primary race that restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba  —   a step the Obama administration took last summer  —   was “fine,” he called Mr. Obama’s December 2014 agreement with President Raúl Castro of Cuba, Mr. Castro’s younger brother, a “very weak agreement” that provided too many “concessions” to the Cubans. “All of the concessions Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them, and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands,” Mr. Trump said at a campaign event in Miami in September. “Not my demands. Our demands. ” Mr. Trump announced last week that he had named Mauricio   a fierce critic of Mr. Obama’s opening with Cuba who leads a   political action committee, to his transition team for the Treasury Department. The move was seen as a signal that Mr. Trump is considering unraveling the web of regulations Mr. Obama has put in place to ease trade and commercial restrictions against Cuba. Last month, Mr. Obama issued a sweeping directive setting forth a new United States policy to lift the Cold War trade embargo entirely  —   a move that would require congressional approval  —   and end a   of clandestine plotting against Cuba’s government. And he announced that his administration was lifting perhaps the most symbolically potent aspect of trade restrictions, the $100 limit on bringing Cuban rum and cigars into the United States. Earlier, Mr. Obama had also resumed direct flights between the two countries. “During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends  —   bonds of family, culture, commerce and common humanity,” Mr. Obama said in his statement. Advocates of the opening argued that Mr. Castro’s death could be a pivot point, clearing away the last emotionally charged remnants of a policy that has outlived its usefulness. “Symbolically, it makes a difference,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, the sponsor of bipartisan legislation to lift the embargo. “A lot of this policy for decades has not been based on sound reason. It has been based on the ghosts of the past. This could mark a major change. I don’t think it’s going to happen immediately, but symbolism is important in this relationship. ” But among Republicans, such a shift was not immediately apparent. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said that if anything, Mr. Castro’s death should stiffen the resolve of those determined to oppose the Cuban government. “The dictator has died, but dictatorship has not,” said Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. “The future of Cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights. ” Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “Sadly, Raúl Castro is no better for Cubans who yearn for freedom. ”",0
17761,Philippines: Duterte Jokes He Will Protect Soldiers Who Rape During Martial Law,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte joked in an address to soldiers this weekend that he would protect them if they raped up to three women —  but not four —  a remark that has aroused the ire of feminist groups and recalled a major controversy during his presidential campaign. [The Philippine Star reports that Duterte made the joke while addressing the 2nd Mechanized Infantry Brigade on Friday, who would soon deploy into the increasingly deadly war zone in Marawi, Mindanao, where Duterte has imposed martial law. The jihadist Maute group invaded the city last week in response to a police raid on the hideout of Isnilon Hapilon, the head of Islamic State affiliate Abu Sayyaf. The Maute group has also pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and its members appear to be cooperating with Abu Sayyaf.  “For this martial law, and the consequences of martial law, and the ramifications of martial law, I and I alone would be responsible,” Duterte told the soldiers, adding in Filipino, “Just work, I’ll take care of it. I will be the one to imprison you. If you have committed rape three times, I’ll take responsibility for it. If you marry four, son of a bitch, you’ll get beaten up. ” “Fight back.   …     I’ll give you everything you need,” he told the soldiers. Duterte previously told his army to “spare no one” in Marawi and has allowed warrantless searches and arrests on all of Mindanao, the southern island Duterte calls home. His spokesman, Ernesto Abella, explained the rape joke as an attempt to use “heightened bravado” to energize the troops. Duterte, he said, was “decisively acting, speaking with heightened bravado, that law and order would be brought back in these areas of rebellion. ” The joke has received wide condemnation from both relevant political entities and Twitter celebrities like Chelsea Clinton. Within the Philippines, politicians in the Duterte government have rejected it. “It is an injustice to our soldiers that what’s being implied is because it is martial law, they are already thinking, or that they have the license, to commit a crime as heinous as rape,” Vice President Leni Robredo said. “Duterte’s   comments only confirm some of the worst fears of human rights activists that the Duterte government will not just turn a blind eye to possible military abuses in Mindanao, but may actively encourage them,” Human Rights Watch’s Phelim Kine said in a statement. This is not the first time Duterte has come under fire for a joke about rape. During his presidential campaign last year, Duterte remarked that it was a “waste” that an Australian woman had been gang raped in his native Davao City, lamenting that he “should have been first” to have sex with her because he was the mayor at the time. Duterte refused to apologize and threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States if the government condemned the joke. He handily won the presidency and took over as head of state in June 2016. The Islamist insurgency in Marawi is the greatest challenge Duterte has faced as president so far. He responded to the raid of the city  —   in which jihadists have so far abducted priests, killed Christians and Muslim “traitors” who could not recite Islamic prayers, freed more than 100 jihadists from a local prison, and flown the Islamic State flag over the city’s mosques. “If I think that you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there is an open defiance, you will die,” Duterte promised the terrorists last week. While Mindanao is home to a substantial Muslim population, the Philippines is an 86 percent Catholic country, with another six percent of citizens identifying as Christian  . Only about five percent of the country identifies as Muslim. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",0

17763,"Donald Trump’s Aging Air Fleet Gives His Bid, and His Brand, a Lift - The New York Times","Of all the things connected to Donald J. Trump, few have given him more mileage than his fleet of aircraft. His Boeing 757 jet, often referred to as Trump Force One, has received the full    lifestyle treatment The Washington Post even queried whether it was better than Air Force One. One of Mr. Trump’s helicopters has gotten similar coverage an interior renovation made CNBC’s “Secret Lives of the Super Rich” in a segment entitled “Pimp My Chopper. ” A close look at Mr. Trump’s two airplanes  —   the 757 and a smaller jet used on the campaign trail  —   and three helicopters, however, suggests that their value rests chiefly in their marketing potential, with the Trump stamp of status masking the fleet’s age. Four of the five aircraft are more than 20 years old, a rarity for most billionaires. The exception is a    Cessna 750 Citation X  —   the only one of the five without the Trump name painted on it in large letters. The smaller plane was grounded last week after The New York Times reported that its registration had expired in January. It is now cleared to fly again, according to the F. A. A. Most people who own aircraft do not have more than one or two. Even those who can afford to own planes often lease or charter them instead, offering a layer of ease and anonymity. But anonymity is not Mr. Trump’s style. The Boeing, built in 1991 to seat roughly 200 people, is Mr. Trump’s favorite flying toy, he said in an interview on Saturday. The jet, which once did duty with a commercial airline in Mexico in the 1990s, has been famously renovated. It has a bedroom the fixtures are brushed with   gold and the toilet seats were reupholstered with Edelman leather, which also graces the Eames chairs in Ivanka Trump’s den. “It’s like a new plane,” Mr. Trump said in a documentary that showed off some of the renovations. “The plane is very much an extension of the Trump brand. ” While the 757 might seem like an odd choice for a man who puts his net worth at $11 billion, and, records show, does not use the plane much to travel abroad, Mr. Trump has cited it and his other planes as proof of how he gets good value for his money. In the 1980s, for example, he paid $8 million to buy a 1968 Boeing 727 from a financially troubled Texas company, Diamond Shamrock, according to his book “The Art of the Deal. ” Mr. Trump said a smaller Gulfstream jet would have cost more than twice as much. “It was a little more plane than I needed,” he wrote, “but I find it hard to resist a good deal when the opportunity presents itself. ” In the interview on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he did not own the five aircraft to burnish his brand, but agreed that the fleet had “promotional value. ” He added that he could get by without owning a Boeing 757 but it was a “great luxury to have. ” Air travel is one of the largest expenses of Mr. Trump’s Republican presidential campaign: A company he owns has charged the campaign approximately $3. 7 million in travel costs since he announced his candidacy in June 2015. Using the 757 does not help keep costs down: It guzzles fuel and costs thousands of dollars an hour to fly, more than private planes being used to shuttle other presidential candidates. Still, Mr. Trump has used it to crisscross the country, sometimes with just a small group of people aboard. The Boeing also weighs more than 100, 000 pounds, making it too heavy to land at many smaller airports, including one at Teterboro, N. J. the airport of choice for wealthy New Yorkers like Mr. Trump. Instead it must fly in and out of La Guardia Airport in Queens, which Mr. Trump, and others,  have likened to what one might find in a third world country. La Guardia does offer a marketing perk: The 757 can often be seen at the airport, a billboard on wheels. Mr. Trump said that he was aware of the Boeing’s limitations and that he did not “use it that much. ” According to F. A. A. records, the Boeing has flown about 333 hours between Mr. Trump’s announcement of his intention to run for president last June and March 16, 2016. During the same stretch, F. A. A. records show, the Cessna has flown roughly 216 hours. A review by The Times shows most of the hours logged were for campaign travel. Large jets are popular among professional sports teams and rock bands, which have to move large groups and equipment. Still, some individuals and companies do own such aircraft. Ronald W. Burkle, a billionaire investor who owns stakes in a number of companies, including Whole Foods Market, flies on a Boeing 757 registered to his firm. Las Vegas Sands, a casino operator run by the billionaire Sheldon Adelson, has several larger planes that are used to transport company executives and Sands customers. Buying older planes has advantages: In addition to being less expensive, their depreciation costs are lower. Mr. Trump said he liked older planes because they had been “tested” and had “been around. ” For Mr. Trump, doing things bigger than most has been a guiding principle, as reflected in his penchant for slapping his name on buildings and planes. In June 1989 he launched the Trump Shuttle, after paying $365 million to buy the old Eastern Airlines shuttle operations, which connected New York City with Boston and Washington. The deal is not counted among his more successful ventures. In 1990 he defaulted on his loan and lost control of the airline to a group of lenders. Around the same time, a helicopter shuttle service he ran also fizzled. As for Mr. Trump’s personal travel, he prefers to fly private. In 2009, he decided to sell his Boeing 727, which was by then 41 years old. He replaced it with another used aircraft, the Boeing 757. A company controlled by the billionaire Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft, had bought that plane in 1995. Mr. Allen did a full renovation, transforming it into a luxurious private jet. He installed a master suite that included a bathroom and guest room. He put a conference table, overhead projector and bar in the center of the aircraft. This room had two couches and 11 single seats, according to F. A. A. records. Elsewhere on the plane, Mr. Allen installed 12 sleeper seats, each with their own foldout monitors.  He agreed to sell it to Mr. Trump in 2010, records show. The purchase price was not disclosed, though it was widely reported that Mr. Trump paid $100 million. The aircraft was insured at a value of $35 million in 2011, records show, and aviation experts say it is currently worth about $18 million. Boeing no longer makes 757s, but a 2015 Boeing Business Jet would sell for approximately $80 million, and cost anywhere from $20 million to $40 million to outfit. After Mr. Trump took possession of the 757 in 2011 he made a number of changes but did not fundamentally undo Mr. Allen’s initial renovation, records show. For instance, he kept the headboard in the master bedroom, as well as most of the chairs, couches and toilet seats Mr. Allen had left, choosing to reupholster them. Greg Raiff, chief executive officer of Private Jet Services, an aviation consulting firm and   charter broker for corporations and individuals, said the Boeing was an unusual aircraft for a man of Mr. Trump’s wealth. “Buying a    757 is like buying a bag of Cheetos. It’s a lot of food for a low price,” he said. The Cessna was previously owned by NetJets, an aircraft company that caters to the nation’s wealthiest people, and has flown more than other planes its age, records show. It was worth $15. 3 million new and has a current resale value of approximately $3. 2 million, according to an estimate by Vref Publishing, a company that supplies information about aircraft values. The Times paid Vref to value the plane based on publicly available information. Mr. Trump’s three other aircraft are helicopters. Two of those are 1989 Sikorsky   one of which was used to give rides to children at the Iowa State Fair. Mr. Trump took possession of the other 1989 in August 2014. It has logged only a handful of flights with the F. A. A. since he took possession, records show, though not all chopper flights are logged with the federal regulator. One notable trip that it received clearance to make was on New Year’s Eve in 2015, when, records show, it was given authorization to fly to Nassau, in the Bahamas, from West Palm Beach, Fla. Both helicopters are worth approximately $875, 000, according to Vref. The third helicopter, a 1990 Sikorsky   was purchased in March 2012 and is currently worth roughly $940, 000. The Trump Organization has used pictures of it to help market its golf courses. It was shipped to Scotland in 2015, for the use of clients of Trump Turnberry Resort in Scotland. “The sky’s the limit at Trump Turnberry, with exclusive helicopter charter now available for guests for quick and seamless travel to destinations across Scotland and beyond,” the resort’s website reads.",0
17764,Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver Expected Yields,"Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver Expected Yields 10/31/2016 
ALL GOV 
The controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat. 
But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem — genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides. 
The promise of genetic modification was twofold: By making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests, they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the world’s growing population, while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides. 
Twenty years ago, Europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the United States and Canada were embracing it. Comparing results on the two continents, using independent data as well as academic and industry research, shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise. 
An analysis by The Times using U.N. data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany . Also, a recent National Academy of Sciences report found “there was little evidence” that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the United States had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops. 
At the same time, herbicide use has increased in the United States, even as major crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties. And the United States has fallen behind Europe’s biggest producer, France, in reducing the overall use of pesticides, which includes both herbicides and insecticides. 
One measure, contained in data from the U.S. Geological Survey , shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides. Since GM crops were introduced in the United States two decades ago for crops like corn, cotton and soybeans, the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third, but the spraying of herbicides, which are used in much higher volumes, has risen 21 percent. 
By contrast, in France, use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen 65 percent and herbicide use has decreased 36 percent.

17765,"“If Trump Loses, I’m Grabbing My Musket”: Former Congressman Ready to Go Full Revolution","
This election remains more heated than any other in modern history – and for many, it has become a call to arms, even if only metaphorically.
Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies – Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example – and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote – the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence.
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ‘pick up a musket’ if Trump loses the election.
On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump.
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket.
You in?
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 

 
Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election.
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms – racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent.
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement.
via CNN :
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
[…]
Walsh … did respond to CNN’s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: “What exactly does that mean?”
“It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,” he responded to Tapper. 
@jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back.
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 

After a firestorm on social media, Walsh doubled down, stating on Twitter:
I’m serious. I don’t think a musket would do much good these days, but it’s time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 

His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS – just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about.
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses – acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America.
Could Hillary’s reported election victory – or Donald Trump’s defeat – signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or “rigged”? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election.
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest.
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment’s “selection” for president:
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny.
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after.
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election 
Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre.
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) – Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed.
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) – Possible new acronym or term for “Martial Law”. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario.
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military 
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end.
How far will things go?
And will things ever be reset without a new American Revolution?

17766,Americas Rocky Road to Raqqa    : Information," Americas Rocky Road to Raqqa
Though the U.S. has no legal right to operate inside Syria, Official Washington is boasting about its plans to liberate Raqqa from ISIS. But another problem: the battle plan makes no sense, says Daniel Lazare. By Daniel Lazare
 "" Consortium News "" - In her final debate with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton promised that the United States and its allies would follow up the offensive against ISIS-occupied Mosul with an assault on ISIS headquarters in Raqqa in neighboring Syria. Last week, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter assured the press that an offensive was on the way.
It starts in the next few weeks, Carter said . That has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both, i.e. dual assaults on Mosul and Raqqa.
We think this is the right moment to begin pushing in Raqqa, a Pentagon spokesman added on Monday. There is a plan in place to begin this.
Except that the more the administration assures the public that an assault is just around the corner, the more distant it seems to become. In fact, it looks more and more like an assault on Raqqa wont occur at all. The reason is simple. The strategy is half-baked even by U.S. standards.
The effort to take back Mosul is off to a dangerous enough start as it is. The problem is not the military campaign, which seems to be making good progress as Iraqi troops enter the city for the first time in two years . Rather, it is the larger political setting.
Powerful cross-currents are at work involving the Iraqi army, Turkey, Iranian-backed Shiite militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces, or Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, and the Kurdish Peshmerga. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkeys neo-Ottoman president, has unsettled the Iraqis by claiming that Mosul lies within his countrys traditional sphere of influence and by vowing to protect the citys Sunni population against revenge by Al-Hashd for anti-Shiite atrocities committed by ISIS (also known as ISIL, Islamic State, and Daesh).
Unfortunately, Erdogans fears are not unfounded since Al-Hashd has already been accused of atrocities in Tikrit and Fallujah while at least one militia leader has sworn to take vengeance in Mosul as well. [See Consortiumnews.coms  Clintons Slog Deeper into the Big Muddy .]
Although the Iraqi government has promised that the militias will confine their activities to the citys outskirts, the Iraqi army is seen as hardly less threatening since its Shiite flags are now ubiquitous . Mosul residents also feel threatened by the Kurds since they remember all too well when the Peshmerga took over in the wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion, sparking a wave of looting that stripped the city clean .
Shiite militia members similarly remember when they clashed with the Kurds in the central Iraqi town of Tuz Khurma as recently as April and are leery of coming into contact with them as well.
Leery Allies
So everyone is leery of everyone else, which means that the more such forces converge on Mosul, the greater the risk that years of accumulated fears and hatreds will reach a critical mass and explode.
Erdogan is meanwhile refusing to abandon a military beachhead that he maintains in the small town of Bashiqa a few miles to the northeast, while Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is threatening that Turkey will be  dismantled  if it tries to mount a full-scale invasion.
We do not want war with Turkey, Abadi said, and we do not want a confrontation with Turkey. But if a confrontation happens, we are ready for it. We will consider [Turkey] an enemy and we will deal with it as an enemy.
Turkeys reply has been to continue massing troops, tanks, and other military hardware on the Iraqi border just 90 miles to the north. On Wednesday, it piled on yet more abuse as Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu demanded of Abadi, If you have the strength, why did you surrender Mosul to terror organizations?
But as dangerous as all this is, the situation some 280 miles to the west around Raqqa in Syria is even worse. As the U.S. tries to assemble a force capable of taking on ISIS, it finds itself picking its way through a list of contenders that is little short of dizzying.
In addition to Syria, Russia and Turkey, the list includes the so-called Free Syrian Army; Kurdish Peoples Protection Units known as the YPG; Sunni Arabs who have joined with the YPG in an umbrella federation known as the Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF; plus the same Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq that have lately begun threatening to cross the border and join in the assault on Raqqa as well.
Also dizzying are the local animosities. While Turkey gets along well with Masoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish autonomous zone in northern Iraq, the story is very different in northern Syria, where the left-leaning YPG is dominant. Since the YPGs parent body, the Kurdish Democratic Union, is allied with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been leading an insurgency inside Turkey since the 1980s, Erdogan sees the militia as no better than Islamic State and possibly even worse.
The YPG feels the same way, describing Erdogan and ISIS as nothing less than brothers under the skin. The YPG is hostile to the Free Syrian Army since it took part in last summers Turkish incursion into northern Syria, whose primary goal was to prevent Kurdish militia units in northeastern Syria from hooking up with fellow YPG fighters in the northwest. The FSA, meanwhile, is not only anti-YPG but anti-U.S. even though its Turkish sponsors are nominally pro.
Thus, Free Syrian Army members erupted in anti-American chanting when a convoy of U.S. commandoes showed up in the Turkish-occupied town of Al-Rai in mid-September, forcing the Americans to flee .
Christians and Americans have no place among us, one militant shouted . They want to wage a crusader war to occupy Syria. Another called out: The collaborators of America are dogs and pigs. They wage a crusader war against Syria and Islam.
This is one of the groups that Washington classifies as secular and moderate. Still, Washingtons hope is that the various factions will put their differences aside long enough to liberate Raqqa. The prospect seems unlikely especially since fighting between the Turkish-backed FSA and the YPG seems to be spreading.
Turkey Killing Kurds
On Oct. 20, Turkish jets and artillery pounded YPG-SDF positions northeast of Aleppo, killing as many as 200 fighters. Since then, the two groups  Turkey and the Free Syrian Army on one side, the YPG and anti-Turkish Arabs of the SDF on the other  have been engaged in a struggle for control of ISIS-occupied Al-Bab, 20 miles or so south of the Turkish border and roughly the same distance northeast of Aleppo.
If Turkish-FSA forces take Al-Bab, then Kurdish hopes of linking up their forces in northeastern and northwestern Syria will have been dashed. The FSA would then be in a position to push east to Raqqa, which would mean a clash with both the main body of the YPG and ISIS. Or, as the often perceptive Moon of Alabama website suggests , it could instead wheel about and attempt to relieve its fellow Salafists besieged in Aleppo.
That would mean a head-on collision with Syrian government forces and exposure to Russian jets, a point that a Syrian government helicopter drove home last week by bombing Turkish-FSA forces engaged in combat with the YPG.
Internecine warfare like this can only benefit Islamic State, an undisputed expert at using its opponents differences to its own advantage. This is why it was able to put down roots in Syria in the first place  because the U.S. was too busy trying to topple Bashar al-Assad to worry about an Al Qaeda offshoot that Obama famously dismissed as nothing more than  a JV team .
Its also why Islamic State was able to establish bases and supply lines in Turkey  because Erdogan was more concerned with fighting Assad and the Kurds to concern himself with what his fellow Sunnis were up to. A northern Syrian and Iraqi landscape torn by infighting is perfect for a hyper-violent Sunni-Salafist group skilled at playing one group off against another.
The White House dimly senses that it has gotten itself into a mess, which is why officials turn vague and inscrutable whenever reporters press for details concerning a reported assault on Raqqa. The problem, as the U.S. officials see it, is that Erdogan remains unalterably opposed to the YPG-SDF even though it is the only ground force capable of fighting Islamic State. Hence, it is impossible to take Raqqa without alienating a fellow member of NATO.
We do not need terrorist organizations like the PYD-YPG, Erdogan says he told Obama in an Oct. 26 phone call , referring to the militia and Kurdish Democratic Union. I said, Come, lets remove [Islamic State] from Raqqa together. We will sort this out together with you. We have the strength.
The U.S. doubts that Erdogan does have that capability yet is unable to say no. The upshot is talks, negotiations, and growing delays. Jennifer Cafarella, a Syria expert at the neocon Institute for the Study of War, grouses that the administration is stalling while, on the other side of the debate, foreign-policy realists wonder why the administration is rushing ahead with a strategy that it knows wont work.
Skeptical Analysis
In a hard-hitting analysis in the conservative but often skeptical National Interest, Daniel L. Davis, a retired army colonel and Afghan veteran, points out that whereas a national army, well-armed militias, U.S. ground and intelligence forces, and resupply lines through friendly territory are all in place in northern Iraq, none of those things exist with regard to Raqqa. The political problems, he adds, are even more daunting.
When Kurdish units liberated the ISIS-occupied town of Manbij in August, Davis notes, grateful residents told YPG members, You are our children, you are our heroes, you are the blood of our hearts. Yet the YPGs reward was to be denounced as terrorists by Erdogan and instructed to leave by the U.S.
What possible assurances could the United States give to the Kurds, Davis writes, that upon successful liberation of Raqqa, the Turkish army isnt going to turn on them? Why would the Turks bomb the Kurdish troops one day and then work with them the next, or allow the Kurds to maintain a presence after liberating Raqqa? There is no recognizable logic in these unsubstantiated hopes.
Davis is correct. But, then, there is no recognizable logic in the Obama administrations intervention in Syria in general. Why insist that Assad step down, for example, when the only effect will be to clear a path for Al Qaeda and Islamic State straight through to the presidential palace in Damascus?
Why back a Turkish incursion into northern Syria when the only result is to infuriate Kurds who are the only effective anti-ISIS fighting force that the U.S. has on its side? Why insist that the U.S. wants a democratic solution to the Syrian civil war when the countries backing the anti-Assad forces, i.e. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil monarchies, are some of the most undemocratic societies on earth?
None of it makes sense. But since the Israelis, Turks and Saudis all want Assad to go, the Obama administration feels that it has no choice but to comply. How else can it keep a fractious empire together if not by catering to its client states whims and desires?
When empires are strong, they can afford to say no. But when they are weak and over-extended, they do as they are told. This is why the U.S. is frozen with regard to Raqqa. It cant disappoint its allies by calling an assault off, and it cant push ahead with a plan that doesnt add up. So it dawdles.

17767,NBC Reviving ’Must-See TV’ Thursdays with ’Will &amp Grace’ - Breitbart,"NEW YORK (AP)  —   NBC is bringing back its “  TV” Thursday franchise this fall with the revival of “Will  Grace,” and by moving its heartwarming hit “This is Us” to the same night. [The network announced its schedule Sunday, kicking off the annual week where broadcasters outline next season’s plans to advertisers. NBC is the second most popular network behind CBS, first among the younger viewers it covets, and is bullish on next year since it will show the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl.  The comedy “Will  Grace,” which originally aired from 1998 to 2006, unites its original ensemble of Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally with the original creative team. If the resumption goes well, NBC hopes there will be more than the 12 episodes now on order, said Robert Greenblatt, NBC entertainment chairman. “Will  Grace” will kick off Thursday’s lineup, followed by “Great News,” a sophomore comedy produced by Tina Fey. Greenblatt said Fey will appear periodically on air next season, too. The key to reestablishing Thursday nights, which NBC dominated during the 1980s and 1990s, is bringing the fans who made “This is Us” the year’s biggest new hit, to that night at 9 p. m. The show also gets the   slot after next winter’s Super Bowl. Greenblatt sounded conflicted about how much NBC will push the “  TV” concept promotionally. “I’m not saying it’s going to be emblazoned with   letters atop the Empire State Building, but we’re going to use it,” he said. NBC will introduce eight new series next season but sprinkle them throughout the year. Only the “Will  Grace” reboot, a Dick   limited series on the Menendez murders and “The Brave,” an action series starring Anne Heche as an undercover military hero, will begin in the fall. Doing it that way illustrates the elastic nature of broadcast television, when shows drop on and off the schedule throughout the year, and the goal is to reduce repeats. As a result, Greenblatt wouldn’t say when the other five new series will appear. Some established shows, like “Chicago Med” and “Little Big Shots” were renewed but don’t have announced spots on the schedule yet. The     nature of TV will be a barrier for NBC: the Thursday schedule it hopes becomes dominant will be   for pro football in the fall and the Winter Olympics. NBC said it was offered “American Idol,” which rival ABC announced it was bringing back next season. NBC said the strength of “The Voice,” which will add former “Idol” stars Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson as coaches next year, and its other development led it to say no, thanks. “The audience didn’t tell us there was a compelling reason to bring it back, either,” said Paul Telegdy, president of NBC’s alternative and reality series. NEW SERIES, Other new series ordered by NBC:  —  “Good Girls,” a drama about three suburban moms who rob the local supermarket. It’s described as a mix between “Thelma  Louise” and “Breaking Bad”  —  “Reverie,” a thriller about a former hostage negotiator brought on to save people lost in a virtual reality program,  —  “Rise,” a drama starring Josh Radnor as a teacher who revives a lackluster high school theater department,  —  “A. P. Bio,” a comedy produced by Lorne Michaels and Seth Meyers about a philosophy scholar who goes to work teaching biology in high school,  —  “Champions,” a Mindy   series about a gym owner and his brother who must cope with a new   in the household. ___, NEVER CAN SAY GOODBYE, After first announcing the cancellation of the time travel series “Timeless,” NBC bowed to fan complaints and said it would bring the freshman series back. NBC also didn’t include some other series in its order for next season  —   “Chicago Justice,” ″Trial  Error” and “The Carmichael Show”  —   but Greenblatt said that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re dead. ___, “NEW GIRL” There’s good news and bad news for fans of the Zooey Deschanel’s Fox series “New Girl. ” Fox, which will present its schedule Monday, announced a day in advance that the series will be back for a seventh season  —   but that will be its last.",0
17768,The Election Results Are Already In,"

What appears to be test pages for graphics clientele for news stations across the country could in fact turn out to be another Dewey wins moment or more recently, akin to the BBC reporting the collapse of building 7 on 911â€Ś before it happened.
Election night results are big business. WorldNow.com, a 17 year old CMS and digital tech provider was recently publicly traded to San Francisco based messaging company Frankly for $45 million. SO it comes as no surprise that yet another facet of the election process is out of the oversight of citizens and in the greedy hands of the corporatocracy.
NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results. The results page appears to be similar to what mainstream news networks display on election night, including Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting.
As Jim Stone notes, the page was pulled directly from the WorldNow.com content management platform utilized by major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox and appears to be a non-public staging area for news and election results. The original page has since been reset.

17770,Donald Trump Seizes Hillary Clinton’s Absence to Press His Case - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump hurled himself into a new effort to reshape the presidential race on Monday, scrambling to allay voters’ concerns about his temperament and put Hillary Clinton on the defensive over her critical comments about many of Mr. Trump’s supporters. Though Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has largely withheld comment about Mrs. Clinton’s health, showing uncharacteristic restraint after her campaign announced she had pneumonia, he took Mrs. Clinton’s unexpected absence from public view as an opportunity to press his case with ferocity. Among Mr. Trump’s advisers, there is a sense of urgency. With eight weeks left in the race  —   and just two before his first debate with Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee  —   Mr. Trump may never again have such a window to make his argument to voters more or less uninterrupted. Without a forceful message and iron discipline heading into the debates, Mr. Trump could struggle mightily to overcome the deeply rooted opposition to his candidacy. An ABC   Post poll published over the weekend showed Mrs. Clinton with a    edge over Mr. Trump nationally, with six in 10 voters describing Mr. Trump as unqualified and biased against women and minorities. Mr. Trump seized the chance on Monday to turn the charge of intolerance against Mrs. Clinton: Denouncing the allegation that his supporters were bigoted, Mr. Trump argued in a speech in Baltimore that Mrs. Clinton had shown “contempt” for voters by deriding many of his supporters as racist and sexist, calling them a “basket of deplorables” at a   on Friday. At a rally on Monday night in North Carolina, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was running a “  and negative campaign. ” The Trump campaign also announced the support of R. James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, to reassure voters of Mr. Trump’s readiness for the presidency. Mr. Trump made no mention of Mrs. Clinton’s health in his campaign speeches. During two television interviews on Monday morning, he said he wished Mrs. Clinton well. He also did not revive his frequent accusation that Mrs. Clinton lacks the physical strength to be president, though he suggested vaguely that “something is going on. ” Instead, he used a speech to the National Guard Association of the United States to defend his supporters at length, arguing that they were right to be concerned about border security and crime, and that those concerns did not indicate a hateful view of racial and religious minorities. “If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don’t see how she can credibly campaign any further,” Mr. Trump said, demanding an apology. He claimed that his campaign was doing “amazingly well with   and Hispanic workers. ” But Mr. Trump, who records little support in the polls among racial minorities and educated whites, did not address any of the past remarks that have contributed to his low standing with those groups. He has continued to call for a crackdown on immigrants who are in the country illegally, and has declined to retract his false assertions in the past that President Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Trump has also not expressed regret for clashing with the family of a slain Muslim Army captain or renounced his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country. Mrs. Clinton has rebuked Mr. Trump over the last month for what she has called his promotion of racially insensitive messages and policies and his alignment with leaders of the movement known as the “” which is widely seen as holding fringe and racist views. Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster, said that Mr. Trump appeared to be recovering his footing in the race, but that it might be too late for him to change many voters’ longstanding assessment of his character and capabilities. “Hillary Clinton clearly won the summer, and there’s little doubt Donald Trump dug himself a very deep hole in the aftermath of the nominating conventions,” Mr. Blizzard said. “While Trump is starting to climb out of that hole now, his ability to take advantage of a few bad weeks for Clinton is going to be limited due to enduring views about his judgment, his temperament and his rhetoric toward other ethnicities and women. ” And Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Trump will be able to reinvent himself by using Mrs. Clinton’s biting comments as a shield. Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who advises a   “super PAC,” described an exercise he uses in focus groups, asking voters to write down three words to describe Mr. Trump before the discussion begins. “People use the word ‘racist’ consistently to describe him,” Mr. Garin said. “But they also talk about him as a dangerous egomaniac. ” Still, on a conference call with top supporters Monday, advisers to Mr. Trump spoke of Mrs. Clinton’s turbulent stretch as a source of relief: For the first time in a while, they said, they were starting the week on offense, according to people who participated in the call who spoke on condition of anonymity about a private discussion. Campaign surrogates were told to hammer Mrs. Clinton for her description of Trump voters, and to say as little as possible about her pneumonia diagnosis. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army officer who advises Mr. Trump, said there was optimism in the campaign that the momentum of the race had “totally shifted in Mr. Trump’s favor. ” He predicted that voters would see a distinction between “a guy who made all kinds of comments as he was fighting to win the primaries” and the Donald Trump of the general election. Mr. Trump has taken other steps in recent days to steady his candidacy, moving to shore up his campaign in crucial swing states. With Mrs. Clinton holding a daunting advantage on the Electoral College map, Mr. Trump aimed a new television campaign at the four most critical states for his candidacy: Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. He has given his aides greater leeway in directing his television advertising, allowing the campaign to focus on that smaller cluster of states, a change from as recently as two weeks ago, when Mr. Trump was personally choosing where to run television ads, according to two people briefed on the Trump operation. Mr. Trump also removed the head of his Florida operation last week, replacing her with Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican operative close to Gov. Rick Scott. And Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, who is still a trusted adviser, has visited New Hampshire in recent weeks, meeting with senior Republicans there and making suggestions on spending and strategy decisions in the state, two people familiar with his activities said. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump and his allies can maintain this level of determined focus. Numerous times, Mr. Trump has briefly adopted a more disciplined pose on the campaign trail, only to give in quickly to the temptation to taunt and brawl. Even on Monday morning, as he refrained from taunting Mrs. Clinton in a television interview, Mr. Trump made an offhand reference to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as “Pocahontas. ” Ms. Warren, a Democrat, has described herself as having Native American heritage. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have suggested in the past that Mrs. Clinton’s health should be fair game. Blaise Ingoglia, the chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said he considered Mrs. Clinton’s handling of her health a legitimate campaign issue because she did not immediately disclose that she had pneumonia. “The disturbing part of that whole thing is that the campaign is willing to conceal that instead of being up front and honest,” he said. “You really start to question: What else is being concealed?”",0
17771,Paralyzed NYPD Detective Who Forgave Shooter Remembered as Hero - Breitbart,"A sea of blue, family and friends gathered in a funeral mass in St. Patrick’s Cathedral Friday morning to bid a final farewell to an iconic hero NYPD Detective Steven McDonald. [“My dad was a real superman,” Sgt. Conor McDonald, the son of McDonald, who followed in his father’s footsteps, said during the funeral ceremony. “My dad wanted to make sure his time on earth was not wasted ant that is why he was so passionate in spreading God’s message of love and forgiveness. ”  In July of 1986, McDonald was working as an undercover cop in Central Park, where he stopped to question three suspicious boys. During the stop, one of the boys, Shavod Jones pulled out a .  and shot McDonald three times. One of the bullets hit McDonald in his neck, piercing through his spinal cord and ultimately paralyzing him.  McDonald was left quadriplegic, unable to breathe on his own, and would depend on a ventilator to breathe for the rest of his life. According to doctors, McDonald was given less than five years to live, but overcame all odds and survived for 30 years. Eight months after the shooting, McDonald publicly forgave Jones during his son Conor’s christening. “I feel sorry for him,” McDonald said. “I forgive him, and hope that he can find peace and purpose in his life. ” Remaining an active member in the NYPD, McDonald would spend the next 30 years speaking and mentoring young NYPD officers during roll call, attending every brother and   ’s graduation ceremony and funeral. He also would became one of the world’s foremost pilgrims, spreading his message of “Faith and Forgiveness” to Israel, Ireland and Bosnia. McDonald suffered a heart attack last Friday and was taken off life support Tuesday afternoon.  NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill remembered McDonald for his impact he had in spreading his message across the world.  “Steven is a life that underscores why people want to become police officers,” O’Neill said. “Despite using a ventilator, Steven’s voice was always strong, just like his message. ” O’Neill added, “Steven was one of the most remarkable men I ever met and one of the most fearless cops to ever die in a uniform. He helped redefine what a hero is in the NYPD. ” Also in attendance were former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly and Bill Bratton, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and David Dickins. Notable celebrities such as former ‘Late Show’ host David Letterman and former New York Ranger Adam Graves were also among those who attended the hero cop funeral. Cardinal Timothy Dolan began the mass, remembering the life of McDonald. “We are here as an act of faith,” Dolan said. “We are here to pray that Steven is now enjoying eternal life as he believed and to thank God for Steven’s splendid life of service. ”   Donald Trump took to Twitter to praise McDonald, calling him a “real NYC hero. ” A beautiful funeral today for a real NYC hero, Detective Steven McDonald. Our law enforcement community has my complete and total support.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2017, ",0
17772,Takata Airbag Recall Is Said to Grow by 35 Million - The New York Times,"Regulators are expected to announce as early as Wednesday that at least 35 million additional airbags made by Takata will need to be fixed, according to a person briefed on the matter. This would more than double what is already the largest automotive recall in American history. The airbags can unexpectedly explode, sending metal parts hurtling into the cabin. At least 11 deaths worldwide have been linked to the defect. The expansion would bring the total of recalled Takata airbags to at least 63 million in the United States  —   possibly affecting nearly one in four of the 250 million vehicles on America’s roads. At issue is Takata’s use of a compound called ammonium nitrate, which can become unstable over time or when it is exposed to moisture. Takata has wrestled with the makeup of the compound over the years, eventually adding a drying agent to make it more stable. The new recalls focus on airbags that do not have the drying agent. Scott Upham, founder and chief executive of the automotive consulting firm Valient Market Research, said that the wider recall was an admission by Takata that its use of ammonium nitrate  —   a cheap, but potent, compound more often used at   sites like coal mines  —   was a safety risk. “Finally, there’s enough scientific evidence to point to the humidity issue as affecting the propellant,” Mr. Upham said. “For a long period of time, they denied that ammonium nitrate was to blame. But this does validate there are fundamental issues with the chemical itself. ” Ever since the first Takata airbag recall of about 4, 000 vehicles in 2008, the company insisted for years that the problems did not lie in the design of the airbag inflaters with ammonium nitrate, but instead were the result of manufacturing flaws or quality control problems. Internally, though, it harbored doubts, quashing the results of tests that failed, manipulating data to conform with automakers’ safety requirements and continually revising patents. But only in May last year did Takata admit that its products were, in fact, defective. Then in a consent order issued last November, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Japanese parts maker until the end of 2018 to prove that the airbag inflaters without the drying agent were safe. The agency imposed a $70 million penalty that could increase by $130 million if Takata does not meet the consent order’s terms. In levying the penalty, regulators noted that Takata had produced testing reports that contained selective or inaccurate data. The new round of recalls to be announced this week was prompted by findings of three separate investigations into the rupture conducted by Honda Motor, the automaker most affected by the recalls Takata and a consortium of 10 automakers. The agency has said that ultimately, more than 100 million airbag inflaters that use ammonium nitrate may need to be recalled. Takata has until the end of 2019 to show that its inflaters that contain the drying agent are safe. The safety agency has also barred Takata from using ammonium nitrate for new orders. In a statement, the safety agency said it could not comment on plans for an expanded recall. But it said the agency had reviewed the findings of investigations into the Takata airbag ruptures and would “take all appropriate actions to make sure airbags in Americans’ vehicles are safe. ” Takata said in a statement that it was “working with regulators and our automaker customers to develop   orderly solutions to these important safety issues. ” The expanded recall was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. The growing recall, though, has been anything but orderly, and Takata now faces new financial pressure. It already appeared to be heading for a second consecutive year of losses, and the company said on Monday that it planned to to book special   charges totaling 20. 1 billion yen, or $189 million, to cover recall costs and settlements with consumers injured by its inflaters. That would more than negate the 5 billion yen of net profit, or $47 million, it forecast in its most recent earnings guidance. The company is scheduled to report final results for its latest fiscal year on May 11. As for consumers, the mere announcement of the newly expanded recall is likely to sow more confusion in what has been a dizzyingly complex problem. Even as automakers look to other suppliers to provide them with replacement inflaters, there has been a persistent shortage of parts in many areas of the country, forcing many car owners to ask for loaners if they can get them or drive their cars knowing of the danger. All the while, doubts over ammonium nitrate have persisted as the human toll has mounted. In December, a Georgia man, Joel Knight, died on a South Carolina highway when the airbag in his Ford Ranger ruptured after his truck hit a cow, sending metal into his neck. He bled to death, not knowing that the airbag posed a risk because it had not been recalled. The Ranger has since been recalled. Mark Lillie, a former Takata engineer who raised concerns about the ammonium nitrate propellant in the late 1990s, said he felt vindicated by Takata’s expanded recall. But he said he remained concerned that the ammonium nitrate remained vulnerable, even with the drying agent, which is called a desiccant. “Undoubtedly, the desiccant will reduce the problem, and delay the onset of the problem,” he said. “But it can’t eliminate the problem. ”",0
17773,President Trump Makes Amul R. Thapar First Lower Court Appointment,"President Donald Trump announced his first federal appeals court nomination on Tuesday, naming Amul R. Thapar of Kentucky to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. [Thapar currently serves on the District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. The White House released news of the appointment which noted that President George W. Bush nominated Thapar in 2008 which led to his confirmation and appointment. The son of   immigrants, he was the first Article III judge of South Asian descent in the U. S.  Prior to becoming a judge, Thapar served as U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky and Assistant U. S. Attorney in the Southern District of Ohio and the District of Columbia according to the White House. Thapar has worked for both Williams  Connolly in Washington, D. C. and Squire, Sanders  Dempsey in Cincinnati during his time in private practice according to the National Law Journal. He has ruled on multiple notable cases including one in 2016 in which he ruled against restrictions on judges’ political involvement.

17774,Pakistan Shrine Bombing Kills Scores in Worst Attack in Months - The New York Times,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  —   A suicide bomber turned a spiritual dance celebration at a revered religious shrine into a slaughterhouse on Thursday, killing at least 70 people and wounding more than 250 in the worst act of terrorism to hit Pakistan in months. At least 50 of the wounded were critically hurt in the explosion at the Sufi shrine in a remote part of southern Pakistan, officials said. Many of the victims were women. The Islamic State, the extreme Sunni militant organization based in Syria and Iraq, announced that its branch in the region had carried out the attack. The Islamic State, which regards members of other Muslim groups as nonbelievers deserving death, also claimed responsibility for an attack on a Sufi shrine in southwestern Pakistan in November. Sufism, popular in Pakistan, is regarded as a relatively tolerant branch of Islam. The shrine assault on Thursday was by far the worst in a wave of militant attacks that have shaken Pakistan this week, most claimed by the Taliban. The attacks were the catalyst for a decision on Thursday by the armed forces to close the border with Afghanistan, where Pakistani officials claim that many such attacks are coordinated and plotted. A spokesman for the armed forces, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, announced on Twitter that the border closing was effective immediately. While Pakistani officials have voiced skepticism about the presence of the Islamic State in the country, they have acknowledged that some local militant groups have expressed support for it. The attacks have underscored the challenges faced by the civil and military leadership to counter extremist violence. On Wednesday, seven people were killed in northwestern Pakistan in two suicide bombings, one targeting judges in Peshawar, the provincial capital of the northwestern   Province. On Monday, at least 13 people were killed in Lahore, in the east, when militants targeted a protest. The bombing Thursday evening targeted the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, a popular Sufi saint, in Sehwan, a city in Jamshoro district of the southern Sindh Province. A large number of people had been performing a spiritual, devotional dance when the bomber struck in the courtyard, officials said, turning a place of spiritual reverie into a spectacle of blood and body parts. The remoteness of the region added to the difficulties faced by the survivors and emergency responders. The nearest big city was about 90 miles away. Khadim Hussain Rind, a senior provincial police officer, said that more than two dozen police officials had been deputized for security at the event and that   cameras had been installed for surveillance of the shrine. “However, it is very difficult to stop a suicide bomber in a big crowd,” Mr. Rind told the local news media. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the bombing as an assault on a “progressive inclusive future of Pakistan. ” Sufi shrines and mosques have been targeted in the past by Taliban militants, who view Sufi Islam as contrary to their beliefs. “The past few days have been hard, and my heart is with the victims,” the prime minister said in the statement. “But we can’t let these events divide us, or scare us. We must stand united in this struggle for the Pakistani identity and universal humanity. ” The sudden spike in terrorist violence has shocked and surprised the country. “Pakistan is under attack. The terrorists are creating a climate of fear, intimidation and uncertainty. No institution and no aspect of society is seemingly secure,” Syeda Sughra Imam, a former senator, said in an interview. “Sehwan is synonymous with Pakistan’s Sufi culture and tradition, which has been dealt a devastating blow today. ” The Pakistani military had proudly claimed last year, under the leadership of the then army chief, that the military operations in the tribal regions, especially the one in North Waziristan, and intelligence operations in different cities had largely defeated the militant groups that had carried out many attacks. But the violence has cast doubt on the military’s claims. Imran Khan, the prominent opposition politician, blamed the federal government for what he called its failure to follow through after the military’s offensives against militants. “We need a coherent national security policy,” Mr. Khan said in an interview. “I do think complacency has set in,” Mr. Khan said.",0
17775,ISIS Killing Former Soldiers in Areas Around Mosul,"At Least 40 Killed Over Weekend, UN Reports   
ISIS has been reported to be using a fleet of trucks and minibuses to transport the civilian population of the area around Mosul into the city itself, which officials are saying they believe is a sign that ISIS intends to use them as human shields. 
While the human shields thing is purely speculative, what appears to be more certain is that those former Iraqi military personnel that ISIS is coming across in their forced busing are being executed, with reports that some 40 were killed over the weekend and thrown into the Tigris River . 
This has been a recurring concern for ISIS since the Mosul battle began. ISIS executed some of their own fighters in the lead-up when they were claimed to be working with the Iraqi government, and have been desperate to purge any other potentially disloyal elements around the city. 
While the UN was harshly critical of ISIS for forcibly relocating people around Mosul, they have so far been mum on government warnings that civilians in Mosul not attempt to escape the city, warnings which came amid announcements that the US intends to launch airstrikes against “fleeing ISIS fighters.”  ",0
17776,Paul Craig Roberts: 'Putin's Nukes Could Wipe Out Entire East Coast' (PODCAST) - Tyler Durden,"Politics Paul Craig Roberts: 'Putin's Nukes Could Wipe Out Entire East Coast' (PODCAST) 
If the US thinks it can continually transgress against Russia until Moscow gives in, it is gravely mistaken Originally appeared at Zero Hedge 
Suffice to say, though children are at play, this is not a game. 
Those who have been toying with outright war against Russia, and an escalation of the conflict in Syria, are putting the lives of all Americans at risk. 
Of course, the threat of nuclear annihilation has been with us since the earliest days of the Cold War, but Russia has now positioned itself with the largest and most destructive nuclear arsenal of any country in the world. 
Economist and political critic Dr. Paul Craig Roberts explains how diplomatic relations have broken between Russia and the United States, after the U.S. knowingly attacked pro-Assad Syria forces… that, of course, was the cherry on top of a host of insults, deliberate antagonism and a strategy that could only result in further chaos and war. 
The end of negotiations is unfortunately, given that fighting it out could mean thermonuclear war that would make Hiroshima and Nagasaki look trivial in comparison. 
After a period of some patience, Russia is now warning that the United States is dangerously close to turning a proxy war into a direct world war – and they are deadly serious about defending the motherland and their sworn allies – namely Assad. 
Any further attack could result in immediate destruction. 
Putin is a formidable opponent and Russia a powerful enemy. At present time, they have the capability of wiping the entire East Coast of the United States off the map – where more than 100 million people live. Will the ranking misleaders in Washington continue to gamble with all of our lives? 
VLADIMIR Putin’s nuclear stockpile could completely destroy the east coast of the US in one clean swipe should the Russian leader launch an attack on the West, an expert has warned. 
A staggering 112.6million people could be at risk of extermination from the deadly missiles. 
Russia has the largest haul of nuclear weapons of any country in the world and reportedly has the most powerful bomb named the SS-18 – menacingly nicknamed the Satan. 
Experts estimate Russia has 55 of the deadly weapons, but only five would be needed to destroy the East Coast of the US. 
[…] 
“Five or six of these ‘Satans’ as they are known by the US military, and the East Coast of the United States disappears.” 
Dr Roberts said: “The atomic bombs that Washington dropped on these helpless civilian centres while the Japanese government was trying to surrender, were mere popguns compared to today’s thermo-nuclear weapons. 
What’s more, the Russian have hinted strongly at the possibility that they would be able to disable electronics, communications and defense shields in the U.S. via electromagnetic warfare – perhaps an EMP . 
Worst of all, the American misleaders haven’t even got a good reason for putting the population at such a risk – strategy in the middle east is muddied at best, and prodding for war with Russia doesn’t carry a clear narrative either. 
The world could change, and American power could end in a few decisive minutes. 
Hopefully it would never come to that, but we shouldn’t live in a false world where we pretend these situations can’t harm us. Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us! Russia Insider depends on your donations: the more you give, the more we can do. $1 $10 Other amount

17777,Michael Eric Dyson Believes in Individual Reparations - The New York Times,"Your forthcoming book, “Tears We Cannot Stop,” is subtitled “A Sermon to White America. ” Which part of white America do you envision reading it? I envision the audience to be that ocean of white folk I encounter who are deeply empathetic to the struggles of minorities  —   they are the ones who ask me, “What can I do, as a white person?” This is my attempt to address them in the most useful and, hopefully, edifying manner. What’s your strategy for getting through to the white people who may not be particularly sympathetic? What I’ve seen under the wonderful presidency of Barack Obama is the tendency to not tell white people the truth, for obvious reasons  —   they don’t vote for you. But I’m not a politician. I don’t have that power or influence, but what I do wield is a different kind of bully pulpit. We have to have enough belief in white people to tell them the truth. They are grown! There are a lot of areas within race relations that seem like less of a conversation and more of an attempt to prove to white people that these issues  —   police brutality, for instance  —   are a real and present danger. I open this book with horror stories about my engagement with the police. These are the stories that have shaped me, that join me to the mass of people who, regardless of our station in life, regardless of educational attainment and achievement, have felt this. The president of the United States has these stories, the former attorney general has these stories and a prominent black intellectual like me has these stories. The reality is that this is part and parcel of what it means to be black in America, and I wanted to spend time talking and thinking about it from a number of different perspectives to show white brothers and sisters that we aren’t making this up. This is not fabricated. I can’t help but think that if the same levels of police brutality were happening to white people, we would just disband the police. Police brutality would not be seen as the price of keeping our society safe. Recently, I was outside of Ben’s Chili Bowl in Washington at 3 a. m. and a young white kid is cursing the police, and I’m going, “Oh, my God, they’re going to shoot him. ” And then it occurred to me that they wouldn’t  —   he’s a white kid. And what did I hear the police say? “Now, son, you’re clearly inebriated. You need to go home and sleep this off. ” And I said to myself: “My God! This is what we want!” We can’t even afford a display of anger that many white people have. At the end of your sermon, you do a “benediction” section, in which you talk about making reparations on the local and individual level: donating to groups like the United Negro College Fund or a scholarship program, but also, to cite your example from the book, paying “the black person who cuts your grass double what you might ordinarily pay. ” That gave me pause! Good! I used to say in church, “If the sermon ain’t making you a little bit uncomfortable, it ain’t effective. ” Look, if it doesn’t cost you anything, you’re not really engaging in change you’re engaging in convenience. You’re engaged in the overflow. I’m asking you to do stuff you wouldn’t ordinarily do. I’m asking you to think more seriously and strategically about why you possess what you possess. I agree with reparations, but maybe this is my white privilege speaking: I can’t imagine actually doing that. That is what I meant by an I. R. A.: an individual reparations account. You ain’t got to ask the government, you don’t have to ask your local politician  —   this is what you, an individual, conscientious, “woke” citizen can do. But charity can’t be the end of it, right? The Koch brothers gave the United Negro College Fund $25 million, but I doubt you would consider them “woke. ” No. Martin Luther King Jr. believed that charity is a poor substitute for justice. But I ain’t turning $25 million down.",0
17778,"Days Before Election, France Asks EU Parliament to Lift Le Pen Immunity","PARIS (AFP)  —   French prosecutors have asked the European parliament to lift the immunity of right wing presidential candidate Marine Le Pen over an inquiry into alleged fake parliamentary jobs, legal sources said Friday. [The revelation comes just nine days before France heads to the polls for a   presidential election with Le Pen, who heads the eurosceptic Front National (FN) one of the frontrunners in the April 23 first round.  The demand was made at the end of last month after she invoked her parliamentary immunity in refusing to attend questioning by investigating magistrates on March 10. The case is linked to an expenses inquiry in which the European Parliament has accused Le Pen’s FN of defrauding it to the tune of some 340, 000 euros ($360, 000). The parliament believes the party used funds allotted for parliamentary assistants to pay Le Pen’s personal assistant Catherine Griset and her bodyguard Thierry Legier for party work in France. French investigators leading the case raided the party’s headquarters outside Paris last month in a bid to determine whether the FN used European funds to pay for 20 assistants  —   presented as parliamentary aides  —   who were working for the party elsewhere. But Le Pen shrugged off the request, saying it was “normal”. “It’s totally normal procedure, I’m not surprised,” she told Franceinfo radio.",0

17782,Turkey and the Next War      : Information," Turkey and the Next War By Philip Giraldi
 The Republic of Turkey has become a loose cannon on deck, a short-term asset in enabling the United States (US) bombing of northern Syria but a major liability when it comes to any eventual settlement intended to quell the fighting in the region.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking to destroy both genuine enemies and far less blameworthy critics alike in his over-the-top reaction to Julys attempted military coup. His emergency powers were recently extended. He has used an enemies list, prepared pre-coup, to detain 37,000 without any prospect of trial, to arrest or fire more than 1,00,000 government officials, to shut down newspapers and television stations, to close schools and universities and to wage an increasingly bloody war against the countrys minority, Kurds.
In Kurdish southwestern Turkey, there have been wholesale dismissals and even arrests of teachers, bureaucrats and elected officials, including mayors . They are being replaced by appointees from Ankara loyal to the government but frequently lacking in the training required to do their jobs.
Erdogans paranoia and desire for revenge run deep. Alleged coup organiser Fetullah Gulen has been described as the head of a terrorist organization intent on subduing the entire world, far beyond Turkey. Turkish embassies and consulates overseas have been ordered to compile lists of disloyal citizens, and Ankara even sued a German comedian who satirised Erdogan.
In Turkey itself, police and intelligence agents have been arresting people who possess multiple American $1 bills whose serial numbers all start with the same letter. (It is believed that the banknotes were used to establish bona fides among coup plotters.) Reading the wrong newspaper or book has led to firing or imprisonment, while parliamentary critics are being silenced and threatened with arrest after being labelled as terrorists. There have been frequent reports of torture, beatings and even rape of those detained, and Erdogan has supported calls for the death penalty for military officers involved in the coup.
And then there is the ongoing corruption of Erdogan himself, his family and his close associates. Turkey illegally bought Iranian oil while Iran was under sanctions, and Erdogans son Bilal used his tankers to move it to markets in East Asia to sell it. Fearing a police raid at one point, Erdogan telephoned his son and advised him to go to his safe, remove all the money inside and hide it.
Now, the government has been arresting businessmen accused of being sympathetic to the coup without presenting any evidence, while also confiscating billions of dollars in assets belonging to their companies. The assets are being temporarily managed by the political associates of Erdogan.
Erdogan is unfortunately supported by a solid bloc of voters who see the world the same way he does and generally share his intense and often-cited religiosity. He is inspired by his own personal sense of righteousness, and he has exhibited what one might reasonably describe as megalomania, seeing grandiose building projects and a redefinition of Turkeys domestic and international interests as part and parcel of his own authority and that of his ruling Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (AKP) party (Justice and Development Party).
I have previously described how Erdogans increasingly aggressive foreign policy has long been driven by a somewhat legitimate fear of the development of an independent Kurdish state, which presumably would incorporate parts of Turkey with northern Syria and Iraq as well as western Iran. Indeed, Erdogans recent participation in the fighting against the Islamic State (ISIS) is actually a deliberate misdirection, being instead mostly aimed at striking the Kurdish militias that the US regards as its most effective fighting force against the terrorist groups.
More disturbing still, recent developments suggest that Ankara is now entertaining irredentist claims over former parts of the Ottoman Empire that are adjacent to Turkeys current borders, including Mosul in Iraq, areas just north of Aleppo in Syria and parts of Greece. Erdogan has argued that he has a responsibility to protect Turks in neighbouring states, a rationalisation that he has been employing to bomb Kurdish-controlled areas and to demand a role in the impending Iraqi assault on Mosul, which has a small Turkmen minority. Iraqs government, knowing that once Ankara has its foot in the door, it will be difficult to make Turkish soldiers go home, has flatly rejected the offer. Erdogan responded by observing that Turkey has a right to invade Iraq if it feels threatened.
The aim to assert some form of regional dominance is a reversal of Turkeys former foreign policy, which stressed friendly relations with all its neighbours. One might further suggest that the July coup let the genie out of the bottle, fully liberating Erdogan from whatever restraints he believed himself to be under and giving him an opportunity to rewrite the countrys constitution to enhance and perpetuate his own power, a process that is now well underway.
Many reasonably question whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should exist at all after the demise of the Soviet Union, but including Turkey as a member raises some very serious concerns due to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty (which created the alliance). This provision requires all members to respond to a military threat against any member state as a collective defense. As the alliance purports to be defensive in nature, Turkeys irredentist claims are problematic  particularly as it would not be difficult to contrive an incident that would make an offensive operation appear to be self-defence. Such an incident took place in December 2015 with the clearly premeditated downing of a Russian warplane that had strayed over the border into Turkey for 17 seconds. Turkey regarded the incursion as an act of war. Fortunately, Moscow was restrained in its response, and the situation did not escalate in military terms. So, the issue of NATO involvement, though it briefly surfaced in Brussels, was essentially moot.
In addition, as a basically European-American alliance, NATO has long taken as a given that member states will conform to reasonably democratic norms. That is something that Turkey is rapidly moving away from with its mass arrests, show trials and collective punishments while Erdogan seeks to aggrandise his position by enhancing his own presidential powers. As Doug Bandow of the Cato Institute puts it , Turkeys brief democratic moment is ending.
For the United States, the calculus is somewhat complicated. Hillary Clinton will likely up the ante in Syria, which will require the use of the airbase at Incirlik. But after that, presuming that a Third World War can somehow be averted while the escalation and intervention are taking place, the role of Turkey should be re-evaluated based on strategic considerations distinct from the current fighting in Iraq and Syria. Ankaras status as a long-term strategic asset should certainly be challenged, particularly in light of the Erdogan governments authoritarian predilections.
Most observers in Washington now believe that ISIS will soon be defeated as a territorial threat, though it likely will retain a base of operations in troubled Libya. That means any continued operations against the group will be conducted by special ops and intelligence personnel, and thus will not require extensive infrastructure and support. As the US will retain major regional military assets in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, Turkey will become a backwater and a Cold War relic, redundant, with Washington instead increasingly focused on security issues surrounding Iran and the Sunni-Shia conflict.
Ankara persists in believing that its current strategic importance means that it can do or say anything and Washington will avoid any criticism, but the White House is clearly beginning to recognise that Turkey is, in the long run, a liability as long as Erdogans brand of democratic centralism prevails. And it must be observed that the current bilateral relationship, in which the administration leans over backwards to placate an invariably irritable Erdogan, produces bad policy. In the recent contretemps with Baghdad over an enhanced Turkish role in Mosul, Secretary of State John Kerry unwisely urged the Iraqis to let the Turks become a partner in the enterprise. He was tone deaf to other considerations of which the government in Baghdad and Americas Kurdish partners were all too aware.
The White House should recognise that Turkey has become a destabilising force in the Near East. Its past collusion with  and arming of  terrorist groups like ISIS reveals that it is not unwilling to play a double game against its nominal allies. Its implacable hostility towards all things Kurdish affects the internal stability of nearly all of its neighbours and even diminishes Washingtons ability to deal with ISIS. Its increasingly assertive nationalism, which is beginning to define itself as irredentism  backed by what is still, after the purge of thousands of personnel, the most powerful military in the region  could easily morph into a series of local conflicts as Ankara seeks to realign its borders.
If Turkey continues to remain in NATO, and if the US persists in being closely tied to it logistically, the eventual consequences could be grave, with Washington again drawn into a Middle East quagmire by virtue of a war that it is neither prepared for nor seeking to fight.

17783,Comment on Many on Social Security Disability can but don’t want to work by DCG,"Why are we demonized for speaking the truth? H/t FOTM’s Trail Dust 
More than a year ago, in May 2012, Lance Roberts wrote that “ Without government largesse many individuals would literally be living on the street.” As much as 1/5 or 22.5% of the average American’s income is dependent on “government transfers.” 
One of those “government transfers” are Social Security Disability benefits. 
There are two types of Social Security Disability benefits: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI): Earned disability benefits for those who have held jobs for significant periods of time and paid at least partially into Social Security before becoming disabled. Social Security Disability (SSI): Unearned disability benefits for individuals who have petitioned to be classified as disabled, although many of them have never worked and have never paid into Social Security. 
Under Obama, t he number of Americans claiming disability has surged to the highest levels on record since the beginning of the last recession. What is most notable, however, is when the surge of disability claims began – exactly two years from the beginning of the financial crisis. This was when the 2 years of extended unemployment insurance began to run out. 
Unlike welfare, disability isn’t term-limited, and in some cases it’s become permanent unemployment insurance for the unemployable or those who simply refuse to work. 
Today, more than 28 million Americans who are of working age have a disability – a level higher than at any other time in recorded history. There are approximately 11 million SSDI or earned recipients and approximately 7 million SSI or unearned recipients. 
But how many of those on disability are actually disabled? 
Luke Rosiak reports for the Washington Examiner , July 30, 2013, that a study by the Social Security Administration found some disturbing, but unsurprising, attributes of disability recipients: Recipients of federal disability checks often admit that they are capable of working but cannot or will not find a job. Returning to work is not a goal for 71% of the SSDI recipients, and 60% of the SSI recipients. Most have never received significant medical treatment and not seen a doctor about their condition in the last yea r, even though medical problems are the official reason they don’t work. Those who acknowledge they’re on disability because they can’t find a job say they make little effort to find one. Of those who say they’re actually looking for a job, most say they’re looking only for part-time jobs that will allow them to keep their disability benefits. The unearned disability recipients are in less pain than their counterparts who had paid into the system. In other words, they are using SSD as a substitute for welfare. These individuals are typically overweight, uneducated and from broken homes. There are practical barriers to weaning recipients off the disability rolls. The jobs they’d be candidates for often don’t provide health insurance, which is essential for those with medical problems, and they’d rather receive the SSD benefits. Many also say they don’t have transportation to work. 72% of the small number of SSDI recipients who started a job while on disability got cash under the table , as did 70% of the small number of SSI recipients who started a job while on disability. 24% of the SSDI recipients lack even GEDs, as do 43% of the SSI recipients. Only 18% of SSDI and 15% of SSI recipients said, during the past 4 weeks, they could not do social activities with family or friends because of their physical health or emotional problems. As many as 96% of SSDI and 91% of SSD recipients admit whatever physical health or mental problems they have do not hinder or limit them from the kind or amount of work or other daily activities they do. In other words, they are not really so disabled they can’t work. 47% of SSDI and 41% of SSD recipients are obese ; 30% of both groups are overweight; only 21% of SSDI and 25% of SSD recipients are of normal weight. 28% of SSD recipients had never worked for pay, i.e., they never had a job! Most SSD recipients don’t bother to educate themselves about or avail themselves of government programs to wean them off disability, such as the Plan for Achieving Self-Support, Earned Income Exclusion, and Continued Medicaid Eligibility after they get off disability benefits. Many disability recipients also receive other government welfare benefits: 28% of SSDI and 81% of SSD recipients are on Medicaid; 80% of SSDI and 42% of SSD recipients are on Medicare; 18% of SSDI and 52% of SSD recipients are on food stamps. The lack of a spouse is a significant factor: 54% of SSDI and 88% of SSD recipients are not married. 11% of SSDI and 21% of SSD recipients have been receiving disability benefits for 20 years or more.

America’s national debt now exceeds our GDP and is closing in on $17 trillion. It doesn’t take an Albert Einstein to know that our super-extended welfare state cannot continue as it is. Indeed the danger signs are already visible. 
In three years, by 2016, the first of the Social Security funds — Social Security Disability — will be in full collapse. 
Brian Faler reports for The Washington Post , May 30, 2012: 
“ The disability program pays benefits averaging $1,111 a month, with the money coming from the Social Security payroll tax. The program cost $132 billion last year, more than the combined annual budgets of the departments of Agriculture, Homeland Security, Commerce, Labor, Interior and Justice. That doesn’t include an additional $80 billion spent because disability beneficiaries become eligible for Medicare, regardless of their age, after a two-year waiting period. The disability program is projected to exhaust its trust fund in 2016, according to a Social Security trustees report released last month. Once it runs through its reserve, incoming payroll-tax revenue will cover only 79% of benefits, according to the trustees. Because the plan is barred from running a deficit, aid would have to be cut to match revenue.” 
Lastly, since the American Medical Association recently declared obesity to be a “disease,” expect even more Americans to apply for and receive Social Security Disability benefits.

17784,"Abu Zubaydah, Tortured Guantánamo Detainee, Makes Case for Release - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Over 14 years in American custody, Abu Zubaydah has come to symbolize, perhaps more than any other prisoner, how fear of terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks changed the United States. He was the first detainee to be waterboarded, and his brutal torture was documented in a Senate report. He is among those held without charges and with no likelihood of a trial. The government long ago admitted that he was never the top leader of Al Qaeda it claimed he was at the time of his capture in 2002, but it insists that he may still be dangerous. In all that time, Mr. Zubaydah, now 45, had never been seen by the outside world. That changed on Tuesday, as his calm face was beamed via video feed from the Guantánamo Bay military prison to a Pentagon conference room. In a   hearing, he argued, through a statement read by a uniformed soldier, that he posed no threat and should be released. A profile prepared by the Defense Department, also read aloud, concluded with unsettling ambiguity that he “probably retains an extremist  . ” The occasion was Mr. Zubaydah’s first appearance before a Periodic Review Board, convened under the military detention system to determine whether a prisoner would pose a danger if released. Under the convoluted rules that govern inmates at Guantánamo, Mr. Zubaydah did not speak during the open part of the hearing. But in the statement summarizing his views, Mr. Zubaydah declared that he “has no desire or intent to harm the United States or any other country. ” Musing about what appeared to be a   prospect, he said he wanted to be reunited with his family and “has some seed money that could be used to start a business. ” A dozen reporters and human rights advocates watched the live video of the   unclassified part of the proceeding. No member of the public other than his lawyers had seen Mr. Zubaydah since his March 2002 capture in Pakistan, after a shootout in which he was badly injured. Mr. Zubaydah may have spoken during the classified part of the hearing that followed the open session and was expected to last for several hours. A notice posted afterward said he had decided he did not want the redacted transcript made public. The review panel, comparable to a civilian parole board, is composed of representatives of six security agencies who participated in the hearing from an undisclosed location in the Washington area. It will announce, a month or longer from now, whether it recommends the continued detention of Mr. Zubaydah or his transfer to another country. Of 779 people held at Guantánamo since 2001, 61 remain. The government says about half are, like Mr. Zubaydah so far, impossible to put on trial but too dangerous to release. Dressed in a white tunic and wearing a neatly trimmed beard, Mr. Zubaydah, whose mental stability has been questioned by some American officials, listened attentively, resting his chin on his right hand. He did not react visibly as officials read various statements about him. The eye patch that in earlier photographs covered his left eye, injured at some point after his capture, hung from a strap around his neck. He wore one pair of glasses and switched to another pair to read a document. Mr. Zubaydah, born in Saudi Arabia to a family of Palestinian background, became a sort of travel agent, camp administrator and facilitator for militant fighters in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, after the ragtag force of Islamic soldiers known as the mujahedeen forced the Soviet Army out of the country. But when he was shot and taken into American custody six months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he was the first significant suspect captured in an increasingly desperate global C. I. A. manhunt. At the time, American intelligence officials wrongly concluded that he was a   leader of Al Qaeda who might have knowledge of forthcoming plots. Flown to a secret jail set up in a hurry by the C. I. A. in Thailand, Mr. Zubaydah was first questioned by F. B. I. agents using traditional   methods. One of the agents, Ali Soufan, who spoke Arabic and was steeped in the history of Al Qaeda, later wrote that Mr. Zubaydah willingly provided valuable information, identifying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed as the main planner of the Sept. 11 attacks and naming Jose Padilla, an American recruited by Al Qaeda. But because they believed Mr. Zubaydah was the No. 3 leader of Al Qaeda, C. I. A. leaders insisted that he must be holding back information. Over the protests of the F. B. I. agents, and advised by two military psychologists who had no experience conducting interrogations, C. I. A. officials decided that only extreme physical force would break him. As soon as approval was received from the Justice Department, Mr. Zubaydah was subjected to waterboarding  —   83 times water was poured over a cloth covering his mouth and nose to give him the feeling of drowning, records later showed. Distressed by his suffering, interrogators told C. I. A. supervisors that they thought he had no more information to offer  —   only to be ordered to continue the rough treatment. The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on the C. I. A. interrogation program later quoted an observer at the scene who described him at one point as “completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth. ” At various times, he was subjected to the other   enhanced interrogation techniques: confined in a cramped box, kept awake for many days, exposed to cold, shackled in uncomfortable positions and slammed into a wall. In their profile, posted on the web this week, military authorities gave a   but still rather vague description of his history. It said he ran a “mujahedeen facilitation network” in the 1990s, “played a key role in Al Qaeda’s communications” and had close contact with the No. 2 in Al Qaeda at the time. He “possibly” had advance knowledge of the attacks on American embassies in East Africa in 1998 and the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen in 2000, the profile said. He was “generally aware” of planning for the   attacks, it said, and “possibly” coordinated training at a camp called Khalden when two of the future hijackers were there. Mr. Zubaydah “most actively plotted attacks against Israel,” the profile also said, was convicted in absentia on   charges in Jordan and took an active role in discussing possible further attacks against the United States after  . Though he has been cooperative in prison, he might join former colleagues in planning attacks if released, the profile said. But Mr. Zubaydah told his “personal representatives”  —   the two members of the military assigned to speak with him  —   that he had no intention of committing terrorist acts. He “repeatedly said that the Islamic State is out of control and has gone too far,” the personal representatives said in their statement. (Officials said detainees have access to live television and radio in multiple languages, in addition to two Arabic newspapers, enabling them to keep up with world events.) One of his lawyers, Joseph Margulies, a professor of law and government at Cornell, who did not attend the hearing, said that in their conversations Mr. Zubaydah “has always been completely honest. He believes in defending Muslims who are under attack. ” But he “has always said innocent civilians are never a legitimate target,” Mr. Margulies said. Despite the government’s shifting accusations, Mr. Margulies said, his client was never a member of Al Qaeda and has never been charged with a crime by American authorities. “He’s the poster child for the torture program, and that’s why they never want him to be heard from again,” Mr. Margulies said.",0
17785,Infamous NV Rancher Cliven Bundy Sues Congressional Candidate Over ‘Attack Ad’ Blaming Him for Murders of 2 Vegas Cops,"A Nevada Congressional candidate is finding himself at the center of a legal controversy following the release of attack ads blaming infamous cattle rancher Cliven Bundy for the deaths of Las Vegas police officers Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo.
In response to the attack ads which depict Bundy’s mugshot and allege that his 2014 standoff with the Bureau of Land Management led to “the deaths of two Las Vegas police officers,” Bundy has filed a lawsuit calling the allegation nothing more than hateful and libelous rhetoric.
The ads which were released by Democratic candidate Ruben Kihuen’s campaign take a huge leap attempting to blame Bundy for the deaths of the police officers by referencing an incident that followed two months after the standoff.
Kihuen is challenging U.S. Rep. Cresent Hardy (R) for his seat in Nevada Congressional District 4.
So why does Kihuen believe that Bundy is responsible for the murder of two police officers?
Via RJ … the Millers had visited the Bundy ranch at one point to join the protesters, but didn’t fit in and left the group. The lawsuit says the Millers went to the ranch but never met or spoke to Bundy before they were forced to leave.
Bundy’s lawsuit calls the mailer connecting Bundy’s conflict to the police shootings as “libelous” and complains that it exposes Bundy to “hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy because it insinuates that (Bundy) orchestrated and promoted the disgraceful and disgusting acts of the killing of two local law enforcement officers.”
The lawsuit says the ads came in the forms of television ads and mailers.
…It shows a mugshot of Bundy and states: “This man’s armed standoff led to the deaths of two Las Vegas police officers.” The mailer adds: “And he’s supported by Congressman Hardy.”
Thoughts on this? Let us know in the comment section below.

17786,"Mosul residents storm Daesh-run jail, free dozens of inmates","Mosul residents storm Daesh-run jail, free dozens of inmates By Press TV on November 4, 2016 
Iraqi families walk on a street in the village of Gogjali, on the eastern edge of Mosul, on November 4, 2016, as they flee Daesh terrorists in the northern city. 
Residents of the Daesh-held Iraqi city of Mosul have managed to storm the city’s main prison and free dozens of inmates amid a major military operation by the Iraqi forces who are tightening the noose around the terror group holed up in the northern city. 
Iraq’s Arabic-language al-Sumaria satellite television network quoted an unnamed security source as saying that the Mosul residents on Friday evening broke into the city’s main prison, located in the eastern part of Mosul, and freed at least 45 prisoners after killing all of the Daesh militants manning the jail. 
The development comes as Iraqi army troops, backed by the country’s Hashd al-Shaabi forces, also known as the Popular Mobilization Units, and Kurdish Peshmerga forces, are closing in on Daesh’s last stronghold in Iraq from almost all directions in a full-scale operation launched on October 17 to liberate the city. 
The Iraqi troops managed to enter Mosul’s limits earlier this week for the first time since June 2014, when Daesh began its terror campaign in northern and western Iraq. So far, a large number of the city’s villages and districts have been purged of terrorists. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has vowed that the country’s second largest city will be fully recaptured by year-end.

‘Daesh killing hundreds, recruiting children’ 
Meanwhile, UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani has announced that the terrorists have executed hundreds of people, including 180 former Iraqi government employees who were killed on Wednesday as the Takfiri group was withdrawing from Gogjali town. 
Citing “credible reports”, she added that the terrorists also executed 50 deserters at the Ghazlani military base in Mosul on Monday. 
Shamdasani, who was speaking on Friday at a regular UN briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, went on to say that Daesh had moved 1,600 people, likely to use them as human shields against airstrikes, from the town of Hammam al-Alil to Tal Afar near Mosul on Tuesday, and told them they might be taken to Syria. 
She also warned that Daesh was trying to recruit children, particularly boys above the age of nine, in Hammam al-Alil as the group was increasingly losing its adult terrorists in clashes with the Iraqi troops. 
“They’ve been knocking on people’s doors and asking for their boys,” Shamdasani further said, adding that defiant families were threatened with harsh punishment. 
The UN official also said that Daesh was currently holding about 400 Kurdish, Izadi and Shia women in Tal Afar, and had possibly killed up to 200 people in Mosul. 
On Friday, the Iraqi special forces launched an assault to advance deeper into the city’s urban center, and engaged in fierce fighting with Daesh terrorists, estimated to number between 3,000 and 5,000 in the sprawling city. 
Iraqis fleeing Daesh reunite with families 
In another related development, Iraqi civilians fleeing Daesh in Mosul reunited with their families for the first time in more than two years at the al-Khazar camp, to the east of the city, on Friday.

17788,"Tony Fadell Steps Down Amid Tumult at Nest, a Google Acquisition - The New York Times","Time to move on. That is the explanation Tony Fadell, a former star executive at Apple known for his aggressive management style, offers for his departure from Nest, a maker of digital versions of household staples like thermostats and smoke detectors that he helped found and sold to Google. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced on Friday that Mr. Fadell was leaving Nest after leading it for six years, including the last two under the ownership of Google, which bought it for $3. 2 billion in 2014. His departure comes after months of controversy regarding his leadership. Mr. Fadell, the company said, will become an adviser to Alphabet and to its chief executive, Larry Page. In a recent interview in his Palo Alto office, Mr. Fadell, 47, talked about his career. At Apple, he led the engineering team that created the iPod digital music player and worked on the first three versions of the iPhone. In 2010 he founded Nest with Matt Rogers, a young Apple engineer. “I’m a guy who’s at the beginning of things,” Mr. Fadell said. “I don’t like to do maintenance mode. It’s not what gets me out of bed. ” But he is leaving after articles on the technology news sites The Information and Recode describing a harsh corporate culture at Nest and abrasiveness on his part that led to resignations, stymied product development and disappointing revenue growth. The sharpest attack came from Greg Duffy, the founder and former chief executive of Dropcam, the home video camera and   service that Nest acquired for $555 million in 2014, about six months after Google bought Nest. Mr. Duffy clashed with Mr. Fadell, remained at Nest for eight months and briefly moved to another post at Google before departing last September. Writing on Medium in late March, Mr. Duffy said he regretted selling Dropcam to Nest and noted his “extreme differences on management style with the current leadership at Nest. ” In the interview, which Mr. Fadell agreed to on the condition that it not be published before Alphabet announced he was leaving, he had answers for most of the criticisms of his tenure. He described the staff departures as a small fraction of Nest employees and in line with the turnover in Silicon Valley, where switching jobs is common. Mr. Fadell said that Nest had “strong  ” revenue growth from the outset. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Page, citing Nest’s achievements, noted that its revenue growth was “in excess of 50 percent” a year since it began shipping products in 2011. Mr. Fadell characterized Nest as healthy, with 1, 100 workers and strong teams in design, software and services around its three product families  —   its “learning” thermostat, smoke detector and video camera. Yet the larger issue is not Nest’s past performance but what impact Mr. Fadell’s departure will have on its future. Nest is the linchpin of Alphabet’s bet on the emerging smart home market  —   devices and software to automate homes for convenience, energy savings and security. Mr. Fadell will be succeeded by Marwan Fawaz, a former executive vice president of Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker Google bought for $12. 5 billion in 2011. Google unloaded Motorola three years later to Lenovo for the fire sale price of $2. 9 billion, though a sizable share of Motorola’s value was its thousands of patents. In the troubled Motorola acquisition, Mr. Fawaz led a financial bright spot, Motorola Home, a television   box business. He pared its product line, cut costs and oversaw its sale in 2013 for $2. 35 billion to the Arris Group, a cable television equipment maker. In the Alphabet portfolio, Nest is a leading entry among the parent company’s “other bets,” its effort to build businesses beyond Google’s lucrative franchise in online search and advertising. Google’s record with acquired hardware businesses, notably the Motorola deal, has not inspired confidence. When the Nest thermostat was introduced in 2011, it was an innovative reimagining of a product category, much as the iPod was a reinvention of the MP3 music player and the iPhone was a new take on the cellphone. It was a stylish piece of hardware, a circle of brushed stainless steel, reflective polymer and a   color display. Inside, the Nest thermostat houses sensors for detecting motion in the room and clever software to learn and adjust room temperatures, according to whether people are present or not, to curb electric bills. Priced at $249, the Nest thermostat was far more expensive than traditional models. Rivals scoffed but later offered their own models. Honeywell, for example, now has a $249 model that resembles the Nest oval. The pace of product introductions in the home necessarily will be more gradual, which critics often miss, Mr. Fadell said. A thermostat typically lasts 10 or 12 years. “Some people expect us to be a gadget factory,” he said. “But you don’t want your thermostat to be like your smartphone, replacing it every two or three years. ” More is done with software, especially updates, sent over the internet and wirelessly connected to Nest devices. Relying on software, of course, opens the door to software bugs. In 2014, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission ordered a recall of more than 400, 000 Nest Protect smoke and gas detectors because a defect could cause users to turn them off unintentionally. Nest halted sales for a while and fixed the problem by updating the software. The software is what allows its devices to communicate with each other. The Nest Protect, for example, can detect a carbon monoxide leak and tell the Nest thermostat to turn off the furnace. Mr. Fadell points to the 18, 000 software developers working with Nest software, 12, 000 retail stores that sell Nest devices and more than 100 utility companies, many of which offer consumer rebates to buy Nest thermostats, for their energy saving potential. “We’re not a products company,” Mr. Fadell said. “We’re a products, services and software company. ” And, he added, building up those networks “takes a long time. ” It will be up to others to do that building now. Yet Mr. Fadell expresses no regrets. Selling to Google, he insists, was the right choice to give Nest the financial ballast it needs for the long term. When Nest started, the technology giants were not in the smart home market. But now, Samsung has SmartThings software and devices, Apple has HomeKit software, and Amazon has the Echo voice command device. Nor does Mr. Fadell apologize for his management style. He described his strength as “holding people to a higher standard than they thought they could achieve and pushing them beyond what they thought they could achieve. ” Mr. Fadell said he had no immediate plans but he would spend more time looking at technology  . In the last decade, he has quietly invested in and advised many fledgling companies. His current investments include Impossible Foods, which synthesizes beef without cattle Airwave, an operating system for drones Mousera, sensor technology to speed insights from preclinical drug trials on lab animals and Phononic,   heating and cooling. “I’m not a scientist,” Mr. Fadell said. “I’m looking for technology that is about to come out of the lab and has the potential to transform a business. I like to see these technologies raw. ”",0
17789,"Alexander Acosta, Labor Nominee, Dismisses Concerns Over Political Pressure - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s second pick to lead the Labor Department told senators on Wednesday that he would not allow partisan political considerations or conservative ideologues to shape his department, pushing back against accusations by Democrats that he had looked away as subordinates at the Justice Department stacked his office with ideological allies during the George W. Bush administration. R. Alexander Acosta, the nominee for labor secretary, also defended his decision as the United States attorney in Southern Florida to offer a lenient plea deal to a wealthy New Yorker accused of paying underage girls for sexual acts. For nearly three hours in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Acosta, 48, defended his record, explained how he might deal with budget cuts to the department and dismissed the concerns of several senators who asked how he would avoid any pressure from the president to pass policies based on politics and not on the best interest of workers. Mr. Acosta, who would be the only Hispanic in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, promised not to evaluate workers based on their political leanings. “If confirmed, I will work to enforce the laws under the department’s jurisdiction fully and fairly,” Mr. Acosta said in his opening pitch to senators. “As a former prosecutor, I will always be on the side of the law and not any particular constituency. ” Mr. Acosta, the dean of Florida International University’s law school, was nominated after the president’s first choice for labor secretary, the   executive Andrew F. Puzder, withdrew from consideration after coming under fire for past labor practices and domestic abuse allegations. Mr. Acosta, a former prosecutor from Miami who headed the Justice Department’s civil rights division, appeared to be a far less contentious choice. But Democratic senators did not go easy on him. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, wanted more details on his promise not to politicize the department. “I expect our next secretary of labor to be someone who can withstand inappropriate political pressure, and prioritize workers and the mission of the Labor Department over, hypothetically speaking, President Trump’s business associates or Steve Bannon’s frightening ideology,” she said, referring to the senior White House adviser. She and other Democrats pointed to a 2008 report by the Justice Department’s   investigator, which found that under Mr. Acosta his office had violated federal law and department policies by weighing political affiliations in hiring and assessing employees. Mr. Acosta acknowledged that the violations had happened on his watch but said that the report laid most of the blame on a subordinate, Bradley Schlozman. “Political views in the hiring of career attorneys and staff should not be used,” Mr. Acosta said. “If I am asked to do that, I will not allow it. ” Mr. Acosta had a lengthy discussion with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, on what critics said was the lenient plea deal given to Jeffrey E. Epstein, a wealthy financier accused of paying underage girls for sexual massages. Mr. Acosta defended the deal and said it was offered based on the evidence. Mr. Epstein, he noted, was required to register as a sex offender. Mr. Acosta also seemed to question Mr. Trump’s proposal to cut the Labor Department’s budget by 21 percent, saying he opposed    cuts as well as targeting specific programs. “The principle that needs to be used to guide the spending is, ‘How successful is the program? ’” Mr. Acosta said. He pledged to consult with local officials before making cuts to the department. He added that he hoped to help Americans “find good jobs, safe jobs. ” Most of the confirmation hearing was given to senators’ interrogating Mr. Acosta about how much of Mr. Trump’s agenda he would back and how he would help fulfill the president’s promises to create jobs and stop companies from moving jobs overseas. Mr. Trump “ran for president saying he was going to make that huge difference  —   he was going to bring jobs back,” said Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. “What’s the plan?” Mr. Acosta answered that he would work with other agencies, like the Department of Education, in carrying out the president’s executive order directing department heads to review regulations. Two Republican senators, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, both   like Mr. Acosta, introduced and praised him as an example of the American dream. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the committee, said Mr. Acosta would be a labor secretary who “understands how a   job is critical to helping workers realize the American dream for themselves and for their families. ” The Senate labor committee is expected to vote next week on whether to advance Mr. Acosta’s nomination to the full Senate. The Senate Agriculture Committee is scheduled to begin a confirmation hearing on Thursday for Sonny Perdue, the former governor of Georgia, to be Mr. Trump’s agriculture secretary.",0
17790,Trump National Security Team Gets a Slow Start - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Obama administration has written 275 briefing papers for the incoming Trump administration: nearly 1, 000 pages of classified material on North Korea’s nuclear program, the military campaign against the Islamic State, tensions in the South China Sea, and every other kind of threat the new team could face in its first weeks in office. Nobody in the current administration knows whether anyone in the next has read any of it. Less than three days before President Obama turns the keys to the White House, and the nuclear codes, over to   Donald J. Trump, Mr. Trump’s transition staff has barely engaged with the National Security Council below the most senior levels. His designated national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, has met four times with his Obama counterpart, Susan E. Rice, most recently on Tuesday afternoon. But the chronic upheaval in Mr. Trump’s transition, a delay in appointing senior National Security Council staff members, and a dearth of people with security clearances have deprived the Trump team of weeks of prep work on some of the most complex national security issues facing the country. “We really wanted to make sure there was nothing a new team needed to know that we hadn’t told them,” Ms. Rice said in an interview. “It took them more time than we expected for them to be ready to engage with us. ” Now, she added, “we’re racing to make up lost time. ” Ms. Rice insisted that she was confident the Trump administration would have the information it needed by the time Mr. Trump was sworn in. The process has settled down in recent days with the arrival of Keith Kellogg, a retired   Army general whom Mr. Trump named as chief of staff of the N. S. C. last month, and who is now running the transition. In a statement, Mr. Flynn said, “Members of our incoming team have held extensive meetings with their N. S. C. counterparts. ” He thanked Ms. Rice for her “cooperation and assistance. ” Last week, the two engaged in a public display of harmony, shaking hands at a “pass the baton” conference sponsored by the United States Institute of Peace. Still, officials from both the Obama and Trump teams acknowledged that the transition had been rocky, in no small part because Mr. Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton caught both the outgoing and incoming administrations so completely by surprise. Had Mrs. Clinton won, her staff planned to place a transition team in the N. S. C. within a couple of days. In Mr. Trump’s case, the first contact with the National Security Council did not come until Nov. 22, two weeks after Election Day. That delay was caused by the purge of the original transition team led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Among those swept out was Matthew Freedman, who had been chosen to run the N. S. C. transition but quickly came under scrutiny because of his foreign lobbying ties. Mr. Freedman’s replacement, Marshall Billingslea, a former Pentagon and State Department official, arrived in the West Wing with six people, only two of whom had security clearances. The Obama administration began meeting with that team after Thanksgiving, but its lack of clearances meant that Mr. Trump’s emissaries could not read the materials that the Obama people had prepared for them. The N. S. C. began creating unclassified versions of the papers. Then, in   there was another   when Mr. Billingslea was replaced by General Kellogg, who began meeting with his Obama counterparts this month. By some accounts, the situation is even more fluid in the State Department and the Pentagon, where the Trump team has devoted much of its attention to lining up cabinet secretaries and will now have to win Senate confirmation for dozens of other senior officials. Officials in the State Department’s transition office said that they had had only intermittent contact with Trump representatives, and that those people often changed. But the snags in the National Security Council transition may be more problematic, current and former officials said, because that is the organization that advises the president on the most urgent foreign policy issues, drawing together recommendations from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and other agencies. “This is the nerve center of the White House,” said David J. Rothkopf, the chief executive and editor of the FP Group, who has written a history of the N. S. C. “Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power. ” “If your brain isn’t functioning, your arms and legs aren’t going to function. ” Because none of the jobs on the National Security Council require Senate confirmation, it can in theory be staffed more quickly than other government agencies. Much of the organization’s policy staff is composed of career civil servants, who are lent by their agencies to the White House for a limited term of service. The Trump administration plans to keep on most of these people, as the Obama administration did. But that still leaves a cadre of senior directors, who run departments that develop policy on Asia, Western Europe, Russia, nonproliferation and other areas. While the Trump team has chosen several senior directors, an official said, it has not yet announced them. And the efforts have been complicated by outside distractions. On Monday, Monica Crowley, a Fox News commentator and writer whom Mr. Trump had named deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, announced that she would not take the post after CNN disclosed that she had plagiarized passages of her 2012 book, “What the (Bleep) Just Happened?” Later, Politico reported that she had done the same in her doctoral dissertation. Mr. Trump’s advisers initially defended Ms. Crowley, labeling the plagiarism charges “a politically motivated attack. ” But her position became untenable because part of her job would have involved writing speeches. HarperCollins, Ms. Crowley’s publisher, said it would withdraw the digital edition of her book until she revised the copied passages. “The Monica Crowley episode is a sign of failure on several levels,” Mr. Rothkopf said. “She wasn’t vetted enough, and they waited too long after the plagiarism scandal broke to act. ” Ms. Rice said that ensuring a smooth transition had been one of her major priorities for 2016, and that she had set a goal to “meet or exceed what the Bush administration did for us. ” N. S. C. officials began drafting briefing papers last summer. Some focused on nuts and bolts: How do you arrange meetings? How do you circulate information to the agencies? Others discussed the evolution of administration policies or contingency planning for crises. Most were three to five pages to make them easy to digest. A Trump official said that members of the team had read some of the memos and praised their quality. But there is an inherent tension in transitions, particularly between two administrations with starkly different political views. Officials in the Bush administration said they doubted that the incoming Obama people read all the briefing papers they prepared. “It’s difficult, because you campaigned on how these guys drove the car into the ditch,” said Peter D. Feaver, who served on the Bush N. S. C. “Now, here are memos from the guys who were driving the car, and they drove the car into a ditch. ”",0
17791,How Cities Can Protect People Threatened by Trumpism,"Donate How Cities Can Protect People Threatened by Trumpism Cities can offer shelter and protection to their vulnerable citizens and become a place progressives can exert real power. By Arun Gupta / yesmagazine.org 
The disbelief, shock, and anguish that Donald Trump is now president-elect is giving way to waves of protests. Tens of thousands are hitting the streets in cities large and small, blocking roads, and rejecting Trump’s blatant racism, misogyny, and Islamophobia. 
But Trump is swiftly assembling a cabinet. The names being floated include some of the most dangerous fanatics, demagogues, and authoritarians in America, such as Rudy Giuliani, Sarah Palin, Ben Carson, Newt Gingrich, and Chris Christie. Trump has drawn considerable support for his proposals to deport undocumented immigrants, force Muslims to register with the government , and ban immigration from specific countries. He has allied himself with hardliners opposed to abortion and LGBTQ rights, and his website still includes a call for a “complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” 
Not surprisingly, the targets of these policies are terrified. 
But there is also a chance to create bulwarks of resistance that can minimize much of the harm, while creating space for movements to build power and eventually challenge Trump’s agenda. 
Let’s start in the cities. Cities are places of great diversity, creativity, and tolerance. They are the economic engines of the United States, producing much of the wealth, and where 63 percent of the population lives . Cities are the one place where the left and progressives can exert real power. 
We should start organizing to make cities powerful bastions of noncooperation, resistance, and protection. Activists and organizations can start demanding in every city that city councils and mayors issue resolutions and statements saying: 
1. Our city will not assist or cooperate with any raids or detentions or deportations of any immigrants. This includes assistance of local law enforcement or providing data to the federal government. Already, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray has pledged it will remain a sanctuary city even if Trump cuts off federal funds, as he has vowed to do. 
2. Our city will not cooperate or assist with registration and surveillance programs of Muslims, or any attempts to make our friends, neighbors, and loved ones the enemy. 
3. Our city is a safe zone for all immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQ people, women, and anyone fearing persecution from the Trump regime. 
4. Our cities reject any effort to criminalize or attack Black Lives Matter or other organizing for social justice, as Trump has suggested he might do. 
It’s vital to go beyond nice-sounding but toothless resolutions. This would involve directing city and county attorneys to design legal strategies to resist odious federal policies. It means exerting strong civilian control of police departments, which a Trump administration will try to enlist as front-line troops to persecute entire communities. 
It’s also vital to pass other resolutions and statements asserting unequivocal support for full reproductive health care for women; no attacks on the right to organize or unions; no attacks on workers’ wages, benefits, or health care; and an end to the fossil fuel economy and a rapid and just transition. Complementary strategies can also be developed to make cities more welcoming for LGBT youth and for women denied abortion by creating networks to fund travel and lodging. But it will take organizing to bring local governments on board with such an agenda. 
Many city governments will try to do the minimum and hope protests die down. So there will be a need to organize to get community groups, unions, activist organizations, professional groups, and businesses on board for strong resolutions and action. 
The strategy should be to build a broad-based movement with a focused agenda. In other words, we want as many people on board as possible, but there are also minimum, nonnegotiable demands to protect vulnerable communities. 
Meetings should start happening citywide, in communities and in neighborhoods. Meet with your neighbors, meet with your coworkers. If you’re a student, meet with other students. Wherever possible. 
A lot of horrendous things are going to happen, so we need to resist fiercely and build bastions of noncooperation and protection throughout the country. We have to defeat Trumpism without getting suckered into a failed Democratic Party. 
The world is counting on us.

Robert Creamer, who has visited the White House over 300 times and met personally with Barack Obama 47 times, was caught in an undercover sting operation, illegally taking $20,000 for Hillary Clinton’s campaign from a “foreign donor” who was really an undercover journalist for Project Veritas, but it gets worse. 
Project Veritas decided to give them the illegal contribution from a bank account that they set up in Belize to prove to Creamer they were not plants and to get Creamer to trust the Project Veritas journalist. Knowing Creamer was in deep, doing dirty deals for Hillary Clinton, it was worth risking the 20 grand, and at the very least, they busted the Democrat operatives taking an illegal donation. 
Creamer took the bait in the form of 20 grand, and it gave the Project Veritas journalist access to all of the other lower level Democratic operatives who then confided all of their dirty dealings. Democratic operative dirty deal man Bob Creamer & his wife Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois) 
Creamer spilled the beans, linking him directly to Hillary’s campaign, which is totally illegal under campaign finance laws. Plus, in earlier videos, Creamer was exposed for being guilty of inciting violence at Trump rallies and potential voter fraud schemes. Here’s Creamer talking, not knowing he is being recorded: 
“Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters … I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising.” He also mentions a conference call discussing a woman potentially coming forward to accuse Trump of inappropriate behavior . [via Breitbart ] 
Did you get that last sentence? He threw in there that he would be discussing another woman who they knew in advance was going to coming forward to accuse Donald Trump. That’s highly suspicious, to say the least. How would this guy, Creamer, know in advance about something like that? 
Elsewhere in the video , Creamer adds, “I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the… the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. ” 
Look, so far, there are so many counts of illegal activity exposed here that the majority of comments from the American people are demanding an answer to one question: Where in the hell is the FBI? 
Creamer is a major player who meets with the president 47 times and runs dirty operations for Hillary Clinton. He has taken 20 grand from an illegal foreign donor, which they give back after they find out Project Veritas busted them in a sting, but that doesn’t make it go away nor does it make any of the other crimes they have committed for Hillary go away either. 
It’s time for the FBI to step up and do some law enforcing. Even if Obama continues to shield Hillary Clinton, a criminal who cannot be president, that doesn’t make these crimes go away. Just wait until Donald Trump wins this election — all of these criminals in Washington will pay.",0
17793,7 Essential Things To Know Before Dating An Alpha Female,"Share on Facebook Some men like their women submissive, sweet, feminine, and nurturing – and hey, there's nothing wrong with that. But that woman is certainly not an Alpha Female . Now, for my Alpha Females out there, you badass bitches know who you are , it takes a very particular man to be able to handle you . Yes, you might as well admit it now: you are a handful. Potential Alpha Female Lovers: don't say ya weren't warned. You best know your woman before you fall head over heels for Miss Independent : 1. She Will Challenge You. Not only will she challenge you, but she probably won't forfeit too easily; she will be persistent and insistent . She will debate with you over anything from de Blasio's new policy, to the actual color of a tennis ball (green? or yellow?), and she expects to win. Some advice: challenge her back . 2. She Don't Need A Man To Make It Happen. If you're the kind of guy who loves to feel needed all the time, this gal just isn't for you. She is fiercely independent and prides herself on being self-reliant and self-sufficient: Miss Outta My Way . The great thing about being with an Alpha is that you won't feel tied down because she doesn't need you, she wants you. 3. She Will Be Straight-Up With You. If your Alpha has a problem, you will most likely know about it. You can't expect her to be too gentle with her words, so hopefully you'll understand that she isn't trying to be mean – this is just the way she is. But, hey, you won't need to deal with the typical passive-aggressive bullshit that most girls pull! 4. She's A Do-er, Not A Talk-er. Alpha's take action, so if she says she's gonna do something – you bet your ass, she's gonna do it . She probably expects the same in return: if you say you're gonna do something, you sure as hell better follow through. And if ya don't, she will … so don't miss the boat, Mister. Hop on! 5. She Doesn't Wear Her Alpha On Her Sleeve. Chocolates? Flowers? One of those Hallmark cards that have a cute pun about how much you love her? Yeah, these things will probably make her vom a little in her mouth before it makes her heart melt. Not that she's a total cynic, but she's used to the doting – the lovey dovey crap that every girl wants – and in order to get her attention, you'll need to come up with something a little more original. 6. She's Not Easy. If you think loving an Alpha Female is easy, you're wrong. She's difficult, competitive, and probably complicated. She gets off from being free, being in power, and will step on any man who gets in her way. She is, in fact, ab. So. Lute. Ly. Impossible. 7. But She's Definitely Worth It. Her my-way-or-the-highway attitude and complete self-competence will, at times, make you feel small. Instead, let it empower you. Let it strengthen your weaknesses, and let it feed your drive to success. She will help you learn about yourself; she will push you; she will change you; she will impact you. Overall, she will make you a better man. Related:",0

17795,Prominent Jesuit Blames ’Morality of Capitalism’ for United Air Incident - Breitbart,"Prominent Jesuit James Martin S. J. argues that “the morality of capitalism” is to blame for the horrible incident on United Airlines that involved a man being violently dragged off of a plane after the airline overbooked the flight, in a column for America magazine this week.[  grad argues that capitalism is to blame for United incident  —   but how would state correct problem better than the market? pic. twitter.   —   Tommy (@tciccotta) April 11, 2017,   “A toxic cocktail of capitalism and corporate culture led to a man being dragged along the floor,” Father James Martin argues. Martin, a Jesuit priest, and the    of the Jesuit Magazine, America, has appeared on such television shows as The Colbert Report to discuss the Jesuit brand of Catholicism. This week, Martin suggests in a new column that the anarchic nature of   capitalism has led to such a chaotic society that a firm could instruct a large, imposing, man to drag a passenger down the aisle of their airliner, leaving him bloodied and disoriented without financial or professional repercussion. But is this an accurate reflection of reality? First, the men who removed the passenger from the aircraft were officers with the Chicago Department of Aviation, a state entity under the direction of the government of the city of Chicago. This distinction is important because it reveals that the violence on United Flight 3411 was committed at the hands of the state, rather than at the hands of a private firm. Perhaps more importantly, in response to the incident, United shareholders democratically decided with their dollars that the firm should have to answer for the incident. The company’s market capitalization (the total dollar market value of a firm) dropped by a whopping $1. 4 billion on the day following a video of the incident went viral. Thousands signed petitions calling for the resignation of United CEO Oscar Munoz. There are already policies ingrained in America’s capitalistic society that protect consumers from being mistreated by the firms with whom they choose to do business. As a result, the passenger will likely wage a successful lawsuit, resulting in further financial and public relation repercussions for United and the Chicago Department of Aviation. This raises the question that I posed to Father Martin in a tweet yesterday: how would the state correct this issue better than the market? What economic system would prevent such an incident from occurring? Martin tries to argue that the   pursuit of profit led to the incident and that capitalism promotes a corporate culture in which money is more important than respecting human dignity. What is the solution, then, to a system that gave rise to such treatment? To recognize that profits are not the sole measure of a good decision in the corporate world. To realize that human beings are more important than money, no matter how much a   economist might object. To act morally. And to respect human dignity. Except that the United incident shows that   businesses cannot afford to disrespect human dignity. Firms that respect their passengers are rewarded by investors and customers those that do not get crushed.

17796,"WikiLeaks Hacked Email Reveals Inside Look at Hillary Campaign: ""Just Need a 3rd Party Spoiler!""","Getty - Chip Somodevilla The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. 
Hillary Clinton advisers Cheryl Mills and Robbie Mook provide one of the most revealing looks inside the campaign yet, courtesy of a WikiLeaks hacked email. 
In the email , Robbie Mooks argues that Hillary Clinton would be making a mistake to run on her gender as an argument for her suitability to be president: 
""In fact, I think running on her gender would be the SAME mistake as 2008, ie having a message at odds with what voters ultimately want. She ran on experience when voters wanted change...and sure there was plenty of data in marks polls with voters saying her experience appealed to them. But that was missing the larger point—voters wanted change. 
Same deal here—lots of people are going to say it would be neat for a woman to be president but that doesn't mean that's actually WHY they will vote for her. That's likely to be how she will handle the economy and relate to the middle class. 
It's also risky because injecting gender makes her candidacy about HER and not the voters and making their lives better. 
That said I would not be surprised if this is a powerful message for donor and activist engagement (vs persuadable voters)."" Image Credit: Michael Buckner/Getty Images 
Then, Mills responds: 
Interesting how hard this narrative is being pushed. 
A friend shared this article with you from The Washington Post: 
Embrace being a woman running for president.. 
http://wapo.st/1dbwtNo 
The link is to a Chris Cillizza article on “How Hillary Clinton can correct the biggest mistake she made in 2008.” 
But one of the most fascinating tidbits is Mooks' suggestive off-hand reference to getting a “third party spoiler”: 
""Just need a third party spoiler and we'll be all set! 
I think the chatterers will dissect and criticize whatever she chooses to do but it's going to be so important that the research drive it. I often felt in 08 that the research was being used to back up a premise instead of genuinely find the right target."" 
To which Mills replied cryptically: 
“WJC redux of 1992” 
WJC is a common acronym for former President William Jefferson Clinton. The reference is to the three-man race in 1992 between George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. Contrary to what is widely believed, there is fairly convincing evidence that Perot did not “cost” Bush the 1992 election. 
Trump supporters have mused if presidential candidates Gary Johnson and independent Evan McMullin are in the 2016 race for the sole purpose of sabotaging the Republican presidential nominee. Image Credit: George Frey/Getty Images 
Johnson, who is running at about six percent in the polls, is running on the Libertarian Party ticket. For historical context, the Libertarians have sent up a presidential candidate every year for the last 44 years . Libertarians have plenty to disagree about regarding Trump's plan for the United States, whether it be on national security, immigration or trade. 
That leads us to Evan McMullin, a man whose name recently caught fire on Twitter due to the so-called “ Mormon mafia ” started by Mitt Romney. Lou Dobbs, an ardent Trump advocate, coined the phrase while labeling McMullin... — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) October 23, 2016 
McMullin was indeed a Mormon missionary, but reports of him belonging to a “mafia” remain unconfirmed. The candidate was a CIA operative and an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, which has fueled speculation and conspiracy theories about his run. 
Interestingly, the candidate is currently surging in Utah and his support may be underestimated . If McMullin could pull off a victory, it would launch an improbable scenario that could see the election thrown to the House of Representatives and an all-out scramble to nominate a president and vice president of the Congress's choosing. 
This potential monkey wrench in Trump's plans has fueled outrage and concern among supporters: Team Hillary is all set: Ex-CIA Evan McMullin is the expert covert spoiler.

17797,Breaking: Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin Could Be A Spy | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print It has been revealed that there are about 650,000 emails on Huma Abedin’s husband’s laptop. Of the 650,000 emails, thousands are labeled “classified” National Security material forwarded from another email server. According to sources, the emails were discovered in a folder labeled, “Life Insurance”. Is it possible the folder was mislabeled by Abedin to deliberately conceal its contents? This also begs the question: How did Huma Abedin get National Security clearance? 
The NY Post explains where FBI originally dropped the ball when they first investigated Abedin: Skeptical agents showed Abedin three separate email exchanges she had with an IT staffer regarding the operation of the private Clinton server during Clinton’s tenure at State. Abedin claimed she “did not recall” the email exchanges. So if you believe Abedin, she didn’t know the private clintonemail.com server that hosted her [email protected] account even existed until she heard about it in the news. Comey was a believer; he didn’t even bother to call her back for further questioning. Case closed. But Abedin’s role in this caper begs for fresh scrutiny. Making false statements to a federal agent is a felony. So is mishandling classified information. By forwarding classified emails to her personal email account and printing them out at home, Abedin appears to have violated a Classified Information NonDisclosure Agreement she signed at the State Department on Jan. 30, 2009, in which she agreed to keep all classified material under the control of the US government. An infographic puts it in a simpler form, stating how government emails were forwarded to her Yahoo account — for what? No one knows. There was allegedly a counter-espionage case going on around the time. With 500,000,000 email accounts hacked earlier last year, Abedin has put our National Security in danger.

17798,"Roger Ailes Leaves Fox News, and Rupert Murdoch Steps In - The New York Times","In the dark for days, Fox News staffers finally got word on Thursday about the future of their network. The news was delivered in person by Rupert Murdoch, the    media mogul who started Fox News with Roger Ailes 20 years ago. It was an unexpected visit, and with stunned employees listening in Fox’s Midtown Manhattan headquarters, Mr. Murdoch announced that Mr. Ailes was out as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Murdoch himself would be taking over Fox News in the interim. Mr. Ailes was not there. Mr. Murdoch had barred him from the building starting on Wednesday, according to one person briefed on the matter. The person said Fox News’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, had learned Mr. Ailes was trying to get some of his   stars to criticize those who cooperated with investigators looking into accusations of sexual harassment against him. The announcement was the culmination of an unsettling   stretch for the network that began on July 6, when Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed a lawsuit accusing Mr. Ailes of sexual harassment. That led to an internal investigation by 21st Century Fox. It was a stunning fall for one of the most powerful people in the media industry, who built Fox News into a ratings juggernaut and a hugely influential platform for Republican politics. Mr. Ailes will walk away with about $40 million as part of a settlement agreement, according to two people briefed on the matter, which essentially amounts to the remainder of his existing employment contract through 2018. As part of the agreement, Mr. Ailes cannot start a competitor to Fox News. He will continue to make himself available as an adviser to Mr. Murdoch on an interim basis, the two people said, though he will not be directly involved with Fox News or 21st Century Fox. In a statement, Mr. Murdoch praised Mr. Ailes, 76, and his “remarkable contribution” to the company, without making mention of the sexual harassment scandal that felled him. “Roger shared my vision of a great and independent television organization and executed it brilliantly over 20 great years,” Mr. Murdoch said in a statement. “Fox News has given voice to those who were ignored by the traditional networks and has been one of the great commercial success stories of modern media. ” Among those who cooperated with investigators looking into the allegations against Mr. Ailes was one of his   stars, Megyn Kelly. She had been among a small group of employees who resisted a campaign to rally support for Mr. Ailes, which came to be viewed as a “loyalty test,” according to several staff members, who declined to be identified. Ms. Kelly told investigators that she received repeated, unwanted advances from Mr. Ailes, which she rejected, according to two people briefed on her account. The entreaties, which happened in the early part of her career at Fox, bothered Ms. Kelly to the point that she retained a lawyer because she worried that her rejections would jeopardize her job, though they ultimately did not. In a statement earlier this week, Mr. Ailes’s lawyer said he never sexually harassed Ms. Kelly. During the investigation, led by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison, around 10 women have come forward with stories of inappropriate conduct from Mr. Ailes while at Fox News, according to a person briefed on the investigation. In a letter to Mr. Murdoch on Thursday, Mr. Ailes wrote: “Having spent 20 years building this historic business, I will not allow my presence to become a distraction from the work that must be done every day to ensure that Fox News and Fox Business continue to lead our industry. ” A copy of the letter was provided by Mr. Ailes’s lawyer, Susan Estrich. She did not respond to further requests for comment. Though Mr. Ailes made no mention of the investigation into his workplace behavior or the sexual harassment lawsuit, he said, pointedly: “I take particular pride in the role that I have played advancing the careers of the many women I have promoted to executive and   positions. Many of these talented journalists have deservedly become household names known for their intelligence and strength, whether reporting the news, fair and balanced, and offering exciting opinions on our opinion programs. ” The terms of Mr. Ailes’s departure were negotiated over several chaotic days that transfixed the media world and spurred intense coverage. Mr. Murdoch, on vacation in the French Riviera with his wife, Jerry Hall, had been working in tandem with his sons, James and Lachlan, with whom he leads 21st Century Fox, but it was not until he returned to New York that a deal was reached. Mr. Murdoch will assume the role of chairman and will be an interim chief executive of the Fox News channel and Fox Business Network until a permanent replacement for Mr. Ailes is found. His interim role is intended to ensure stability during the rest of the presidential race, and to be taken as a signal that the network is not on the verge of a   overhaul, said a person briefed on the matter. Mr. Murdoch plans to be “extremely engaged” and had already been attending some news meetings because Mr. Ailes has had health issues recently, the person said. In the same statement as their father, James and Lachlan Murdoch praised Mr. Ailes but alluded to the trouble at Fox News, saying they were committed “to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect. ” Lachlan joined his father in the newsroom on Thursday, but James was not present because of a previously scheduled business trip in Europe. Mr. Ailes’s position atop Fox News was thrown into doubt two weeks ago after Ms. Carlson filed a sexual harassment suit against him. Mr. Ailes denied the accusations, but 21st Century Fox began the internal review and, earlier this week, determined that he could no longer remain in the job. The campaign to rally support for Mr. Ailes ultimately became a problem for him. It included declarations casting doubt on Ms. Carlson’s charges from hosts including Greta Van Susteren, Jeanine Pirro and Neil Cavuto, who in an   described the accusations as “sick. ” Several female staff members had said on Wednesday that they feared that campaign was making younger female staff members with their own stories to tell too frightened to speak with investigators  —   something the investigators feared as well, people briefed on their inquiry said this week. A friend of Ms. Kelly, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Ms. Kelly resisted pressure to support Mr. Ailes, and cooperated with the investigation so that those other staff members would “feel more comfortable coming forward to tell the truth. ” Ms. Kelly has not spoken publicly about the matter. On Thursday night, Kirsten Powers, a Fox contributor for 11 years, said: “While I understand loyalty, I was disappointed that so many senior members of Fox’s   team rushed to defend Roger in a way that seemed to prejudge an investigation into sexual harassment. I would hope that in 2016 people would know that just because you weren’t harassed, or didn’t witness harassment by a certain man, that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. ” For hundreds of Fox employees gathered in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention, the week had been surreal. Those who left New York just days ago will return this weekend to a workplace turned  . “There are people in tears,” said Chris Wallace, the host of “Fox News Sunday. ” “I shed mine a couple of days ago. ” During an interview, Mr. Wallace’s anchor baritone occasionally grew faint Bret Baier, his colleague, was also emotional. Notably, Mr. Baier and his fellow Fox anchors Brit Hume and Ms. Van Susteren declined to say definitively whether they would remain at Fox, although Mr. Baier, after some hesitation, said: “I couldn’t be happier. ” Several of the network’s most recognizable faces  —   including Bill O’Reilly, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baier  —   are known to have contract clauses that allow them to leave the network if Mr. Ailes is not in charge. The lawyer for Ms. Carlson, Nancy Erika Smith, released a statement that her client’s “extraordinary courage has caused a seismic shift in the media world. ” She added, “We hope that all businesses now understand that women will no longer tolerate sexual harassment, and reputable companies will no longer shield those who abuse women. ”",0

17803,"Rodrigo Duterte, Scorned Abroad, Remains Popular in the Philippines - The New York Times","MANILA  —   Virgilio Mabag figures there is a good chance that his meth addict brother will become a casualty of President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly campaign against drugs in the Philippines. “I told him to prepare himself to die,” Mr. Mabag said. But Mr. Mabag, 54, who runs a neighborhood volunteer association in a sprawling Manila slum, still enthusiastically supports Mr. Duterte, saying that his policies will make the country safer and more orderly. “I’m delighted,” said Mr. Mabag, who was wearing a Duterte  . “This is the only time I’ve seen a president like this, who says exactly what he wants to say. ” The rest of the world may have trouble understanding this, but Mr. Duterte still commands ardent support in the Philippines. Since he took office in June promising to kill drug addicts and dealers, about 1, 400 people have been killed by the police in antidrug operations, and hundreds more by vigilantes. His embrace of violence has shocked other countries and brought condemnation from human rights groups. He has compared himself to Hitler (and later apologized) called President Obama a “son of a whore,” and joked after an Australian missionary was raped and killed that “she was so beautiful” he should have been first to rape her. He has lashed out at the pope, despite leading a nation that is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, and cursed the United Nations and the European Union. No matter. For many Filipinos, Mr. Duterte’s passionate outbursts, however crude and impolitic, are signs of his fearlessness and willingness to act. The weak leadership of previous presidents, they say, led to high rates of violent crime, drug use, woefully inadequate infrastructure and widespread poverty. The first national polls since Mr. Duterte became president came out this week, showing that his outbursts and the mounting body count have barely dented his extraordinary popularity. One poll, conducted in late September, found that 83 percent of Filipinos had “much trust” in him, compared with 84 percent in June, after he was elected but before he took office. The other showed his trust rating falling slightly, to 86 percent in September from 91 percent in July. “His initiatives, and this includes the antidrug campaign, are well received by the people,” said Ramon C. Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. “They don’t have an impact on the overall perception of his administration or presidency. ” While Mr. Duterte’s antidrug campaign and outrageous statements have received all the attention abroad, he has pushed ahead with an array of progressive social policies that have won him broad support in the Philippines. Lorraine Badoy, a dermatologist and a volunteer at a nongovernmental organization who lives in one of Manila’s gated communities, acknowledges that the president’s outbursts make her cringe. “I just wish he’d shut up sometimes,” she said. But she says she is more enamored of his social policies than she is concerned about the casualties of the antidrug campaign. In Mr. Duterte, she said: “I see something that I have not seen in a long time in the Philippines, which is that he cares. He cares for the small guy, which is very important to me. ” His government has paved the way for indigenous people displaced by mining and logging to return to their ancestral lands, has committed to providing free irrigation to subsistence farmers, has suspended the operations of mining companies that violated environmental protection laws, and has begun a program of free checkups for the 20 million poorest Filipinos. His support has blossomed on social media  —   followers on the most popular   pages number in the millions  —   which his administration has cannily harnessed. Social media catapulted Mr. Duterte to the presidency, says his communications secretary, Martin Andanar, and it remains a bastion of support in the face of what Mr. Andanar considers negative coverage by international and local news media. “It is very important for our team to maintain, and even encourage  —   foster  —   the relationship of the different social media patriots of President Duterte,” he said. “We do it by reaching out to them, they reach out to us. ” Mr. Duterte’s social media team, which Mr. Andanar oversees, selects a weekly message, often tied to the news, and creates posts it hopes will be reposted and widely shared by supporters. He said he recently told followers on social media that “the crime news has been blown out of proportion, and nobody’s listening to our economic policies. ” So even as the value of the Philippine peso began to slip last week, Mr. Duterte’s supporters were arguing that a weakened currency increased the buying power of remittances sent back by Filipinos working overseas. When Mr. Duterte likened himself to Hitler, his supporters rushed to defend him on social media, arguing that the comment was precipitated by a remark by former President Benigno S. Aquino III, who compared Mr. Duterte to Hitler five months earlier. The argument aligned with ones made the same day by administration officials. “It is a matter of record that the reference to Hitler did not originate from the president,” his spokesman Ernesto Abella said in a statement. A   site went further, posting photographs of two Reuters journalists it accused of causing the furor by misrepresenting Mr. Duterte’s words, and calling for their punishment. The post was shared thousands of times on social media and whipped up an untold number of commenters, who created a flurry of threats and insults. Mocha Uson, a blogger with 4. 2 million followers on Facebook, shared the images, adding the caption in Tagalog, “Enemies of change. ” Critics of Mr. Duterte have been threatened with rape and a variety of deaths, including by hanging, drowning and, as one   doctor suggested to Emily Rauhala, who has written about the Philippines for The Washington Post, that she crawl back into her mother’s uterus and suffocate. Mr. Andanar said that the administration did not condone threats of violence on social media. So far, none has been carried out. However, he said, “I cannot blame the Duterte social media patriots when they protect the president and when they do everything that they can to pounce on the enemy. ” Many Duterte supporters say their cause is unfairly portrayed in the mainstream news media. But Melinda Quintos de Jesus, executive director of the Center for Media Freedom, said that threats by   online mobs had intimidated the national news media. The local news media has published some criticism and several reports on specific cases of extrajudicial killings, she said, but the major television stations and newspapers have failed to produce critical analyses of Mr. Duterte’s policies. “They like him, they fear him,” she said. “They basically are afraid to be singled out. ” In The Hague on Thursday, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, issued a blunt warning to the government, saying that the violent   crackdown could become a target of a criminal investigation because   killing fell within the jurisdiction of the court. There are signs, in some quarters at least, that the killings have begun to tarnish Mr. Duterte’s popularity. In a slum in Pasay, a district of greater Manila, on a recent Saturday, Migo Paladio, 24, stood in a narrow alley and watched the crowds from two wakes spill out. They were for men killed by vigilantes on the presumption that they were drug dealers. Mr. Paladio, a technician, said they were not dealers. He said they were among 10 people he knew who had been killed in the last three months in Mr. Duterte’s antidrug campaign. He voted for Mr. Duterte, but he said his support was wavering. “I was wrong about what I thought was going to happen,” he said. “He’s prioritizing the killings too much. And we have six more years of this. ”",0

En los últimos cinco años se han detectado más de 75 construcciones de este tipo en las fronteras entre ambos países. Imagen Ilustrativa Jorge Duenes Reuters   
Un túnel subterráneo de unos 500 metros de longitud destinado al narcotráfico ha sido descubierto en la frontera entre EE.UU. y México por las autoridades de este último país. Dentro de la construcción, que al parecer comunicaba la ciudad de San Diego (Tijuana) con la localidad homónima situada en el estado de California, fueron encontradas más de dos toneladas de marihuana, informa 'The San Diego Union Tribune' . Asimismo, la construcción estaba equipada con luces, sistemas ferroviarios y ventilación. 
Los informes señalan que el túnel, de 1,15 metros de altura y 90 centímetros de ancho, se encontraban a 7 metros de profundidad sobre un establecimiento de venta de hielo en las cercanías del aeropuerto internacional General Abelardo L. Rodríguez, que se halla a solo 300 metros de la frontera con EE.UU. Se presume que además de servir de fachada, el lugar era utilizado como punto de fabricación de estupefacientes. 
El Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de EE.UU. también ha confirmado la existencia del túnel, pero no ha dado a conocer su ubicación exacta. 
En los últimos cinco años se han detectado más de 75 túneles de contrabando fronterizo. En el mes de abril, la Fiscalía mexicana localizó uno de los más extensos hallados hasta el momento, con más de 700 metros de largo y hasta un ascensor.  ",0
17805,Lincoln Center President’s Abrupt Departure Was Prompted by a Relationship - The New York Times,"The surprising departure of Jed Bernstein last month after just 27 months as president of Lincoln Center was prompted not by a change in career plans, as announced, but by the discovery that he had been in a relationship with a staff member, the organization acknowledged on Tuesday. The center, the world’s leading performing arts complex, had presented the resignation as a sudden but understandable decision by a cultural leader who wanted to return to producing shows for the stage, where he had spent much of his career. In reality, Mr. Bernstein, 61, was forced from the top post after an anonymous complaint revealed that he had been involved in a consensual relationship with a woman in her 30s who worked for him  —   and whom he had twice promoted, according to two people briefed on his resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations over his departure were confidential. After repeated requests during the past several weeks to elaborate on Mr. Bernstein’s departure, Lincoln Center on Tuesday provided a statement to The New York Times through the crisis management firm Rubenstein. The statement said that in response to the complaint, received in March, Lincoln Center “immediately retained independent outside counsel to conduct an investigation” and “determined that Mr. Bernstein had violated Lincoln Center human resources policy by not disclosing a personal relationship with an employee. ” Mr. Bernstein, as president, had been positioned to lead Lincoln Center into a new era of prominence, led by a   effort to turn the New York Philharmonic’s acoustically challenged home into a   symphonic hall. But even with $100 million from David Geffen, the job of raising an additional $400 million to cover the projected cost has become more difficult with the departure of such a key figure. Lincoln Center’s operations are now being directed by Katherine G. Farley, the chairwoman, who said in a statement at the time of Mr. Bernstein’s resignation that “Lincoln Center is in a very strong position artistically, operationally and financially. ” Mr. Bernstein did not respond to calls and messages over the past several weeks. On Tuesday, he said in an email sent by his publicist, Cristyne L. Nicholas: “I take full responsibility for my actions and have cooperated fully with Lincoln Center. I remain proud of the incredible group of colleagues with whom I have worked at Lincoln Center and the accomplishments that we were able to achieve together and as I move forward to my next chapter, I wish them continued success. ” Concerns about Mr. Bernstein first came to the board’s attention in November when he asked to renew his contract, which was to expire in December 2016. In preparation, Lincoln Center  —   which was planning to grant the renewal  —   sought feedback about him from members of the senior staff. While some praised Mr. Bernstein for his energy and enthusiasm, others complained about his management style, namely his telling   jokes and addressing female employees as “Sweetie” and “Honey,” the people briefed on the matter said. Lincoln Center executives asked Mr. Bernstein to work with a coach to correct the behavior, which he began to do, the sources said. The entire staff was also given a refresher workshop in sensitivity training. Lincoln Center, however, did not believe that its president’s conduct constituted sexual harassment, the people knowledgeable about his departure said. Then in March, before the contract was finalized, an anonymous complaint alerted Lincoln Center executives about a sexual relationship between Mr. Bernstein and a female employee whom he had promoted, most recently to a senior position in September. Both Mr. Bernstein and the employee are single. To investigate, Lincoln Center enlisted outside counsel  —   Jeffrey S. Klein, chairman of the employment litigation practice group at Weil, Gotshal  Manges. Although the inquiry determined that the relationship had ended by the time Mr. Bernstein was confronted and that it appeared to be consensual, the sources said, it violated Lincoln Center’s policies about senior management dating subordinates. The organization declined to provided a copy of the policy. Lincoln Center officials confronted Mr. Bernstein, who agreed to resign and was paid a sum of money according to the terms of his contract, which are confidential. As for why Lincoln Center did not originally disclose the true circumstances of Mr. Bernstein’s departure, the sources said the institution wanted to protect the woman involved. The Times is withholding her name to protect her privacy. Lincoln Center was also satisfied that the woman, having been twice promoted under its previous president, Reynold Levy, deserved the latest promotion that she had received from Mr. Bernstein, the sources said. Mr. Bernstein took over from Mr. Levy in January 2014. Mr. Levy, a prodigious   who oversaw the institution’s ambitious $1. 2 billion renovation, served for 11 years. A search for Mr. Bernstein’s successor is underway. Before coming to Lincoln Center, Mr. Bernstein spent more than a decade as president of the Broadway League, the industry’s national trade association. He also produced Broadway shows and helped to   the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania as a stage for live theater. He landed the Lincoln Center job partly because former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a friend of Ms. Farley, had supported him Mr. Bernstein and his brother, Doug, directed the mayor’s performance in the annual Inner Circle show. The organization never received information suggesting that Mr. Bernstein had any history of comparable misconduct, the sources said, and the issue did not surface in his vetting as a candidate. When he was hired, in May 2013, Mr. Bernstein struck many as a surprising choice because he had a marketing background and had never run a nonprofit institution, let alone one with multiple prominent constituents, which in this case include the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Ballet.",0

17807,Authorities Look to Aaron Hernandez’s Alleged Bisexuality as Reason Behind Suicide - Breitbart,"After former NFL star Aaron Hernandez was found dead in his jail cell last week, authorities found three suicide notes lying near his body, one addressed to his fiancée, one to his daughter, and the third to his prison boyfriend. Authorities are now questioning whether the player’s complicated sex life was a prime motivation for his years of troublesome behavior, and ultimately his suicide. [Authorities discovered much focus on the Bible inside Hernandez’s jail cell after his death. Not only did he write a portion of a Bible verse on his forehead  —   John 3:16  —   he had also used a red marker to mimic Christ’s stigmata on his hands and feet. Along with the stigmata, which are markings emulating the wounds Jesus suffered on the cross, a Bible was opened to the same verse he excerpted on his forehead. That verse reads, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whosoever believes in him would not perish but have eternal life. ”  The suicide seemed to come at a strange time for Aaron Hernandez, since it occurred only a few days after he had been cleared in his second murder trial. The letter to the player’s prison boyfriend might go toward explaining much of the former New England Patriots’ life, Newsweek reported. Investigations against Hernandez have revealed that there may have been elements of sex, deception, and secrecy to the player’s unsettled life. In 2015 Hernandez was convicted of the murder of Odin Lloyd, the man who was dating the sister of the NFL player’s fiancée. In some ways Lloyd’s murder made little sense, but police were working on an angle that Hernandez killed Lloyd because Lloyd knew of the player’s bisexuality and Hernandez wanted that information kept secret. A relationship Hernandez reportedly had with a high school friend also played a role in the investigation. Ernest Wallace, a   in the murder of Lloyd, told police in several different ways that he thought Hernandez was gay. Hernandez’s is bisexuality now seems practically assured after the discovery of the letter to his prison boyfriend. Investigators also speculated that Hernandez’s sexual proclivities may have been at the root of his bouts of violence. Hernandez had a long list of outbursts going back to his youth, and many of these incidents also formed a central part in the case against the NFL player in Lloyd’s murder. Perhaps there will be no way to prove the suspicions that Hernandez’ sexual proclivities led to his turbulent life, but it would certainly make sense.

17809,America Is Now At Its Greatest Risk Of a False Flag Attack,"By Rahul Manchanda, Esq. on October 30, 2016 The Neo-Con/Communist natives are restless, they desperately want their World War 3, and they are wanting to move their wealth and power to their next world empire, which will be the final one in their sick deluded minds, unopposed and permanent. 
Never in America’s history has she been in more danger of a “false flag” attack from her enemies, both foreign and domestic, than she is now. 
The contemporary term “false flag” describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them. 
Historically, the term “false flag” had its origins in naval warfare where the use of a flag other than the belligerent’s true battle flag before (but not while) engaging the enemy has long been accepted as a permissible ruse de guerre ; by contrast, flying a false flag while engaging the enemy constitutes “perfidy.” 
Operations carried out during peace-time by civilian organizations, as well as covert government agencies, can (by extension) also be called false flag operations if they seek to hide the real organization behind an operation. 
America has been thoroughly infiltrated by a mighty and wealthy foreign power and menace, while her people are suffering financially, and she is now poised to be sacrificed on the altar of history for a one world government headquartered overseas. 
The Neo-Con/Communist natives are restless, they desperately want their World War 3, and they are wanting to move their wealth and power to their next world empire, which will be the final one in their sick deluded minds, unopposed and permanent. 
Now that Hillary Clinton has been “theoretically re-indicted” by the FBI for the email scandals (although they are being obstructed by our very own US Department of “Justice” under Attorney General Loretta Lynch) this has effectively ruined her chances of becoming President through legal channels, so they only have one more option – and that is a false flag attack leading us directly into World War 3 in a nuclear war, using all of their carefully placed traitors in the Pentagon, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, and cooperative local police departments all throughout the United States, with a declaration of a state of emergency in both the United States, and abroad. 
This is why it is vitally important that all Americans, both in the private and public sector, start watching their government and elected leaders like “hawks.” 
Americans need to use the Neo-Con’s mantra of “See Something, Say Something” against them. 
The Neo-Con/Stasi/Communist’s Zersetzung (organized gang-stalking under Bill Clinton’s Community Oriented Policing “COPS” program) needs to be turned by the People against them, and the American People need to watch each and every single one of them like they would watch a lunatic holding an AK-47 in a mall. 
The Neo-Cons simply can not be trusted, as they work for the Plutocrats, who desperately want to hold on to their power, and will not willingly relinquish it to the People by way of Donald Trump and his Populist Revolt and Uprising. 
Some examples of real false flags throughout history having routinely disastrous results, wherein the “winners” re-wrote history, include the: 
(1) 1914 Battle of Trindade fought between the British auxiliary cruiser RMS Carmania and the German auxiliary cruiser SMS Cap Trafalgar which had been altered to look like Carmania; 
(2) World War II German commerce raider Kormoran which surprised and sank the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney in 1941 while disguised as a Dutch merchant ship, causing the greatest recorded loss of life on an Australian warship; 
(3) trial of Otto Skorzeny, who planned and commanded Operation Greif, by a U.S. military tribunal at the Dachau Trials included a finding that Skorzeny was not guilty of a crime by ordering his men into action in American uniforms; 
(4) 1788 incident wherein the head tailor at the Royal Swedish Opera received an order to sew a number of Russian military uniforms to stage an attack on Puumala, a Swedish outpost on the Russo-Swedish border allowing King Gustav III of Sweden, who lacked the constitutional authority to initiate unprovoked hostilities without the Estates’ consent, to launch the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790); 
(5) September 1931 incident wherein Japanese officers fabricated a pretext for invading Manchuria by blowing up a section of railway; 
(6) Gleiwitz incident in 1939 involving Reinhard Heydrich fabricating evidence of a Polish attack against Germany to mobilize German public opinion for war with Poland; 
(7) November 26, 1939 incident wherein the Soviet army shelled Mainila, a Russian village near the Finnish border blaming Finland for the attack using the incident as a pretext to invade Finland, starting the Winter War, four days later; 
(8) 1962 Operation Northwoods plot by the U.S. Department of Defense for a war with Cuba involving scenarios such as fabricating the hijacking or shooting down of passenger and military planes, sinking a U.S. ship in the vicinity of Cuba, burning crops, sinking a boat filled with Cuban refugees, attacks by alleged Cuban infiltrators inside the United States, and harassment of U.S. aircraft and shipping and the destruction of aerial drones by aircraft disguised as Cuban MiGs to be blamed on Cuba and a pretext for an invasion of Cuba and the overthrow of Fidel Castro’s communist government; 
(9) Reichstag fire which was an arson attack on the Reichstag building in Berlin on February 27, 1933 using as “evidence” by the Nazis that the Communists were beginning a plot against the German government, whereby Adolf Hitler, who was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany four weeks before, on 30 January, urged President Paul von Hindenburg to pass an emergency decree to counter the “ruthless confrontation of the Communist Party of Germany” – with civil liberties suspended, the government instituted mass arrests of Communists, including all of the Communist parliamentary delegates; 
(10) April 4 1953 incident wherein the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh by carrying out false flag attacks “on mosques and key public figures” to be blamed on Iranian communists loyal to the government, code-named “TP-Ajax,” the tactic of a “directed campaign of bombings by Iranians posing as members of the Communist party” involving the bombing of “at least” one well known Muslim’s house by CIA agents posing as Communists; 
(11) 2008 shooting of two minibuses carrying Georgians who lived in Abkhazia who wanted to cross the border so they could go and vote in the parliamentary election that day, in a volatile area on the border of Abkhazia and the Republic of Georgia, wherein President Saakashvili indicated that the attack had been an attempt to disrupt the election, implying that it had been Abkhaz or Russian forces who had been behind it, providing a favorable opportunity for the president to focus the nation’s attention on an external enemy, leading attention away from his domestic critics, as well as making use of his position as leader to rally the Georgians around his candidates in the election; 
(12) assassination of Charlemagne Péralte of Haiti in 1919, after checkpoints were passed by military disguised as guerrilla fighters; 
(13) Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s, wherein captured Mau Mau members who switched sides and specially trained British troops initiated the pseudo-gang concept to successfully counter Mau Mau; 
(14) Algerian civil war in the middle of 1994 wherein death squads composed of Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité (DRS) security forces disguised themselves as Islamist terrorists and committed false flag terror attacks; 
(15) Mexican wars of 1819 and 1846-48; 
(16) Spanish-American War of 1898 involving the surprise explosion of the battleship Maine at Havana, Cuba wherein the Hearst Press accused the Spanish and the USA declared war on Spain conquering the Philippines, Guam and Cuba; 
(17) World War I in 1914-1918 wherein a U-boat torpedo hit ocean liner Lusitania near Britain and some 1200 people, including 128 Americans, on board lost their lives, and subsequent investigations revealed that the major explosions were inside the Lusitania, as it was secretly transporting 6 million pounds of artillery shells and rifle ammunition, as well as other explosives on behalf of Morgan Banking Corporation to help Britain and France; 
(18) World War 2 in 1939-1945 where a U-boat torpedo hit the ocean liner Athenia near Britain with some 1100 passengers, of which 311 were Americans; 
(19) US naval intelligence planning and suggesting “8 insults” to bring Japan into war with the US, and where President Roosevelt executed this plan immediately and also added some other insults, enraging Japan, such as a total blockade of Japanese oil imports, as agreed between the Americans, British and the Dutch – FDR also declared an all-out embargo against Japan and forbade them the use of the Panama Canal impeding Japan’s access to Venezuelan oil; 
(20) one of many incidents provoking Japan to attack Pearl Harbor some 6 months later; 
(21) Korean War in 1950-1953 wherein South Korean incursions (the Tiger regiment etc.) into North Korea (1949) led to contrary claims and into war – the cause of this war was covert action involving leaders of Taiwan, South Korea and the US Military Industrial Complex (John Foster Dulles has been mentioned as an organizer of the hostilities); 
(22) Vietnam War in “The Gulf of Tonkin Incident” wherein the American destroyer Maddox was supposedly attacked twice by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats in 1964 in the Gulf of Tonkin – but which never happened; 
(23) Grenada invasion whereby the Grenadian leader, Maurice Bishop, who favored the left and invited Cubans to build infrastructure to accommodate long range Soviet aircraft was deposed and executed in October 19, 1983 – six days later the US invaded, with the supposed reason that American medical students studying in Grenada were in danger due to a “Cuban presence”– and of course the new leader supported by the US favored more traditional values and the right; 
(24) Panama invasion wherein an incident between American and Panamanian troops led to invasion and the earlier Carter administration plan to hand control of the canal over to Panama was cancelled; 
(25) US-Israeli sponsored wars between Iraq and Iran from 1980-1988; 
(26) Desert Storm War (First Gulf War) in 1991 wherein Saddam Hussein asked for permission from the US (via their ambassador April Gillespie) to invade Kuwait, and got an answer that the US was not concerned with “Arab quarrels” – this was a trap, and after Saddam occupied Kuwait, George Bush Sr. mobilized a coalition of some 40 nations to “liberate Kuwait” and smash the recently-built Iraqi military power base – this incident also involved a media hoax wherein the daughter of a Kuwaiti US Ambassador played a nurse on TV and testified to “witnessing” Iraqi soldiers throwing babies out of incubators in Kuwait; 
(27) War on Terror launched by the Bush administration in October 2001 – claimed to be the response to terrorism, especially the 9-11 incidents; 
(28) Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan invasion); 
(29) Enduring Justice (Second Gulf war); and 
(30) countless others. 
Paragraph 43 of the Field Manual published by the War Department, United States Army, on 1 October 1940, under the entry Rules of Land Warfare states: 
“National flags, insignias and uniforms as a ruse – in practice it has been authorized to make use of these as a ruse. The foregoing rule (Article 23 of the Annex of the IVth Hague Convention), does not prohibit such use, but does prohibit their improper use. It is certainly forbidden to make use of them during a combat. Before opening fire upon the enemy, they must be discarded.” 
The American Soldiers’ Handbook states: 
“The use of the enemy flag, insignia, and uniform is permitted under some circumstances. They are not to be used during actual fighting, and if used in order to approach the enemy without drawing fire, should be thrown away or removed as soon as fighting begins.” 
The 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949 (Protocol I) states: 
Article 37. – Prohibition of perfidy – 1. It is prohibited to kill, injure, or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy: (a) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; (b) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness; (c) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and (d) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict. 2. Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and disinformation. 
Article 38. – Recognized emblems – 1. It is prohibited to make improper use of the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Lion and Sun or of other emblems, signs or signals provided for by the Conventions or by this Protocol. It is also prohibited to misuse deliberately in an armed conflict other internationally recognized protective emblems, signs or signals, including the flag of truce, and the protective emblem of cultural property. 2. It is prohibited to make use of the distinctive emblem of the United Nations, except as authorized by that Organization. 
Article 39. – Emblems of nationality – 1. It is prohibited to make use in an armed conflict of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict. 2. It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations. 3. Nothing in this Article or in Article 37, paragraph 1(d), shall affect the existing generally recognized rules of international law applicable to espionage or to the use of flags in the conduct of armed conflict at sea.” 
It is vitally important to note that while the United States may have these codes and regulations, her enemies, both foreign and domestic, are not bound by these Rules. 
The American People (and indeed the rest of the world) need to be exceptionally on guard and vigilant before the upcoming November 2016 election, and even many months afterwards, because the Neo-Cons/Communists may still try and get their World War 3, even if Donald Trump is elected. 
After all, September 11, 2001 took place a full 9 months after George W Bush was sworn in at his Inauguration in January 2001, and this was blamed on Osama Bin Laden who was a known CIA Asset and who allegedly declared War on America in 1998 – he might have been the Neo-Cons’ insurance plan, cooked up during the 8 year Clinton Administration from 1992-2000. 
And of course, 9-11 is what led to the wholesale bloodshed and regime changing wars for the past 15 years, leaving the Middle East in flames, with countless millions of innocent lives and refugees lost forever, the greatest genocide and bloodbath the world has ever known. 
And don’t think that these crazed Neo-Con psychopaths won’t do it again, especially when there are only a few more countries left to “take out” now – Russia, Iran, and North Korea – as opposed to 20.

17810,Usain Bolt Stripped of Gold Medal After Relay Teammate Found Guilty of Doping - The New York Times,"Usain Bolt is no longer a   Olympic gold medalist. Bolt and the Jamaican team have been stripped of their   relay gold medal from the Beijing Games in 2008 because one runner, Nesta Carter, was found guilty of a doping violation, the International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday. Bolt won the 100 meters, the 200 and the 4x100 relay at the last three Summer Olympics, for a total of nine gold medals, tied for the most of any track athlete. Carter initially tested negative after the race in 2008. But his sample was one of many retested by the I. O. C. last year. It was found to contain a prohibited stimulant, methylhexaneamine. Carter’s lawyer told Reuters on Wednesday that he intended to file an appeal of the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Olympic officials last year intensified scrutiny of samples from past Olympics after Russia was found to have executed an elaborate,   doping scheme. Dozens of athletes from the Beijing and London Games have been found, upon retesting of their stored samples, to be guilty of doping violations. Many were medalists. It is standard practice for Olympic officials to store urine samples for up to a decade so they may conduct additional tests, often with more advanced, newly developed techniques. Carter was also a part of the winning 4x100 relay team in London in 2012, but no announcement about the status of that medal has been made. The I. O. C. directed the international track federation to “modify the results” of the 2008 event. Trinidad, Japan and Brazil were second, third and fourth in the race and would each move up a notch. The United States dropped the baton in its heat and did not make the final. The I. O. C. also told the Jamaican federation to secure the return of the physical gold medals. The other two team members in the final were Asafa Powell and Michael Frater. The Jamaican team finished in 37. 10 seconds, which was a world record at the time. When one member of a team tests positive, it is typical for the entire team to be stripped of its medals, although there have been exceptions. Marion Jones lost two relay medals from 2000 after doping violations, but her teammates were allowed to keep theirs after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. When news of Carter’s positive test first emerged last year, Bolt told The Guardian, “It’s heartbreaking because over the years you’ve worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion  —   but it’s just one of those things. ” He added, “If I need to give back my gold medal, I’d have to give it back it’s not a problem for me. ” The I. O. C. also announced on Wednesday that Tatiana Lebedeva of Russia was disqualified from the 2008 long jump, in which she won the silver medal, and the triple jump because of a positive test. Bolt, regarded as the greatest sprinter in history, has said he will retire from the sport after this summer’s world championships in London.",0

17812,Supreme Court Justice Helping to Oversee Brazil Graft Inquiry Dies in Plane Crash - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The Supreme Court justice overseeing parts of the investigation into corruption at Brazil’s national oil company died on Thursday in the crash of a small plane, stunning the country as investigators are intensifying their efforts to prosecute an array of political figures on graft charges. The justice, Teori Zavascki, 68, was killed along with at least two other people traveling on a Beechcraft King Air C90 when it crashed into the Atlantic near Paraty, a town of   buildings on the coast between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, according to Brazilian news reports. The cause of the crash was unknown as of Thursday night. The federal police have begun an investigation that will be closely watched across Brazil, given Justice Zavascki’s influence in Brazil’s legal system. Justice Zavascki, who had kept a low public profile since being named to the   court in 2012, was responsible for some of the boldest moves in Brazil’s judiciary in recent years, earning him a reputation as a judge prepared to curb abuses by influential lawmakers and business leaders. In 2015, Justice Zavascki ordered the arrest and imprisonment of Delcídio do Amaral, a sitting senator from the leftist Workers’ Party, which was in power at the time. And in 2016, he ousted the speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who had orchestrated the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Large portions of Brazil’s political establishment are on edge over revelations of bribery by Odebrecht, the construction giant that was one of the largest contractors for Petrobras, the   oil company. Justice Zavascki was overseeing the ratification of Odebrecht’s plea deal, in which dozens of Brazilian politicians are accused of receiving funds from the company, and some prominent figures suggested that the plane crash could have been a result of foul play. “This ‘accident’ needs to be thoroughly investigated,” Márcio Adriano Anselmo, a federal investigator on the Petrobras case, said in a Facebook post. Mr. Anselmo called Justice Zavascki’s death “the prelude to the end of an era” before editing and removing parts of the post. Justice Zavascki’s death raises important concerns about the direction of the Petrobras investigation and the independence of the judiciary. President Michel Temer will be able to nominate a replacement, influencing the Supreme Court while his own   Brazilian Democratic Movement Party is facing intense criticism over graft cases and efforts to stifle the Petrobras inquiry. Within the court, justices were maneuvering quickly on Thursday to nominate a successor to oversee the Petrobras case, expressing concern about delays that could allow legislators to avoid going to jail. Under Brazilian law, the Supreme Court handles cases involving lawmakers and other senior politicians who enjoy special legal standing. Justice Marco Aurélio Mello said it would be a mistake to await Mr. Temer’s nomination of a new court member, which would be followed by Senate hearings that could take almost a year. “We cannot wait,” Mr. Mello said, citing the demands of the Petrobras investigation, called Operation Carwash in reference to a service station in the capital, Brasília, that laundered money. The plane carrying Justice Zavascki was owned by Emiliano, a Brazilian luxury hotel operator. The owner of Emiliano, Carlos Alberto Filgueiras, 69, and the pilot of the plane, Osmar Rodrigues, 56, also died in the crash. The hotel company said in a statement that Justice Zavascki and Mr. Filgueiras were “close friends. ” Brazilian news outlets also reported that a woman, whose identity was not disclosed, had died. Justice Zavascki, a specialist in tax legislation before becoming a judge, was named to the court by Ms. Rousseff, who was replaced last year by Mr. Temer, her vice president. Sergio Moro, the judge overseeing much of the Petrobras inquiry, called Justice Zavascki “an example for all judges, prosecutors and lawyers in this country. ” “Without him, there would not have been the Carwash investigation,” Judge Moro said. Legal scholars agreed that Brazil’s Supreme Court, along with Justice Zavascki’s replacement, would come under scrutiny. “This thing isn’t for amateurs,” said Antonio Valverde, a professor of ethics and philosophy at Catholic University in São Paulo, citing reports that some of Brazil’s most powerful men received bribes in the Carwash inquiry. “The names in those reports are in the federal government. ”",0

November 2016 Krankenwagen werden mit Pflug ausgestattet, um Rettungsgasse freiräumen zu können Berlin (Archiv) - Wer künftig auf der Autobahn einen Rettungswagen im Rückspiegel sieht, sollte besser schnell reagieren und Platz machen – andernfalls ist mit erheblichem Blechschaden zu rechnen. Denn ab sofort sollen deutsche Krankenwagen mit einem Pflug ausgestattet werden, mit dem träge Autofahrer einfach beiseitegeschoben werden können. Ihren Ursprung hat die Pflug-Erweiterung für deutsche Rettungswagen in einer gemeinsamen Initiative von Gesundheits- und Verkehrsministerium. ""Immer wieder kommen Rettungskräfte nicht rechtzeitig an ihren Einsatzort, weil Autofahrer nicht wissen, wie man bei Stau eine ordnungsgemäße Rettungsgasse nach § 11 Abs. 2 StVO bildet"", erklärt ein Sprecher des Verkehrsministeriums. ""Wer zu langsam reagiert und dadurch fahrlässig Menschenleben gefährdet, ist selbst schuld, wenn sein Auto was abbekommt."" In den Ministerien rechne man jedoch ohnehin damit, dass es nur in den ersten Monaten nach der Einführung des Rettungswagenpfluges vermehrt zu Blechschäden und umgekippten Fahrzeugen kommen wird. Spätestens dann dürfte sich bei den meisten Fahrern ein gewisser Lerneffekt eingestellt haben. Sollte es tatsächlich vorkommen, dass ein Fahrzeughalter verletzt wird, nachdem er von einem Krankenwagen mit Pflug von der Straße gefegt wurde, muss er nicht lange bangen. Dank der neuen mit Pflug ausgestatteten Krankenwagen kann auch er mit schnellstmöglicher medizinischer Versorgung rechnen. ssi, dan; Idee: fer; Foto oben [M]: Los Hawlos , CC BY-SA 3.0 / fabiodevilla - Shutterstock.com; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 23.11.15 Artikel teilen:",0

17818,"In Health Bill’s Defeat, Medicaid Comes of Age - The New York Times","When it was created more than a half century ago, Medicaid almost escaped notice.   stories hailed the bigger, more controversial part of the law that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed that July day in 1965  —   health insurance for elderly people, or Medicare, which the American Medical Association had bitterly denounced as socialized medicine. The New York Times did not even mention Medicaid, conceived as a small program to cover poor people’s medical bills. But over the past five decades, Medicaid has surpassed Medicare in the number of Americans it covers. It has grown gradually into a behemoth that provides for the medical needs of one in five Americans  —   74 million people  —   starting for many in the womb, and for others, ending only when they go to their graves. Medicaid, so central to the country’s health care system, also played a major, though far less appreciated, role in last week’s collapse of the Republican drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. While President Trump and others largely blamed the conservative Freedom Caucus for that failure, the objections of moderate Republicans to the deep cuts in Medicaid also helped doom the Republican bill. “I was not willing to gamble with the care of my constituents with this huge unknown,” said Representative Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey, a member of the centrist Tuesday Group caucus, noting that in three of the counties in his district in the state’s more conservative southern half, over 30 percent of all residents are covered by Medicaid. In the Senate, many Republicans, echoing their states’ governors, had worried about jeopardizing the treatment of people addicted to opioids, depriving the working poor, children and people with disabilities of health care and in the long run reducing funding for the care of elderly people in nursing homes. The Republican bill would have largely undone the expansion of Medicaid under the A. C. A. which added 11 million   adults to the program and guaranteed the federal government would cover almost all of their costs. It would have also ended the federal government’s   commitment to pay a significant share of states’ Medicaid costs, no matter how much enrollment or spending rose. Instead, the bill would have given the states a choice between a fixed annual sum per recipient or a block grant, both of which would have almost certainly led to major cuts in coverage over time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that the Republican bill would have cumulatively cut projected spending on Medicaid by $839 billion and reduced the number of Medicaid beneficiaries by 14 million over the coming decade. Many Republicans could not stomach those consequences. Even some conservatives  —   Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey, for example, and Daniel Webster of Florida  —   expressed concerns about the number of Medicaid recipients who could suffer. The Trump administration will likely still seek to rewrite Medicaid rules and give states more leeway to limit benefits or eligibility, for example, allowing them to require certain adults in the program to have jobs or pay monthly premiums. And many Republican governors and members of Congress remain determined to curb Medicaid spending, including by methods proposed in the bill. In 2015, the nation spent more than $532 billion on Medicaid, of which about 63 percent was federal money and the rest from the states. Still, last week’s defeat reflected how hard it is to take away an entitlement. It also showed the broad and deep reach of Medicaid, which covers about six times as many people as the private marketplaces created under the A. C. A. but, perhaps because the markets are more strongly associated with President Barack Obama and his law, got less attention in this month’s contentious debate. Medicaid now provides medical care to four out of 10 American children. It covers the costs of nearly half of all births in the United States. It pays for the care for   of people in nursing homes. And it provides for 10 million children and adults with physical or mental disabilities. For states, it accounts for 60 percent of federal funding  —   meaning that cuts hurt not only poor and   families caring for their children with autism or dying parents, but also bond ratings. The program is so woven into the nation’s fabric that in 2015, almost two thirds of Americans in a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they were either covered by Medicaid or had a family member or friend who was. The program not only pays for 16 percent of all personal health care spending nationwide, but also accounts for 9 percent of federal domestic spending. Because it has always covered a patchwork of groups  —   and many of its beneficiaries are poor and relatively powerless  —   Medicaid lacks the unified, formidable political constituency that Social Security and Medicare have. States often have different names for the program, and many who rely on it don’t realize that MassHealth in Massachusetts or TennCare in Tennessee are just Medicaid by another name. But in Kaiser’s polling since 2005, the percentage of people who support cutting Medicaid spending has never exceeded 13 percent. “The conventional wisdom that there’s a great deal of stigma attached to this program does not bear out in the public opinion data,” said Mollyann Brodie, who oversees polling for the foundation. President Trump led the charge for the bill that would have slashed Medicaid, but he recognized the program’s political potency during his campaign, proclaiming when he announced his candidacy that Medicaid should be saved “without cuts” and repeatedly taking to Twitter to declare his support for it. “The Republicans who want to cut SS and Medicaid are wrong,” he wrote in July 2015. The C. B. O. report made it clear that within a few years, the cuts to Medicaid in the Republican bill would have been felt by millions of Americans. “It’s health care for a huge chunk of the country,” said James A. Morone, a   professor at Brown University, “and as Donald Trump discovered, it’s really, really complicated to mess around with. ” As he waited to see what would happen to the Republican proposal last week, Myrone Pickett said, “I’ve got a question mark hanging over my head. ” Mr. Pickett, of Bloomfield, N. J. got health insurance under the A. C. A. ’s expansion of Medicaid, and has used it for monthly shots of Vivitrol, a drug that reduces cravings for opioids and alcohol. A heroin addict for 16 years, Mr. Pickett, 51, said the treatment had helped him stay clean for the past year, get medication for bipolar disorder and land a job at a grocery store. The A. C. A. offered a tempting deal to states that agreed to expand Medicaid eligibility to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level  —   $16, 400 for a single person  —   mostly   workers like cooks, hairdressers and cashiers. The federal government would initially pay 100 percent of the costs of covering their medical care, and never less than 90 percent under the terms of the law. Over the past three years, 31 states and the District of Columbia took the deal. The move was especially helpful to states overwhelmed by the opioid epidemic. It required Medicaid to cover addiction and mental health treatment for those newly eligible. Announcing his vote against the G. O. P. proposal last week, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who represents a politically moderate district north of Philadelphia, said his top concern was “the impact on the single most important issue plaguing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, and the issue that I have made my priority in Congress: opioid abuse prevention, treatment and recovery. ” The Republican bill would have allowed Medicaid payments to grow per person at an inflation rate that would have eroded their value over time. The C. B. O. estimated that states would have gradually had to devote more of their own money to Medicaid, cut payments to doctors, tighten eligibility or cut services covered. In 2020, states would have started losing the 90 percent federal match for anyone who had gained Medicaid under the A. C. A. expansion but was dropped from the rolls, even briefly. And the bill required beneficiaries in the expansion population to   every six months, instead of annually, increasing the likelihood that many would be dropped. As a result, the C. B. O. estimated that by 2026, less than 5 percent of Medicaid recipients enrolled under the A. C. A. would have been covered at the higher matching rate. But more broadly, the cuts would have almost inevitably affected every group covered by Medicaid, including the biggest block of recipients: 36 million children as of last year. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington State Republican, announced her “no” vote on the bill Thursday, saying, “Protecting vulnerable children is a core purpose of the Medicaid program and when the program fails to do so, it fails entirely. ” The cuts would also likely have eventually hit poor, chronically ill mothers like Tracie Scott of Paulding, Ohio. She has multiple sclerosis and quit her job at a dollar store two years ago because of it. Medicaid covers her and her four children, including her    daughter and an    son with   disease who has needed expensive medication and care for frequent fractures. “I’d be afraid to see some of the bills for my son,” Ms. Scott, 30, said as she cradled her newborn, Izabella, in their hospital room recently. “It’s been a lifesaver. ” For more than six million Americans older than 64, Medicaid pays for nursing homes and other   care that they would never otherwise be able to afford, while Medicare covers their medical care. The threat to such care propelled Representative Webster, whose Central Florida district includes The Villages, a retirement community with more than 150, 000 residents, to lean “no” on the bill. “This uniquely impacted Florida and our growing senior population that’s only going to explode in years to come,” said Jaryn Emhof, his spokeswoman. Representative Smith of New Jersey said he was voting no because of concerns about the impact on people with disabilities, who make up just 15 percent of all Medicaid recipients but account for 42 percent of spending, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts. For millions of disabled people, Medicaid covers services provided at home or through local programs  —   aides who help them walk, eat and bathe, for example, and physical and speech therapy  —   that allow them to stay out of institutions, where care is often more expensive. But those services are optional for states, while the cost of institutional care is not. The law would have given states an incentive to place them in institutions. Medicaid pays for Barbara Theus, 67, to attend a day program in Southfield, Mich. so that her son and caregiver, Royale Theus, can work. Ms. Theus sustained a serious head injury in a car accident 11 years ago and has not been able to care for herself since then. Medicaid also pays for home health aides who help Ms. Theus, a former nurse who did not have much savings at the time of her accident, get showered and fed. Mr. Theus was relieved when the bill failed. Had his mother lost coverage, he said, he would have had to leave his job to care for her. “I was hopeful that the powers that be would make the best decisions for the people, and that’s what happened,” he said. This was the third major effort by Republicans to end Medicaid as an   entitlement. The first was under President Ronald Reagan, the second was in 1995, after President Bill Clinton’s unsuccessful attempt to expand health care coverage. But this was the first time Republicans tried it while they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. For all the battles over the years, Medicaid started as something of an afterthought. By 1960, both parties were worried that the country’s growing reliance on   insurance was leaving out elderly people, who were unable to pay the rapidly rising cost of health care. The night of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963, Lyndon Johnson returned to his home in Washington and, unable to sleep, summoned three aides. “That’s when he took out his pen and wrote down the priorities that he was going to pursue,” one of those aides, Bill Moyers, recalled in an interview. Among them was government health insurance. President Harry S. Truman had sought to establish national health insurance  —   and failed. Democrats decided to take on a more limited goal: insurance for elderly people. They called it Medicare. Democrats pushed for it to cover hospital bills for the elderly Republicans wanted it to pay for private doctor’s bills. The American Medical Association had long lobbied against Medicare, hiring Reagan, then a Hollywood actor, to be the face of its campaign, producing a 1961 LP titled “Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine. ” And the doctors’ group had an ally in Wilbur Mills, a conservative Democrat who was chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, who like the doctors’ group did not think that   elderly people should have their bills covered. In 1960, Mr. Mills had   a law that established a small program to help the states treat the needy, as a way to stave off proposals for Medicare. The doctors’ group suggested expanding this program, preferring it because it would be administered by states, not the federal government. Mr. Mills had a change of heart after Johnson’s landslide victory in 1964. Johnson’s Republican opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, had denounced Medicare, and Mr. Mills, and many Republicans, were eager to distance themselves from him. In early 1965, Mr. Mills proposed what became known as the   cake: Medicare for hospital insurance, Medicare for doctor’s bills and a broadened version of the law that helped states pay for the care of the poor, the program that would become Medicaid. “Hardly anybody talked about Medicaid,” said Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton. “It just got added on. ” At first, Medicaid helped states provide medical care only for single parents and children on welfare. Over the next 25 years, Democrats  —   sometimes working with Republicans  —   gradually pushed to expand benefits  —   to   families, to children with speech and development delays, to home treatment for people who would otherwise be institutionalized, to children up to age 5, then to age 8 and later to age 18, and to pregnant women. Ironically, some of the biggest expansions in Medicaid came in the 1980s under Reagan, the onetime A. M. A. mouthpiece. After Republicans failed to turn Medicaid into a block grant, Democrats, who still controlled Congress, worked on compromises with the president and other Republicans, sometimes allowing cuts in programs like Medicare in exchange for expanding Medicaid, said former Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat who shepherded many of those expansions. Democrats carefully calibrated each expansion to fit within the annual budget, submitting plans to the Congressional Budget Office for “scoring,” to see how much each would cost. “We couldn’t do it all at once because we didn’t have enough money in the budgets,” Mr. Waxman said. But eventually, the goal to decouple Medicaid from the welfare system was achieved. “We broke the link to welfare,” he said. By the 1980s and ’90s, health insurance was becoming prohibitively costly, and wages were starting to stagnate.   health insurance was eroding. States led by Republicans as well as Democrats began to expand their Medicaid programs. “What people began to accept, including Republicans, was that the assumption that you could afford health insurance if you were an   adult was not true,” said Colleen M. Grogan, a professor at the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago, who has written extensively on health care. “You could be working and still not afford health insurance. ” In 1996, Mr. Clinton expanded Medicaid to cover more working families as part of his welfare overhaul. Campaigning for   that year, he depicted Medicaid as a   program, telling audiences it was helping their grandparents. “He is the first Democrat to start calling Medicaid one of ‘our programs,’” said Professor Morone of Brown. “There was a sense that Medicaid had sort of grown up as an entitlement. ” The expansion of Medicaid in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, passed with Republican sponsorship in 1997, set the stage for the sweeping expansions of the Affordable Care Act 13 years later. But politics during Mr. Obama’s presidency had become highly polarized. While earlier expansions of Medicaid had sometimes been bipartisan, the A. C. A. passed without a single Republican vote in Congress. The Tea Party had risen in opposition to the legislation, and later helped elect many of those who now form the conservative Freedom Caucus. Gradually, though,   states have adopted the expansion. And now that the law known as Obamacare has survived the effort to repeal it, more states may choose to expand Medicaid. In Maine, voters will decide this fall whether to do so, and in Kansas, the Legislature has all but approved an expansion, although Gov. Sam Brownback could veto it. Last week, despite their desire to repeal Mr. Obama’s biggest domestic legacy, some Republicans recognized that any bill that would lead to such drastic cuts in Medicaid would simply hurt too many of their constituents. In Ashland, Va. Medicaid made it possible for Kim Goodloe and her husband, Tom, to start a small company making metal parts for semiconductors and medical devices after the birth of twin boys with tuberous sclerosis 27 years ago. The genetic disorder causes tumors in vital organs, leading to frequent seizures, and Mrs. Goodloe had quit her job to take care of the boys when they were 4  —   Medicaid did not cover services for them back then. But now, Medicaid provides a home aide for Matthew, who is incontinent and nonverbal, suffers daily seizures and needs help walking. For the other twin, Christopher, who is less severely developmentally disabled, Medicaid provided a job coach, helping him to work at their company and earn enough money that he now pays taxes. The Goodloes have private insurance, but it is not required to pay for the twins’ services, she said. With Virginia facing such steep cuts to its federal Medicaid payments, Mrs. Goodloe worried about losing the home health aide. They would have had to downsize the business, which employs 30 people. “Even within my own family, when you say ‘Medicaid’ it comes with some, ‘Those people don’t want to work.’ They believe there’s a lot of fraud, there’s people that don’t deserve it. ” “But then,” she said, “They’ll say, ‘How could they take it away from Matthew? ’”",0

[Schwarzenegger made the endorsement in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:  “He should run in 2020, yes,” Schwarzenegger said in an interview with The Times when asked whether Kasich, whom he supported over Trump in the 2016 presidential race, should launch another presidential campaign. “Kasich is an extraordinary guy. He’s a man of substance. He’s worked in Washington, he’s worked in local government, he’s worked in statewide government. He has the experience. He can see things. He has vision,” Schwarzenegger enthused. “He’s also a moderate. He’s a tough Republican and very fiscally conservative, but he also at the same time loves helping people. ” Schwarzenegger backed Kasich in 2016, to little effect. In the Republican primary, the Ohio governor only carried his home state. Arguably, Kasich made Trump’s primary win easier by staying in the race so long that it became impossible for any Trump challenger  —   specifically, Sen. Ted Cruz ( )  —   to round up the necessary delegates and campaign cash. During the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Kasich refused to show up, angering his own state’s delegation. Despite Kasich’s opposition, Trump carried the crucial Buckeye State by nearly 9 percentage points, taking all 18 Electoral College votes en route to victory. Trump and Schwarzenegger have carried on a war in social media, trading barbs over political issues and particularly over the ratings of The Apprentice, where Schwarzenegger filled in for Trump but later withdrew from the show.

17821,Former Rockette: Inauguration Performance Will ’Unite’ America,"A retired member of the   Rockettes dance troupe is encouraging its members to set aside their political differences and proudly perform at the inauguration of   Donald Trump. [“The only thing the Rockettes should be focused on is performing for our nation and helping unite us all with the joy, love, beauty and strength for which they are famous,” says Patty DeCarlo Grantham, a veteran member of the renowned troupe.  Grantham, who’s president of the   Rockette Alumnae Association, says she was appalled by backlash and calls encouraging Rockettes to boycott the inaugural event. “To perform for someone that represents everything that we, as women, have ever had to overcome is contrary to everything we know to be right and true,” former Rockette Autumn Withers wrote last week, The Wrap reported. “On a national level, the optics of this alone normalize the atrocious remarks Mr. Trump has openly made towards women,” Withers continued. “The idea that if you simply ask their bosses or perhaps pay their bosses enough money, a line of beautiful women will oblige anyone in any way is exploitation. ” Grantham, responding to Withers, wrote to the Madison Square Garden Co. which owns Radio City Music Hall. “We are all aware how contentious this election has been for our country,” Grantham wrote, assuring MSG owner James Dolan “that in no way does Ms. Withers’ opinions reflect the opinion of the Rockette Alumnae Association. ” Madison Square Garden Company released a statement last week confirming that the   dancers are not obligated to perform and that each Rockette “must voluntarily sign up. ” . @MSG says ”it is always their choice” in new statement on #Rockettes performing at Trump inauguration https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Jackie Strause (@jackiedstrause) December 23, 2016,  “Like the millions of people who are true Rockette fans, we cannot wait to see the Rockettes proudly ‘strut their stuff’ for the upcoming inauguration of the President of the United States of America,” wrote Grantham, who performed as a Rockette from 1959 through 1970. The Rockettes last performed at President George W. Bush’s presidential inauguration in 2005.

17822,Australian Candidates Woo Allies as Election Deadlock Continues - The New York Times,"SYDNEY, Australia  —   The two men seeking to emerge as Australia’s prime minister after national elections on Saturday, Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten, have begun a delicate courtship of a handful of lawmakers who are likely to hold the balance of power in the next Parliament. Officials will resume counting votes on Tuesday for about a dozen seats that are too close to call. The Liberal Party, now governing in a coalition with the National Party, said postal and   ballots that were yet to be counted would be crucial to its securing a   majority in the   House of Representatives. As of Monday, neither the Liberal National coalition, led by Mr. Turnbull, nor the Labor Party, led by Mr. Shorten, had won enough seats to form a government outright. Vote counting stopped in the early hours of Sunday with the governing coalition at 67 seats and the Labor Party at 71, the Electoral Commission said. If neither side can form a clear majority government, the party that secures the support of enough   lawmakers to control at least 76 seats can form a government. “Australian voters are changing,” said Bob Katter, an independent member whose electorate covers about 193, 000 square miles of central Queensland, an area double the size of Britain. “In the past, I could run around and kiss babies and mouth party platitudes and expect to get ” Mr. Katter said in a telephone interview on Monday. But that was when he was a member of the National Party, he said, adding that now, candidates must be much more responsive to the needs of their constituents. Mr. Katter, the leader of Katter’s Australian Party, easily won his rural seat. The lawmakers viewed as crucial to the next government  —   five independents, including Mr. Katter, and one from the Greens  —   have not met to discuss forming a voting bloc, and they are from diverse electorates. Mr. Katter, who once ran a   cattle ranch, said he had had “  talks” with both leaders but had not reached an agreement with either. Wooing the swing lawmakers is likely to be troublesome. “They are very different candidates,” said Jill Sheppard, a political scientist at the Australian National University. “Their electorates are spread out and have very different needs. ” Australia has been here before. In 2010, the Labor Party, then led by Julia Gillard, signed agreements with independents and the Greens to secure the seats it needed to form a government. Three of those lawmakers agreed to vote in a bloc if there was a stalemate over legislation. But Andrew Wilkie, an independent and a former intelligence officer who entered Parliament in 2010, tore up his contract with Ms. Gillard two years later when she backed out of a deal with him to introduce restrictions on poker machines. Mr. Wilkie, who is from Tasmania, the most southern state in Australia, described that dispute and his time working with the Labor Party as so traumatic that he said he would not sign on with either side in this election. Mr. Turnbull telephoned Mr. Wilkie on Sunday. “It was as much ensuring that the channels of communications are open,” Mr. Wilkie told ABC television. “I went to this election with a position that I would not enter into any formal agreement with any party to allow them to form a government, and nothing has changed. ” Another independent, Cathy McGowan, a former teacher and farmer from rural northeastern Victoria, said much the same. “I am proudly independent, and I won’t be making any deals,” she said in a statement issued on Monday. Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Shorten had both called her to congratulate her on her victory, she said. Adam Bandt, the Greens candidate, who will occupy the House seat representing the inner city of Melbourne, said he would support a Labor government but would not sign onto a coalition to help it secure the right to govern. The Greens did agree to help Ms. Gillard form a government in 2010. In return, the party asked for almost $10 billion in clean energy investments, a tax on carbon consumption and free dental care for children of families with low incomes. Prime Minister Tony Abbott ended the carbon tax in 2014. The team of Senator Nick Xenophon from South Australia, which appeared to have won one lower house seat and has said a second may fall its way after a recount, said it would negotiate with either party to form a majority government. South Australia, sometimes described as Australia’s Rust Belt state, appears likely to lose its major steel manufacturer and automobile industry. The loss of the steel plant alone could cost 6, 000 jobs, in a state that has a population of about 1. 6 million. In the prelude to the election, Mr. Turnbull announced that South Australia would receive a share of a $37. 5 billion contract to help a French company build Australia’s new fleet of submarines. The terms of an alliance between the Xenophon team and either major party have not been broached. “It is about achieving the best outcomes for the electorates, and the state of South Australia, but also outcomes that are in the national interest,” said Stirling Griff of Adelaide, who will enter the Senate for the first time as a Xenophon team member. Further complicating matters, Mr. Shorten has called on Mr. Turnbull to quit. Some analysts say Australia could be without an effective government for more than a week. Having to negotiate with independent lawmakers over legislation “will be chaotic,” Mr. Katter said. “But it is also what we call democracy here. ”",0
17823,Un conflit militaire entre la Russie et les Etats-Unis est-il possible ?,"Opinion Un Su-25 à la base aérienne russe de Hmeimim, Syrie. Crédit : AP 
La crise syrienne est bien plus dangereuse que les crises de la guerre froide, y compris que la célèbre crise des missiles de Cuba de 1962. Aujourd’hui, le potentiel de conflit dans les relations entre la Russie et les Etats-Unis est plus élevé que ce n’était le cas dans les années 1960. Rivalité systémique Une armée commune européenne pour éviter la désintégration de l’UE? Ce n’est pas un hasard si le politologue américain John Lewis Gaddis a qualifié la guerre froide de « longue période de paix » . Au premier abord, la période qui s’étend entre le milieu des années 1950 et le milieu des années 1980 était une époque de confrontation dure entre deux superpuissances aux idéologies irréconciliables.
En réalité, la confrontation entre l’URSS et les Etats-Unis suivait des règles strictes et ne s’est jamais approchée (malgré la rhétorique virulente) de la confrontation armée directe. 
La possession d’armes nucléaires par l’URSS et les Etats-Unis n’était pas la cause principale de cette longue paix. Les dirigeants des superpuissances n’avaient aucune raison politique de lancer un affrontement direct. Les Etats-Unis et l’Union soviétique n’avaient pas de concurrents dans leur rôle de leaders des mondes capitaliste et socialiste. Lire aussi : Convoi de l’Onu bombardé en Syrie : la coopération russo-américaine se fissure 
L’absence de motifs politiques était complétée par le manque de capacités techniques à mener une guerre directe. Situés dans deux hémisphères différents, l’URSS et les Etats-Unis ne pouvaient pas occuper leur territoire mutuel. Aucune partie ne disposait de la supériorité suffisante pour garantir la défaite de l’adversaire et remporter la victoire dans un conflit régional majeur. 
L’idéologie soviétique, tout comme l’idéologie américaine, étaient intransigeantes devant l’adversaire. Les deux superpuissances affirmaient le principe de compétition entre le communisme et le libéralisme. L’Otan trouverait-elle la Russie plus dangereuse que Daech? Premièrement, cela signifiait que l’ URSS et les Etats-Unis se considéraient mutuellement comme deux entités égales. Deuxièmement, les deux parties étaient prêtes à suivre des règles. Troisièmement, une compétition suppose que l’adversaire dispose d’aspects positifs qui doivent être adaptés ou surpassés.
A la moindre escalade, les dirigeants soviétiques et américains s’empressaient de lancer des négociations et de discuter des conditions d’un compromis. Rivalité non-systémique 
Après le démantèlement de l’Union soviétique en 1991, la donne a changé. La Russie et les Etats-Unis ont commencéà accumuler des motifs d’un conflit militaire. Les deux puissances nucléaires aux capacités comparables ont dû construire leurs relations dans le cadre d’un même ordre global mondial. 
Les contradictions idéologiques réelles se sont justement fait sentir après 1993. Dès la fin de 1994, la Russie refusait officiellement à reconnaître les concepts américains de leadership et d’extension de la démocratie. Lire aussi : Le bouclier US en Europe serait-il dirigé contre la Russie et la Chine ? 
En 1997, la Russie avec la Chine ont avancé l’idée d’un monde multipolaire. Cette idée a eu bien du mal à passer à Washington, qui prétendait au rôle de leader de l’ordre mondial en gestation. Il ne s’agissait plus de la coexistence de deux camps, mais de deux façons de construire un monde globalisé. 
Toutes les administrations américaines étaient particulièrement irritées par deux facteurs. Le premier : le potentiel militaire conservé par Moscou. Le deuxième : la conservation par la Russie de son statut de membre permanent du Conseil de sécurité de l’ Onu , qui lui permet de bloquer les décisions de Washington ou de les rendre illégitimes. Syrie : la guerre des résolutions En dépit de la déclaration sur le « partenariat stratégique » , l’objectif de la politique américaine se réduisait à diminuer rapidement (et, idéalement, à liquider) le potentiel stratégique russe pour le ramener à un niveau suffisamment sûr pour les Etats-Unis. 
Les élites russes , de leur côté, comprenaient parfaitement les raisons qui motivaient les actions des Etats-Unis. Moscou était particulièrement inquiet quant à la réforme du droit international entreprise par Washington. 
À travers un enchaînement de précédents, la diplomatie américaine affirmait deux principes. Le premier : l’éviction forcée des dirigeants des États souverains (avec leur condamnation successive par un tribunal international). Le deuxième : le désarmement forcé des régimes dangereux (du point de vue de Washington) et, en premier lieu, la privation de ces régimes de leur potentiel militaire de destruction massive. Lire aussi : La Russie prête à abattre des avions américains en cas de frappe en Syrie 
La guerre en Irak et les crises postérieures autour des programmes nucléaires de l’Iran, de la Corée du Nord et du Pakistan étaient perçues par Moscou comme le rodage d’un scénario de visant à confisquer des ADM à un pays à problème (du point de vue de Washington). Les dirigeants russes soupçonnaient que l’objectif ultime des Etats-Unis était d’utiliser ces approches à l’intention de la Russie. 
Les nouvelles formes de coopération ont donné naissance à un nouveau type de conflits militaro-politiques. Après 1991, les Etats-Unis ont utilisé la force contre les pays qu’ils désignaient comme « Etats-voyous » , peaufinant ainsi leur modèle de guerre punitive contre des régimes donnés. Washington rompt le dialogue avec Moscou sur la Syrie : et après? Les dirigeants russes ne pouvaient que soupçonner que la Fédération de Russie était l’objectif final de ces actions. Moscou, quant à lui, s’adonnait régulièrement à des démonstrations de force pour contraindre Washington à chercher un compromis.
Un système de confrontation indirecte, mais rude, s’est installé entre la Russie et les Etats-Unis. Les crises en Yougoslavie, Tchétchénie, Géorgie et en Ukraine en sont des exemples. 
À ces causes s’ajoute les progrès dans l’ armement . La création d’unités aéroportées autonomes, de systèmes de défense antiaérienne et antimissile, d’armes de précision, etc. rendent le scénario d’un conflit régional entre la Russie et les Etats-Unis plus réaliste du point de vue technique. On ne peut exclure l’éventualité que, dans les 10–15 prochaines années, la tentation d’y recourir grandisse pour les élites de ces deux puissances.

La forme future des conflits avec la Russie et la Chine est esquissée, pour la première fois, dans La stratégie militaire nationale des Etats-Unis en 1995. 
Pour les experts américains, ces chocs pourraient prendre la forme d’une intervention de Washington dans un conflit entre Moscou ou Pékin avec l’un de leurs voisins – une sorte de Tempête du désert régionale dans un théâtre d’opérations limité. Bombes et diplomatie : un an d'opération russe en Syrie Sans compter qu’au cours des vingt dernières années, la Russie et la Chine ont accru leur capacité de défense et mis fin à la supériorité américaine dans les armes de précision. Les conflits en Géorgie, en Ukraine et en Syrie doivent être vus comme des tests, une « épreuve de force » pour un affrontement éventuel entre la Russie et les Etats-Unis.
Il est difficile de présager comment se terminerait un tel conflit s’il devait, hélas, se produire, mais on peut être certains qu’il mettra fin à l’ordre mondial établi, avec son système financier global et ses processus de mondialisation, ordre au sein du quel l’Onu joue un rôle central. 
Sans doute, le monde reviendra alors à un modèle d’Etats-nations fermés et hostiles sans normes de droit international et à l’idéologie du culte de la force militaire. Après un affrontement hypothétique entre la Russie et les Etats-Unis, le monde rappellera plutôt le système de Versailles-Washington en vigueur de 1919 à 1938.

17824,Snap Is Said to Have Worked on a Drone - The New York Times,"Snap has long been known as the maker of Snapchat, an app that sends disappearing messages, photographs and videos. But over the past few years, the company has repositioned itself as a   camera company. One of the products that Snap has worked on to bolster that direction is a drone, according to three people briefed on the project who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential. A drone could help Snap’s users take overhead videos and photographs, and then feed that visual data to the company. It is unclear when or if Snap’s drone would become available to consumers. Like many technology companies, Snap often works on experiments, many of which are killed or repurposed into other projects. A Snap spokeswoman declined to comment. The work on a drone builds on Snap’s unveiling last year of Spectacles, sunglasses that record short video clips. The company also changed its name  to Snap from Snapchat to reflect that it intended to branch out into myriad products. The drone gives a glimpse into what kind of future products Snap may be considering, which would affect the company’s growth. How the company plans to grow is on the minds of investors as Snap goes public this week. Snap priced its initial public offering on Wednesday and the stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, in what is set to be the biggest technology I. P. O. since the Chinese   company Alibaba in 2014. Snap set its I. P. O. pricing at $17 a share  —   higher than the expected range of $14 to $16  —   valuing the company at $24 billion. Getting more visual data such as photographs and video is important to Snap because it helps bolster people’s interactions with Snapchat. Communicating on Snapchat is a highly visual process, intended to create an intense engagement among people with the app. Snap said in its public offering prospectus that the average Snapchat user opened the app more than 18 times a day, and that more than 2. 5 billion messages and images were sent each day with the app. Evan Spiegel, Snap’s chief executive, has been vocal about his company’s ambitions around cameras. In a video for investors about Snap’s public offering this month, Mr. Spiegel said cameras augmented the way a person communicates, rather than a person’s memory. “We’re at the beginning of what cameras can do,” Mr. Spiegel told viewers of the video. When Spectacles appeared, Snap faced questions from critics about why it would enter the realm of hardware products. The product is designed to make taking videos a fun and seamless part of everyday life, which dovetails with the company’s goal of getting users to feed Snapchat a steady stream of images and videos. “We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way that people live and communicate,” Snap said in its public offering prospectus. “Our products empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. ”",0
17825,"Trump: ’We Are Fighting’ ’Fake News’ - ’They Shouldn’t Be Allowed To Use’ Anonymous Sources, CNN ’Clinton News Network’ - Breitbart","During his speech at CPAC on Friday, President Trump dubbed CNN the “Clinton News Network,” and said, “we are fighting the fake news. ” And that he’s “against the people that make up stories, and make up sources. They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. ”  Trump reacted to some of the applause during his speech by saying, that the “dishonest media” would say he didn’t get a standing ovation because “everybody stood and nobody sat. So, they will say, ‘He never got a standing ovation.’ They are the worst. ” He later added, “I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It’s fake, phony, fake. A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are. They are the enemy of the people, because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed, there are no nine people, I don’t believe there was one or two people, nine people.   …     They make up sources. They’re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people, the fake news. They dropped off the word ‘fake,’ and all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy. ” Trump further stated that he wasn’t against the media and didn’t mind negative stories if he “deserved” them. He added, “I’m against the people that make up stories, and make up sources. They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. ” After saying that there were good reporters out there, Trump concluded by referencing the “Clinton News Network” and saying, “I mean, it’s a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories, they say that we can’t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment.   …     I love the First Amendment, nobody know  —   loves it better than me, nobody. I mean, who uses it more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us, it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right, and me the right to criticize fake news, and criticize it strongly. And many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and it’s not your agenda, and it’s not the country’s agenda. It’s their own agenda. they have a professional obligation, as members of the press, to report honestly, but, as you saw, throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn’t tell the truth. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
17826,VIDEO: Watch Newt Gingrich UNLOAD on Megyn Kelly Over Trump,"Pinterest 
Newt Gingrich has accused Fox News’ Megyn Kelly of being “fascinated” by sex, and not caring at all about public policy in a shocking and startling interview. 
The former Speaker of the House said Kelly showed “bias” for mentioning the groping allegations against Donald Trump. 
Kelly responded by saying her fascination is not of “sex,” but of who was going to end up in the White House. Kelly has a history with Trump – getting into a shouting match with the Republican candidate over comments he made about women during a primary debate. 
What set Gingrich off was Kelly’s mention of the leaked “sex boasts” tapes, where Trump is heard to say he grabs women by the genitals. 
Gingrich attacked, saying the media was obsessed with spending time on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied. “You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy,” he said. 
“I’m not fascinated by sex, but I’m fascinated about sexual predators,” Kelly said. 
The bias the media has against Trump – especially focusing on sex – is historic. 
“This is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia, ” Gingrich said.

17827,Artificial Intelligence Swarms Silicon Valley on Wings and Wheels - The New York Times,"SUNNYVALE, Calif.  —   For more than a decade, Silicon Valley’s technology investors and entrepreneurs obsessed over social media and mobile apps that helped people do things like find new friends, fetch a ride home or crowdsource a review of a product or a movie. Now Silicon Valley has found its next shiny new thing. And it does not have a “Like” button. The new era in Silicon Valley centers on artificial intelligence and robots, a transformation that many believe will have a payoff on the scale of the personal computing industry or the commercial internet, two previous generations that spread computing globally. Computers have begun to speak, listen and see, as well as sprout legs, wings and wheels to move unfettered in the world. The shift was evident in a Lowe’s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries. The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock. Silicon Valley’s financiers and entrepreneurs are digging into artificial intelligence with remarkable exuberance. The region now has at least 19 companies designing   cars and trucks, up from a handful five years ago. There are also more than a   types of mobile robots, including robotic bellhops and aerial drones, being commercialized. “We saw a slow trickle in investments in robotics, and suddenly, boom  —   there seem to be a dozen companies securing large investment rounds focusing on specific robotic niches,” said Martin Hitch, chief executive of Bossa Nova, which has a base in San Francisco. Funding in A. I.   has increased more than fourfold to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to the market research firm CB Insights. The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1. 2 billion this year, up 76 percent from last year. “Whenever there is a new idea, the valley swarms it,” said   Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chip maker that was founded to make graphic processors for the video game business but that has turned decisively toward artificial intelligence applications in the last year. “But you have to wait for a good idea, and good ideas don’t happen every day. ” By contrast, funding for social media   peaked in 2011 before plunging. That year, venture capital firms made 66 social media deals and pumped in $2. 4 billion. So far this year, there have been just 10 social media investments, totaling $6. 9 million, according to CB Insights. Last month, the professional social networking site LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26. 2 billion, underscoring that social media has become a mature market sector. Even Silicon Valley’s biggest social media companies are now getting into artificial intelligence, as are other tech behemoths. Facebook is using A. I. to improve its products. Google will soon compete with Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri, which are based on A. I. with a device that listens in the home, answers questions and places   orders. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, recently appeared at the Aspen Ideas Conference and called for a partnership between humans and artificial intelligence systems in which machines are designed to augment humans. The auto industry has also set up camp in the valley to learn how to make cars that can do the driving for you. Both technology and car companies are making claims that increasingly powerful sensors and A. I. software will enable cars to drive themselves with the push of a button as soon as the end of this decade  —   despite recent Tesla crashes that have raised the question of how quickly human drivers will be completely replaced by the technology. Silicon Valley’s new A. I. era underscores the region’s ability to opportunistically reinvent itself and quickly follow the latest tech trend. “This is at the heart of the region’s culture that goes all the way back to the Gold Rush,” said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology forecaster and a faculty member at Singularity University. “The valley is built on the idea that there is always a way to start over and find a new beginning. ” The change spurred a rush for talent in A. I. that has become intense. “It’s ridiculous,” said Richard Socher, chief scientist at the software maker Salesforce, who teaches a course at Stanford on a machine intelligence technique known as deep learning. “The number of people trying to get the students to drop out of the class halfway through because now they know a little bit of this stuff is crazy. ” The valley’s tendency toward reinvention dates back to the region’s initial emergence from the ashes of a deep aerospace industry recession as a   manufacturing center producing memory chips, video games and digital watches in the  . A malaise in the personal computing market in the early 1990s was followed by the World Wide Web and the global expansion of the consumer internet. A decade later, in 2007, just as innovation in mobile phones seemed to be on the verge of moving away from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia, Apple introduced the first iPhone, resetting the mobile communications marketplace and ensuring that the valley would  —   for at least another generation  —   remain the world’s innovation center. In the most recent shift, the A. I. idea emerged first in Canada in the work of cognitive scientists and computer scientists like Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun during the previous decade. The three helped pioneer a new approach to deep learning, a machine learning method that is highly effective for pattern recognition challenges like vision and speech. Modeled on a general understanding of how the human brain works, it has helped technologists make rapid progress in a wide range of A. I. fields. How far the A. I. boom will go is hotly debated. For some technologists, today’s technical advances are laying the groundwork for truly brilliant machines that will soon have   intelligence. Yet Silicon Valley has faced false starts with A. I. before. During the 1980s, an earlier generation of entrepreneurs also believed that artificial intelligence was the wave of the future, leading to a flurry of  . Their products offered little business value at the time, and so the commercial enthusiasm ended in disappointment, leading to a period now referred to as the “A. I. Winter. ” The current resurgence will not fall short this time, said several investors, who believe that the economic potential in terms of new efficiency and new applications is strong. “There is no chance of a new winter,” said Shivon Zilis, an investor at Bloomberg Beta who specializes in machine intelligence  . John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif. said deep learning has made a difference to the potential success of A. I. companies. “You get a new set of tools that let you attack a new set of problems, which let you push the boundary out,” he said. For others, like Jerry Kaplan, who helped found two A. I. companies in the 1980s  —   Symantec, which became a security company, and Teknowledge, which ultimately shut down  —   the Valley’s new enthusiasm is troubling because it suggests an unfounded optimism similar to earlier eras in which the field overpromised and underdelivered. “Sometimes when I hang around with A. I. enthusiasts here in the valley, I feel like an atheist at a convention of evangelicals,” he said.",0
17828,International Criminal Court Demands Immediate Arrest of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi - Breitbart,"Moammar Qaddafi’s son Saif   recently released from half a decade of captivity by a Libyan militia group, has hit a major stumbling block in his bid to become a unifying figure for   Libya: the International Criminal Court wants him arrested and hauled before a war crimes trial in the Hague. [This is not an entirely surprising development because the ICC has made it clear all along that it considers Qaddafi’s case very much open. It was not clear until now just how aggressively the court would pursue him, but it was made very clear indeed in a statement on Wednesday from chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.  Bensouda declared that the 2011 arrest warrant against Saif “remains valid, and Libya is obliged to immediately arrest and surrender Mr. Qaddafi. ” She called upon any other state that has an opportunity to arrest Qaddafi to do so if he leaves Libya.  “Helping a fugitive to escape justice must not be tolerated, and Mr. Gaddafi must be surrendered to the custody of the Court,” Bensouda declared. She added this directive supersedes “any purported amnesty law in Libya. ” One of Libya’s several governments declared an amnesty throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Another Libyan government sentenced Qaddafi to death in absentia in 2015 and has given no indication of rescinding its judgment. Human Rights Watch (HRW) applauded the ICC’s demand to bring Saif   to justice, citing a U. N. Security Council resolution requiring Libyan authorities to cooperate with the ICC, while also accusing his former captors of   abuses for their treatment of him. “The reported release of Gaddafi based on a flawed amnesty law does not change the fact that he is wanted by the ICC for crimes against humanity. The Zintan brigade, which alleges that it released him, should urgently disclose his current whereabouts,” said HRW International Justice Director Richard Dicker. However, Human Rights Watch also noted that the Zintan brigade held Qaddafi incommunicado, subjected him to solitary confinement, denied him access to legal counsel, illegally interrogated him, and held him long after the Libyan government the brigade nominally answers to ordered his release.  Also, HRW noted that the Libyan court which sentenced Qaddafi to death did not meet international fair trial standards and cited the wording of the Libyan amnesty law to point out that it does not cover the   offenses Qaddafi stands accused of, concluding that only the International Criminal Court can handle the case. In fact, Human Rights Watch wants the ICC to take over more investigations and prosecutions of Libyans on all sides of its   conflict for human rights violations, including the abuse of migrants.",0

As Twitchy reported, James O’Keefe on Tuesday teased a new Project Veritas video that would ensure Americans United for Change director Brad Woodhouse a “busy busy day.” 
That video premiered on Fox News’“The O’Reilly Factor” Wednesday night. Remarkably, Scott Foval, fired from Americans United for Change after previous Project Veritas video releases, had even more secrets to offer up — and this one was big. . @oreillyfactor breaks new video showing @woodhouseb / Scott Foval was responsible for @DavidCornDC video, not ""bartender"" pic.twitter.com/IxpfHdqpB6

In Wednesday’s video release, Foval explains that the bartender who caught Romney’s devastating “47 percent” remarks on video during a fundraiser was part of a coordinated operation to sneak a video recording device into the event. That video eventually was passed along to David Corn of Mother Jones, who won a George Polk Award for his efforts.

The story at the time, of course, was that bartender Scott Prouty brought a camera along in hopes of perhaps getting a photo with Romney — which somehow involved setting down the camera and hitting the record button.

17830,"Aleppo, Mosul and “war crimes”","PAUL VAN AUKEN, WSWS.ORG 28 October 2016 T he United Nations Security Council was the scene Wednesday of a bitter exchange over the ongoing war in Syria, with the Western powers indicting Russia for war crimes over its operations in the northern city of Aleppo. The UN aid chief and former Tory member of the British parliament Stephen O’Brien set the tone by declaring himself “incandescent with rage” over the inability of the Security Council to take action. “Aleppo has essentially become a kill zone,” he said. The fact that both Russian and Syrian warplanes have halted their strikes against the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militias that control eastern Aleppo for the past 10 days was brushed aside by Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the United Nations, who represents the living embodiment of imperialist “human rights” hypocrisy. Clueless Americans’ tax dollars at work: Samantha Power doing her Neocon best to stir up further trouble for humanity. Taunting Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin, she declared. “You don’t get congratulations and credit for not committing war crimes for a day or a week.” Continuing her tirade, Power asked, “Does Russia believe that all of the children in eastern Aleppo are Al Qaeda members?” Such outrage over the fate of civilians and children is highly selective. None of the representatives of US imperialism and its allies evinced even a spark of rage over the killing of men, women and children in government-controlled western Aleppo, which is regularly bombarded by mortars and rockets provided to the Al Qaeda “rebels” by the Pentagon and the CIA. On Thursday, rocket fire claimed the lives of six children in the west of the city, where the vast majority of the population lives. Three Syrian children died at their school, where 14 other students were wounded. In a separate attack, three young brothers died when a rocket struck their home. Nor for that matter, as far as the human rights imperialists are concerned, can the slaughter of civilians in US air strikes elsewhere in Syria be compared in any way to the deaths caused by Russian bombs in Aleppo. Amnesty International issued a report Tuesday on 11 separate strikes by the US-led “coalition” in which it said some 300 civilians were killed. The Pentagon has acknowledged only one death in these bombing raids. Other monitoring groups have put the civilian death toll inflicted by the US air war in Syria at well over 1,000. All told, the Pentagon admits to killing only 55 civilians in two years. Power’s jibe that the Russians view every child in Aleppo as a member of Al Qaeda applies with equal force to the Pentagon, whose bombs apparently kill only members of ISIS. Power is herself a veteran practitioner of this kind of grotesque double standard. This crusader for human rights took the effective position that “every child in Gaza was a member of Hamas” during the 51-day Israeli siege of 2013 that killed over 2,100 Palestinians and wounded another 11,000. During this one-sided slaughter, the US ambassador used her post at the UN to relentlessly proclaim Israel’s right to “defend” itself. Waving the filthy imperialist human rights banner, she was also one of the leading proponents of the US-NATO war in Libya that killed tens of thousands and left the country in ruins, as well as the war for regime change in Syria, which has killed over 300,000 and driven millions from their homes. T he hypocrisy and double standard of the war crimes denunciations against Russia over Aleppo emerges most starkly in relation to the launching earlier this month of a US-led siege of the Iraqi city of Mosul, just over 300 miles to the east, which was overrun by ISIS in 2014. While the Russians are indicted for turning Aleppo into a “kill zone,” the Western media routinely refers to the American onslaught as the “liberation” of Mosul. To that end, US warplanes, rocket launchers and heavy artillery are relentlessly pounding the city of over a million, which analysts acknowledge will be reduced to rubble. The head of the US military’s Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, boasted in an interview with AFP that his forces had killed “800 to 900 Islamic State fighters.” He said not a word as to how many civilians had died under the US bombardment; nor has the US corporate media shown any interest in that subject. When one horrific incident did come to light—the bombing of a Shia mosque near Kirkuk last Friday in which 17 women and children lost their lives and scores were wounded—the Pentagon brushed it aside and the media largely ignored it. Even as US officials, parroted by the press, indict ISIS for using Mosul’s population as “human shields”—a timeworn alibi for the slaughter of civilians—they ignore and tacitly support Al Qaeda’s use of terror and violence to prevent civilians from fleeing from the besieged neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo. While the actions carried out by the Russian military against the civilians trapped in eastern Aleppo are no doubt reprehensible, they are not the real concern of those screaming about war crimes. Their fear is that the Al Qaeda-linked militias that serve as the principal proxy force in the war for regime change are facing a final rout. Power trying to dragoon the UN Russian delegate, V. Churkin. Encouraged and rewarded by their hypocritical masters, the empire’s goons know no limits to their audacious indecency. More fundamentally, the crimes of Russia[—such as they are, and that, in itself needs careful contextual examination— Editors] in Aleppo pale in comparison to those carried out by Washington in the region, and for that matter, around the globe. Have those who feign shock and rage over the Russian bombs dropped on Syria forgotten “shock and awe?” The US invasion and occupation of Iraq took an estimated 1 million Iraqi lives. Are these champions of human rights unaware of the ongoing slaughter in Yemen, where over 10,000 people have died under Saudi airstrikes carried out with US supplied bombs and missiles and made possible by extensive intelligence and logistical aid from the Pentagon? Why is there no rage over a war by the ruling monarchy of the Middle East’s wealthiest nation against the region’s poorest, in which the systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure and a blockade imposed with the aid of US forces is threatening the population with starvation? When it comes to war crimes, the Kremlin oligarchy represented by Vladimir Putin is in the minor leagues. Since the end of World War II, and the US atomic bombs that killed some 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, virtually every US president has engaged in wars of military aggression that entailed war crimes, many of them on a scale surpassed only by the atrocities carried out by Hitler’s Third Reich. The Korean War resulted in 3 million civilian deaths; in Vietnam, the US killed some 3 to 4 million civilians. Afghanistan’s tragic and protracted encounter with US imperialism, dating back to the CIA-orchestrated war of regime change of the 1980s, claimed the lives of between 1.5 and 2 million more. Meanwhile, Washington remains at war in at least seven different countries, where civilian deaths continue to mount daily: Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. The source of the feigned rage and tears over Aleppo is the fact that the US war for regime change in Syria has turned into a debacle. Moscow launched its intervention in defense of the interests of Russia’s ruling capitalist oligarchy, not those of the Syrian masses. Nonetheless, it has presented an obstacle to the US drive to assert its hegemony over the entire oil-rich region of the Middle East. The unrelenting “human rights” propaganda and demonization of Russia over Aleppo stands as a warning. US imperialism is preparing a major escalation, not only of the US intervention in Syria, but of its confrontation with Russia itself, carrying with it the real and present danger of a nuclear war. —Bill Van Auken",0

(ALI RASH/ERBIL, IRAQ) Iraqi special forces recaptured six districts of eastern Mosul on Friday, a military statement said, expanding the army's foothold in the Islamic State stronghold a day after its leader told his jihadist followers there could be no retreat. 
An officer in the elite Counter Terrorism Service said CTS troops launched a major operation against the militants, who are now almost surrounded in their last major urban redoubt in Iraq. 
CTS special forces took over the neighborhoods of Malayeen, Samah, Khadra, Karkukli, Quds and Karama, the statement said, inflicting heavy losses on the militant fighters and raising the Iraqi flag over buildings. 
One special forces officer told Reuters the CTS units may try to push all the way to the Tigris river, which runs through the center of Mosul. 
Iraqi television footage from the east of the city showed grey smoke rising, and a Reuters reporter in the village of Ali Rash, 7 km (4 miles) to the south east, heard helicopter gunships and cannon fire. Volleys of automatic rifle fire, possibly from the militants, were also audible.

17832,Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive – An Interview with Edward S. Herman,"2016 presidential campaign by Ann Garrison 
The just-concluded election revealed as much about the corporate media, which has broken every rule of journalism to support Hillary Clinton, and the fraudulence of much of the American Left, which turns out to have no real problem with war or capitalism, than it did about the candidates, themselves. Edward Herman is an exception, a genuine man of the Left. He says “a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia.” Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive – An Interview with Edward S. Herman by Ann Garrison 
“ The election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory.” 
Ann Garrison: Earlier this year, you told me that you differ with Noam Chomsky, your co-author of Manufacturing Consent and other books, in that you plan to vote for the Green Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Are you still planning to do so? 
Edward S. Herman: Yes. 
AG: Can you explain why? 
ESH: Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival. Hillary Clinton is a neo-liberal and pre-eminent war-monger. I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today, given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president. She represents the corporate elite and military-industrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a follow-on to Bush and Obama. She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent. 
Trump is a self-promoting windbag, racist and dangerous, unpredictable phony. We have a ghastly choice in these two. Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity, more so than not voting. On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump, one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu (and hence for escalated violence in Palestine). 
AG: Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's e-mail has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers - not rogue elements - fund ISIS, and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation. Throughout the last George Bush's presidency, there were innumerable headlines that ""Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford, Texas ranch."" What are your thoughts on that? 
ESH: Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state. Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president. The Clinton Foundation's receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage, but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump, helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, Bill Clinton. 
AG: What do you think of Clinton's statement that she would make removing Bashar Al-Assad her top priority? And Trump's statement that he would not, because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia? 
ESH: Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well. Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about ""regime change"" in Russia (cite). This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media, but the existing media are part of the war system, hence Hillary Clinton's commitment to wars is essentially suppressed. Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner, but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms, use of nuclear weapons, etc. But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her war-mongering. This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump. 
AG: Jill Stein has said that ""wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance"" and that she would cut the military budget by half, close most of the foreign bases, and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure. I can't imagine you disagree, but do you think it's important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level, instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win? 
ESH: The Greens don't have the resources to compete in many local elections. So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues. Furthermore, the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies. It is said that she can't make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly, but even Ralph Nader couldn't get 5 percent of the vote. The system still works well, for the 1%. 
AG : Michael Moore has made a movie called ""Trumpland"" and warned that Trump's election would be the end of the United States , assuming that would be a bad thing. David Swanson, author of ""War Is a Lie,"" has imagined the same but argued, in "" Secession, Trump, and the Avoidability of Civil War ,"" that the break-up of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon. Do you have any thoughts on this? 
ESH: Michael Moore is completely oblivious to the fact that the enlarging war that is likely to follow Hillary Clinton's election threatens not only a nuclear exchange but also attacks on civil liberties and the march toward fascism. In its own way, the election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory. The anti-Trump hysteria has tended to block out consideration of the Hillary Clinton menace. 
AG: Is there anything else you'd like to say about why you're voting for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka? 
ESH: I've always believed in the moral rule laid down in the categorical imperative: ""Do that which you would wish generalized."" Ann Garrison an independent journalist based in Oakland, USA.",0

Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, an aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner.
The F.B.I. told Congress that it had uncovered new emails related to the closed investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton or her aides had mishandled classified information, potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election.

17835,Study Supports Suspicion That Police Are More Likely to Use Force on Blacks - The New York Times,"The vast majority of interactions between police officers and civilians end routinely, with no one injured, no one aggrieved and no one making the headlines. But when force is used, a new study has found, the race of the person being stopped by officers is significant. The study of thousands of    episodes from police departments across the nation has concluded what many people have long thought, but which could not be proved because of a lack of data:   are far more likely than whites and other groups to be the victims of use of force by the police, even when racial disparities in crime are taken into account. The report, to be released Friday by the Center for Policing Equity, a New   think tank, took three years to assemble and largely refutes explanations from some police officials that blacks are more likely to be subjected to police force because they are more frequently involved in criminal activity. The researchers said they did not gather enough data specifically related to police shootings to draw conclusions on whether there were racial disparities when it came to the fatal confrontations between officers and civilians so in the news. The study’s release comes at a particularly volatile time in the relationship between the police and minority communities after   fatal police shootings of   men this week in Louisiana and Minnesota prompted widespread outrage. Portions of the episodes, both captured on video and released publicly, have intensified calls for police reform as many departments across the nation have been slow to deploy body cameras or to mandate changes in officer training standards after the   deaths of a number of   at the hands of police officers in the past two years.   activists who have demanded greater police accountability since the 2014 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. set off days of rioting, said Thursday that the study was critical to the conversation, but far from surprising. “It’s kind of like, ‘Is water wet? ’” said Aislinn Sol, organizer of the Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter. “But what we gain with each study, each new piece of information is that we are able to win people over who are on the fence. The evidence is becoming overwhelming and incontrovertible that it is a systemic problem, rather than an isolated one. ” The organization compiled more than 19, 000    incidents by police officers representing 11 large and midsize cities and one large urban county from 2010 to 2015. It is the sort of data the Obama administration and the Justice Department have been seeking from police departments for nearly two years, in many cases, unsuccessfully. The report found that although officers employ force in less than 2 percent of all   interactions, the use of police force is disproportionately high for    —   more than three times greater than for whites. The study, “The Science of Justice: Race, Arrests, and Police Use of Force,” did not seek to determine whether the employment of force in any particular instance was justified, but the center’s researchers found that the disparity in which   were subjected to police force remained consistent across what law enforcement officers call the    continuum  —   from relatively mild physical force, through baton strikes, canine bites, pepper spray, Tasers and gunshots. “The dominant narrative has been that this happens to   because they are arrested in disproportionate numbers,” said Phillip Atiba Goff, a founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity, based at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “But the data really makes it difficult to say that crime is the primary driver of this. In every single category, the   disparity persists. ” The study found that the overall mean    rate for all black residents was 273 per 100, 000, which is 3. 6 times higher than the rate for white residents (76 per 100, 000) and 2. 5 times higher than the overall rate of 108 per 100, 000 for all residents. For those who were arrested, the mean rate of use of force against blacks was 46 for every 1, 000 arrests, compared with 36 per 1, 000 for whites. The Obama administration has been nudging police departments to adapt   tactics and to fix broken relationships with poor and minority communities across the nation, which typically experience far more intensive policing because of what are frequently higher crime rates. But because police departments often refuse to release    data that would illustrate such trends, the federal government has had a difficult time in determining whether police departments are employing force less often. The federal government cannot generally compel police departments to hand over such material, and many local agencies say they do not require officers to submit    reports. Other departments say they lack the resources to collect such information, and others acknowledge privately that they fear that the release of their data would subject them to unwanted scrutiny from the public and the federal government. But when the Justice Department has had the ability to review    records, it has found evidence of abuse. In Seattle, federal investigators found that one out of every five    episodes had been excessive. In Albuquerque, the Justice Department determined that most police shootings from 2009 to 2012 had been unjustified. Researchers for the center said Thursday that the compilation of the    material after years of failed efforts to determine whether racial bias was present represented a significant success. The data is so closely held by police departments that the agencies that cooperated with the project did so anonymously. Though the 12 municipalities that provided data were not named, they represented a large urban county in California and 11 cities spanning the nation with populations that range from less than 100, 000 to several million, with an average population of 600, 000. The center said that given the diversity of the municipalities  —   six are predominantly white, one is predominantly black or Latino, and five have populations in which no single racial or ethnic group represents 50 percent or more of the population  —   that the findings are likely to hold true for most other cities. Cameron McLay, the police chief of Pittsburgh, said his agency had been among those to share its    data. He said use of force by his officers had decreased in recent years, but acknowledged that there remained concerns about disparities in use of force when it came to  . “We are responsible for not just bringing down the crime rate, but for making people feel safe in their communities,” he said.",0
17836,Re-appraisal of Mark Twain underway after discovery of ‘good wank spoiled’ note,"November 12, 2016 
Historians were undertaking a frantic reassessment of the contribution of Mark Twain yesterday, after the surprise discovery of a box of jottings by the famous American author, known for his sparkling epigrams. The box, containing notes from his early life in Missouri was uncovered during a spring clean of the Twain family home in Connecticut, now a working museum dedicated to the literary legend. On one note, Twain wrote that ‘golf is a good wank spoiled’, casting considerable doubt on the commonly held view that he was comparing the sport unfavourably to a walk in the park. 
‘Twain was a prodigious masturbator as a teenager, that much we know from published memoirs, and the extensive porn collection found under his mattress,’ indicated Cecile De Mornay, Professor of American Literature at Oxford University. ‘These new notes reveal much about the state of his mind – and his trousers – during his formative years. As he entered adolescence, it seems he struggled to find much privacy in the family home, so he would often sneak off to the local golf club to snap one out.’ 
‘The local toilets at the club provided him with a nice quiet space for him to bash his bishop,’ continued De Mornay. ‘Frustratingly for him, sometimes, other members of the golf club would spot him before he reached the toilets, and, understandably, they would invite him to join them for 18 holes, thus spoiling his regular bouts of self-discovery. A round of fourballs, rather than his preference for a solitary game with two balls and a wood, if you like.’ 
Experts suggest that this discovery will not be a long term stain on Twain’s reputation, although the impact on his bedsheets is a different matter. ‘Twain’s place in the spotlight will come again’, concluded De Mornay confidently. ‘Although, with this new discovery, it is actually his come that is being placed under the spotlight.’ Share this story...

17837,"At the Tonys, Moments to Remember - The New York Times","In a Tony Awards night shadowed by the tragedy in Orlando, Fla. prizewinners and other performers worked hard to strike a balance between joy and reflection. Here are some moments to remember: Soon after delivering a tremulous speech addressed to the TV audience (“Hate will never win”) the Tonys host, James Corden, dove into a breathless   of 20 Broadway hits, concluding with some elegant hoofing to “We’re in the Money” from “42nd Street. ” “Think of tonight as the Oscars, but with diversity,” Mr. Corden joked in his opening monologue. And the show delivered: In a first for Broadway, Tony voters gave the four musical performance awards to black actors: Cynthia Erivo of “The Color Purple” and Leslie Odom Jr. Renée Elise Goldsberry and Daveed Diggs of “Hamilton. ” In his acceptance speech for best score for “Hamilton,”   Miranda provided the broadcast’s emotional high point, reading a sonnet he had written that cited “senseless acts of tragedy” and included the repeated “and love is love, is love, is love, is love” that brought down the house. Asked later why he decided to address the situation this way, he said: “We live in this world where beautiful and horrible things exist at the same time. You can’t let that go by, particularly when theater doesn’t exist without the L. G. B. T. community. ” Not only did a pregnant Audra McDonald tap her heart out in the “Shuffle Along” production number, she later presented the prize for best actress in a musical  —   a category in which she was overlooked. With six Tonys already, it’s easier to take things in stride. In winning best leading actor in a play for “The Father,” Frank Langella tied Boyd Gaines for the most Tonys won by a male actor. He used his acceptance speech to movingly remember the victims of the massacre in Orlando, Fla. “I’m now a    man, and I react to things a lot more profoundly than I did when I was 60, when I was 50 or 40,” Mr. Langella said. “This constant violence and sense of madness that seems to be pervading this country is terrifying. ” He continued: “I urge you, Orlando, to be strong. I’m standing in a room full of the most generous human beings on earth, and we will be with you every step of the way. ” Mr. Langella’s other Tonys were for his roles in “Seascape” (1975) “Fortune’s Fool” (2002) and “ ” (2007). The costume designer William Ivey Long said he scrambled to make some 3, 000 commemorative ribbons in the basement of the Beacon Theater, where the ceremony was held. In an interview on the red carpet, Mr. Long said the ribbons were a small way for Broadway to show its support for the victims and their families in Orlando. ”You’re helpless because you’re here,” he said. “We wanted to open our arms and show love, that we understand. ” Mr. Diggs almost upstaged his own acceptance speech by wearing a jacket with gaudy patchwork sleeves that you almost couldn’t take your eyes off. Meanwhile, Barbra Streisand’s   look seemed almost a spoiler, giving the nod to “Hamilton” as best musical before she’d even opened the envelope. She joked, “Thank God I picked the right outfit. ” As the camera panned to show nominees for best director of a musical, it focused on the actor Christopher Fitzgerald, not Michael Arden, the director of “Spring Awakening. ” Mr. Arden later tweeted: “If you know anything about me I’ve spent the last 10 years of my life  —   what some would consider the lifeblood of a woman’s career  —   just trying to have children. And I get to testify in front of all of you that the Lord gave me Benjamin and Brielle and then he still gave me this. Thank you. ”  —   Ms. Goldsberry accepting her Tony. From the show’s opening number, in which Mr. Corden glanced back fondly on his formative years as a bespectacled kid with big dreams, parents were paid tribute throughout the night for the encouragement they offered and sacrifices they made for their   sons and daughters. In his acceptance speech, Mr. Diggs thanked his father for joining him in a preschool gymnastics performance in which they both wore “matching rainbow tights,” and his mother for “permission to do something that everyone else wasn’t doing. ” Later in the program, Mr. Corden found his father in the audience and asked him how he thought the show was going. “It’s great, mate,” he replied, “but it’s going on a bit, isn’t it?” Compiled by Mike Hale, Scott Heller, Charles Isherwood, Dave Itzkoff and Erik Piepenburg.",0
17838,Moroccan Migrant Arrested After Woman Pushed onto Subway Tracks,"Police were able to arrest a suspect early Wednesday morning after a woman was knocked unconscious having been pushed onto the tracks of the Hamburg   underground railway by a Moroccan illegal. [The    paperless migrant who Die Welt reports had no residence permit in Germany and is in the country illegally assaulted a    woman in the early hours of Wednesday morning. CCTV footage reviewed by officers showed the illegal youth attempting to reach into the woman’s handbag at around one o’clock in the morning, but being spotted by his intended victim.  As the woman called for help and resisted the attack, the Moroccan male pushed her backwards, causing the woman to stumble onto the tracks below, the fall knocking her unconscious. Examination in hospital showed the woman had suffered a concussion as a result of her head striking the railway track. Fortunately, no trains were due on the line at that time and German Rail staff came to her aid. The assailant fled the scene, but was identified from security camera footage and was later arrested. He is being held on suspicion of “predatory theft”. Germany’s underground railways are becoming an increasing target for migrant criminals, who in addition to engaging in theft have also been reported to act with extreme violence towards other subway users. Breitbart London reported in December of a Berlin police hunt for a group of migrants who were caught on security cameras setting a homeless man sleeping on a station platform alight on Christmas day. The Syrian and Libyan gang have been charged with attempted murder. In another incident caught on security camera, German police sought a group of Bulgarian men after they, in an apparently unprovoked attack, kicked a woman down a flight of stairs leading to the platform. The victim was admitted to hospital with a broken forearm.",0
17839,Скандал вокруг Пак Кын Хе и Чхве Сун Силь и массовые протесты | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Южная Корея Мы продолжаем информировать аудиторию о скандале вокруг Чхве Сун Силь — конфидантки президента РК Пак Кын Хе, так как кризис, связанный с ее вмешательством в государственные дела и коррупцией, продолжает развиваться. Напомним, что, не имея формального допуска, Чхве читала ДСП-шные материалы, правила речи президента (правда, пока все же нет доказательств идеологического, а не стилистического характера правки) и подозревается также в сборе средств с крупных компаний, в числе которых Lotte и SK Group, в связанные с ней фонды MIR и K-Sports. 4 ноября 2016 г. президент РК выступила в прямом телеэфире и принесла извинения, признав, что «чрезмерная зависимость от Чхве ослепила мою объективность и возможность суждений». Говорила очень эмоционально, что нетипично для нее, взяла всю ответственность за скандал на себя и заявила, что очень сожалеет о том, что разочаровала народ, который доверил ей управление государством. Пак указала, что работала над улучшением экономики и жизни населения, но отдельные личности пошли на противозаконные действия в своих интересах, отчего она испытывает глубокие переживания. Такая эмоциональность имеет причины, если вспоминать биографию президента РК – после смерти родителей и на фоне очень сложных отношений с семьей, Чхве, дочь ее духовного наставника, была самым близким человеком и соратником в течение очень долгого времени. Президент подчеркнула, что готова принять все требования народа и Национального собрания в рамках выполнения возложенных не неё обязанностей. В том числе в случае необходимости оказать содействие следствию со стороны прокуратуры и принять участие в специальном расследовании, хотя формально она на вполне законных основаниях могла бы отказаться от этого. Однако при этом Пак Кын Хе отметила, что сегодня безопасность и экономика страны под большой угрозой. Поэтому нельзя, чтобы реализация государственной политики прекращалась. Извинения, однако, пришлись по вкусу не всем. В правящей партии Сэнури выступление главы государства оценили положительно, указав, что президент согласилась со всеми требованиями общественности, выразив твёрдую готовность к выяснению всех подробностей скандала и предотвращению возникновения подобных ситуаций в будущем. Глава оппозиционной Демократической партии Тобуро Чху Ми Э наоборот, заявила, что извинения Пак Кын Хе не дали ответов, которых ожидал возмущённый народ, и назвала выступление президента всего лишь неискренним оправданием. Председатель временного комитета Народной партии Пак Чи Вон указал на неприемлемость заявления Пак Кын Хе о том, что проблема вокруг Чхве Сун Силь началась с действий, направленных на улучшение экономики и качества жизни населения, но положительно оценил готовность Пак Кын Хе сотрудничать с прокуратурой в проведении расследования. В результате оппозиция только усилила давление и фактически предъявила президенту ультиматум. Или парламент инициирует импичмент, или Пак устраняется от внутренней политики и смещает новоназначенного ей премьера – представителя левых, но не того, кого бы хотело видеть на этом посту оппозиционное руководство. За спиной подобных требований – негативно настроенная общественность. 5 ноября в Сеуле прошла демонстрация протеста со свечами, в которой по официальным данным приняло участие 45 тысяч человек, а по оппозиционным, все 100 тысяч (некоторые даже говорили о двухстах, что явное преувеличение). До столкновений дело не дошло, полиция (около 20 тысяч полицейских на 220 машинах) была корректна, но 12 ноября протесты начались с новой силой. А как тем временем идет расследование? 3 ноября Чхве Сун Силь была заключена под стражу, но БЕЗ предъявления обвинения. Такая практика в РК есть (и ранее неоднократно критиковалась правозащитниками), позволяя держать человека под стражей до 20 суток, даже если пока против него нет улик того уровня, при котором ему можно предъявить обвинения. Решение по этому поводу принял суд Центрального округа Сеула по запросу прокуратуры. В тот же день другой фигурант коррупционного скандала — бывший советник президента РК по вопросам государственной политики Ан Чжон Бом — сообщил на допросе, что ставшие предметом расследования фонды MIR и K-Sports были учреждены по указанию президента РК Пак Кын Хе, чем могла быть объяснена их ускоренная регистрация. Ан подчеркнул, что в своей политике глава государства уделяет важное значение культуре и креативной экономике, и отверг подозрения о причастности к сбору средств с крупных компаний в пользу вышеуказанных фондов. По его словам, представители деловых кругов добровольно приняли решение участвовать в учреждении фондов без какого-либо давления на них. Бывший главный секретарь президента РК по гражданским делам У Бён У также был вызван на допрос в прокуратуру. Он подозревается в причастности к сбору средств компаний в фонды Mir и K-Sports и будет допрошен в качестве свидетеля, хотя в зависимости от результатов расследования может стать подозреваемым. Существуют пока не доказанные подозрения в том, что он использовал средства фондов в личных целях, оформил на подставное лицо объекты недвижимости, принадлежащие его жене, и использовал своё влияние для того, чтобы помочь сыну пройти обязательную военную службу не в вооружённых силах, а в полиции. В общем, убедительных доказательств самых убойных случаев коррупции или вмешательства в государственные дела пока нет – есть «обоснованные подозрения» или слухи, которые обильно тиражирует как левая, так и правая пресса. Нет пока ни доказательств идеологической правки президентских речей, ни заявлений представителей ФПГ о том, что от них требовали спонсировать фонды против их желания, ни финансовых документов, указывающих на перевод денег из фондов в личные средства Чхве Сун Силь. Тем не менее на подругу президента, кажется, пытаются повесить все скандалы или злоупотребления последнего времени. А документ из Викиликс, где говорится о том, что «ходят слухи о том, что Пак чрезмерно зависима от человека, которого можно сравнить с Распутиным», цитируют не как указание на слухи, а как доказательство. Пак же не поддается давлению (многие думали, что телевыступление будет включать не только извинения, но и добровольную отставку) и остается под огнем – левые будут стараться не упустить шанс сбросить «символ диктатуры», виноватый хотя бы тем, что нынешний президент – дочь Пак Чон Хи. Для правых – это не только утопить соперника в рамках фракционной борьбы, но и свалить на «шаманку» как на стрелочника все просчеты правительственного курса, после чего, сбросив балласт, попытаться выйти на новый виток президентской гонки в новом образе. Именно консерваторы могут припомнить ей и возобновление борьбы с коррупцией, и «Евразийскую инициативу», при помощи которой она пыталась хотя бы частично выйти из-под американского зонтика и улучшить отношения с Москвой и Пекином. Неслучайно бывший лидер правящей партии Сэнури Ким Му Сон (жесткий консерватор, находящийся куда правее Пак) потребовал от президента покинуть ряды партии. Он подчеркнул, что глава государства, являющаяся гарантом Конституции, управляла страной, нарушая конституционные принципы и ценности, и потребовал скорейшего формирования правительства национального единства. Члены Высшего совета партии выразили протест в отношении такого требования, однако ее лидер Ли Чжон Хён (экс-сторонник Пак) заявил, что в скором времени покинет свой пост. Он лишь попросил дать ему немного времени для того, чтобы помочь главе государства разобраться с ситуацией. В этом контексте автор напоминает аудитории, что «правый поворот» Пак Кын Хе был вызван не иррациональными причинами, а общей политической ситуацией, включавшей в себя ужесточение позиции КНДР (включая четвертое ядерное испытание, на которое надо было дать некий громкий ответ), категорическое непризнание левыми любых действий президента (что исключало возможность диалога для проведения в жизнь умеренной программы) и существенное давление с правого фланга. А потому посмотрим, как будут развиваться события покажет время, благо власти собираются вплотную заняться урегулированием скандала.

17840,"2017: ""Safe spaces"" and Putin-blaming won't save European Atlanticists","November 20, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Ruslan Ostashko, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


I’ve already taken note of the fact that one only has to mention some problems of the European Union and the reactions of our Westernists will boil down to one argument: “Yeah, sure, Europe is rotting, but it still hasn’t rotted since the times of the USSR.” Now, if I say that the EU is faced with the prospects of a real collapse, then our Westernists will probably write something similar to me and accuse me of belonging to Kremlin propaganda. 
No matter what, I will say that the EU risks collapsing in the foreseeable future. In the end, there is nothing wrong with being considered a Kremlin propagandist, especially since I am joined by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who yesterday said the same thing. Yes, he even used the word “collapse.” What do you think - did Putin buy him or does he really think this? 
The French prime minister made such a statement in Berlin, where he went to discuss with Angela Merkel how to live in the new epoch of Trump. to be honest, the tone of his interview in the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung suggests that his talks with Merkel are more reminiscent of a collective therapy session than a brainstorming session. Let me tell you what this really reminded me of. 
Following Trump’s victory, many American universities held special psychological support events for students who couldn’t cope with the grief of Hillary Clinton’s defeat. Volunteers and university employees created a pleasant atmosphere for suffering American youth, comforting them and handing out coloring books for adults, brought special therapeutic dogs to pet, and gave students the opportunity to cry a river. Some tests and exams have even been cancelled. 
The actions of European politicians following the US elections really remind me of this kind of collective therapy: they cry together, grieve together, convince each other that everything will be fine, but don’t come up with anything concrete. In the interview with the French prime minister, it is difficult to find any kind of concrete action plan. The statement that “France and Germany should be the leaders of Europe” is not an action program. France and Germany have already long since been the leaders of Europe, and the problem is once again that many European don’t like where they’ve brought them. The English and part of the English political elite disliked this situation to such an extent that they voted to leave the European Union. Even Manuel Valls already suspects that Britain won’t be the last country to ask to disembark from the European Titanic. 
The prime minister of France suddenly realizes that the EU is faced with the problem of migrants. This is big progress, but with whom is he going to solve this problem? With Merkel? With the very same Merkel who has flooded Germany with migrants and whose approval rating is collapsing for this reason? 
There is the theory that France’s prime minister went to Germany to give Frau Chancellor much needed moral support. Western analysts have declared Merkel the “savior of the free world,” but she is the last person who would fit this role, and she herself is not very comfortable in it. Western analysts are at least correctly writing that Merkel does not have the charisma, army, or economy to be the “leader and savior of the free world,” and the EU is falling apart. 
Let me recall several events which could finish European stability. In December, there will be presidential elections in Austria which could be won by the candidate that is inclined to recognize Crimea and inaugurate Austria’s exit from the EU. Also in December, there will be a referendum in Italy, the results of which could send Renzi’s government into resignation, thus causing a political crisis and a practical paralysis of decision-making at the EU level as long as Italian politicians can’t agree with each other.  
2017 will bring even more interesting events. There will be presidential elections in France that might be won by Sarkozy or Marine Le Pen, both of whom are bad enough for Merkel. Merkel herself could lose the chair of Chancellor, although she will try to run for a fourth term. 
In fact, I want to ask the fans of Western democracy and peaceful transfer of power: how will a fourth term for Merkel pan out? Democratically? What about a fourth term for Putin? No? The double standards are revealed. 
Judging by the experience of the US election campaign and the Brexit referendum, I already know who will be blamed. Do you think that Obama has just kindheartedly declared Russia a superpower capable of influencing the world? Of course not. This is an artillery barrage preceding a massive information campaign with the message “Putin is undermining the EU!” After all, Europeans wouldn’t understand how the EU could be undermined by a “regional power” with an economy “torn to shreds.” 
Everything will be clear. I don’t even rule out that our Kiev opponents will send the next set of fakes to Berlin or Paris in the form of a stolen letter from Surkov, only for BBC and Euronews to then expose some kind of plan to scare voters. This will be, of course, hilarious, but it won’t help European politicians.

17841,Why Betsy DeVos Won’t Be Able to Privatize U.S. Education - The New York Times,"We’re resurfacing this article after the narrow confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary on Tuesday. As we noted in November, she will be highly constrained in trying to voucherize American   education. Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican philanthropist, whom Donald J. Trump selected on Wednesday as the next secretary of education, has spent her career promoting a   privatized vision of public education. If she pursues that agenda in her new role, she is quite likely to face disappointment and frustration.   school reforms generally come in two flavors: vouchers and charter schools. They differ in both structure and political orientation. Charter schools are public schools, open to all, accountable in varying degrees to public authorities, and usually run by nonprofit organizations. Vouchers, by contrast, allow students to attend any school, public or private, including those run by religious organizations and   companies. While charters enjoy support from most Republicans and some Democrats, vouchers have a narrower political base, those who tend to favor free markets to replace many government responsibilities. Working primarily in Michigan, Ms. DeVos has been a strong advocate of vouchers, and her charter work has often focused on making charter schools as private as possible. The large majority of Michigan charters are run by   companies, in contrast with most states. The DeVos family donated more than $1 million to Republican lawmakers earlier this year during a successful effort to oppose new oversight of charters. That support made Ms. Devos a natural choice for Mr. Trump, who proposed a $20 billion federal voucher program on the campaign trail, and has likened the public school system to a monopoly business that needs to be broken up. But any effort to promote vouchers from Washington will run up against the basic structures of American education. The United States spends over $600 billion a year on public   schools. Less than 9 percent of that money comes from the federal government, and it is almost exclusively dedicated to specific populations of children, most notably students with disabilities and students in   communities. There are no existing federal funds that can easily be turned into vouchers large enough to pay for school tuition on the open market. Mr. Trump’s $20 billion proposal would be, by itself, very expensive. It may be hard to fit into a budget passed by a Republican Congress that has pledged to enact large tax cuts for corporations and citizens, expand the military and eliminate the budget deficit, all at the same time. Yet $20 billion isn’t nearly enough to finance vouchers nationwide, which is why Mr. Trump’s proposal assumes that states will kick in another $110 billion. States don’t have that kind of money lying around. The only plausible source is existing school funding. But even if Ms. DeVos were to find a willing governor and state legislature, it’s not that easy. Roughly half of all nonfederal education funding comes from local property taxes raised by over 13, 000 local school districts. They and their elected representatives will have a say, too. This is where the intersection of geography and politics makes any national voucher plan much more difficult to enact. The practicality of school choice is highly related to population density. Children need to be able to get from home to school and back again every day. In a large metropolis with public transportation, there could be dozens of schools within reasonable travel distance of most families. In a small city, town or rural area, there will be few or none. And population density, as Americans saw in the last election, is increasingly the dividing line of the nation’s politics. A significant number of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters live in sparsely populated areas where school choice is logistically unlikely. At the same time, many of the municipalities where market reforms are theoretically much easier to put in voted overwhelmingly against the  . On Election Day, voters in liberal Massachusetts rejected a ballot measure by a   margin that would have increased the number of charter schools in the state, despite strong evidence that the state’s   charters produce superior results for   and minority schoolchildren. In theory, information technology offers a way around the population density problem. Virtual schools can be attended from anywhere with an internet connection.   colleges that have pocketed billions of dollars by offering   online courses are poised to make a comeback under the Trump administration, which is likely to roll back President Obama’s efforts to regulate them. But the federal government is a much larger financial contributor to colleges and universities than to   schools, and college students don’t need an adult looking after them all day. Ms. DeVos will probably be a boon to the relatively small, growing population of families that   their children. But most parents will still want their children in a school building during the day, taught by a teacher, not by a computer. Ms. Devos will also be hamstrung by the fact that her deregulated school choice philosophy has not been considered a resounding success. In her home state, Detroit’s   choice policies have led to a wild west of cutthroat competition and poor academic results. While there is substantial academic literature on school vouchers and while debates continue between opposing camps of researchers, it’s safe to say that vouchers have not produced the kind of large improvements in academic achievement that   reformers originally promised.",0
17842,Poll: Most Californians Favor Vouchers for Private Schools - Breitbart,"A poll released Wednesday by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) finds a solid majority of Californians support   vouchers for private and religious schools. [According to the poll, 60 percent of adults favor “providing parents with   vouchers to send their children to any public, private, or parochial school they choose. ” Among registered voters, 55 percent favor vouchers, and, among likely voters, 50 percent favor vouchers.  Among adults, the survey finds 73 percent of African Americans, 69 percent of Latinos, 56 percent of Asian Americans, and 51 percent of White Americans favor school vouchers. Republicans are more likely to favor school vouchers than Democrats, 67 percent to 46 percent. At the same time, results of the poll show that most Californians give passing grades to their local public schools. Among adults, 54 percent give their public schools an A (22 percent) or a B (32 percent) with only 7 percent giving a grade of F. Most adults (64 percent) and likely voters (66 percent) also say current funding for public schools is inadequate. “Most Californians give passing grades to their local public schools,” said Mark Baldassare, PPIC president and CEO. “But many believe that the state isn’t spending enough money on K —  12 education and should also spend what it has more wisely. In this context, many are willing to raise their local taxes and consider a voucher system. ” The PPIC poll’s results are based on a survey of 1, 705 California adult residents between April   2017, with a sampling error of ±3. 2 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. The poll contains a subgroup of 1, 036 California adult likely voters. Results for that group have a sampling error of ±4. 1 at the 95 percent confidence level. President Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have made school choice the focus of their national education agenda. A national poll by Education Next (EdNext) in August 2016 found that, while overall support for school choice has remained high, support for the use of vouchers to access choice programs has fallen. School choice can be designed with a variety of financial mechanisms, including school vouchers, education savings accounts (ESAs) and scholarship tax credits (STC)  —   all of which may differ in terms of the level of state regulation that may be required of the schools that participate in the choice program. According to EdNext, support for vouchers targeted for   families was at 37% in 2016, and for universal vouchers for all families at 45%. However, 53% of the general public and 60% of parents in 2016 backed scholarship tax credits for individuals or companies that donate to foundations that provide scholarships to   students to attend private schools. That percentage backing STCs is increased from 46% since 2009, though down from its highest level of 60% in 2014. “The EdNext findings on school choice suggest that program design matters,” Lindsey Burke, director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told Breitbart News, adding: The poll results found a drop in support for school vouchers, which could reflect recent experiences in states that have heavily regulated their school voucher programs, leading, paradoxically  —   as the regulations were promulgated in the name of accountability  —   to lower participation among high quality private schools. The concept of “school choice” is very appealing, but the reality is that vouchers are a transfer of taxpayer funds from a public school to a private or religious participating school. If parents “choose” to send their children to a participating school, that school may have additional regulatory burdens placed upon it by the state in which it is located  —   in the name of “accountability”  —   in order to qualify for the school choice program. The overarching question then becomes why transfer a child to a school when it might have the same regulations, test requirements, etc. as the public school? In a 2010 study at the Cato Institute, Andrew Coulson found that voucher programs are more likely to “suffocate the very markets to which they aim to expand access,” because state funds —  which invariably invite state regulation —  are directly transferred, in the form of vouchers, to parents to spend in an alternate education setting.

17843,Comment on Friday funnies! by MeThePeople,"Yesterday we saw a black teenager take a Trump poster and gleefully tear it up. It was a shopping area in Duval County Jacksonville, FL. Not downtown. What does it mean? That for many, political activism means vandalizing private property and suppressing freedom of speech. (yours not theirs) 
An acquaintance who is in Chicago says his wife is voting for Hillary because it is time for a woman POTUS. He says he cannot speak about Trump at home or a riot starts, but says he is voting Trump because all Hillary’s campaign does is attack Trump, no policy. AT LEAST Trump has a plan. When I mention Benghazi, he says he is sorry about military casualties but those who enlist know the risks. I guess that it was diplomats running guns for Obama, doesn’t matter, 
So these are mature people who run a business (3 rd generation), and this what filters through to them. This is the level of comprehension. So he volunteered the info that he was voting for Trump, and I do not abuse him or speak excessively about politics with him, and I forget what we were chatting about when it came up. He says he goes to church regularly and considers himself ‘religious’, but when speaking to him, he is pretty fuzzy about what the Bible says about forgiveness. If Trump loses and then buys an island and starts a country, I’d be interested in the costs involved. If Trump loses this country will not offer much of a future for my kids or grandchildren.",0
17844,Why Bomb Suspect’s Travels Didn’t Set Off More Scrutiny - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   To an amateur eye, Ahmad Khan Rahami’s travel history might appear to be a red flag: He had traveled to Pakistan, the home of Al Qaeda, four times between 2005 and 2014. The last time he stayed for a year. So Mr. Rahami’s arrest in the bombings last weekend in New York and New Jersey  —   and the revelation that he cited jihadist leaders in his journal  —   has raised an obvious question: Did the government miss something? Possibly. But Mr. Khan’s extended family, originally from Afghanistan, lives in Pakistan, and he told customs officials on his return from his trips that he had been visiting family, officials said. He had married a Pakistani woman during a 2011 visit. In 2014, he had to arrange an American passport for their baby, born that year in Pakistan. Both are plausible explanations for an extended stay. An initial review of the government’s handling of Mr. Rahami’s travel, based on records described by law enforcement officials, suggests no obvious lapses. That could change if more details of his exchanges with border officials become public. In 2006 and 2011, Mr. Rahami was subjected to extra airport screening, but no further consequences, when he returned to the United States, officials said. Mr. Rahami’s arrival at Kennedy International Airport in March 2014 appears to have received the most scrutiny. Because he had arrived on a   ticket from Pakistan  —   a trigger for extra attention  —   he was questioned again in a secondary interview. But for an American returning home from a lengthy stay abroad, the   ticket he used made sense, and he was not held or further delayed. Officials now believe that Mr. Rahami may have taken a side trip to Ankara, Turkey, in January 2014. It is not clear whether he informed customs officials about that trip. Still, customs officers who spoke with him thought information from the interview should be shared more broadly, so they forwarded a report to the National Targeting Center, an analysis hub run by U. S. Customs and Border Protection. Officers at the center, in turn, thought the report on Mr. Rahami was significant enough to distribute to other law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a summary that is sent out every few days. Officials familiar with the report said it contained no hard information that might have caused alarm or prompted immediate action. Certainly, there was nothing approaching the significance of a statement that Mr. Rahami’s father gave to the F. B. I. five months later, in which he said he thought that his son might be involved in terrorism. The National Targeting Center, near Washington, was set up after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and became part of the customs and border agency in 2002. In 2007, it was divided into two parts, one focusing on cargo, the other on passengers. Its operations were stepped up further after the   underwear bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried to blow up an airliner as it prepared to land in Detroit. In recent weeks, the passenger and cargo operations were combined into one office again, officials said. Dozens of officers comb through passenger lists for all flights arriving in the United States, which include about 300, 000 people each day, as well as cargo manifests  —   looking, in essence, for the needle in the haystack. The center is in charge of identifying people who should be stopped or questioned at the borders. It also writes guidelines for when   customs officers should send passengers from certain countries or with unusual travel itineraries for additional questioning, as happened with Mr. Rahami. The center has had its problems. A 2011 report from the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that it had a staff shortage and described a cumbersome data system that made complete checks on incoming passengers difficult and  . Targeting specialists at the time used “as many as four computer monitors with different databases open concurrently,” the report said. For years after the 2001 attacks, one of the F. B. I. ’s primary concerns was trying to catch Americans traveling to Pakistan to join Al Qaeda, in an effort to disrupt recruiting networks. Today, by contrast, the bureau is most intently focused on homegrown violent extremists who may be plotting attacks in the United States. Travel to   hot spots no longer stands out as an automatic sign of danger, especially when there is a reasonable explanation. “It is an indicator, but you don’t even need to travel anymore to conduct an attack,” said Brenda Heck, a former senior F. B. I. counterterrorism agent who retired in 2012. “It is less now of an indicator than when I was working there. ” Still, as an F. B. I. agent, Ms. Heck said she would want to know what Mr. Rahami was doing in Pakistan. “On one side of it, he’s likely got family, but we can’t know exactly what he did over there,” she said. “That’s troubling. ” The elaborate security measures in place for years at United States borders do not always work. In May 2013, a young man named Moner Mohammad Abusalha landed in Newark and was pulled aside for additional questioning. He told officers he had been in Jordan visiting family. In fact, he had secretly traveled to Syria. One of the officers was suspicious and called his mother in Florida. She verified his story, and Mr. Abusalha passed through customs. The F. B. I. was never told about the call to the mother or about the officer’s suspicions. Mr. Abusalha later returned to Syria, joined a Qaeda affiliate in Syria and blew himself up in an attack.",0
17845,Schumer: ’Lots’ of Democrats Could Beat Trump in 2020 - Breitbart,"Friday on MSNBC, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) said “lots” of Democrats could beat President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

17846,November supermoon biggest in nearly 70 years,"November supermoon biggest in nearly 70 years 11/03/2016 
USA TODAY 
Supersized! November supermoon will be biggest in nearly 70 years. The supermoon occurs when the moon is slightly closer to Earth than it typically is, and the effect is most noticeable when it occurs around the same time as a full moon. 
It can appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than usual, according to NASA. 
The word supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle, AccuWeather’s Mark Paquette says. Nolle used the term to describe a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is at or near its closest approach to Earth. 
Instead of a supermoon, astronomy site Slooh.com is calling it a “mega beaver moon,” which includes the moon’s folklore name for November. 
According to the Old Farmer’s Almanac , the November moon was named the beaver moon partly because, “for both the colonists and the Algonquin tribes, this was the time to set beaver traps before the swamps froze, to ensure a supply of warm winter furs.”

17847,Mysterious Buyer of Trump’s Childhood Home Said to Be From China - The New York Times,"They first arrived in late January, caravans of black Escalades driving along a small street in Jamaica Estates, an upscale neighborhood in Queens, and stopping in front of a modest   house that had just been sold at auction: the home where President Trump lived as a boy. Out stepped a stream of people in business suits, according to a neighbor, all speaking Chinese. The visits spiked between the auction and the closing of the sale last week, according to the neighbor, who did not want to be identified because of concerns about her privacy. It was revealed last week that the home had been bought by Trump Birth House, a limited liability company that obscured the identity of the person behind it. But while the buyer’s identity remained unknown, a person with knowledge of the deal said that the new owner, who spent over $2 million for the childhood home of the current president of the United States, is a woman from China. “Why is there an influx of Chinese people interested in this house, of all people?” the neighbor said she recalled wondering. “What do they want?” The house on Wareham Place has become another curiosity in the vast orbit of properties connected to Mr. Trump, even though he last lived in the   home, built by his father, Fred C. Trump, when he was 4. The house’s intrigue lies not just in the price it fetched in an auction by Paramount Realty USA  —   $2. 14 million, more than double the price of comparable houses in the area  —   but also in the mystery surrounding the buyer. She remains unknown, shrouded behind the limited liability company. A thin trail of documents associated with the sale led first to a   office on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, of Michael X. Tang, a lawyer who represents Trump Birth House. In the cramped and bustling office, which, according to its website, specializes in facilitating Chinese purchases of American real estate, a woman at a desk welcomed visitors. “Oh, about the Trump house,” she said. She continued: Mr. Tang declined to comment. Documents show that Mr. Tang was also the lawyer for a seemingly unrelated transaction on a palatial home in Old Westbury, N. Y. which sold for more than $3. 6 million in 2014 to a person named Jiying Wei. The redbrick mansion, tucked at the end of a    and abutted by a private tennis court, is a far cry from the modest   childhood home of Mr. Trump. But, according to a person with knowledge of the sale, the mansion’s owner is a relative of the woman from China who bought the Trump family home. Standing in the collonaded entryway of her home a few doors down in Old Westbury, a neighbor, who declined to give her name for privacy reasons, deepened the mystery: The only person who lives in the mansion, she said, is the family’s son, a local college student the rest of the family lives in China. The trail   at the   : The house was empty and the owner could not be reached. “I did have some expectation that the purchaser would be a huge Trump supporter from within America,” Misha Haghani, principal of Paramount Realty USA, said of the Jamaica Estates home. He declined to reveal the identity of the buyer. “But it is entirely possible that the purchaser is a huge Trump supporter from outside of America,” he said. Cathy Han, a real estate agent in New York who specializes in marketing   properties to Chinese buyers  —   including apartments in   buildings  —   said she was not surprised that the home had been purchased by a Chinese buyer. “When I saw it was Trump’s birth house property for sale, I knew immediately it would get a lot of attention from Chinese buyers,” Ms. Han said. “I know he is a controversial figure in the States, but among Chinese people, Trump is a very popular kind of character in China. ” She said the image that Mr. Trump liked to promote of himself as a successful businessman resonated in China. “The whole thing about Trump is he has no experience in politics, but now he is the president of the U. S. A. ,” she said. “The story is like a movie: It’s kind of inspiring, in a way, that a person can rise up to that position. And I think most Chinese people kind of respect that journey. ” The home had been owned by Isaac Kestenberg, purchased with his wife, Claudia, in 2008 for $782, 500. On Election Day last year, as Mr. Trump’s ascendancy seemed possible, Michael Davis, a real estate investor, made an offer on the house, he said, ultimately purchasing it for about $1. 4 million. Neither Mr. Kestenberg nor Mr. Davis knows who bought it this time, they said. The sale to Trump Birth House closed on March 23. “I hope that the broader economy has as much lift from the president’s policies as the president’s childhood home got,” Mr. Davis said. On Tuesday, rain pelted the crocuses popping up outside the home on Wareham Place. The house appeared to have been emptied. Around 1 p. m. a worker arrived in a National Grid van. The new owner couldn’t be found, he said, so he had come to turn off the power.",0
17848,NASA Aims at an Asteroid Holding Clues to the Solar System’s Roots - The New York Times,"For the next two years, NASA’s latest robotic spacecraft will be chasing down an asteroid near Earth in the hopes of scooping up some of the most primordial bits of the solar system. The premise of the mission for the spacecraft,   is simple: Fly to an asteroid, grab some of the rock and bring it back to Earth, where scientists will study some of the pristine ingredients that went into the making of the solar system, including possibly the building blocks of life. “What was that beginning organic material like?” James L. Green, the director of NASA’s planetary science division, said in an interview. “That’s what’s really exciting about this. This is what we want. ” The details are a bit more complicated. The spacecraft is sitting on top of an Atlas 5 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Fla. ready for launching on Thursday on a   mission. Once off the ground,    —   a shortening of Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer  —   will be aiming to get close to the asteroid Bennu. “It’s 500 meters or so in size, about the height of the Empire State Building,” Dr. Green said. Discovered in 1999, Bennu is a   almost black asteroid. Data from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope and radar measurements by   radio telescopes suggest it is a “rubble pile” with pebbles about half an inch wide on the surface. Scientists believe that it is a conglomeration of leftovers, largely unchanged over the last 4. 5 billion years. “It’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation,” said Dante Lauretta, a professor of planetary science and cosmochemistry at the University of Arizona who is the mission’s principal investigator.   will survey Bennu for more than a year to select the site where it will grab the sample of rock. In July 2020, the spacecraft, about the size of an sport utility vehicle, is to slowly descend and bounce off the surface like a pogo stick at a gentle pace of a   per hour. A sampling head, which looks like an automobile air filter, will shoot a burst of nitrogen to kick up dirt and small rocks during the three to five seconds it is in contact with the surface. The goal is to collect at least a couple of ounces of material and possibly as much as 4. 4 pounds. The spacecraft carries enough nitrogen to attempt to extract material three times if necessary. After departing Bennu in 2021,   will pass by Earth in September 2023, dropping off a capsule with the samples that will land via parachute in a Utah desert. A Japanese mission, Hayabusa 2, will similarly collect samples from another   asteroid, but the   scientists view the missions as complementary, not redundant. Dr. Lauretta said he was particularly interested in gleaning information about organic molecules like amino acids, the building blocks of proteins that are known to float in outer space. One question is whether Bennu contains higher concentrations of the 20 amino acids used by forms of life on Earth compared with dozens of others not found in living organisms. Life on Earth also exclusively uses   “ ” amino acids and not the mirror,   versions. Study of the Bennu material could help explain whether nonbiological chemical reactions in space pushed life toward   molecules or whether that shift occurred later when life arose. Scientists also hope that waterlogged minerals in the sample could tell whether the water in Earth’s oceans came from asteroids like Bennu. Its shape, like a top, fatter around the Equator as it spins around in 4. 3 hours, also suggests that the stuff of Bennu is not solid rock but shifts and slides. Studying this asteroid could also come in handy if it is ever on a collision course with Earth. With about a   orbit, Bennu passes fairly close once every six years. In 2035, it will make a particularly close approach, passing within the orbit of the moon, and Earth will give enough of a gravitational kick that astronomers cannot precisely predict where the asteroid will go after that. There is a small chance  —   one in 2, 700  —   that Bennu will smack into Earth sometime from 2175 to 2196. Bennu is not large enough to wreak planetwide extinctions  —   the asteroid that is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was about six miles wide  —   but a collision would be devastating. Impact would occur at more than 27, 000 miles per hour, unleashing energy equivalent to 1, 450 million tons of TNT and carving a crater almost three miles wide and 1, 500 feet deep, Dr. Lauretta calculated. One of the uncertainties in predicting Bennu’s path is that gravity is not the only force acting on it. As the asteroid rotates, the dark surface absorbs sunlight and then radiates heat. The radiated heat pushes the asteroid like a rocket thruster, a small effect that becomes significant over time. With detailed observations of the surface, scientists will be able to test their models of this effect with the actual orbits of Bennu. For Dr. Lauretta,  ’s launching is a culmination of a dozen years of work. In 2004, officials at Lockheed Martin discussed the idea of an asteroid return mission with Michael J. Drake, the head of the Lunar and Planetary Institute at Arizona. Dr. Drake invited Dr. Lauretta to take part. Dr. Lauretta came up with the name. “That’s entirely my fault,” he said. As he jotted some themes of the scientific objectives  —   origins, spectroscopy, resources and security  —   he had most of the letters of Osiris, the Egyptian god who was the lord of the underworld but who also represented the seeds of regeneration to new life. “It was the dual nature of the Osiris myth,” Dr. Lauretta said. “I had to buy a couple of vowels. ” Meanwhile, engineers at Lockheed Martin had to figure out how to grab a bit of asteroid. The company held a contest. Many of the proposals suggested landing and scooping, but an engineer named James Harris came up with the pogo stick idea, testing out a prototype in his dirt driveway with a plastic cup and an air compressor. “Now instead of worrying about how to anchor a spacecraft to an asteroid,” said Richard Kuhns, the program manager for   at Lockheed Martin Space Systems, “in almost no gravity, you get to gently touch it, take your sample and then back away. Much, much safer for a spacecraft in that environment. ” On Bennu’s surface, the pull of gravity may be somewhere from    to   as that of Earth’s, depending on the location. That means the spacecraft, about 3, 000 pounds while awaiting launch, will probably weigh less than an ounce as it nudges Bennu to collect the rock. When the team added instruments to make detailed measurements of Bennu before grabbing the sample, Dr. Lauretta tacked Rex (Regolith Explorer) on to the name, because of the connotation with Tyrannosaurus rex and dinosaurs. “We wanted that connection,” Dr. Lauretta said. NASA selected   in May 2011, four months before Dr. Drake died after receiving a diagnosis of liver cancer and a liver transplant. Dr. Lauretta was promoted to Dr. Drake’s position on the mission. Now, Dr. Lauretta is looking forward to three moments of  ’s journey. The first is when the spacecraft takes its first clear photograph of Bennu. “That is the moment of truth, what we are up against,” he said. The second is when the   grabs the bits of Bennu, and the third is when the sample arrives back on Earth, seven years from now.",0
17849,Judge Aaron Persky Under Fire for Sentencing in Stanford Rape Case - The New York Times,"A California judge harshly criticized for giving what many say is a   sentence to a former Stanford student convicted of sexual assault has been bombarded by threats of violence against him and his family, an official said on Tuesday. The judge, Aaron Persky, 54, on Thursday sentenced the former student, Brock Allen Turner, 20, to six months in jail for three felony counts: intent to commit rape, sexual penetration with a foreign object of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration with a foreign object of an unconscious person. Threatening phone calls have flooded into the Santa Clara County Superior Court since then, said Gary Goodman, a supervising attorney for the county public defender’s office. “People have been calling the court and leaving messages, and if someone answers, they say, ‘Tell your judge he can go to hell, and I hope his kids get raped and he rots in hell,’ ” said Mr. Goodman, who has defended the judge. “He’s getting threats over this, him and his family, from all over the country. Is that right?” Here is what we know about the jurist. • A former corporate lawyer and former criminal prosecutor who was appointed to the Santa Clara County Superior Court by Gov. Gray Davis in 2003, according to the Santa Clara County Bar Association. The judge is up for election this year but is running unopposed. • A Stanford alumnus. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the university, he was the captain of the men’s lacrosse team, according to a 2002 article in The Stanford Daily. • While campaigning for a judgeship in 2002, he wrote a biography for the League of Women Voters of California that championed his work as a prosecutor in cases involving violent sex crimes and hate crimes. “I focus on the prosecution of sexually violent predators, working to keep the most dangerous sex offenders in custody in mental hospitals,” he wrote. If elected, he said, his top priorities would be “honesty and integrity” and “equal access to justice for all. ” (He lost the election and was later appointed to the bench.) • He said he served as a member of the executive committee of the Support Network for Battered Women and the Santa Clara County Network for a   Community. • The judge handed down a   sentence and three years probation to Mr. Turner, a champion swimmer convicted in March of attacking the    woman behind a Dumpster on campus in 2015. The victim, who was not a Stanford student, had attended a fraternity party. Two graduate students riding past the Kappa Alpha fraternity house witnessed the assault and intervened to stop it one chased and tackled Mr. Turner when he fled. “We saw that she was not moving, while he was moving a lot,” one of the students, Carl Frederik Arndt, told the Swedish news outlet Expressen on Tuesday. “She was unconscious the entire time,” Mr. Arndt also told CBS News. “The guy ran away, and my friend Peter chased after him. ” • The case attracted national attention on Friday after BuzzFeed published a powerful   courtroom statement by the victim, who detailed the horror of that night and asserted that male and class privilege had irrevocably marred the trial and the sentencing. “When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen,” she wrote. She called the students who held her attacker until the police arrived her “heroes. ” But of Mr. Turner, she said: “You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. The damage is done no one can undo it. ” Her letter was also released by Santa Clara County. • The furor grew after Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor and sociologist, tweeted a statement by the defendant’s father complaining that his son’s life had been ruined for “20 minutes of action. ” • Judge Persky was also excoriated for his comments about the defendant. In citing factors he weighed in the sentencing, The Guardian reported, the judge said Mr. Turner had “less moral culpability” for his actions because he was intoxicated, and he had “no significant record of prior criminal offenses. ” The judge also appeared to suggest that the jail sentence might be an “antidote” to the anxiety the former student may have suffered from the intense media attention. He told the courtroom, according to reports: “A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him. I think he will not be a danger to others. ” And seeming to accept the defendant’s account (Mr. Turner said the victim consented) the judge said: “I take him at his word that subjectively that’s his version of his events.   …     I’m not convinced that his lack of complete acquiescence to the verdict should count against him. ” Because of his conviction, Mr. Turner must register as a sex offender. In his courtroom statement, obtained by The New York Times, he cited the university’s “party culture” and drinking as factors in the sexual assault. • Besides a flood of critical comments online against the judge, Professor Dauber, a friend of the victim’s family, said that she was part of an organization seeking to recall him. She said because the judge had no opponent and will be “automatically  ” in November, the recall campaign was the only way to remove him. (Judge Persky won his race in the California primary Tuesday.) She said his ruling had made female college students unsafe and cited what she called the judge’s misapplication of the law in taking Mr. Turner’s age, academic achievement and alcohol consumption into consideration. “If you’re going to declare that a   perpetrator is an unusual case, then you’re saying to women on college campuses that they don’t deserve the full protection of the law in the state of California,” the professor said. • A Change. org petition backing the judge’s removal had collected more than 400, 000 signatures by Tuesday. In order to successfully remove the judge, the recall campaign said it would need the signatures of at least 20 percent of the votes cast in November in Santa Clara County. • On Tuesday, lawmakers weighed in: Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who prosecuted sexual assault cases as a lawyer, said the sentence didn’t appear to provide adequate punishment, according to The Hill. “Typically, that would be considered an inappropriate sentence,” she said. The office of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said that a “short sentence sends the wrong message. ” (The senators have lobbied fellow legislators to change how the military handles sexual assault cases.) • The Stanford Daily said the judge’s decision had outraged campus groups. Students were being urged to join a demonstration during the traditional university graduation procession that kicks off commencement on Sunday. • The Santa Clara County district attorney, Jeff Rosen, whose office tried the Stanford rape case, said in a statement on Monday, “While I strongly disagree with the sentence that Judge Persky issued in the Brock Turner case, I do not believe he should be removed from his judgeship. ” • Molly O’Neal, the Santa Clara County public defender, said she was “alarmed by the hysteria” surrounding Mr. Turner’s sentence. “The judge is required under California law to consider certain mitigating and aggravating factors,” she said, including past criminal records and the presence of alcohol. “We need to be very careful we’re not hanging judges out to dry based on one decision, especially because he is considered to be a fair and   judge,” she said. • Mr. Goodman, the deputy public defender, said he had worked with the judge for three decades and denounced the proposed recall. He said Judge Persky was “an exceptional jurist” who had accurately followed the relevant rules and statutes and formulated the sentence in consultation with the probation department. “You have to judge a case on its merits only,” Mr. Goodman said. “The narrative on social media is ‘We have to judge this case as part of the larger social issue of campus sexual abuse,’ but as a judge, he is not allowed to do that. ” He rejected the argument that race or social class had played any role in Mr. Turner’s sentence. “People say it’s because he’s a Stanford kid and he’s rich and the judge played lacrosse. No, it’s not done that way. It can’t be done that way,” Mr. Goodman added. “It would have been the exact same result for a person of color. ”",0

17851,Hawaii Lawmakers Ask State to Prepare for North Korea Missile Attack,"Lawmakers in Hawaii have asked state officials to update contingency plans and provide extra funding in anticipation of an attack from North Korea, amid escalating tensions between America and the communist state. [Last Thursday, the state’s House Public Safety Committee passed a resolution demanding extra resources for any potential attack, which includes the redevelopment of shelters last used during the Cold War.  Amongst other things, the resolution asks for the “restocking of fallout shelter provisions,” as well as calling on authorities to “conduct public awareness campaigns to ready the public for a nuclear disaster. ” “At a time when we have this kind of   and really blustering foreign policy, it does make people a little nervous,” said House Public Safety Committee Vice Chairman Matt LePresti. “They haven’t been updated since 1985. I was 11 years old when they were last updated. Many of the buildings that are on the fallout shelter list don’t exist anymore. ” Many experts have warned that Hawaii may be the first point of any potential North Korean attack, with its location in the   ocean far more reachable than the American west coast. The remote island is located 4, 660 miles from North Korea, while Los Angeles remains approximately 5, 800 miles in distance. An analysis carried by the BBC suggests that North Korea possesses over 1, 000 missiles, all with ranging capabilities. Some of their weapons, including the   ballistic missile, have an intercontinental range, meaning they can travel up to 5000 miles, just short of the American coastline. The request comes amidst rising tensions between the U. S. and North Korea, with Donald Trump warning last week that he was sending “an armada” into the region to fend off any potential threat. Meanwhile, on Sunday, North Korean forces held a military parade to celebrate the 105th birthday of former leader Kim   who remains the country’s “eternal leader. ” However, reports from South Korea also indicated that the country’s planned missile launch, intended to be a show of strength, ended in failure. On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence visited the Korean demilitarized zone, also the border between South and North. In an interview with CNN, Pence said that “the people in North Korea should make no mistake that the United States of America and our allies will see to the security of this region and see to the security of the people of our country. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
17852,Amazon to Shelter Homeless in Seattle HQ - Breitbart,"Amazon announced on Wednesday that it would build a homeless shelter inside of its Seattle HQ, donating nearly 50, 000 square feet to the project. [65 rooms will be built for the shelter, which is being planned in partnership with nonprofit organization Mary’s Place, providing space for more than 200 homeless people every night.  “Mary’s Place does incredible,   work every day for women, children, and families experiencing homelessness in the Seattle community,” said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. “We are lucky to count them as neighbors and thrilled to offer them a permanent home within our downtown Seattle headquarters. ” According to CNN, “The new Mary’s Place shelter will open in early 2020. It will also have a resource center like those the nonprofit offers in North Seattle and White Center, where   local nonprofits and volunteers work with staff to help families obtain employment and permanent housing. ” In 2016, Amazon partnered with Mary’s Place to temporarily house 200 homeless people in an empty building on its Seattle campus. Since last year, Amazon customers have also been able to order items from the Mary’s Place wishlist, “such as diapers and socks. ” “To have a permanent downtown Seattle location within Amazon is a   for Mary’s Place and the families we serve,” declared Marty Hartman, Executive Director of Mary’s Place. “We’ve loved being Amazon’s neighbor, and now the opportunity to move into their headquarters permanently is truly a dream come true. This unique,     shelter will remind families that they matter and that their community wants to help them succeed. ” “Amazon employees are frequent visitors and volunteers at the existing shelter  —   bringing meals, organizing arts and crafts projects, throwing parties for the families, and more,” claimed the nonprofit group in a blog post. “By sharing permanent space with Mary’s Place, Amazon employees will now have even more opportunities to volunteer and support the organization and the families they serve. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

17853,Lawyer for Melania Trump Threatens Defamation Suits Against News Outlets - The New York Times,"A lawyer for Melania Trump said Monday that he had informed several news organizations, including The Daily Mail, that they could face legal action for publishing articles that Ms. Trump contended were defamatory. In an email, the lawyer, Charles J. Harder, said Ms. Trump, the wife of Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, “has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an ‘escort’ in the 1990s. ” “All such statements are 100 percent false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful,” Mr. Harder added. “She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency. ” He said no suit had been filed, but added, “That may change. ” The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Harder represented the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan in the    lawsuit against Gawker Media that ultimately resulted in Gawker’s filing for bankruptcy. Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur who spoke in July at the Republican National Convention, acknowledged in May that he had secretly funded the Hogan case and others against Gawker. Among the news outlets that Mr. Harder said had been sent notices were Inquisitr (which apologized to Ms. Trump and retracted an article about her that was published within the last week) Politico and Liberal America. Politico declined to comment. Reached by telephone, Tiffany Willis, the founder and editor in chief of Liberal America, said her publication received an emailed letter from Mr. Harder. In the email, a copy of which is posted on the publication’s website, Mr. Harder listed several statements he claimed were defamatory and demanded that the publication “immediately and permanently remove each of these statements from the story, and print a full and complete retraction and apology, with as prominent placement as the original story. ” “Failure to do so,” Mr. Harder added, “will leave my client with no alternative but to institute immediate legal proceedings against you and, should that occur, she would pursue all available causes of action and seek all available legal remedies to the maximum extent permitted by law. ”",0

17855,"Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Maced, Hit with Rubber Bullets in Standoff Over Ancestral Land","Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Maced, Hit with Rubber Bullets in Standoff Over Ancestral Land Posted on Nov 3, 2016 
By Emma Niles 
Tensions flared again Wednesday between North Dakota law enforcement and protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline. Filmmaker and activist Josh Fox was at the scene of the violent confrontation, where journalist Erin Schrode, among others, was shot with a rubber bullet at the front lines of the protest. 
“This is an insane situation,” Fox begins in a video streamed live to his Facebook page after the confrontation. “We had a line of peaceful water protectors in the water, up to their waists, who were freezing cold. Those people were standing in front of a line of police, the police were occupying treaty land—not their land. Police were there with riot gear on, with shotguns, with rubber bullets, with mace, with pepper spray.” 
According to NBC , Wednesday’s conflict took place at Cantapeta Creek, which runs just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. Protesters grew agitated when police “dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site.” The “sacred site” refers to the hilltop across the creek where Standing Rock Sioux tribal ancestors are buried. 
The Young Turks network shared a brief video highlighting the escalating tensions: 
“This is land that is theirs, per the Laramie Treaty of 1851 ,” Schrode says in the video above. “This is a militarized police force up against an unarmed, peaceful, prayerful people.” 
  
Women and children were reportedly present at the demonstrations. 
Another video, streamed live on Facebook by user Cempoalli Twenny, provides a clear shot of the bridge in question. Drumbeats and chants can be heard as several “water protectors” attempt to cross the river: 

In a separate video , Twenny says that while being interviewed, police “shot at the reporter” but were “possibly aiming for me.” 
“[A] sista reporter was hit [instead],” he writes, referring to Schrode. 
On Facebook, Schrode shared video of the incident, which shows her interviewing Twenny when suddenly she is hit: 

“I was just shot,” says Schrode, a journalist who has worked with CNN, NBC and The New York Times, in a Wednesday post . “Militarized police fired at me from point blank range with a rubber bullet on the front lines of Standing Rock.” 
She continues: 
My body will be okay, but I am hurting, I am incensed, I am weeping, I am scared. Peaceful, prayerful, unarmed, nonviolent people on one side of a river; militarized police with armed vehicles and assault weapons occupying treaty land on the other, where sacred burial grounds have already been destroyed. What is happening here in North Dakota is like nothing I have ever seen in my life, anywhere in the world. … 
It is inexcusable for the President Obama to say he will “let it play out for several more weeks.” It is unjustifiable for the Attorney General to not be here. It is unconscionable for mainstream media to not cover this. It is indefensible for all politicians to not condemn what is occurring here. It is disgraceful for more people to not speak out and show up to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney provided a very different perspective on the conflict. “In my 27 years in law enforcement, I have never seen such an absolute disregard for the law, or other people’s rights because of someone else’s ideology,” he states in a press release. “The idea that because you have a strong opinion about something means you can threaten, harass and intimidate other American citizens is just plain wrong.” 
Numerous video accounts show police officers firing rubber bullets at those standing in the water. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department released a statement regarding its tactics. 
“Law enforcement witnessed protesters building an illegal, man-made, wooden bridge across the Cantapeta Creek,” the statement reads. “Protesters involved in building the bridge violated numerous federal and state laws including the Clean Water Act and the Safe River and Harbors Act.” 
The statement continues: 
Authorities used less-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation. In one incident a male was at a boat and was throwing bottles at officers on the police line. A second incident occurred when a man wearing a gas mask, refused to show his hands, refused to disperse and charged the police line. Officers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers. No lethal shots were fired from law enforcement. 
According to the press release, one person was arrested for “conspiracy to commit obstruction of a government function” after purchasing kayaks and canoes for the demonstrators. In the past few months, hundreds of people have been arrested while fighting to halt the DAPL. 
“It was like witnessing Gandhi’s Salt March,” Fox says, “then suddenly I am watching people being maced, and I hear a pop and see that they shot Erin Schrode with a rubber bullet. How is it possible that from 10 feet away, they are shooting at   journalists, bystanders, medics?” TAGS:",0

These are important qualities necessary to achieve cooperation, mutual respect and to overcome pervasive stereotypes. I am honored and grateful to have two incredible cultural Ambassadors at our Fifth Anniversary celebration for the Carmel Institute. Igor Butman and Wynton Marsalis exemplify the best of cultural diplomacy and cultural dialogue, and help us represent the Institutes' focus on enhancing greater cultural understanding through shared common interests and face to face interactions. By continuing to emphasize the importance of these qualities to our younger generations and future leaders, we are making an investment into the future that will be paid back ten-fold over time.” 
Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the U.S. and Honorary Co-Chair of the Institute acknowledged the Institute’s milestone by saying, “We would like to congratulate the Carmel Institute for Russian Culture and History and its leadership with the fifth anniversary and express our gratitude for their support and dedication.

17858,Re: America Is The Loneliest Country In The World – Is It Because We’ve Abandoned The Traditional Family Structure?,"  America Is The Loneliest Country In The World – Is It Because We’ve Abandoned The Traditional Family Structure?   13th, 2013 
Of all the nations on the entire planet, the United States is the most lonely place to be. We have the highest percentage of one person households on the entire globe, and the average size of our households has been steadily decreasing. Studies have shown that the number of close friends that Americans have is falling, and we have the highest divorce rate in the world by a wide margin. So why is this happening? Does this have anything to do with the fact that America is abandoning the traditional family structure? Back in the 1960s, the “sexual revolution” fundamentally changed the way that millions of Americans viewed sex and love. By throwing out all of the old boundaries, many Americans believed that they would ultimately be able to have more sex and more love. Today, this manifests itself in a “hookup culture” that is constantly being promoted as “healthy” in our popular music, in our television shows and in our movies. But instead of this “hookup culture” resulting in more sex and more love, most Americans are discovering that it leads to just the opposite. We have become a nation of desperately lonely people that have very few real ties to others. 
Never in the history of our nation have Americans been so isolated from one another. Most people get up in the morning, drive to work or school, perhaps do a little shopping afterwards, and then drive home again. The rest of the evening is typically spent in front of the television or on some sort of electronic device. 
In addition, most Americans spend precious little time attending social gatherings of any sort these days. Church attendance is at historic lows , and most people don’t take the time or the effort to get involved in other types of social groups. 
And even when Americans do go out and try to meet people, the relationships that are formed are very much “on the surface” at best. The truth is that most Americans have very few “close friends”. Just take a moment and consider how many people outside your immediate family actually “love you” and would be there for you no matter what. For most Americans that number is depressingly low. 
In a desperate attempt for human love and interaction, an increasing number of Americans have turned to social networking websites such as Facebook to fill that void. For the desperately lonely, some human contact is better than none. In fact, a growing number of people are so desperate for people to talk with them that they will pretend to be someone else online. Many will even use an attractive picture of someone else in an attempt to try to lure others. This has become so common that this phenomenon has even been given a name. It is known as “ catfishing “, and it has grown to epidemic levels. 
Other Americans deal with their loneliness by recklessly indulging in food, drugs, gambling, shopping or other addictions. We are a fundamentally unhappy nation, and this is reflected in the fact that we lead the world in antidepressant use. In fact, the total number of Americans taking antidepressants doubled between 1996 and 2005. 
Could a lot of this have been avoided if we would have just fully embraced the traditional family structure as a nation? 
Wouldn’t most of us be doing a lot better if we lived in homes that were filled with happy, healthy families? 
Just consider what the consequences of “free love” and the “hookup culture” have been for America… 
*At 26 percent, America has the highest percentage of one person households on the entire planet. 
*100 years ago, 4.52 were living in the average U.S. household, but now the average U.S. household only consists of 2.59 people . 
*Back in 1950, 78 percent of all households in the United States contained a married couple. Today, that number has declined to 48 percent . 
*The marriage rate in the United States has fallen to an all-time low. Right now it is sitting at a yearly rate of 6.8 marriages per 1000 people . 
*Today, an all-time low 44.2 percent of Americans in the 25 to 34 year old age bracket are married. 
*According to the Pew Research Center, only 51 percent of all Americans that are at least 18 years old are currently married. Back in 1960, 72 percent of all U.S. adults were married. 
*In the United States today, more than half of all couples “move in together” before they get married. 
*The divorce rate for couples that live together first is significantly higher than for those that do not. 
*America has the highest divorce rate on the globe by a wide margin. 
*In 1970, the average woman had her first child when she was 21.4 years old . Now the average woman has her first child when she is 25.6 years old . 
*The birth rate for American women in the 20 to 24 year old age bracket has fallen to 85.3 births per 1,000 women . That is a new all-time record low. 
*Approximately one out of every three children in the United States lives in a home without a father. 
*For women under the age of 30 living in the United States today, more than half of all babies are being born out of wedlock. 
For most Americans, marriage has come to be viewed as a temporary agreement that can be abandoned the moment that it no longer makes them happy any longer. This “me-centered” approach to love and marriage has had a whole host of negative consequences for us as a nation. 
As the National Marriage Project puts it, a marriage in America now “depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses”… 
Over the last four decades, many Americans have moved away from identifying with an “institutional” model of marriage, which seeks to integrate sex, parenthood, economic cooperation, and emotional intimacy in a permanent union. This model has been overwritten by the “soul mate” model, which sees marriage as primarily a couple-centered vehicle for personal growth, emotional intimacy, and shared consumption that depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses. Thus where marriage used to serve as the gateway to responsible adulthood, it has come to be increasingly seen as a capstone of sorts that signals couples have arrived, both financially and emotionally—or are on the cusp of arriving. 
And our young people are no longer taught to value marriage. Instead, they are told to put off marriage and to go out and “have some fun”. This message is constantly being reinforced by popular culture. For example, posted below is an actual pro-Obamacare ad . Yes, I know that this ad is almost too bizarre to be true, but it is actually a real ad. And as you can see, the messages that it is sending to our young people are not very subtle at all… 
We have become a nation where “anything goes”, and most Americans seem to like it that way. 
So what do you think? 
Is America the loneliest country in the world because we’ve abandoned the traditional family structure? 
Please feel free to share your opinion by posting a comment below… What Are The Off-White Boxes That Are Going Up On Utility Poles All Over Seattle? » K 
The lack of family structure is part of it. But there is something far more basic, that has died in this Country. The dog eat dog business attitude, the money is the most important thing attitude,and the I come before everyone else attitude, All these things killed this precious concept. What is it? Trust. You can not have a good marriage, or friendship without it. Ask yourself, how many people you know, would you trust with your life? For most it is a rather small number. Sadly for some the number is 0. ISA 
o here. I dont trust, nor really care for, most any of you. I learned this in childhood, by watching the true nature of adults. Adult Humans are the virus of the World, of rotting flesh, that is a parasite. This can be proven empirically. Aston Martin 
Adult humans except “# Godschosenones?” because saying that all humans are viruses inclusing the shoes is # antisemitic? I see where you are going.. rbolo29 . 
It’s because of the apathy of realizing there is no God; so the children play and do what they want. Kim 
Probably why so many people attach themselves to their animals. I know people that treat their dog like their child. It’s because it’s all they have. ISA 
Some dont treat their animals that way out of loneliness, but a dog just makes a better friend than Humans. Thats the truth. Take it or leave it. Humans are rather crappy things. Kim 
Some humans, not all of them. Don’t get me wrong, I love my pet as much as anybody. But some people go overboard. A Dodgy Bloke 
I think a number of components go into this. A big one is the sexual revolution I have seen personally how it’s a great thing for guys but a disaster for women. The tragic part is most women don’t see it, the want the same sexual freedom as men, but ignore the damage done. The damage is kids with no father, and a woman who has several children by different guys. The woman wakes up forty alone, has no control over her life dependent on welfare but has ultimate responsibility for what happens under her roof. Everybody wants to be loved in one form or another. I think the culture produces high expectations in what people want or expect in a spouse. Men want somebody young good looking with no issues. Woman are looking foe the same, but some have a attraction to bad boys who they find exciting. People don’t get to and know each other before they wind up in bed. They get caught up in the newness get married and wake up one morning look at their spouse and wonder ‘What did I see in you.” But I have hope that the coming hard times will reverse this because people will have to adapt, or not survive. rbolo29 . 
It really doesn’t matter; because we all die in the end and if there is no God to save us; then it’s a total lost cause to even try to be moral and good. Some Dude 
fix yourself and become the change you seek in others for those others are all the reflections of the changes you made from within, granting them the permission to let their own light shine.

About to graduate from college within a short timeframe, this fearsome yet truthful article details some chilling events experienced in my academic career. Up unto this point, many of students within my campus follow a self-centered, selfish attitude, unaware that their destructive attitudes harm only but themselves. The idea of “STFU and leave me alone” concept continues to be pushed forth by faculty, peers, and the social environment. Having lived in the dorms, I’ve been through numerous roommates who refuse to talk to anyone, especially to me, stating that I’m too weird or someone who should just drop dead, yet later claim they have no friends and spend most of their time wasting it away, allowing their academic careers reach at a stag point. The same applies to my classes. I know about 70 students by name who will graduate this semester, but how many do I personally know and trust? Sadly, that number is zero. This is not because I don’t engage in conversations, but it’s rather the experiences that others around me only care only for themselves, while ignoring those that may be able to provide lasting friendships and improving the overall quality of life. rbolo29 . 
It’s ok; because they will graduate and find there are no jobs waiting for them; except being a manager at McDonalds. Jim Davis

The gullible femaleist women from colelge will probably go on dating websites to find elderly rich and wealthy men who are desperate enough to date goods which were expired a long time ago. 
I agree I had similar experiences. Most people had their own little groups of friends and never really mingled with others. I think the problem is too, many people don’t know HOW to make friends. Everyone is so self-absorbed. MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse

Cant afford it, and who would want to be married today? Even the boomer generation is throwing in the towel. If Americans can evolve, which they cant, then its over with soon. You all are still stuck in the model of 60 years ago, if not more, and are dying on the inside. 
Good riddance. Lars Lonte 
I totally agree with you – just compare Women from Eastern Europa or even Asia with the average Women from the East Coast or Europe (especially (West-) Germany and Great Britain as most US like states and cultures….there is a reason, why Eastern European men usually do not want to marry women from western Germany…. King Mercury 
Because American women have literally priced themselves out of the dating market! American women show that they want only guys with big, wide luxury sports Ferraris with all of the latest technology, gigantic mc mansions at least 5 times the size of the Home Alone house, three quarter million dollar or higher incomes, a growing number of them are even going for gangsters and thugs that get that kind of luxury through violent crime and illegal drugs. Jonathan 
Women are uncooperative, don’t care, too busy, incompetent at love and domestic life and think it’s cool to emotionally, psychologically, financially, and in every way abuse men and never receive any reciprocation for their bad behavior, nor offer any reciprocation for men’s gifts. The egomania in women has exploded, and the genie can no longer fit in the bottle. rwinkel 
It’s a no brainer. Lookup “hisanic paradox” on wikipedia. The abuse of infants in this country is an important factor in the rise of sociopathy and broken families. Infants imprint just like every other mammal on the planet, and American obstetrics is unique in its disregard for children’s dignity and human rights. P.F. 
America is in this state because it has turned to sin rather than YAHWEH’S HOLY LAW. Only in our LORD JESUS/YESHUA do we find fulfillment, peace, and joy. When people are filled with joy they share truth and love–when people are moaning miserably inside they become cold and detached. You can’t depend on people to bring you happiness first—you have to seek JESUS/YESHUA who teaches us how to love one another the right way, and then, and only then, will people know joy. america depends on itself to create its own happiness and you’re seeing the negative effects. Back in the 1950’s Biblical values were held strongly in the homes. That’s why you see your grandparents who were married during that time either still alive and married and buried next to each other. What you’ll see in the coming years are old ladies and men wondering around alone who are not married and who will be buried in single graves while the children carry on the negative tradition of their failed ways. Way to go america, you’re doing just fine. David McElroy 
Sad, but true, P.F. If it weren’t for hope in Jesus, there’d be no hope at all! MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse 
Michael David McElroy 
As the oldest of 12 children from an Irish father who stayed married to our mother, I can testify as to the merciless bombardments of anti-family messages delivered to us. My mother was urged to abort many of my siblings. Teachers and other “counselors” urged us not to spend so much time together, as we were “clannish”. I fell for the encouragement to go to college and make something of myself and “get ahead” before marriage and children. Even our church was discouraging, openly saying we took too much pew space and gave too little money. (Even though we physically labored to help build the building!) I went to college, became a journalist and, after a disasterous cohabitation I thought would lead to marriage, eventually a chaplain. But I also ended up an old bachelor who thought he would have a wife and grandkids by now. My computer is my companion! CollGen2 
You are a wonderful person. Your parent’s stuck together. That is the way God’s original design was. Your writing touched my heart today, thank you! All things will work out for good to those who LOVE God and are called according to HIS purpose. HE created each one of us and He also beckons us. He put an end to sin by being the perfect sacrifice on that cross. He beckoned me and I did it my way…..til trouble hit! I have a husband, 3 children and 4 grandchildren. I am alone most of the time at home, answering the phone for my small business. But, most of the time, I am immersing myself in the King James Bible and fellowshipping with my Father. He is the only one who will never leave me nor forsake me. How do I know that? I was in a coma many years ago when He beckoned me. I have tried to do things the “me” way but every road was a disaster until I surrendered my life to Him! The suffering I go through here is nothing compared to the GLORY that awaits me.”! Tim 
There are good, faithful men out there who want a family. David McElroy 
I’m with Tim, I was one of those guys who wanted to be a faithful husband and father. But I made the mistake of being smitten with a conniving woman who had no maternal domestic interests, being the “modern” sort. Jenn 
I’m sorry that happened to you. Not all of us women are that way, but many of them seem to be these days. :-( Aston Martin

Good. Why buy the book when there’s a library in town? godozo 
Ugly analogy. Knowledge is meant to be shared, women…not. Even the Founding Fathers and many of the old-school Robber Barons would agree (Carnegie anyone? He funded a nation’s worth of libraries.). 
Try “Why buy the cow when the milk is free?”. Lifelong Mates (both male and female) ARE a limited resource, and like milk is worth paying for to keep (or keep the flow coming, depending on the item). wombleranger 
I don’t like to be the one to say this but….if you remove spirituality and morals from a society you end up with the western world. America isn’t the only western power suffering this condition come to Canada where anyone with a problem gets a Prozac prescription and it’s free!!! We would be wise to remember the former Soviet Union and it’s devastation of the churches and religions. Now we must ask ourselves are we staring to become a communist nation? To quote William Penn ” .Those who will not be governed by God will be ruled by tyrants”-certainly is food for thought! A lonely mind is a dangerous mind. Eileen Kuch 
Very well put, wombleranger. Indeed, if you remove spirituality and morals from a society, that society starts to fragment. Just look at America today. It’s barely recognizable as the God-fearing nation it used to be. 
I don’t know about your Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, but Barack Obama is the worst Presidents we ever had. He’s hell-bent on destroying the old America and turning it into a USSA, a near image of the early 20th Century USSR, where Orthodox Christian Churches were devastated and the religion driven underground. 
Those who will not be governed by God will be ruled by tyrants – William Penn 
Great quote, too. wombleranger 
Thanks Eileen. It’s comforting to see there are still moral people in this world, now we just need to wake-up the good souls from the deep sleep. It’s an uphill battle to be sure, but as long as i breath i will never forsake my dignity, morals and most of all my God. nilro

17859,Embodying The Monad,"Embodying The Monad, A Session Transcript 
ES Forum Reference Link (Jan. 2011): 
This gives us the bigger picture and an understanding of why embodying the monad right now is so important. The suggested invocation will follow. 
There are two agendas happening simultaneously for 2012 and beyond. 
On one level there is a battle happening over the control of the souls here. The beings that are entrenched in the first three chakras are being subjected to more aggressive and more amounts of technology geared to break down the mental body. 
The algorithms that create the binary process of the linear mind meaning, how our solar plexus projects impulses that our physical brain picks up, that process is being interrupted with static, harnesses and mind control. If a person is not in their own power, they will be influenced to either be possessed by consciousness entities or possessed by forces that they act out that they don’t understand. This is the agenda of the negative aliens who are continuing to be aggressive with these technologies. 
As fragmented souls become more stressed out and engage in more negative behavior, at a certain point the body’s aura will include more percentage of that possessed dark energy. If a person is 49% light and 51% dark, that person will be sucked like a vacuum. A person that is primarily in fear or sick, they will get sucked down like a magnetic pull and it will cause that person to fragment. Their soul and seed atom will shatter. This is the metatronic black heart, which is essentially a reversal monad pulled down into a phantom system. The controllers want to destroy the actual crystal seed atom and have it be disconnected from the body. By doing this, they create an automaton, which is a body that is human but is not animated by any kind of soul , only a finite life force. 
Simultaneously to that, there are those of us that are in the light warrior family or the galactic family starting to embody new levels of our spirit bodies that are starting to be returned to us (the monad) and with that god technology and consciousness technology we are learning new ways to work with the technology and some of that has required new levels of dark arts training. 
We are attempting to embody as much of our monadic consciousness and activate the seed atom. As we activate the seed atom, we activate and change the pulse rhythm in the grid on the planet. So many areas of the planetary grid are damaged, so they are going in reversals patterns. If we can hold this base pulse rhythm, we create a circumference in an area where we can literally create a safe zone. We are being asked to create a safe zone by Guardian contacts. If we can embody this, we create a safe zone on the planet. The more of us that do this, the more safe zones we are going to have. More people are going to have the opportunity to be able to pick up the code they need and not get sucked down into the controllers system where their seed atom could get shattered. 
We must embody this consciousness and architecture and hold it in our location. Our location is never an accident. This is our assignment meaning where we are, where we are holding it is where we need to anchor it down. 
We seem to have a goal to get a lot of this done by 2011 and ongoing. We are trying to meet a goal of a certain threshold of healing by November 11, 2011, which is 11/11/11. At strange at it may sound, bodies are freed now and we need to get them to their rightful owner. 
Here is an explanation of the changes and adjustments that are happening in our bodies as the monad comes in and the Christ seed gets activated: 
“There are multidimensional centers in the body that are called flame access points and they control the neurological processes in the physical body and also adjust the brain nervous system. As the body undergoes adjustments in the heart chakra, I am understanding that particular part of the bio computer which is controlled by the monad. So this is the nervous system adjustment that is controlling the currents that work with the pulsation on the heart rhythm. And then there is the heart rhythm axiatonal line upgrade in the center of the chest and heart. The flame access points work with a part of the architecture on the heart chakra where these points come out of the heart and are a part of breathing the zero point. 
We the starseeded ones are working with biological prototyping and we hold these certain levels of architecture. The holding of the Mother Arc is that 13th dimensional frequency which has to do with the universal monad and the dimensional 13 monad frequency of the Mother Arc. Generally I note that the monadic core is the 8th dimensional chakra in the thymus area where this starts to open up and the crystalline structure of the heart and its function starts changing. Layers 1-7 are planetary. 8th and above layers are off planet, galactic, multiple bodies that exist in other planets and star systems. The monadic 8th dimension and how it connects with the mother energy, changes biorhythms and certain chemicals that relate to the heart function. 
The permanent seed atom or the Christ seed starts coming on line when the monad starts connecting to the body. Higher spirit body starts connecting to the body at the thymus level and starts adjusting the heart pattern. It causes change in hormones, endocrine, biorhythms like a domino effect when the monad starts coming on line. 
The Egyptians knew that our endocrine system was responsible for secreting hormones and those hormones were responsible for our neurology being able to perceive other dimensions. The hormonal secretions change our neurochemistry and then align us to the broadcast to those particular windows of the soul. 
The monad is the 7th, 8th and 9th layer but it starts connecting at the 8th chakra level which is the heart. When the monad starts coming in like this, the whole heart changes pattern meaning the heart chakra is no longer an astral heart, it is a blue heart. Your heart turns blue and the frequency coming through starts turning blue. They were showing me something new I have never seen before which is that blue connection to the turquoise of the mother. So the 8th dimension is a gold color but when the monad starts flowering in the heart and the heart starts to configure, it actually looks blue and they call this the living lotus. I call this galactivation. 
When our heart is healed, there is a fire that is ignited inside the heart that is accessed and the fire in the heart is also in the kidneys. There is a triangle that connects the heart into the kidneys. The kidneys are in the base of the triangle from left to right and the point of the triangle is in the heart. When the heart is healed, there is a twin flame ignition in our heart and kidneys, which shifts the heart configuration. Twin flames = structure of light within the heart. So two flames ignite in the heart. The monad is the greater flame and the physical body is the lesser flame. When this flame is ignited, there is an ignition in the heart and a fire coming in to the kidneys. 
How it impacts the 5th chakra, thyroid and parathyroid, glandular system, and secretions of the brain tell the brain how the heart and breathing rhythm work. It is a vast circulatory system including meridians, axiatonal lines, and the multiple levels of bodies of complexity working toward the physical embodiment of the Christ consciousness. This is about igniting the Christ consciousness eternal seed atom and bring that on line. The Monadic spark starts to connect to the seed atom, which is the Christ consciousness and our crystal body. 
This is the seed that the controllers are attempting to crush or stop from flowering in the human population. They want to crush the permanent seed atom in the thymus, which is the 8th chakra, which is where the monad starts coming in and actually connecting in to the body.”

Huntington.) USA Today argues: Each man spins a narrative for his followers of sprawling conflict between believers of Prophet Mohammed and followers of Jesus Christ. “There is a major war brewing, a war that’s already global,” Bannon warned an audience at the Vatican in 2014. A year later, Baghdadi said: “Oh Muslims   …     this war is only against you and against your religion. ” Each man proselytizes for this vision of war. A decade ago, according to The Washington Post, Bannon outlined a movie proposal based on the fear that radical Muslims will overrun the U. S. turning it into the “Islamic States of America. ” Bannon and the ISIS leader, USA Today argues, are also similar because Bannon is a “populist” who “seeks to upend the establishment and thrives on chaos. ” The editorial argues that the only way to hold Bannon in check is through “President Donald Trump’s    vanity,” which “could become a welcome force for peace” if he feels upstaged by Bannon and reduces his influence. USA Today printed a short opposing view, written by Paul Miller of the Haym Salomon Center. He points out that USA Today itself conducted an “exhaustive” investigation of Bannon’s past radio broadcasts “only to find nothing”  —   none of the racism and antisemitism that the mainstream media had falsely concocted over the past several months. Miller adds: Since   two administrations told the public, “Islam is peace. ” President Obama refused to even acknowledge that Islam, which means “submission” or “surrender,” has anything to do with the wave of   terrorism in Europe and creeping its way into the United States. The Trump administration and Bannon do not mince words. And the fact that terrorism is uppermost on so many Americans’ minds indicates a compelling vote of confidence for Bannon and President Trump, although one would be   to read that in the news media. In 2016, USA Today made an exception to its policy of not endorsing presidential candidates, and told its readers not to vote for Trump, arguing that he was “unfit for the presidency. ” Joel B.

17861,Muslim Americans Speak of Escalating Worries - The New York Times,"Muslim Americans, already alarmed by the election of Donald J. Trump, said Friday that Mr. Trump’s choices for crucial posts heightened their fears of discrimination, violence, deportation and even detention. Many said they worried that a more hostile America could prompt more Muslims to join forces with terrorists. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said “Islam hates us,” endorsed the idea of a government registry of Muslims and proposed suspending immigration by Muslims or people from some   countries. In interviews on Friday, many Muslims said that they were not sure before the election how seriously to take such talk, hoping that it was more political hyperbole than policy, but that the personnel moves of the last few days had confirmed their worst fears. At the Dream Cafe, a hookah bar in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, Sara Khan, 17, whose parents are from Pakistan, expressed particular concern about her family’s ability to remain in the United States. “What are we going to do if he tries to kick us out?” she asked of Mr. Trump. “People from all over the world come here to find freedom,” she said, but now she wonders what that freedom means if “one man can take it away. ” Mr. Trump has offered the post of national security adviser to Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army general who has written that “fear of Muslims is rational,” has said that “Islam is a political ideology” and is “like a malignant cancer. ” For director of central intelligence, Mr. Trump has tapped Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who has said that “most Islamic leaders across America” were complicit in terrorist attacks for not speaking out more forcefully. He has asked Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has endorsed a Muslim immigration ban, to be attorney general, and has named Stephen K. Bannon, whom critics have denounced as a white nationalist, as senior White House strategist. And some Trump supporters have cited the internment of   during World War II as a possible precedent. “I did not take Trump’s statements seriously enough, and I did not take these white nationalists as seriously as I should have,” said Zareena Grewal, an associate professor of American studies and religious studies at Yale. “That these people have moved from the fringe of American politics to the very center should frighten everybody. ” Hanan Hassan, a native of Iraq who works at a refugee center in Phoenix, mostly with people from Syria, said her mood and that of her clients had changed drastically. “Some of us are scared of being sent back,” she said. “Our children are having issues at school. ” Ms. Hassan, 37, who said her parents and her brother were killed by a car bomb in Baghdad, said, “We left home because it was not safe there,” but now the United States feels unsafe. Some voiced worries about a Muslim registry, and the prospect of being tracked and investigated by the government, noting that a registry for noncitizens from some Arab countries, in effect from 2002 to 2011, resulted in few leads on terrorism, but many deportations. Others shrugged off the prospect, saying that they assumed they were under surveillance already. And people were still unsure how seriously to take the even more troubling idea  —   not raised by anyone with a formal role on the Trump team  —   of internment. “I don’t put it past them,” said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council of American Islamic Relations. “Personnel is policy, and Flynn considers us as the enemy, so what kind of policies is he going to push forward? The Muslim community will be at his mercy. ” Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, said: “I believe in my heart that our fellow Americans would not let that happen. I’m not saying that it definitely won’t happen. The fact that we’re even having this conversation is really spreading a lot of fear in the community. ” Muslim leaders said their strategy would be to mount legal challenges and to strengthen alliances with other religious and ethnic groups. Muslim, Jewish and Christian clergy members and lay leaders gathered in front of mosque in Washington on Friday in a demonstration of mutual support. Mobilized by an interfaith group called “Shoulder to Shoulder,” they asked   Trump to keep his   promise that he will serve as the president of all Americans. “American Muslims follow the U. S. Constitution,” said Rizwan Jaka, chairman of the board of the ADAMS Center, one of the nation’s largest mosques, in Northern Virginia. “We call upon this incoming administration to also follow it. ” They refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump or his selections, and instead called on them to recognize that American Muslims serve the United States as doctors, teachers and law enforcement officers. They said that, contrary to claims by Mr. Pompeo and others, American Muslims routinely denounce terrorist attacks perpetrated by Islamic extremists, and have been credited by the Department of Homeland Security with preventing attacks by reporting suspects to the authorities. Usama Shami, president of the Islamic Community Center in Phoenix, said he had received an outpouring of support from   including some who came in person to join in Friday Prayers, and others who offered to register as Muslims if a registry is created. “All of that gives us comfort,” Mr. Shami said. “The problem is, in this day and age  —   this is 2016, almost 2017  —   we’re going backward. Make America great again? How? Having an internment camp for Muslims as they had for Japanese? Appointing Islamophobes for key positions?” Still, some Muslims held out hope that the Trump team may be more bluster than real threat. “He is a businessman, and businessmen have plenty of masks they wear everyday,” said Heshem Hassane, 42, an Egyptian immigrant who owns an ironworks in New York. He expressed doubt about whether the new administration would follow through on some plans, but added, “there’s no person who’s not concerned unless he’s isolated about what’s going on. ” For many Muslims, their fears are less about Trump administration policies than about a hostile atmosphere that they say could promote violence against them. The FBI reported this week that   hate crimes rose 67 percent in 2015, and Muslim groups say 2016 is on track to be worse. “Every day people are calling from all over the country to tell me about incidents and attacks, and I have to tell people, I’m not a Trump emergency responder,” Dr. Grewal said. “People are worried about their actual, physical safety, about attacks. People are asking, ‘Do we buy a gun? Do we get a dog?’ ” For many Muslims, the worst prospect of all is that members of their community, alienated by the political atmosphere and government action, could heed calls by Islamic extremists to carry out terrorist attacks. “ISIS will have more disenfranchised people, people pushed to the margins, to appeal to,” Mr. Awad said. “This is music to their ears. ”",0
17862,Turmoil Overshadows First Day of Republican-Controlled Congress - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The   Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in Washington on Tuesday, as the new Senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of President Obama’s signature health care law while the House descended into chaos in an   attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office. On a day usually reserved for pomp, constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses, Congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles. Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won   but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office, only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from   Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities. It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if they controlled both Congress and the White House. There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump, who ran against the Republican establishment, would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times. As Democrats in both chambers seethed, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the Affordable Care Act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring, even if any replacement of the law could take years. Budget language released on Tuesday gives House and Senate committees only until Jan. 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law. Under arcane budget procedures, that legislation would be protected from a Democratic filibuster and could pass the Senate with a simple majority. And debate will begin on Wednesday, before senators have even moved into their new offices. The dueling over the health law’s fate will pull in both the departing and incoming White House administrations as well. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will visit with congressional Democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal, and Mike Pence, the vice   will meet with Republicans to gird them for the fight ahead. While the Senate action showed Republicans on course to keep campaign promises, the House got off to a messy start, brought on by Republicans who had moved largely in secret on Monday to gut a congressional ethics office against Mr. Ryan’s wishes. That provoked an outcry from both Democrats and voters who flooded House offices with angry calls. “Every   organization is calling my office,” said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. “And we’ve told them: ‘Thank you very much. We appreciate your feedback. ’” After a hastily called meeting on Tuesday morning among Republicans, the matter was dropped before it could go to the full House floor for a vote. As the Senate moved to larger legislative matters, the House kerfuffle seemed to cast a shadow over Mr. Ryan, but he tried to brush it off. “There’s no sense of foreboding in the House today,” Mr. Ryan said after his   “only the sense of potential. ” The fight over the House rules was already acrimonious thanks to a piece of the package that would impose $2, 500 in fines for filming events on the House floor, a response to Democrats who streamed their overnight   over guns last June using cellphones and video cameras. In the Senate, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. swore in seven new members and all the incumbents who won their races last year, their colleagues looking on cheerfully, as a cold rain pelted the newly refurbished Capitol dome. Members of the House and Senate brought along their families  —   elderly parents with canes, small children tugging at uncomfortable lacy hems  —   as well as former senators and other special guests. Former Vice President Dick Cheney accompanied his daughter Liz to her   as a member of the House elected from Wyoming. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York officially became the Democratic leader and quickly warned Republicans that the minority would be vocal, if not operatic, in resisting much of their agenda and many of Mr. Trump’s nominees. “It is our job to do what’s best for the American people, the middle class and those struggling to get there,” he said. “If the   proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure, trade and closing the carried interest loophole, for instance, we will work in good faith to perfect and, potentially, enact it. When he doesn’t, we will resist. ” He added, “If   Trump lets the   members of Congress and his cabinet run the show, if he adopts their timeworn policies  —   which benefit the elites, the special interests and corporate America, not the working man and woman  —   his presidency will not succeed. ” On Tuesday, the House also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law. The budget blueprint introduced on Tuesday in the Senate is not sent to the president and does not become law, but still clears the way for subsequent legislation that Republicans say will repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans bypassed the Budget Committee so they could immediately bring the measure to the floor. Such resolutions are normally developed after weeks of work in the Budget Committee. Under the plan, four congressional committees  —   two in the House and two in the Senate  —   have until Jan. 27 to develop legislation that will be the vehicle for repealing the health care law. The document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved. Nor does it specify or even suggest how Republicans would replace the Affordable Care Act, which the Obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured. Republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill, to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for Republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law. The budget blueprint allows Republicans to use savings from repealing major provisions of that law to help offset the cost of future, unspecified measures to help people obtain coverage. “Americans face skyrocketing premiums and soaring deductibles,” said Senator Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “Insurers are withdrawing from markets across the country, leaving many families with fewer choices and less access to care than they had before  —   the opposite of what the law promised. ” The American Medical Association urged Congress on Tuesday to explain how it would replace the Affordable Care Act. “Before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policy makers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies,” the chief executive of the association, Dr. James L. Madara, said in a letter to congressional leaders. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who engineered the House passage of the health law in 2010, promised this week that Democrats would be just as aggressive in fighting its repeal. Republicans have said they may delay legislation to replace the health law for several years. Ms. Pelosi said that such a delay would be “an act of cowardice on the part of Republicans,” and that “they don’t even have the votes to do it” because they have not agreed on a replacement plan. Democrats also vowed to give Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees rigorous scrutiny. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the   Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, has written to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee chairman, asking to postpone the first scheduled confirmation hearing, set for next week for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump has chosen as attorney general.",0
17863,Flooding Compounds Pain of Tragic Summer in Baton Rouge - The New York Times,"BATON ROUGE, La.  —   Few can appreciate the scale of devastation and loss here quite like the tow truck driver. Since before dawn, Terrance Carter was up, first getting a flooded Cadillac out of Zachary, a town where more than two feet of rain had fallen in 72 hours. Soon after, he was hooking up a pickup truck abandoned by its driver during the floods in a neighborhood of North Baton Rouge, where nearly every house had the telltale brown stain up past the windowsills. Two hours later, he was taking a minivan through the charmingly named and thoroughly devastated   subdivisions in the eastern part of the city. On this tour of destruction, he pointed to familiar neighborhoods that looked utterly wrecked and nearly deserted, and to ruined houses of friends he was just now seeing. But he was quiet passing the Triple S convenience store. It was there, on July 5, that his uncle Alton B. Sterling was killed. “It’s very hard to pass by that store,” said Mr. Carter, a    father of four who like thousands here is now homeless. He drove on in silence for some blocks. Then he pointed: “All this flooded. ” It had already been a long, painful summer in Baton Rouge. What was once a sleepy college and government town was hit in July with successive crises that seemed, at the time, to be the crises of a decade: citywide protests over the police shooting of Mr. Sterling and the gunning down of three officers 12 days later. What followed were weeks of talk about coming together as a community after a crisis. Then came the worst flooding in memory. By Wednesday morning, about 7, 000 people were spread among 37 shelters across   southern Louisiana, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. Later in the day, the death toll reached 13, and state officials said they were still searching homes and businesses after a flood that the American Red Cross described as “the worst natural disaster to strike the United States since Superstorm Sandy. ” In Ascension Parish, southeast of Baton Rouge, the local emergency preparedness director compared rescue operations to those that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005. “The sheltering effort is actually greater than what we saw for Hurricane Katrina,” the director, Richard A. Webre, said. The White House said that President Obama, who was vacationing in Massachusetts, had received a briefing on Wednesday morning from the FEMA administrator, W. Craig Fugate, who visited Louisiana this week. More than 70, 000 people had registered for federal assistance, the White House said. Nearly everyone here has been affected by one of the crises this summer, some by two and some by all three. Police officers in Baton Rouge have been working extended shifts of 12 hours each, even though, according to a department spokesman, the flooding affected “a large number” of officers. “We’re out there and we’re doing what we can,” said Sgt. Don Coppola Jr. of the Baton Rouge Police Department. In Livingston Parish, the Sheriff’s Office said that at least 60 deputies had had to deal with flood damage. “Some have nowhere to go,” the agency said on its Facebook page. The homes of the families of the three law enforcement officers killed on July 17  —   Cpl. Montrell L. Jackson and Officer Matthew Gerald of the Baton Rouge police, and Deputy Brad Garafola of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office  —   had made it through the floods, officials said, some damaged but none ruined. Mr. Carter had been asleep early on July 5 when his mother called and told him that her brother, Mr. Sterling, had been shot by an officer at the Triple S. The days unfolded and exploded. Mr. Carter’s employer saw him on television talking about the shooting and fired him, Mr. Carter said. A baby daughter was born a week later. Three days after that, Mr. Carter stood before hundreds at his uncle’s funeral service and recited a poem he had written, “Kiss From Your Nephew. ” Two days afterward, the three officers were shot dead by a man from Missouri angered about Mr. Sterling’s death. Mr. Carter emphasized to the reporters who asked: He did not condone violence at all he has relatives on the police force. The summer quieted until the rains came this past weekend. He had to spend Saturday and Sunday nights in a shelter in Baton Rouge with his four young children, from 5 weeks to 7 years, and Bessia Moore, the mother of the two youngest. On Monday, he moved everyone to his sisters’ small house, joining nine other people and two dogs. On Tuesday, he went to the house where he, his children, his mother and stepfather had been living, and found it and everything in it ruined. On Wednesday, he was back at work. “Somebody gave me the clothes I have on now,” he said Wednesday, sitting in the truck cab equipped with a pack of cigarettes and the last of his insulin shots. “Nothing I have on is mine. Even the shoes. ” This part of his story is not so different from many others in south Louisiana. It has similarities with Michelle Monistere, who had the minivan in Lakeview Estates, which like so many subdivisions in the eastern part of the city was congested with piles of ruined mattresses, carpeting, wallboard and furniture. It is familiar to Tasha Butler, who was taking everything out of the house where she had lived for 35 out of the last 40 years. “It was bad,” she said through a dust mask. “It’s everything. ” Mr. Carter was in North Baton Rouge, a struggling and often overlooked part of the city where he has lived most of his life, to retrieve the pickup. Discarded cars littered the streets. Mr. Carter recognized Ms. Butler’s house, having helped paint it when he was 10. “In time, it will be better,” said Ms. Butler, throwing another garbage bag on the enormous pile on her lawn. After hours on the road, Mr. Carter finally stopped for something to eat: fried shrimp and fish at the V  P Seafood and Deli. A local news channel was playing, and the police chief of a small flooded Louisiana city was talking of the coffins that had floated up from graveyards. “Even the dead can’t rest,” the chief was saying. Mr. Carter watched. He had feared this possibility when he was in the shelter over the weekend, he said. So he had walked from the shelter to his uncle’s grave. It had not been disturbed.",0
17864,Bob Bradley Is Out at Swansea. Round Up the Usual Replacements. - The New York Times,"There was a telltale line in the statement Huw Jenkins, the chairman of Swansea City, released Tuesday to confirm that Bob Bradley’s career as a Premier League manager was over after 85 days. Amid the heartfelt expressions of regret that are all but programmed into these things, the eulogies for the condemned man’s character and the best wishes for his future, Jenkins explained the logic that had forced his  —   and Swansea’s American owners’  —   hand. “We felt we had to make the change with half of the Premier League season remaining,” Jenkins said. “With the club going through such a tough time, we have to try and find the answers to get ourselves out of trouble. ” Jenkins did not mean that Swansea is about to indulge in a period of intense  . There will be no   at the executive level about the drift that has been allowed to set in at the club over the last three years or about why Swansea’s meteoric rise has been allowed to stall so quickly. Jenkins and his colleagues will not be asking themselves why the club has sold a host of important players, the core of the team that took Swansea into the Premier League and then established the club there, nor why they tried to replace them with a collection of waifs and strays. There will be no deep dive into performance data to try to work out where, what and who the weak links are. No, what Jenkins means is quite different. Swansea is not going to start asking any questions. It is going to skip that part and go out and find an answer. Or rather, it is going to go out and find a man  —   almost certainly a white man, and most likely one who in most other walks of life would be about ready for his pension  —   who it believes already has the answers. In Italy, there is a word for the manager who is called in when the warning lights are flashing and the fans are in revolt: traghettatore  —   the ferryman, the person who guides you through choppy waters to the safety of the bank. England  —   where referring to a penalty kick as a “P. K.,” as Bradley did, is considered dangerously gauche  —   does not have the word, but it most certainly understands the concept. A couple of days before Christmas, Sam Allardyce was confirmed as Crystal Palace’s new manager. Alan Pardew, the man he replaced, was a former player at the club, beloved by its fans, and had even taken Palace to last year’s F. A. Cup final. His arrival just less than two years ago had been treated as a considerable coup Palace had paid Newcastle £3. 5 million ($4. 2 million) to release him from his contract, and it had been only a couple of months since Pardew himself had explained, at length, why he would not want to leave the club even if he was offered the chance to manage England’s national team. But Palace was enduring a worse 2016 than any other Premier League team. The most lavish   spending in the club’s history  —   bringing in the likes of Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend  —   had not arrested the slide, and now the heat of the battle to avoid relegation was on Pardew’s neck. Despite his close bond with Steve Parish, Palace’s chairman, Pardew could not survive it. On Dec. 22, the day he was relieved of his duties  —   with a   payout to cushion the blow  —   Allardyce was summoned for talks with Parish. Those went so well that Allardyce, 62, took charge of training on Christmas Eve. It did not matter that Allardyce had been fired, just a few months earlier, from his dream job as England’s manager for a series of damaging comments made to undercover newspaper journalists. It did not matter that the Football Association, English soccer’s governing body, had deemed his behavior beyond the pale, and that it had been forced to part with him “to protect the wider interests of the game. ” It did not matter, either, that at two of Allardyce’s four previous clubs  —   Newcastle United and West Ham United  —   his departure was hardly mourned, or that his preferred style of play was polarizing at best, or that he only won nine of 31 games in charge of Sunderland, his last club post. It did not matter because Allardyce is a traghettatore, and ultimately money trumps what ghosts of morality survive in elite soccer. He is the man who has the answers. He will always find work whenever he is without it, work tends to find him. “We were fortunate that someone of Allardyce’s caliber and experience was available,” Parish said in bringing him on. That word, experience, is crucial. It is the same one Allardyce chose to emphasize when he was presented as Palace’s new manager: He would “get out of trouble, with my experience. ” The Premier League, more than most other leagues, cherishes experience. Swansea’s experiment with Bradley, of course, seems to illustrate perfectly why that is. Bradley was, by Premier League standards, an appointment out of deep left field. He had never before worked in a top European league. He had neither coached nor played in England. His résumé was eclectic, and his body of work, weighted with its context, was impressive: spells with the United States and Egypt national teams, fine campaigns with Stabaek in Norway and Le Havre in France’s second division. He was convincing in interviews: Jenkins, like Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, Swansea’s American owners, believed he was a leader. He was popular within the club, with employees and players. Jenkins meant it when he described him, in his statement Tuesday, as a “good man. ” And yet the results do not lie. Swansea has only 12 points from 18 games this season Bradley leaves the club in 19th place in the standings, his team having scored 15 goals and conceded 29 during his tenure. It was the latter that did it for him: not the fact of defeats to West Ham, Middlesbrough and West Bromwich Albion, but the nature of them  —   the visible collapses, the wilting spirit. Bradley had many admirable traits and a respected work ethic, but in hindsight that all seems irrelevant because he does not have experience, and only experience brings answers. Now Swansea, too, will turn to its own traghettatore. It is possible to, simultaneously, feel that Swansea has made an understandable decision and worry that English soccer is damaged by this tyranny of experience. Not just because the same old jobs going to the same old faces is one of the reasons that England’s native managerial stock remains so steadfastly white: Even a properly enforced Rooney Rule  —   the N. F. L. ’s requirement that teams interview a minority candidate for head coaching vacancies  —   would stand no chance of working when the only openings that come up would be inevitably awarded to the same   candidates. Not just because it places an insurmountable roadblock on any young coaches  —   either     or those working their way through the lower leagues  —   hoping for a chance to cut their teeth in the Premier League, starving a new generation of oxygen. But because, in encouraging that homogeneity, it locks English soccer  —   as opposed to the multinational Premier League  —   in stasis. Few clubs risk new ideas, new approaches, new voices those that do seem to lose their nerve with alarming speed. Maybe Bradley was the wrong appointment at Swansea, but that should not mean the league should write off all American coaches, or all coaches in France’s second division, or all coaches who have not previously managed in England. To believe that would be to condemn English soccer to the tried and tested, instead of the bold and the brave. It would mean a culture that is forever crossing from one bank to another, never actually getting anywhere.",0

17866,Vladimir Putin: Donald Trump's Win Is A Massive Defeat For New World Order,"Share on Facebook Russia is hoping for a “new understanding” and “restored Russian-American relations” according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be “encouraged” by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government. Via Yournewswire : According to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists' destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand. “The American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change.” Putin vowed to destroy the New World Order in 2016, and it appears people all over the world have started to wake up and resonate with his goal. The President is “ deeply encouraged ” that his determination to destroy the invasive organisation’s agenda is shared by people all over the world, and gaining momentum all the time. This election result represents the biggest uprising by the American people against the elite who run the country since the Boston Tea Party in 1771, and the New World Order controlled puppets in Washington are reeling. All of the elite – politicians, bankers, economists, celebrities – told the people to vote for the NWO selected candidate, Hillary Clinton . But the people are waking up. The people said no. The Rothschild NWO cabal will be pacing nervously in their mansions, wondering how to deal with this massive, unexpected blow to their globalist agenda. Their roadmap to arriving at a one world government – so close, yet so far away – has been thrown off course by this uprising of the people. In an annual press conference with his countrymen last April, Putin expressed skepticism about the American electoral process, which he believes is corrupt – elite family clans taking turns occupying the White House. He also hinted at how he personally saw Hillary Clinton. “First there was Bush senior in power, then Bush junior. [Bill] Clinton was[U.S. President] two times in a row, now his wife has ambitions. Again, the family might stay in power. As they say in Russia, a husband and a wife are the same Satan.” Neither side of the political establishment wanted Trump anywhere near the White House. The mainstream media were vilifying him. In short, the sock puppets of the New World Order were united against him. They have a lot to lose if somebody who isn't playing by their rules takes control – and their nightmare has come true. Do not be surprised if the mainstream media attempt to convince you of something deeply disturbing in the near future. Never in history has the NWO had such a firm grip on mainstream media operations. The New World Order controlled elites in Washington did not expect this blow and they will be a scrambling to take back control. Triggered by a massive popular uprising, stoked by wholly rational fears, and fired up by hard facts, America has regained its status as a powerful, sovereign nation. The people chose to make the United States powerful again, to take control of their economy, and make themselves respected in the eyes of the world. They have taken the bull by the horns and backed themselves as American. They have voted for advance over stagnation. It is the answer for our times. Related:",0
17867,Top U.S. General Praises Iran-Backed Shiite Militias in Mosul as Professional - Breitbart,"The top commander of the U. S.  coalition against the Islamic State ( ) has lauded the   Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) a predominantly Shiite militia umbrella group that also includes individuals who have been deemed terrorists by the United States, for their contribution to the ongoing offensive to retake Sunni majority Mosul. [“Before I got here, I read all kinds of things about the PMF, and I got here and I haven’t observed that behavior,” American Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander, told the Daily Beast on Christmas Day. “We’re not having allegations of bad behavior or misconduct,” he noted, asserting that the PMF have not endangered U. S. troops yet.  “Their internal and external comms are to keep disciplined and follow the orders of the government,” he said. “They’re saying that and that’s what we’re seeing. ” Townsend suggested the PMF, which includes members who have recently threatened U. S. service members, are no longer a risk to his fellow service members. According to the Daily Beast: The U. S. has ordinarily eyed these [  Shiite] units warily. But Townsend, in an unusual statement for an American commander, said these militias been been “remarkably disciplined” allies since he arrived. That assessment marks a stark contrast with his previous tours, when deadly   bombs almost hit his vehicle, and took the lives of many of his troops. Shortly before the Daily Beast report, the Los Angeles Times has recently learned that, marking a “significant break” in U. S. policy, the U. S.  coalition forces in Iraq have provided hundreds of weapons and training to hundreds of Shiite militias known for being affiliated with Iran, including some the U. S. has designated terrorists and may have American blood on their hands. Despite the repeated denials from the Pentagon, Reuters has confirmed that Shiite militias closely aligned with the Iranian government and the terror group Hezbollah are actively participating in the liberation of Mosul from ISIS. The U. S. military claims it only trains and assists Shiite militiamen it has vetted for links to Iran and terrorist groups, as mandated by law, conceding that certain fighters who fail the vetting process are still allowed to participate in the offensive. Townsend confirmed that the U. S. is indeed collaborating with the   PMF in fighting for Mosul. The Pentagon has previously denied on multiple occasions that the PMF includes members of the terrorist group Hezbollah, which has collaborated with other Shiite groups on the ground in Iraq. “The PMF did advance more rapidly than we expected and they’ve done a good job,” he told the Daily Beast. PMF fighters have been accused of atrocities against Sunnis but deny the allegations. Asked whether the United States had been “allowing” Shiite militias with bloody histories of murdering U. S. troops to participate in the Mosul operation, a defense official told Breitbart News on condition of anonymity soon after the offensive began, “We are confident in our force protection measures. ” Initially, the U. S. military claimed that it had only been backing the Sunni component of the predominant Shiite PMF, suggesting that the Shiite Iraqi Prime Minister did not control the Shiite component. Iraq’s Parliament has since enacted a law making Shiite militias legal and placing them under the umbrella of the Iraqi armed forces, though answering directly to Iraq’s Prime Minister Haidar  . It appears the new law will allow the Iraqi PM to break his pledge that only regular members of the Iraqi forces would enter   Mosul, the   city in Iraq and ISIS’s last remaining stronghold in the country. In addition to Shiite Muslims, some PMF members are also Sunni tribesman and Christians, but the large majority are Shiites, reports the Daily Beast.",0
17868,India to buy engines to install in Russian-made frigates,"india , frigate , indian navy Project 11356 Admiral Grigorovich frigate. Source:mil.ru 
India will independently acquire or build and install engines into the Russian-made Project 11356 frigates , India’s Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has said. 
After the Russian-Indian annual Summit held in Goa on October 15, the two countries signed an intergovernmental agreement on the construction of the frigates. 
Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin had noted that two of these vessels would be built in Russia, and two in India. 
According to the Indian minister, negotiations on the purchase of the frigates by India had begun a long while earlier but, because of the crisis in relations with Russia, Ukraine had refused to supply gas-turbine power plants for the Russian ships. 
Russia, India will expand military cooperation with focus on Navy projects 
“Now we will buy these engines ourselves and install them in the ships. The frigate will be provided with Indian equipment. This version (of the frigate) has stealth technologies, and we will participate in the design work,” the minister was quoted as saying by the NDTV news channel. 
India already has six frigates of the Talwar type – the predecessors of Project 11356, designed for export. The Indian ships entered into service in 2003-2004 and in 2012-2013. 
The standard patrol ship of the Burevestnik type is armed with Kalibr cruise missiles. However, as Minister Rogozin stated in Goa, the new frigates will be equipped with BrahMos cruise missiles, of joint Russian-Indian production.

17870,"Paul Ryan Calls Donald Trump’s Attack on Judge ‘Racist,’ but Still Backs Him - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the nation’s   Republican, on Tuesday called Donald J. Trump’s remarks about a Latino judge “racist,” an extraordinary indictment that generated a fresh wave of criticism and panic from other Republicans. By the end of the day, Mr. Trump was forced into a rare moment of damage control and said that his words had been “misconstrued. ” Mr. Trump, who said last week that a   judge in a case involving Trump University was biased against him because of his heritage, issued a statement Tuesday saying, “I do not feel that one’s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial. ” He added that he was simply questioning whether he was receiving a fair trial, but he did not apologize for his remarks, something many Republicans had urged him to do. Mr. Ryan said Mr. Trump’s criticism of the judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel of United States District Court, was “the textbook definition of a racist comment. ” But Mr. Ryan also reiterated his support for Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. “I disavow these comments  —   I regret those comments that he made,” Mr. Ryan said. “I think that should be absolutely disavowed. It’s absolutely unacceptable. But do I believe that Hillary Clinton is the answer? No, I do not. ” He added: “I believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than with her. ” Republicans on Capitol Hill faced an increasingly difficult task  —   giving Mr. Trump their support while still keeping their distance from his inflammatory language. While many Republicans, like Mr. Ryan, continued to affirm their support for Mr. Trump, others appeared ready to abandon him, throwing the once stolid party further into disarray. “I cannot and will not support my party’s nominee for president,” said Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois, becoming the first Republican senator running for   to break with Mr. Trump. “After much consideration, I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world” or to control the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Mr. Kirk is perhaps the most vulnerable incumbent Republican, in a state where Mr. Trump is likely to be a drag on the ticket. Mr. Kirk, who still speaks with difficulty from a stroke in 2012, also noted that Mr. Trump has mocked a disabled reporter. Others were close to following Mr. Kirk. “If Donald remains Donald, I will not vote for him,” declared Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who echoed Mr. Ryan’s denunciation of Mr. Trump’s comments. In a victory speech in Westchester County on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump struck a measured tone, saying he understood the responsibility of carrying the mantle of the Republican Party. “I will never, ever let you down,” he said. But Mr. Trump’s more incendiary remarks in other arenas have left many congressional Republicans facing a painful dilemma. Those who are on the ballot defending the party’s majorities this year need Mr. Trump’s voters to win, and risk angering them with any full disavowal of the nominee. But to continue to embrace him as he openly injects race into the campaign poses its own dangers. Even Republicans who have praised his candidacy warned on Tuesday that the party may have to separate itself from its  . Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who has met privately with Mr. Trump and been mentioned as a   choice, said “there could be” a line that the presumptive nominee crosses that would make him withdraw his support. “This is a crucial   or   period,” Mr. Corker said. “If at the end of June, moving into a convention and still not having pivoted toward being more of a general election candidate would prove to be very problematic. ” In private, the senators redirected their anger toward Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is Mr. Trump’s most outspoken supporter in the Senate. Senator Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican who is also in a difficult   fight, used a   luncheon to complain that Mr. Trump’s comments were obscuring the party’s economic message and urged Mr. Sessions to tell Mr. Trump to drop his jeremiad against the judge, according to two senators present who requested anonymity to reveal private conversations. Many Republicans hewed to a carefully scripted text in which the prospect of Hillary Clinton in the White House is presented as a larger threat than the risk their party may be taking with Mr. Trump. “What we have here is a country in crisis,” said Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, adding that Mrs. Clinton was not the person to govern in troubled times. But even that defense showed it cracks. Asked which of Mr. Trump’s policy statements he preferred over Mrs. Clinton’s, Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, paused for 11 seconds before saying, “I don’t know that I want to deal with that. ” Ms. Ayotte said Mr. Trump’s comments “were wrong and offensive,” adding, “He should retract those comments. ” Among others in a perilous trap are Senators Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, whose new book boasts of his commitment to civil rights Tim Scott, the Senate’s only   Republican and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, sons of Cuban immigrants. Their choice now appears one between their biographies and their principles. Beyond Washington, other Republicans were also not satisfied with Mr. Trump’s response. “Donald Trump should retract his comments, not defend them. There is no place for racism in the G. O. P. or this country,” former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said on Twitter. For the moment, Republicans are more focused on limiting the damage they incur as a result of Mr. Trump’s candidacy than they are getting him elected. Mr. Scott, who has called Mr. Trump’s comments “racially toxic,” portrayed his own party’s nominee as a temporary affliction on conservatism. “For the next several months, he will have the loudest voice, but the fact of the matter is there will be other voices speaking as well,” he said, not even suggesting Mr. Trump could have the party’s loudest voice for four years. On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell deflected numerous questions about Mr. Trump before saying, “ It’s time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message. ” Even Republicans who shied from talk of abandoning the nominee shifted their tone. Moving from alarmed to angry, the party’s leaders sent Mr. Trump an unmistakable message: He is hurting the party and must stop. Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who has also embraced Mr. Trump, acknowledged that the party may have to disavow Mr. Trump, employing the   maxim from former Justice Potter Stewart about how one can detect pornography. “This is one of those things you’ll know it when you see it,” said Mr. Burr, adding, hopefully, that he did not think the party “will get there. ” Dashing into a   luncheon of senators, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, called over her shoulder, “His comments are not helping. ” But Ms. Capito also said in an interview that in her economically depressed state, “there is a huge degree of pessimism. ” “People are looking for a message of hope,” she added, underscoring the attractiveness of Mr. Trump’s economic messages for many Republican voters. Mr. Trump has told his supporters that they should respond by suggesting that reporters who raise questions about his statements are racists, and to carry the message in various forms. One early supporter, Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, gave the technique a whirl in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. “You can easily argue that the president of the United States is a racist with his policies and his rhetoric. ” The conflagration over Mr. Trump’s remarks has detracted from Mr. Ryan’s desperate efforts to change the conversation on the Hill to focus on policy. But most Republicans agreed they had no real recourse at this point. “There is no easy answer,” Mr. Flake said. “You can write someone in. ” Mr. Trump tried to provide an answer to mitigate the damage. In his statement, he said it was “unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. ” “I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent,” he added. “The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. “I do not feel that one’s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial. ”",0
17871,"Modi’s Cash Ban Brings Pain, but Corruption-Weary India Grits Its Teeth - The New York Times","MUMBAI, India  —   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India, which came into full effect at midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off cash shortages that have hit the country’s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi’s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister’s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as “black money,” flowing through the country’s economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. “Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,” said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children’s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, “We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me. ” Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for   Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. “Trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,” Mr. Prasad said in an interview. “Modi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can’t tackle   problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones. ” Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Year’s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. “Today Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,” Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi. “As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,” he said, referring to Gandhi’s nonviolent resistance movement, “let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness. ” Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. “It’s a little bit crazy,” said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. “When I first read the news, I couldn’t even figure out if it was true. ” The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  —   more than 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. Modi’s   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India’s ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane. “If this move damages the economy, he’s in for a rough ride,” said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. “You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,” he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the country’s   life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. “In 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,” Mr. Pant said. “He was the precursor to what’s happening in the West. ” Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the country’s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax. He cast the opposition as “people who don’t want change, who don’t want reform,” Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said. Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1, 000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. “So if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?” he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. “We can’t shift to a cashless mode overnight,” he said. Surjit Bhalla, a New   economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said. Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. Modi’s continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. “So far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,” Mr. Pant said. “He thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don’t know. There are so many unknowns. ”",0
17872,"The Blessed, Cursed Life of Bon Iver - The New York Times","“What is left when unhungry? ,” Justin Vernon sings midway through “22, a Million,” his third album as Bon Iver. It’s one of many questions this    songwriter and   asks of himself in the course of the album. And it’s answered, in some ways, by the songs themselves on Bon Iver’s most diverse, noisiest, shortest, knottiest and most experimental album so far. Due for release on Sept. 30, “22, a Million,” is one more sharp turn in a career that has carried Mr. Vernon from   obscurity in Wisconsin clubs to festival stages and the Grammys, including an improbable detour via   and Kanye West. The songwriter and pianist Bruce Hornsby  —   one of Mr. Vernon’s avowed influences and, lately, a collaborator  —   described Mr. Vernon in a phone interview as “a soul singer who creates these unique and beautiful sonic landscapes on which to perform. ” Those landscapes have grown ever more painstakingly inventive. Making the album, Mr. Vernon said earlier this month, was at times spontaneous, at times convoluted and often uncertain. “It was a long moment, these last few years, thinking: What am I doing? What do I want to do it for?” he said. Mr. Vernon needed five years, three of them concentrated on writing and recording the new album, to clarify for himself what Bon Iver means and sounds like, now that he can count on a worldwide audience to keep him “unhungry. ” “I feel both blessed and cursed by the fact that I can do whatever I want at this point,” Mr. Vernon said in a rare extended interview in the recording studio at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, a gallery and performance space in Red Hook where he is on the advisory board. “I have more recognition than I had ever wanted to deal with. ” The pressure he felt was not commercial. “22, a Million” is a bumpier ride than Bon Iver’s previous albums. It constantly mixes distorted and manipulated sounds with natural ones, and it deliberately veers away from pop familiarity. But it also progresses toward solace, grounding its closing songs in steadfast melodies and consoling harmonies. “It’s important to me to not pay any attention to questions of, ‘What’s your legacy going to be?’ or ‘What are you going to leave behind?’ or ‘How do you work into the current scene?’ or ‘How do you relate to the  ? ’” Mr. Vernon said. “I find all of that stuff not only distracting but kind of the opposite of what it all means. ” Wearing loose pinstriped pants and a dark gray   that revealed some of his many tattoos, with a neatly trimmed beard and casually tousled hair, Mr. Vernon was by no means the introvert his songs might suggest. Affable and articulate, he was eager to delve into and at least partly decrypt his work. The polite   of his Midwestern upbringing came through, but Mr. Vernon battles excessive modesty. “I got in a friendly argument with Kanye West about the word humble once,” he recalled. “He said, ‘Have you ever looked up the word humble?’ I was like, ‘Actually I don’t know if I have.’ And he showed me the definition of it, and it’s far more   kind of the problematic Midwestern ‘Sorry!’ mentality, than I realized. ” He continued, “I took a lot out of that conversation. Ultimately, I think it’s great to serve others and everything, but I think there’s a certain point where it’s diminishing returns for the people around you if you’re not showing up and being who you are. ” “22, a Million”  —   the title reflects Mr. Vernon’s numerological whims  —   is the   successor to the 2011 album “Bon Iver, Bon Iver,” which sold more than half a million copies in the United States and won Grammy Awards for best alternative album and best new artist. Grammy recognition “didn’t change anything about me,” he said. “It did make me realize that there are people out there that really care about monetary success and recognition for the commodity that is music, like way more than I do. Not to say I don’t care about recognition. I like when people like a song, but I certainly don’t care as much as some folks out there. ” The first Bon Iver album, “For Emma, Forever Ago,” was a nearly solitary work. Mr. Vernon wrote and recorded it after the breakup of both his longtime band and a relationship, in his father’s chilly hunting cabin in Wisconsin during the winter of   and it was full of pensive ballads with translucent layers of guitars and vocals. “For Emma” quietly won hearts, eventually selling half a million copies. It also brought Bon Iver to the attention of Mr. West, who sampled “Woods,” a song from a 2009 Bon Iver EP, and went on to feature Mr. Vernon at concerts and as a songwriting collaborator on “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” “Watch the Throne” and “Yeezus. ” The second Bon Iver album, “Bon Iver, Bon Iver” was both more expansive and more ambiguous. Mr. Vernon built his own studio, April Base, in his hometown, Eau Claire, Wis. The music was still gracious, mostly     as Mr. Vernon welcomed a broader range of collaborators and instruments, bringing a lapidary detail to the arrangements, while the lyrics posed new riddles. In the interview, Mr. Vernon noted that “Perth,” which opens that album, and “” which concludes it, rhyme with “birth” and “death. ” The   continue: A song title on the new album, “10 Death Breast,” rhymes with “ . ” Mr. Vernon found plenty of distractions before settling in to work on “22, a Million. ” He toured the world with the large band he needed to recreate “Bon Iver, Bon Iver” onstage, an elaborate and demanding project. “I didn’t ever plan on having that much popularity, and being from Wisconsin, whatever amount that I could have dreamt about, I was not prepared for any of that,” he said. One thing that weighed on him was being photographed constantly, he said his face is noticeably absent from the artwork of the new album. “I felt very exposed, with scarred skin from the whole experience. Not that it was all bad, but it wore down these outer layers, and everything kind of hurt. ” When the tour ended, he turned to collaborations: producing albums for the Blind Boys of Alabama and the folky English group the Staves, and regrouping and touring with his    band Volcano Choir. He started and closely curated a festival, Eaux Claires, with Bon Iver headlining alongside its influences and favorites. And, gradually, he pushed himself to write new songs. Instead of having his guitar at their center, they largely relied on a portable synthesizer and sampler along with a customized Vocoder and thoughts of the heady blend of Duke Ellington’s saxophone sections one new song, he said, weaves about 150 saxophones into its mix. A turning point came when Mr. Vernon traveled to Greece, alone and  . He found himself singing the line “It might be over soon” into the sampler, hearing it as a kind of mantra that could suggest relief, loss, mortality or a reason to get to work. “The bad stuff might be over soon, but maybe the good stuff might be over soon,” he said. “So you’d better figure out how to enjoy this life and participate in it. ” Back in Wisconsin, Mr. Vernon worked like both a   and a   producer. He improvised with musicians in his studio, then culled snippets that might engender songs he toyed with loops and effects he let samples lead him to ideas. Where he had organized “Bon Iver, Bon Iver” around places, he decided to unify his new album with numbers. Each song title on “22, a Million” begins with a number that holds a private significance for Mr. Vernon. He has always been drawn to the number 22. While growing up and playing sports, he chose it as his jersey number he also, he said, sets   alarms to 22 minutes after the hour. As he chopped up the phrase “It might be over soon” in the sampler, “soon” began to turn into “two, two”: 22. The album opens with “22 Over Soon” and concludes with the hymnlike “1000000, a Million. ” “Being 22 is me,” he said, “and then the last song being a million, which is this great elusive thing: like, what’s a million? The album deals a lot with duality in general and how that works into the math. I was big into Taoism in college, and the paradox of duality, and how it’s always one thing and the other  —   you can never have one thing without the other. So it’s 22 being me and a million being the Other. That was a way to look at it as a circle. ” He also delved into sonic manipulation. “A big thing for me on the album was, how do we get something to sound accidental or new or fresh,” he said. When he was dissatisfied with the overly digital sound of “22 Over Soon,” he and his engineer took a cassette (Neil Young’s “Unplugged”) pulled out the tape and crumpled it and wrote on it with a marker. Then they recorded the track onto it, creating distortion and dropouts. Other songs toy with recording speed, ending up between standard pitches. The   that runs through all of Bon Iver’s songs emerged anew in lyrics and song titles that draw on thoughts of consecration, prayer and God. A spacious yet fragile ballad, “666 Upsidedowncross,” presents the singer as an uncertain pilgrim, musing, “I don’t know the path. ” The album booklet cites the anguished Psalm 22  —   “Why are you so far from saving me?”  —   alongside the song “33 ‘God’,” which includes samples from a gospel choir. “When you use enough of that language, it perks some people’s ears up,” Mr. Vernon said. “I do love those words, I love the word consecration, these holy words so to speak. I like using them in a way people haven’t heard before, or right next to a bunch of swear words. It’s just fun  —   it puts a smile on my face. ” But there was also a more serious undercurrent. He added: “For me from a very early age, music has been my religion. It’s been my way of understanding, it’s been my way of celebration, it’s been my way of contemplation. ” As Bon Iver   Mr. Vernon is thinking hard about  . “When I made the last record, actually both records, I very much felt like I’d healed myself,” he said. “Oh, I got done, and oh! now I’m better. And this one, I’m smarter than that. Now that this album’s done, as much as I healed a lot of things by making it, I know that it’s an ongoing thing. The river does not end. ”",0

C. said a video of the fatal shooting that set off two nights of violent protests did not offer “absolute, definitive visual evidence” that the victim, Keith Scott, was pointing a gun. A lawyer for the dead man’s family said the video showed his hands were by his side when he was shot. In another fatal shooting that has prompted anger over race and policing, Officer Betty Shelby, who killed Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Okla. was charged with manslaughter. _____ 2. Donald Trump, set to speak about fracking in Philadelphia, opened with comments about the unrest in Charlotte and, more broadly, about violence in largely black urban areas. “Drugs are a very, very big factor in what you’re watching on television at night,” he said. Hillary Clinton, who has called the recent spate of police killings of black suspects “unbearable,” had a day off from campaign events. But she did appear on the mock celebrity interview show “Between Two Ferns,” answering the oblivious questions of Zach Galifianakis, who asked how fast she typed as secretary, and how President Obama liked his coffee. _____ 3. Yahoo reported a vast email breach by an unnamed “  actor” dating to 2014. Some 500 million accounts were hacked  —   a number larger than the population of the United States  —   yielding names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, passwords, and in some cases security questions. Yahoo said it had begun notifying potentially affected users. Here’s what you can do to protect yourself. _____ 4. The father of the man accused of carrying out bombings last weekend in New York and New Jersey spoke to our reporters, clarifying the warnings he gave to federal agents about his son two years ago. He said he explicitly warned agents that Ahmad Rahami was interested in terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and fascinated by jihadist music, poetry and videos. “In two months, the F. B. I. came back to me and said he’s clean,” the father said. “They didn’t find anything on him. But they didn’t interview him. ” _____ 5. President Obama honored some of the country’s top filmmakers, artists and musicians at the White House, including Mel Brooks, above, Audra McDonald, Wynton Marsalis and 21 other luminaries. “We’ve got Terry Gross,” Mr. Obama said, referring to the “Fresh Air” host, “and a whole bunch of people who Terry Gross has interviewed. ” The MacArthur Foundation also awarded its “genius” grants. Among the 23 recipients of the fellowship  —   $625, 000 over five years  —   are a few relatively   figures, like the poet Claudia Rankine. Many appeared to be hard to categorize, working across existing genres, disciplines and institutions. _____ 6. “After what happened I had no short or long term plans, I just figured out how to get my life back together, to regain trust and hope that this world wasn’t a horrible place. ” That was the    woman above, one of 11 women who were brutally sexually assaulted during protests in Mexico State a decade ago. International human rights officials are demanding an investigation, which would sweep in President Enrique Peña Nieto, who ordered the crackdown as governor of the state. _____ 7. Scientists are warning of a surprisingly invasive species you may be familiar with  —   from your aquarium. Improperly released pet goldfish have spawned, swollen to the size of footballs, migrated, interbred with other species and become an ecological nightmare in places ranging from Australia to Nevada. So, the experts say, if you’re tired of your goldfish, give it back to the store or to a friend, or kill it in an ice slurry. Don’t toss it in a stream or flush it. _____ 8. Baseball fans  —   and regulators  —   want to know: What’s with all the home runs? A surprisingly long list of players are at or near 30 for the season, including previously unspectacular hitters like shortstop Brad Miller of the Tampa Bay Rays, above. Possible explanations: “juiced” balls, with   interiors, a rush of doping  —   or maybe just the game’s turn toward raw power for both pitchers and hitters. _____ 9. No less a reviewer than the novelist Richard Ford (“The Sportswriter,” “Independence Day”) offers high praise for Bruce Springsteen’s memoir, which comes out next Tuesday. Writing as one of “nine jillion” fans, he says “Born to Run” helps, as much as anything can, explain how the singer went from a New Jersey backwater to going “in front of 90, 000 people for   years in 40 different countries. ” He also says: “You’d think a guy who wrote “Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night’ ’u2009With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a   old Buick . ’u2008. ’u2008. ” could navigate his way around a complete and creditable American sentence. And you’d be right. ” _____ 10. Nine arrests in a corruption case dealt a serious blow to the inner circle of New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo. A former aide, Joseph Percoco, above with Mr. Cuomo, was among those accused of bribery, extortion and fraud linked to “hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts and other official state benefits” in economic development programs. The case, the latest in a string of corruption cases plaguing Albany and Mr. Cuomo’s associates, spared the governor himself. _____ 11. Finally, it’s the autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, so happy fall. And if you’re feeling a little less than fulfilled, here’s a lesson from one of Stanford University’s most popular courses, Designing Your Life. Try using the same approach that goes into making successful products: prototyping, building teams and bias to action (meaning rapid decision making). “The question of ‘What do I do with the rest of my one wild and wonderful life?’ is on everyone’s mind,” said one of the course’s two professors. _____ Martin Tsai contributed reporting.  _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

17874,"Dem Rep Clyburn: We Need ’Blazing Guns’ To Save Obamacare, Said Palin Crosshairs Map Was Aiding ’Terrorism’ - Breitbart","On Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” Representative James Clyburn ( ) stated that in order to save Obamacare, Democrats are “going to have to come out of the box with blazing guns. ”  Clyburn said, “We, as the New York Times wrote in an article, or someone wrote in the New York Times, we go into fights with knives, the other side’s got guns. We’re going to have to come out of the box with blazing guns. There was a movie or something called ‘Blazing Saddles.’ We’re going to have to do that if we want to see this law preserved. ” Back in 2010, during an appearance on MSNBC, Clyburn said that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s (R) map of some Democrats who voted for Obamacare that had rifle crosshairs was “beyond the pale. And they need to stop this, because, I can tell you, I’ve seen how these things escalate. People out there in the streets get their signals, or what they think are their signals, from the people in positions like we hold. And so, if we don’t disown that, and go get our people to move beyond that. If we participate in it, either from the balcony, or on the floor of the House, you are aiding and abetting this kind of terrorism, really. ” (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
17875,Huma “Breaks Down In Tears” After Receiving Text: Feels Like She Cost Her the Election,"The price of hubris has set in.
After years of assuming an easy victory in 2016, Team Hillary is taking the heavy toll as reality is setting in.
Human Abedin, under her own set of scandals after the brutal email-centric campaign, was seen breaking down in tears as she carried dry cleaning through Manhattan in New York.
Clearly, the campaign is not taking their failure to secure total power very well at all. Right now they are in the grieving phase.
This image captured by Daily Mail photographer Jae Donnelly tells it all – actually, there are many angles and snaps of this priceless moment at the Daily Mail :

According to the Daily Mail :
Hillary Clinton’s closest aide Huma Abedin wept openly in the street on Friday as she returned to the place where the Democratic candidate’s campaign was fought – and lost. 
Abedin looked like she had the weight of the world on her shoulders as she visited the campaign headquarters of the failed presidential candidate – after her own stumbles and her husband’s sexting habits helped contribute to Clinton’s historic defeat.
[…] The pain and emotion of the situation were clearly visible on the face of the long-time loyalist, despite the dark large-frame sunglasses that covered her eyes. 
Evidently, her breakdown was triggered by a text message, as the Daily Mail notes:
“Abedin appeared to start weeping after she read a message on her mobile phone as she made her way to the Brooklyn headquarters.” 
It is thought that Huma feels guilty for the campaign’s defeat, as the last minute FBI investigation into Hillary just before election week was largely due to the 650,000 emails found on her husband’s laptop, himself under fresh investigation for allegedly misdeeds involving underage girls. Regardless of the merits of either of the investigations, it may have taken Hillary down a final peg, just enough for Donald Trump to win the presidency.
Though Huma is taking it quite hard, she is hardly the only one upset.
Hillary Clinton herself has been reportedly crying inconsolably, and cycling through systematic blame against her surrogates and opponents, while lamenting her own loss of what is, no doubt, ‘rightfully’ hers.
As SHTF reported, it was the primary reason why she did not make an appearance on election night:
According to Ed Klein who spoke with a close friend and confidante of Hillary, that she did, in fact, have a serious breakdown and was in no condition to speak to America on live television.
The shock of losing after having been a “98%” lock for the Presidency was simply too much to bear. And as you might expect from a Clinton, it was everybody else’s fault: 
She was crying inconsolably. She couldn’t stop crying. And her friend, her female friend from way, way back said it was even hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard… her friend said she could make out that she was blaming James Comey, the Director of the FBI, for her loss, and, I don’t understand exactly, the president of the United States for not doing enough. ( Via Gateway Pundit) 
The question is, did Hillary really cast the bulk of blame on the loyal aide who is typically more closely at her side than even her daughter or husband?
Hillary has a notoriously dark reputation for (allegedly) throwing objects at the former president , castigating her staff and surrogates and demeaning the general public and even her own supporters .
We can only imagine how bad she took her rage and despair about the big loss on Huma.

17876,LinkedIn could soon be banned in Russia,"LinkedIn could soon be banned in Russia 27 October 2016 rt.com LinkedIn may turn out to be the first casualty of Russia’s Federal Law On Personal Data. The world’s largest professional network did not transfer its servers to Russia. Facebook network , law , society Networking site for professionals LinkedIn is the world's largest business and employment oriented social network. Source:AFP/East News 
The world's largest professional network LinkedIn could soon be blocked in Russia. The company has failed to comply with a law that obliges companies to keep data on Russian users in the country. 
""We are seeking a court order to block LinkedIn. We twice sent requests in the summer, but they did not provide answers to our questions,"" said Roskomnadzor spokesman Vadim Ampelonskiy in an interview with the TASS news agency. Apart from not moving servers to Russia, LinkedIn collects and sends information about people who are not users of the network without their consent, according to the Russian internet watchdog Roskomnadzor. 
Yakutia is where Google should store data 
According to the spokesman, Moscow’s Tagansky District Court has ruled in favor of the watchdog, but LinkedIn has appealed to a higher court. 
“If the appellate court upholds the judgment, and it will no longer be appealed, the decision will enter into force within 30 days. We will include the appropriate IP address in the register of violators of the personal data rights, which means blocking,”Ampelonskiy said. The decision will be announced on November 10. 
The watchdog will remove the ban, if the social network provides information that it has fulfilled the law and moved servers with data about Russians to the country. 
""This is the first company we are suing in court. In future we will use the same mechanism in relation to other companies,""the spokesman said. 
Roskomnadzor also told Kommersant daily that another reason for the lawsuit was ""numerous publications in the media about repeated leaks of user data from the social network."" 
Big Brother is listening: Beware 
In May, website Haker.ru reported the sale of 167 million stolen LinkedIn accounts, and passwords for 117 million accounts on the dark web. LinkedIn said the leak happened in 2012, and passwords have now been updated. 
LinkedIn is the world's largest business and employment oriented social network. As of 2015, it had 400 million users with 5 million people registered in Russia.

17877,"Study: St. Louis to Lose 1,000 Jobs After Minimum Wage Increase - Breitbart","“The true minimum wage rate is zero —  the amount an unemployed person receives from his   job,” Milton Friedman wrote in Newsweek 45 years ago. Two economists writing about the decision of St. Louis city fathers to boost its minimum wage come to a similar conclusion. [Dr. David Macpherson of Trinity University and Dr. William Even of Miami University posit in a study that St. Louis stands to lose more than 1, 000 jobs after its minimum wage skyrockets 43 percent to $11 an hour next year. Roughly 25, 000 workers in the city currently make minimum wage. The academics found women, teenagers, and those with a high school degree or less disproportionately constituting those at greatest risk for suffering (or benefitting) as a result of the law.  “It turns primarily on the fact that those are the workers that are most likely to be earning the minimum wage to begin with,” Dr. William Even told Breitbart News. “To a    college graduate, the minimum wage is irrelevant. ” A state law capped the Show Me State’s minimum wage at $7. 65 an hour. But St. Louis workers demanded that local government force businesses to “show me the money. ” A court challenge enabled the state’s most populous city to mandate a higher hourly rate for workers. “Some of those workers are going to get a pay raise,” Even explains. “They’re the ones who are better off. Other workers are going to lose their jobs. They’re the ones who are worse off. ” The employees affected, for good and ill, by the law disproportionately work in retail and food services. Automation, passing costs on to consumers, and simply doing more with fewer employees remain options for businesses. Most states impose a minimum wage on employers above what the feds demand. Dr. Even sees cities increasingly imposing higher minimum wages on their businesses, too. “If we look at the last twenty or so years, we’re seeing a lot more states, as well as local communities, raising the minimum wage above the federal level,” Even tells Breitbart News. “We’re seeing heterogeneity in the minimum wage levels in the states and cities across the country. San Francisco is going to $15. Seattle is going to $15. L. A. has gone up. St. Louis is going up. It’s a long list. ” The federal minimum wage remains at $7. 25, the amount mandated by a law passed during the first year of the Barack Obama administration.",0
17878,"Clinton “Fixer”: I Spiked Damaging Stories for Sexually Depraved, Morally Corrupt Hillary","Email 
Clinton wins “by a landslide” — in the corruption department. So says columnist, New York Times bestselling author, and admitted Clinton “bagman” Jeff Rovin. Initially presenting his story anonymously in the National Enquirer , Rovin subsequently revealed his identity in a Monday interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Among his striking claims: The Clintons have an “open marriage,” Hillary has had affairs with both men and women, and he paid off reporters to keep the copious Clinton dirt hush-hush. And these allegations are backed up by 24-years' worth of documentation. 
Rovin’s appearance on Hannity (video below) adds further weight to his claims, as people often associate the Enquirer with fanciful tales. Yet as Hannity himself pointed out, that paper has at times broken major stories, catching the rest of the media napping. Hannity cited scoops concerning O.J. Simpson, John Edwards’ mistress, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson’s out-of-wedlock child, Tiger Woods’ marriage woes, and others. In fact, Rovin said that such Enquirer stories are, ironically, “probably better vetted than most of the stories in other media” because they’re “so controversial.” 
Of course, the Enquirer 's scoops almost invariably involve salacious matters, and the Clinton story is no exception. Yet most significant are Rovin’s disclosures about media suppression of truth — and efforts to destroy people such as Monica Lewinsky. 
Rovin explains that as a Hollywood reporter in the '80s and '90s, his close relationship with the Tinseltown power set and press allowed him to become, as he put it, “‘a fixer’: someone who helps stars keep embarrassing stories out of the press.” Rovin did his job so well that in 1991 he was asked to work for a rising political couple who, together, were an embarrassing-story-disgorging machine: Arkansas governor William Jefferson Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham. As he wrote : I was informed that these stories would involve rumors of Bill Clinton' s many sexual dalliances and an alleged ongoing affair of Hillary Clinton with a male member of her law firm, Vince Foster, as well as a female mover-and-shaker in Hollywood. For a retainer of $4,000 a month — paid by a third party, not the campaign — I was told to keep these stories hush-hush in one of two ways: by trading access to the Clintons for “positive” interviews, or by paying the reporters. The payments were always cash, usually delivered in a movie theater or restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, and came in two denominations: $100 for a heads-up that a bad story was coming; or considerably more to kill the piece. 
Rovin’s claims align perfectly with the recent WikiLeaks revelations about direct collusion between the corrupt mainstream media and Clinton campaign; among the examples are a New York Times reporter giving the campaign veto power over quotations, a CNBC reporter advising the campaign, and CNN commentator Donna Brazile forwarding Clinton a debate question prior to a March face-off against Bernie Sanders (yes, Sandernistas, the fix was really in). 
Yet bribery wasn’t the only method for getting stories spiked; deception was another. As Rovin told Hannity, reporters “were paid to soften the stories.… What would happen is, if we got wind of a story from the tabloids, chances were pretty good it would end up in one of the mainstream newspapers or magazines. We would then contact one of those people and say, ‘This isn't true, don't run it.’” 
And this apparently does ring true to Hannity, who spoke of the evidence he saw, saying to Rovin, “I went through with your editor everything that you had. You do have ledgers; you did have the faxes with the letterhead and the timestamps. The Clintons know you…. They know you fixed things for them.” 
And Rovin says this fixing became a full-time job, as the Clintons committed continual sexual indiscretions in what he described as a “polyamorous” and “open” marriage — which matches the “open borders” Hillary said, in an e-mail, that she wanted. 
Rovin appears to believe the Clintons’ sexual depravity was so all-consuming that it distracted Bill from the business of running the country. He cites as the worst example of judgment the bachelor party in March 1994 for Clinton’s half-brother, Roger Clinton, who, in quintessential Clinton style, was marrying a bride eight-months-pregnant. Prostitutes were present, and recordings were made — they included Bill Clinton. 
None of this will surprise those who know of Bill’s having taken 26 flights on billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s “Lolita Express,” but the recording was a problem: It was offered for sale to the Enquirer , says Rovin. This is when he says he swooped in and negotiated a deal to keep the recording suppressed. (Note: This would be a national-security concern, too. A foreign power that obtained such a recording conceivably could use it to blackmail the president.) 
Also in 1994, Rovin “arranged a meeting for Hillary and a woman in an exclusive Beverly Hills hotel,” he said . “I helped her slip out of a back exit for a one-on-one session with the other woman.” The journalist described this encounter as “sordid.” 
Rovin also reveals that he was part of a “team effort” to damage Monica Lewinsky; in fact, Rovin later felt so bad about this smear campaign that he apologized to Lewinsky personally. In addition, the journalist “told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary’s crew rummaged through [Vince] Foster’s office … to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal,” as WND.com put it . 
As to Rovin’s motivations for finally coming forward, he mentioned two significant factors. He told Hannity that when he learned that Enquirer editor Dylan Howard was doing the Clinton story and was naming sources he wanted kept confidential, he agreed to participate under the condition he could protect those sources. Second, he wrote in the Enquirer piece, “I am coming forward now because of the endless attention the alleged indiscretions of Donald Trump have received. Nothing I have heard comes close to the sexual and moral corruption of the Clintons — many of which have [sic] yet to be revealed.” 
Having said this, Rovin was dismayed at the campaign emphasis on dirt, saying to Hannity, “The election is too important to focus on this salacious material.” Identifying as a libertarian, the journalist expressed the common idea that politicians’ sexual indiscretions are none of anyone’s business and should be beyond scrutiny. And while many issues are more important — such as Clinton’s internationalist, open-borders dreams; amnesty plans; warmongering stance vis-à-vis Russia; and radical social agenda — that common idea is also a mistaken idea. 
Question: Is there any sexual indiscretion a politician could commit that would bring his psychological fitness into question? What if a person habitually engages in bestiality? Would you want such an individual managing your finances or babysitting your child? If not, why not, if “private” sexual behavior has no bearing on whether the person can “do the job”? 
If so, however, then would you want such a person’s finger on the nuclear button? 
Now, what kind of sexual depravity is not a red flag? 
During the Bill Clinton years, “Character doesn’t matter” became a meme used to justify Clinton corruption. But would you want to be pulled over by a cop with bad character or have your car repaired by a mechanic with same? Character is integral to everything we do . 
The Bible speaks of “eyes blinded by sin,” “For the eye altering alters all,” wrote poet William Blake. Habitually engaging in wrongdoing and (as man will do) rationalizing it away — which is when we deny reality — causes us to lose touch with reality. Twisting the truth in our own minds twists our minds; conning ourselves corrupts our judgment. The eye altering…

17879,How Not to Be a Networking Leech: Tips for Seeking Professional Advice - The New York Times,"Businesspeople generally think of networking as a mutually beneficial meeting for both parties. But that’s not usually what it is. Far more often, it is one person asking the other for a favor. I have been a management consultant, business owner and speaker for more than 12 years. Before that, I was a business executive and a trial lawyer. Along the way I have received invaluable advice from others  —   guidance that educated me and helped me make important professional connections. Because this advice has been such a great help to me, I believe in helping others in the same way, without expecting anything in return. During the course of a year I receive numerous requests from people I do not know, asking me to network. I respond by meeting at least once a week with someone who is seeking advice on their careers or businesses, either in person or on the phone. In the course of these meetings, I have come across people who fall under the category of what I call “networking parasites. ” These are people who fail to understand that I am giving them information that my regular clients pay for. I am not alone in this. Doctors, accountants, plumbers, computer experts, lawyers and financial advisers all must deal with people shamelessly asking for meetings, free advice or free services or treatment  —   without remotely acknowledging that these professionals make their living selling that time and expertise. Over the years, dozens of experts have told me about being accosted at parties and on airplanes by strangers who ask for a free consultation under the guise of “conversation. ” Surely you do not want to be the kind of person who antagonizes professionals in this way. So here are some tips to help you avoid becoming a networking parasite. Make the meeting convenient. Ask for time frames that would work well, and meet at a place that is convenient for them, even if you have to drive across town. If they leave it up to you, give them three options and let them pick the one that works best. Recently, someone asked me to meet him for coffee, and I told him I could make “just about anything work” on a particular Friday. He responded with, “I like to start my day early, so let’s meet for coffee near your office at 6 a. m. ” I wrote back that 6 a. m. was too early, to which he responded, “O. K. Let’s make it 7 a. m. ” If you want me to pull out all the stops for you, this is not the way to start. Buy their coffee or meal. Insist on doing this as a sign of how valuable you consider their time and advice. If you are on a tight budget, ask them to coffee, but insist on paying for it by saying, “This is a huge favor to me, so please let me do this small thing for you. ” If you can manage it financially, try to meet for drinks or dinner after work. You will get more of their attention if you are not sandwiched in during their day. Go with a prepared list of questions. People whose advice is worth seeking are busy. They don’t have time to sit through your    thoughts. Figure out in advance what information you want from them, and send your list ahead of time so they can be thinking about the answers. Don’t argue about their advice or point out why it wouldn’t work for you. You can ask for clarification by finding out how they would handle a particular concern you have, but don’t go beyond that. You get to decide whether or not to use their advice. Don’t ask for intellectual property or materials. I am amazed at the number of people who ask for copies of my PowerPoint presentations and seminar materials to use in their organization, with no understanding that these materials are original and copyrighted  —   and how I make my living. Never ask for any written  . It is your job to take good notes during your meeting, not their job to send you bullet points after the meeting. No one should get homework after agreeing to help someone. Spend time at the end of the meeting finding out what you can do for them. Do you know anyone who could use their services, or who would make a good professional connection? At the very least, consider writing a recommendation for them on LinkedIn. Always thank them more than once. Thank them at the end of the meeting, expressing your appreciation for the time they have spent with you. Follow up with a handwritten note  —   not an email or a text. Do not refer others to the same expert. I just helped someone (whom I didn’t know well) polish her résumé and craft her   pitch. Then I worked my contacts and helped her land a great new job. The result? I received emails from two strangers, asking me to “network” with them, because the person I had just helped suggested they contact me to do the same for them. Ask an expert for free help only once. If the help someone offered you was so valuable that you would like them to provide it again, then pay for it the next time. As you ask people for help, always consider how you in turn can help others. At the end of each workweek make a list of the people you have helped, and the favors you have done for which you received nothing in return. If your list is empty week after week, then you really are a networking parasite.",0
17880,"In France, a Monument Honors the American Flyers of World War I - The New York Times","When one thinks of the First World War, which the United States entered 100 years ago this month, certain images are inevitably evoked: miles of muddy trenches, clouds of poison gas creeping over the battlefield, biplanes and triplanes jousting balletically above the clouds. If the first two sound like something you would have avoided at all costs, trust me, you wouldn’t have wanted any part of the last one, either. Aircraft back then were tiny and flimsy. Their engines stalled their guns jammed. If they had been flown even once, they were certainly grimy and probably covered with haphazardly applied patches. To merely go aloft in one was to risk your life, even if you didn’t encounter an enemy who might try to shoot you down. But you probably would, since there was no point in just flying safely behind your own lines. As for dogfights: chaos. There was no way to plan for one. Most pilots did whatever they could to get away from them as quickly as possible, which says nothing about their courage but a lot about their intelligence. Many, perhaps most, were not even issued parachutes. That we have largely forgotten all that today, and focus instead only on romantic images of fearless men in long scarves and sleek machines, redounds to a couple of culprits. There’s Snoopy, of course, but well before he ever climbed atop his doghouse and took on the Red Baron, there were the aviators themselves, tireless curators of their own legends. They were special, and they knew it they wanted you to know it, too. Almost all were highborn. Most had prepped together, gone to college together, joined up out of a sense of noblesse oblige but also a thirst for adventure. They chose to fly  —   went to great lengths just to get aloft  —   not despite the fact that it was exceedingly dangerous, but because of it. The romance of the venture was not lost on them. Nor was the fact that the eyes of the entire world were on them. It was, they firmly believed, their due. Proportionate to their small numbers, many more of them died, and much sooner, than those down below, who were subject to a daily barrage of explosive shells and mustard gas. And when they did die, their families spared little expense in commemorating them. They installed plaques in the French countryside where the airmen fell or, in at least one case, a cement bench that beckons you, explicitly, to pause, rest and consider the    life that ended right there. One grieving father left a bequest to the town that buried his son that brought running water to the place for the first time. Theodore Roosevelt installed a handsome fountain in the village where his son Quentin crashed. But the grandest monument can be found deep in a verdant park called Domaine National de St.  in the commune of    just outside Paris. This is the one built by the fliers themselves  —   those who managed to survive  —   for their dead. I say “for,” rather than “to,” because they are actually in there. Well, most of them, anyway. A total of 68 Americans were killed flying for France in the war that’s 68 out of only 200 or so who were part of what is known as the Lafayette Flying Corps, an unofficial designation that encompassed all Americans who did so, even those who later transferred to squadrons in the American Expeditionary Forces. (The   term Lafayette Escadrille applies to just one   squadron under French command most in the “corps” flew as part of French squadrons.) While all 68 are commemorated on the Lafayette Escadrille Memorial  —   an open gallery with a central arch that is said to be a   model of the Arc de Triomphe  —   the remains of 50 are entombed in a crypt directly beneath it. The whole thing is very French. The names of the dead  —   “mort pour la defense du droit et de la liberté”  —   are engraved on both the face of the arch and on its sides, where they are inscribed in order of enlistment.

The second time, the memorial had just completed a $1. 5 million restoration, the cost split   by American and French benefactors. The memorial was rededicated last April 20. It fairly gleams now. The crypt, though, remains dark. If you know someone who has a key, you can stroll among its sarcophagi, which look like marble but are   an impressive feat of trompe l’oeil. The 50 Americans are arrayed in chronological order, the first having fallen in June 1916, 10 months before the United States entered the war the last on Nov. 6, 1918, just five days before it ended. There are names that history and aviation buffs will recognize: Victor Chapman, the first to die, shot down, it is said, while flying oranges back to a friend wounded at Verdun Raoul Lufbery, America’s first great ace, with 17 confirmed kills and Norman Prince, a founder of the Lafayette Escadrille, whose father later had him interred in the National Cathedral in Washington. There is also a beautiful series of 13 small   windows, made by the sadly defunct concern Mauméjean, depicting some of the greatest battles of the war, and featuring images of biplanes, barbed wire, howitzers, early tanks and burning cathedrals. It’s a reminder of why these sarcophagi are here, in this park outside Paris.

17882,Los Zetas Cartel Leader Arrested in Mexican Border State,"MONTERREY, Nuevo León  —   Mexican authorities have arrested one of the key leaders within the fearsome Mexican cartel known as Los Zetas. The man is considered one of the individuals largely responsible for the violence that has spread throughout northern Mexico. [Over the weekend, Mexican Marines arrested Juan Pablo “El Oaxaco” or “Bravo 1” Perez Garcia, in the town of Los Ramones, Nuevo León. Perez Garcia has since been transferred to Mexico City where he is facing multiple organized crime, drug, and weapons charges.   The man known as El Oaxaco is considered to be the leader of the Vieja Escuela Z and Grupo Bravo factions of the Los Zetas cartel. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, Vieja Escuela Z has been waging a bloody war against the Los Zetas faction known as Cartel Del Noreste over lucrative drug trafficking territories. The fighting between the two factions has resulted in almost daily kidnappings, gun battles, beheadings, dismemberments, and other gory executions in the border states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila.  Breitbart Texas consulted with Mexican law enforcement officials who revealed that El Oaxaco was a corporal with the Mexican Army before joining the Los Zetas during a time when the criminal organization was the enforcement wing of the Gulf Cartel. While part of the Los Zetas, Perez Garcia was a Tamaulipas State Police officer and had also worked as a security guard with Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE).  El Oaxaco had been in charge of Grupo Bravo and along with Javier “El Shaggy” Morales Valencia and used the nickname “Bravo 1” as a diversion tactic when signing various cartel banners. The banners were routinely left behind in gory crime scenes to spread fear among rivals.   The now captured cartel leader also assumed command of the Vieja Escuela Z faction of the Los Zetas after the incarceration of Luis “El Rex” or “ ” Reyes, another original member of the Los Zetas who was arrested in the upscale suburb of San Pedro.  Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by Tony Aranda from Monterrey, Nuevo León and “M. A. Navarro” from Ciudad Victoria. ",0
17883,Mayweather ’Out of Retirement for McGregor’: MMA - Breitbart,"Los Angeles (AFP)  —   Retired unbeaten boxing champion Floyd Mayweather says that when it comes to a possible   fight with Irish mixed martial arts star Conor McGregor, he is “out of retirement. ”[In a posting on the MMA website, the    American said he wants to face McGregor, 28, in June.  “For Conor McGregor, I’m coming out of retirement, just to fight Conor McGregor,” Mayweather told FightHype, according to the posting. “Today, I’m officially out of retirement for Conor McGregor. We don’t need to waste no time. We need to make this  …     happen quickly. Let’s get it on in June. ” Mayweather had matched Rocky Marciano’s iconic   unbeaten career record when he walked away from boxing as the welterweight champion in 2015. Speculation of a   fight has intensified in recent months, with the US star saying he is willing to meet McGregor in a boxing ring. McGregor, however, is under contract to the Ultimate Fighting Championship series, which would have to approve any deal for the bout to happen. “I don’t want to hear no more excuses about the money, about the UFC,” Mayweather said. “Sign the paper with the UFC so you can fight me in June. Simple and plain. Let’s fight in June. If you want to fight, sign the paperwork, let’s do it. ” McGregor is on a break for the impending birth of his first child, a son with his   girlfriend Dee Devlin, who is due to give birth in May.",0

17887,"With One Castro Gone, Questions About What the Other Castro Will Do - The New York Times","MEXICO CITY  —   For half a century, as Fidel Castro transformed Cuba into a Communist state and sparred with the United States, his brother Raúl worked in his shadow, the authoritarian leader’s disciplined, junior partner. But by the time the elder Mr. Castro died on Friday night, Raúl Castro, who assumed presidential powers in 2006 before getting the official title in 2008, had transformed Cuba into a country that was unrecognizable in many ways  —   and yet remarkably the same. Raúl discarded some of the precepts that Fidel had considered sacred, chipping away at the Communist scaffold his brother had built. And in a stunning embrace that caught the world off guard, he negotiated an end to the   diplomatic standoff with the United States that Fidel had fiercely maintained. It is now solidly Raúl’s Cuba, an island where millennials talk to their cousins on Skype, where restaurant owners hustle for zucchini at privately run farms and where Americans clog the streets of Old Havana. Over all this, he has a firm hold on power, secured by trusted military leaders in vital positions and a new economic course of his making in which private enterprise plays an essential  —   but unthreatening  —   role. Still, Fidel died at a time of great uncertainty. Cuba’s regional benefactor, Venezuela, is collapsing economically. And many Cubans are trying to reach the United States while special immigration privileges are still in place. And now, after multiple rounds of changes by President Obama to knit the two countries closer together, a wild card has emerged: the election of Donald J. Trump, who has threatened to undermine the détente between the two nations unless he can extract more concessions from the Castro government. Cuban officials say they have weathered financial and political swings before, whether they were the American embargo, the collapse of the Soviet Union or the economic troubles in Venezuela. With Fidel gone, a lingering question may now be answered: Did the weight of his legacy hold Raúl back, preventing him from substantially dismantling the cherished system his brother had constructed, or were the slow, halting steps toward change a reflection of Raúl’s own desire to insert new life into the ailing Cuban economy  —   without weakening the structures of state power? Roberto Veiga, the director of Cuba Posible, an organization in Havana that promotes political dialogue, said that Fidel’s passing would “deeply affect people” on the island, but that it would not change the course of the country. “It will have an emotional impact,” Mr. Veiga said. “It will have a political impact. But it won’t have any impact on how the country is governed. ” “It’s a long time since Fidel was in the presidency,” he added. “Raul Castro has been leading the country for years. He has a team. There’s stability. ” Enrique López Oliva, a retired church historian in Cuba, expects change. While he did not rejoice in Mr. Castro’s death, he said, he found himself excited about the possibilities that it could bring for Cuba’s future. “It’s the end of one era and the beginning of another,” he said. “The death itself, we were waiting for that to happen at any moment. But now it feels like a new phase is about to begin. ” Some experts contend that Raúl held back true economic reforms because his brother opposed them. Fidel, some believe, prevented the Communist Party from announcing major new endeavors at the party congress this year, Mr. López said. “Now Raúl will feel more free,” he said. “The process of change will undoubtedly accelerate. ” Mr. López added that Cubans were eager for more economic changes because the increase in tourism seemed to have had the adverse effect of diverting food and other necessities to the tourism sector. Shortages are common, and frustrations are running high. Mr. López, who lives on a $12 monthly pension, said he recently had to sell two luxury antique lamps in order to buy food. “When I was in Miami, people asked me why I didn’t stay in Miami, and I said I wanted to see the end of the movie,” Mr. López, 80, said. “Now I am watching it. We are living a historic moment. I was happy to have lived through the revolution and happy to live through this. ” Raúl has shown a willingness to change course. Brian Latell, a former C. I. A. analyst who has followed the Cuban leadership closely for decades, said the Castro brothers’ relationship was once like a show. Fidel played the mercurial, genius director spewing bold visions, while Raúl was the producer backstage, making sure that the microphone worked, that the actors were paid and that everyone followed the script. But as Fidel withdrew, he said, Raúl was increasingly free to steer the production in a different direction, while retaining its spirit. Raúl has long framed his vision as a continuation of the revolution, vowing to build “a prosperous and sustainable socialism. ” It was Raúl who grumbled about the bloated state bureaucracy and corruption, saying the public work force had to be cut. “We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working,” he told the National Assembly in 2010. He replaced many of Fidel’s senior leaders with his own trusted allies in the military. He opened limited space for small private enterprise, introduced   salary increases and reduced state subsidies, publicly rejecting “three principles of Fidelismo: paternalism, idealism and egalitarianism,” Mr. Latell said. Fidel began his protracted retreat from public life in August 2006, when a grave intestinal illness forced him to step aside. He ceded power to Raúl, first provisionally, then permanently in 2008. Fidel’s silence after the United States and Cuba announced they would restore diplomatic relations in 2014 was interpreted by Cubans and by foreign experts as a sign that the former leader was extremely sick. Some Cuba watchers wonder if the breakthrough with the United States could have been achieved if Fidel had still been in power or in better health. But others believe that the changes must have carried Fidel’s endorsement, or at least that Raúl acted in a belief that he was following his brother’s grand design. In the televised speech to announce the rapprochement with the United States, Raúl said his openness to talks was “a position that was expressed to the United States government, both in public and in private, by our Comrade Fidel at different moments of our long struggle. ” While Raúl is firmly in control, and seemingly in good health, many people inside and outside Cuban wonder what kind of Cuba comes after him. Raúl, 85, has pledged to step down in 2018. His vice president and former minister for higher education, Miguel Mario   Bermúdez, 56, is expected to fill the presidency. But in the opaque, tightly guarded circles of Cuban politics, it is impossible to know for sure.",0

17890,Preguntar por el sueldo será motivo de despido,"Preguntar por el sueldo será motivo de despido ATOSIGAR AL JEFE PIDIÉNDOLE UN CONTRATO O DÍAS DE VACACIONES SE CONSIDERARÁ ACOSO LABORAL trabajo 
Embrutecer la relación laboral mostrando interés por asuntos meramente económicos será motivo suficiente para echar a un empleado, según una nueva normativa laboral anunciada por el Gobierno esta mañana. “Insistir en temas económicos da a entender que el trabajador podría no estar interesado en el trabajo sino sólo en el dinero”, explicaba esta mañana Fátima Báñez, ministra de Empleo y Seguridad Social. 
Según la normativa, la cantidad monetaria que todos los trabajadores perciben a fin de mes a cambio del trabajo realizado debería ser un tema “que al menos se finja secundario” para poder mantener “la ilusión” de que se trabaja en vistas a mejorar la productividad de la empresda y de España “y no por intereses personales y exclusivamente pecuniarios”. 
“Preguntar por nóminas atrasadas deja en evidencia que existía un interés oculto cuando se aceptó el trabajo”, explica la ministra. 
Los empresarios, a través de la patronal, no han tardado en aplaudir una medida que llevaban años solicitando. “Cuando estás haciendo una entrevista, preguntas por los sueños y las aspiraciones de una persona, por cosas importantes, y al final siempre rompen ese clima de confidencia preguntando cuánto van a cobrar y es una pena”, explica Carmen Sartoña, directora de Recursos Humanos de la multinacional Jenkins&Co. “El trabajo bien hecho debería ser su propia recompensa, nos gusta que el sueldo sea una sorpresa inesperada, un plus”, insiste. 
“Que mis subordinados trabajen por una motivación ajena al trabajo me parece feo y en esas condiciones prefiero poder despedirlos”, ha declarado otro empresario de Madrid, aplaudiendo la medida. Confía en que la nueva normativa favorezca la dedicación apasionada y desinteresada por el trabajo. 
Asimismo, los trabajadores que atosiguen al jefe pidiéndole un contrato o días de vacaciones podrán ser acusados de acoso laboral.",0
17891,Fiat Chrysler Announces Recall of 1.1 Million Autos - The New York Times,"DETROIT  —   Fiat Chrysler said on Friday that it was recalling 1. 1 million vehicles that can roll away unexpectedly and cause injuries when the transmission is not used properly, adding to a spate of recent safety actions by carmakers. Safety recalls in the United States have continued to mount this year as automakers react to tougher enforcement efforts by regulators. This year’s total is unlikely to match the record of more than 60 million vehicles set in 2014 after General Motors recalled millions of small cars with faulty ignitions that were ultimately linked to 124 deaths. But over all, the pace of recalls so far in 2016 exceeds the number in a typical year before the G. M. crisis. G. M. and other automakers, including Fiat Chrysler, have been subject to heavy fines by regulators for failing to promptly fix defective vehicles. In addition, automakers are being scrutinized by other government agencies, including the Justice Department, for their conduct related to recalls and safety defects. In recent weeks, G. M. announced a major recall to fix seatbelts in its trucks, and other companies have announced safety actions to repair faulty airbags. The recall blitz has even included the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which said last week that it would recall its new Model X sport utility vehicle to prevent   seats from folding forward in a collision. On Friday, Fiat Chrysler said it would recall 811, 586 cars and S. U. V.s in the United States after reports of 41 injuries linked to transmission problems. The automaker also will recall more than 300, 000 vehicles for similar problems in various international markets, including Canada and Mexico. The vehicles affected include   Jeep Grand Cherokee S. U. V. and   Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans. An investigation by the carmaker and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that drivers were leaving their vehicles without shifting the transmission into the “park” position when the engine was running. According to Fiat Chrysler, the drivers were unaware of how to properly use electronically controlled shift levers. Unlike conventional transmissions, the levers do not change position when shifted. Instead, the levers return to the same position after shifting, and gear selection is indicated by lights. “Unless due care is taken, drivers may draw erroneous conclusions about the status of their vehicles,” Fiat Chrysler said. According to documents from the auto safety regulator, more than 300 incidents were reported in which vehicles rolled away after improper shifting, resulting in more than 100 accidents. Among the injuries were a fractured pelvis, broken ribs, cuts, sprains and severe bruising. Regulators also found that shifters in the affected vehicles were unreasonably difficult to operate. “The shifter is not intuitive and provides poor tactile and visual feedback to the driver, increasing the potential for unintended gear selection,” regulators said. Fiat Chrysler said it would enhance the warning systems and otherwise modify the transmission systems in the recalled models. The company said it had already updated the shifters in newer versions of the vehicles.",0
17892,"Donald Trump’s Jet, a Regular on the Campaign Trail, Isn’t Registered to Fly - The New York Times","Over the past several months, Donald J. Trump has crisscrossed the country making dozens of campaign stops in places like Sioux City, Iowa, and Jackson, Miss. often in his sleek Cessna jet. There is just one hitch: The plane’s registration is expired. Records kept with the Federal Aviation Administration show the aircraft’s registration lapsed on Jan. 31. Laura J. Brown, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, confirmed that the plane’s registration was not in good standing and said the owner had not renewed it. With few exceptions, aircraft must be registered in order to fly. Mr. Trump’s plane could be grounded for days, or even months, while the issue is sorted out. In the event of an accident, the company that insures the jet could cite the lapsed registration to decline any claims. The F. A. A. could also fine or assess other penalties against the owner, the operator or both Mr. Trump owns the plane through a limited liability company. Though it is unlikely that the agency would seek the maximum penalty, flying with no registration could result in a civil penalty of up to $27, 500, a criminal fine of up to $250, 000 and imprisonment for up to three years, it said. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, declined to answer several questions about the plane’s registration or use, saying only that the renewal process “is just about complete. ” As of late Tuesday, the F. A. A. had not received a registration renewal application for the Cessna, according to Ms. Brown, the agency spokeswoman. She declined to comment on any action the F. A. A. might take. Although Mr. Trump has a sizable delegate lead in the Republican presidential primary race, his campaign has often had organizational issues, at times losing ground against better organized opponents, chiefly Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as Mr. Trump has struggled to master the complicated rules governing the selection of delegates. Mr. Trump can still fly most candidates typically charter a private plane. He also has four other registered aircraft: a Boeing 757 and three Sikorsky helicopters, a fleet that has become a critical part of the billionaire’s image he has sought to project on the campaign trail. The Boeing, which has Mr. Trump’s surname emblazoned in big letters on the outside and   fixtures inside, has been used as a backdrop at a number of his rallies. But the aircraft weighs more than 100, 000 pounds, and that creates limitations: It cannot land at many smaller airports. As a result, Mr. Trump often presses the 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X, which was designed to seat eight people, into action. It has made hundreds of flights since he announced his plan to seek the Republican nomination in June 2015, according to F. A. A. records reviewed by The New York Times. Dozens of those flights were made after Jan. 31, when the registration expired. The plane flew as recently as Monday, when it was used to transport Team Trump between La Guardia Airport and Buffalo for a campaign event on the eve of the New York primary. On Friday, it flew to Plattsburgh, N. Y. and to Hartford for rallies in those cities, according to radio transmissions broadcast by the plane that were archived on a flight data website and reviewed by The Times. The F. A. A. warned Mr. Trump that the Cessna’s registration was set to expire, records show. On Dec. 1, DJT Operations CX L. L. C. the limited liability company owned by Mr. Trump that operates the Cessna, received a “final notice” from the F. A. A. according to records reviewed by The Times. Then, on March 1, DJT Operations CX was notified that the registration had expired. “The aircraft’s registration and airworthiness certificates no longer support the aircraft’s operation,” the agency wrote. These notices, records show, were sent to National Registered Agents it is not a company Mr. Trump owns. It is the Delaware firm that was listed as the “registered agent” when DJT Operations CX was incorporated in 2012, the year Mr. Trump bought the jet. In an F. A. A. filing in 2012, titled “Aircraft Registration Application,” National Registered Agents, its address and its phone number were listed as the contact information for DJT Operations CX. The filing is one page, largely filled out by hand, and is signed by Mr. Trump. His title, initially listed as “president,” was crossed out and replaced with “sole member. ” The registration for Mr. Trump’s four other aircraft are current, records show. Flying privately is not cheap. The Trump campaign has paid a company that Mr. Trump owns more than $3 million for   travel since he announced his candidacy. Registering an aircraft, however, is cheap: It costs only $5, and the registration is valid for three years.",0
17893,"Al Jarreau, Singer Who Spanned Jazz, Pop and R&ampB Worlds, Dies at 76 - The New York Times","Al Jarreau, a versatile vocalist who sold millions of records and won a string of Grammys for his work in pop and RB as well as his first love, jazz, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 76. His death was announced by his manager, Joe Gordon, who said that Mr. Jarreau had been hospitalized for exhaustion two weeks ago. On the advice of his doctors, he had canceled his tour dates and retired from touring. Mr. Jarreau did not begin a   musical career until he was nearly 30, but within a few years he had begun attracting notice for a vocal style that was both instantly appealing and highly unusual. Critics were particularly taken by his improvisational dexterity, in particular his virtuosic ability to produce an array of vocalizations ranging from delicious nonsense to clicks and growls to   sounds. Although he made his initial mark in the jazz world, Mr. Jarreau’s style, and his audience, crossed stylistic barriers. His music incorporated elements of pop, soul, gospel, Latin and other genres. It was a mark of his eclecticism that he won six Grammys across three different categories: jazz, pop and RB. He was also among the performers on a   children’s album, “In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record. ” If Mr. Jarreau’s highly accessible, intensely personal style defied easy classification, that very accessibility  —   and, perhaps, the mere fact of his considerable commercial success  —   left some jazz purists skeptical. Reviewing a concert by Mr. Jarreau at the Savoy in New York in 1981, Stephen Holden of The New York Times encapsulated what many saw as both the pros and the cons of Mr. Jarreau’s singular style: “Al Jarreau may be the most technically gifted singer working in   today,” Mr. Holden wrote. Of the evening’s performance, however, he continued: “Mr. Jarreau’s concert lacked the emotional range of great jazz. He is such a prodigious talent that the absence of even the slightest blues inflections kept his music from cutting deeply. ” But critics’ reservations never deterred Mr. Jarreau, who prided himself, as he told The Los Angeles Times in 1986, on his “jazz attitude,” which he defined as “the idea of being open to each and every moment as a chance to create something different. ” “I try to be receptive,” he added, “and to be listening, and to not be afraid to try something new. ” Alwin Lopez Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940, into a musical family. His father, a minister, was a fine singer his mother played the piano in church. Young Al began singing at 4, harmonizing with his siblings. As a youth he sang in church, as well as with   harmony groups and local jazz bands. Mr. Jarreau earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1962, and a master’s in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa in 1964. Afterward he moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a rehabilitation counselor for people with disabilities. But Mr. Jarreau found he could not resist the pull of jazz and before long was singing in local nightclubs. By the late ’60s, he had quit his day job and embarked on a nightclub career, first on the West Coast and eventually in New York. He reached a national audience with the album “We Got By,” released by Warner Bros. in 1975 to critical praise and commercial success. Though advertised as his debut, it was actually his second album. A decade earlier, Mr. Jarreau had quietly recorded an album, later released on the Bainbridge label under the title “1965. ” Though Mr. Jarreau took legal action, without success, to block its belated release in 1982, it is esteemed by jazz connoisseurs today. Appearances on “Saturday Night Live” and other television shows raised his profile, as did extensive touring. In 1981 he had his biggest hit with the song “We’re in This Love Together,” which reached No. 15 on the Billboard pop singles chart. He won his first Grammy in 1978, for best jazz vocal performance, for his album “Look to the Rainbow. ” He won his last in 2007, for best traditional RB vocal performance the award was shared by Mr. Jarreau, George Benson and Jill Scott for their collaborative performance “God Bless the Child. ” In between, in 1982, Mr. Jarreau earned a Grammy for best pop vocal performance by a male artist for the title track of his album “Breakin’ Away. ” That year, he also received the Grammy for best jazz vocal performance by a male artist, for his version of Dave Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo à la Turk,” from the same album. His other Grammys came in 1979 for the album “All Fly Home” (in the jazz category) and in 1993 for the album “Heaven and Earth” (in RB). A seventh Grammy came in 1981 for “In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record,” a compilation children’s album that featured a range of artists. Among Mr. Jarreau’s   recordings was the theme song for the   television series “Moonlighting,” for which he wrote the lyrics to Lee Holdridge’s music. He appeared on Broadway as a replacement in the role of the Teen Angel in the 1994 revival of “Grease. ” Mr. Jarreau’s first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Player a son, Ryan two brothers, Marshall and Appie and a sister, Rose Marie Freeman. Mr. Jarreau canceled a number of concert dates in 2010 after experiencing heart and breathing problems during a European tour. He was hospitalized for 11 days but resumed his touring schedule after his release, and had continued to perform until recently. Shortly after his 2010 hospitalization, he said in an interview that his health problems had not been as serious as reports suggested, but joked that he appreciated the attention they received in the media because it proved that he was a celebrity. “I figured,” he said, “ ‘Yeah, maybe I have arrived.’ ”",0
17894,The Man Who Loathed Pajamas - The New York Times,"Two days before the snowstorm that was supposed to be a blizzard (but wasn’t quite) I decided to get serious. I went to the supermarket to stock up on paper towels and cookies and the      concoction that is the only coffee drink I can stomach. I went to the butcher and bought a thick sirloin that I would go on to woefully torture on the stove top. And I went to Sleepy Jones, to pick out pajamas. Let’s start with this: I abhor pajamas. I abhor most forms of casual attire, even in the most casual of settings. I didn’t buy sweatpants until about two years ago, not because demathleisureboyz. net told me to, but because I thought I might one day see the inside of a gym and hoped to pass for a native. (I have I don’t.) I wear them around the house, too, but I don’t want to be seen in them. If I wear them to the trash chute, I walk quickly. As for pajamas, I’ve had a few. Two, actually, in my adult life. One, a pair I bought in London when it seemed culturally appropriate and chic the other, by Burberry, a gift. I had spells of wearing both, but they passed quickly. Working from home  —   writing from home  —   is close enough to subsidized indolence that you don’t need a sartorial reminder of just how little you’re accomplishing. Besides, being home is a prize all of its own. You get to keep the worst of the world, and most of the rest of it, at bay. But the house no longer feels like such a safe space. There are CNN and all the other news channels on my TV, alerts from The New York Times and The Washington Post on my phone screen. Anxiety is persistent. Even “Fixer Upper” barely helps. Pajamas, I recently reasoned, might be the only hope for sanity. In the store, the two clerks wore full sets, top and bottom, with some accessories atop them so no one got too cozy. They seemed to promise that, yes, you could wear pajamas and get things done  —   maybe not everything, but some things, and certainly that would be enough. I didn’t come to Sleepy Jones to be sensible, though. That seemed besides the point. I think I was hoping for neon stripes, a rich paisley, a garish gingham  —   something that would connote relaxation even from space. Allowing yourself space to relax is a herculean task. Pajamas, I was positing, would make it an irresistible one, too. The choices here were basic, though. Friendly and nonjudgmental. Ice blue and white, or a nongarish gingham, or one particularly dizzying plaid. (Pants ranged from $128 to $158 tops from $138 to $178.) Sleepy Jones is part of the Andy Spade ecosystem, which is why, in these pajamas, you don’t look like Julian Schnabel so much as a fastidious finance executive who packs thoroughly for a   pond jumper trip to Brussels. In the spirit of the place, and also of possible   soothing, I tried on several sets. They were fine. It turns out it is hard to exult about pajamas  —   simple ones, at least  —   especially in a store where the staff is enthusiastically curious about how your pajamas look. (Buddy, I’m buying pajamas because I don’t want to be seen, not because they unleash my inner conversationalist.) Pajamas also have limitations, which Sleepy Jones, a jovial place, addresses by offering items that are related in tone: underwear, some pencils, fragrant soaps ($14)     that had the names of other clothing items (loafer, navy blazer) in generic fonts ($48) zines filled with strange things said by the son of a friend of the brand ($10). I decided to buy a pair of simple    gingham pants. It was both an experiment and a symbol of naïve hope. Sweatpants, I’d come to realize, never felt formal. Pajama pants might allow a dash of seriousness to temper my relaxation. It wasn’t to be. When I got home and pulled the pants out of the bag, the white tissue paper they were wrapped in was sealed with a small circular sticker that read, “Finish nothing today. ” I’m certain whoever came up with that felt it would reinforce my decision to tap out, but the longer I looked at it, the more it began to feel nihilistic. Finish nothing? I had, like, five deadlines. I bought pajamas because I wanted everything around me to telegraph calm so that my brain and fingers could be free to roam. I’m not lazy, I’m overstimulated. Still, I held out hope that a   life could also be a productive one. A day or so later, when the snow came, I gamely put the pants on. An hour later, it was back to the sweatpants. An hour after that, jeans.",0

17897,This is the Man Militarized Police at Standing Rock are Working For,"Waking Times 
The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation by Native Americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply has been met with heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. Militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with LRAD sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. 
But, as the saying goes, Water Is Life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable. The root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism, and the perception that money is more important than life itself. When the police and national guard attack U.S. citizens on private property to protect corporate interests, who are they really working for? 
The corporate dream of the Keystone XL pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way. At the top of this pyramid of profit is Texas billionaire Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the project. 
So who is Kelcy Warren? 
A native of East Texas and graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in civil engineering, Warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co-chair of Energy Transfer Equity in 2007. With business partner Ray Davis, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Warren built Energy Transfer Equity into one of the nation’s largest pipeline companies, which now owns about 71,000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil. The company’s holdings include Sunoco, Southern Union and Regency Energy Partners. 
Forbes estimates the 60-year-old Warren’s personal wealth at $4 billion. Bloomberg described him as “among America’s new shale tycoons” — but rather than building a fortune by drilling he “takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another, chilling, boiling, pressurizing, and processing it until it’s worth more than when it burst from the wellhead.” [ Source ] 
Shockingly, in 2015 the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, appointed Warren to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect Big Bend National Park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another $770 million pipeline project . 
“According to the governor’s office, the state parks and wildlife commission “manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of Texas,” along with ensuring the future of hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for Texans.” [ Source ] 
This glaring conflict of interest has inspired Environmental Science major at UTSA and former Texas State Park Ambassador Andrew Lucas to begin a drive to have Warren removed from this environmental post. His petition is described here : 
Most people may know Kelcy Warren as the man behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The Dallas-based billionaire and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the Midwest and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. No environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. A similar story is unfolding out in West Texas, where Warren’s company has split through the pristine Big Bend region with the 200 mile Comanche Trail Pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile Trans Pecos Pipeline. These Pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the Trans Pecos region. 
With untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of Energy Transfer Partners, it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Kelcy Warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who preside over Texas Parks And Wildlife… Why? Probably the $550,000 in campaign contributions Abbott received from Warren. 
Footage of militarized police using the Long Range Acoustic Device ( LRAD ) crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on October 27th, 2016: Final Thoughts 
Warren is listed as number 150 on Forbes list of wealthiest Americans with an estimated net worth of $4.2 billion in September of 2016. He is the head of the Dakota Access Pipeline snake. 
If you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating, gassing and attacking peaceful resistors, including women, children and the elderly, the answer is, they are doing it to protect the interests of Kelcy Warren and others invested in this pipeline project.

17898,Trump Unleashes On Media: “Everyone At CNN Is A Liar… You Should Be Ashamed”,"Image: Bin im Garten, Creative Commons
This article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge . 
Editor’s Comment: The entire campaign season was composed of stories about how Trump couldn’t win, about the derogatory comments he has made, and the terror he would bring. But their lopsided attacks against Trump, and their continuing praise of nothing-but-Hillary was completely wrong in every way… the epitome of “fake news.” 
And President-elect Trump reportedly let the media hear his mind… interesting account of this off-the-record meeting. 
Trump “Exploded” At Media Execs During Off-The-Record Meeting: “It Was A F–king Firing Squad” 
by Tyler Durden
Earlier today we reported that in a “summit” organized by Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, executives and anchors from the major US media outlets, including CNN president Jeff Zucker, ABC News president James Goldston, Fox News co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, and NBC News president Deborah Turness, visited Donald Trump at his Trump Tower penthouse for an off the record meeting.
Courtesy of the Post, we have a complete list of the participants at the Trump media meeting: the hour-long powwow included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC’s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC’s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, CBS’ Norah O’Donnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and Gayle King, Fox News’ Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC’s Phil Griffin and CNN’s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett.
The contents of what was discussed were initially unclear.

Now, according to the Post and Politico , we learn that the President-elect “ exploded at media bigs in an off-the-record Trump Tower powow on Monday .”
“ It was like a f—ing firing squad ,” one source told the Post.
According to the Post’s recound of the conversation, “ Trump started with Jeff Zucker and said I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed ….”

Jeff Zucker (left) 
“The meeting was a total disaster . The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,” the source added. A second source confirmed the encounter.
The Post adds that “the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks…”
“Trump kept saying, ‘ We’re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars .
“Trump didn’t say Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate – which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.
“Gayle did not stand up, but asked some question, ‘How do you propose we the media work with you?’ Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked how are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.”
Politico adds further details, according to which “Trump complained about photos of himself that NBC used that he found unflattering, the source said. Trump turned to NBC News President Deborah Turness at one point, the source said, and told her the network won’t run a nice picture of him, instead choosing “this picture of me,” as he made a face with a double chin. Turness replied that they had a “very nice” picture of him on their website at the moment.”
Amusingly, since the meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations, it means they will most likely be unable to confirm or deny the Post’s report.
Politco’s recollection of events was slightly less dramatic:
The New York Post on Monday afternoon portrayed a much more heated meeting, including a quote from one source who said the encounter was “like a f–ing firing squad.” The Post also said Trump called CNN journalists “liars” and that they should be “ashamed.” The source who spoke with POLITICO characterized the meeting as less intense, and said the discussion included Trump expressing the possibility of a “reset” of the tumultuous relationship between the president-elect and the media and that all he wants is “fairness.”
Asked how he defines fairness by a network executive, Trump said simply, “The truth.” But aside from the few moments of contention in the beginning, the source said the meeting was largely substantive.
Politico also adds that Trump, flanked by chief of staff Reince Priebus and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway at the table, also expressed annoyance at the protective press pool and the complaints over him ditching the press when he went out to dinner last week with his family after reporters were advised he was in for the night. But Priebus assured the attendees that the protective press pool will be taken care of and it would all work out.
Other attendees at the meeting from Trump’s team included chief strategist Stephen Bannon, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spokesman Jason Miller, and Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer.
Asked for comment, Miller referred POLITICO to Conway’s comments to reporters after the meeting, in which she echoed the sentiments made in the meeting about turning over a new leaf with the media.
“There was no need to mend fences,” Conway said. “It was very cordial, very genial. But it was very candid and very honest. From my own perspective, it’s great to hit the reset button.”
Conway later on Monday hit back at the New York Post report. “He did not explode in anger,” she said.
While one can have a subjective interpretuation of the nuances at the meeting, one thing was clear: Trump’s attempt at a ‘reset’ will be frowned at by the media which is not used to this kind of treatment, even if the “kindler, gentler” version of events as reported by Politico is accurate.
It also means that what has already been a conventional war between the various US media organizations and Trump, is likely about to go nuclear.

17899,‘It Did Not Stick’: The First Federal Effort to Curb Police Abuse - The New York Times,"PITTSBURGH  —   Federal intervention to curb police abuse did not begin after chants of “I can’t breathe,” viral cellphone videos or the Black Lives Matter movement. It began 21 years ago here in Pittsburgh, where the police were laden with complaints that black residents were routinely singled out for false arrest and abuse. In a City Hall conference room, Chief Robert McNeilly faced a team of lawyers from the Justice Department  —   young, smartly dressed and newly empowered to rein in the department. Sizing up the investigators, Chief McNeilly  —   dressed, as usual, in uniform  —   had one thought he could not get out of his mind: “There was nobody with any police experience. ” Still, the negotiators groped their way to the first federal “consent decree,” an     agreement in 1997 that turned Pittsburgh into a widely emulated model department  —   for a time, at least. Since then, there have been consent decrees in 19 other cities, from little Steubenville, Ohio, and Ferguson, Mo. to Los Angeles, Seattle and, as of Friday, Baltimore. Though widely regarded as a net positive, consent decrees, based on a 1994 statute that gave the federal attorney general the authority to combat systemic constitutional violations, have had varying degrees of success and have fallen in and out of favor, buffeted by political winds. They were pioneered by President Bill Clinton’s Justice Department, largely rejected by President George W. Bush and vigorously revived by the Obama administration. Now, under President Trump, their future is in doubt. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a review of all federal interventions in law enforcement agencies and tried to delay Baltimore’s new decree. To revisit the very first police consent decree is to examine a microcosm of the agreements’ potential, and their limitations. Many of the issues, including poor training, racial bias, union opposition and the high cost to carry out the decree, could have been plucked from last week’s headlines. Under its decree, Pittsburgh curtailed strip searches, began documenting traffic stops, gave officers “cultural diversity” training and tracked civilian complaints. But from the outset, the police union balked, warning of “more   shootings, more drugs” and a spike in crime. Four years after the consent decree ended in 2002, a new mayor, elected with union backing, took office and promptly dismissed Chief McNeilly. (The former chief says he retired voluntarily.) Over time, various aspects of the consent decree fell out of use. One of Chief McNeilly’s successors went to prison during a corruption scandal. “The only realistic way to look at this is that it did not stick,” said David Harris, a University of Pittsburgh law professor who has written extensively about police reform and who studied the Pittsburgh experience. In 1991, long before cellphone videos, there was Rodney King, an unarmed black man whose beating by four Los Angeles police officers was captured in grainy television footage. The episode led to widespread public outrage and congressional hearings on how to address police misconduct. A tiny provision, known as Section 14141, was inserted into a crime bill signed into law by Mr. Clinton in 1994. The attorney general was authorized to investigate and sue to eliminate any “pattern or practice” of unconstitutional conduct by law enforcement officers. In the Justice Department, civil rights lawyers wrestled with how, and where, to exercise their new authority. In Pittsburgh, lawyers had been collecting civilian complaints and learned that over 20 years, only one police officer had been disciplined  —   one who had an altercation with a black man who happened to be the deputy city solicitor. In 1995, Pittsburgh had its own Rodney King  —   Jonny Gammage, a black businessman and cousin of a lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who died of asphyxiation during a struggle with white police officers in the suburbs. Though his death did not involve the Pittsburgh police, it galvanized blacks and whites here to work together, said Tim Stevens, the president of the local chapter of the N. A. A. C. P. at the time. In March 1996, Witold Walczak, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, learned about Section 14141 while preparing a   suit against the Pittsburgh police. He called the Justice Department and offered up his documents, which led to the federal investigation. The city was offered the chance to avoid a federal lawsuit if it agreed to make certain changes  —   a consent decree. Though Section 14141 was envisioned as a way to force change, Chief McNeilly, who was new to the job and had been brought on for that very purpose, did not resist. “When the D. O. J. came in, I pulled out my list and said, ‘These are the things I would do  —   ethics training, diversity training, communications training for every officer,’” Chief McNeilly said. Also on his list: computers, which the Justice Department ultimately required the city to buy. “Pittsburgh could very well have been stuck in the ’60s with no computers if it hadn’t had a consent decree,” he said. The Justice Department had a list of demands  —   for instance, that every passenger’s race and sex be recorded during traffic stops. Chief McNeilly protested, questioning the practicality and legality of such a requirement. In the end, only the driver’s information was tracked. The Justice Department also required an “early warning system,” opposed by the union, that would flag officers prone to using force. “Bob McNeilly was like a test pilot in the Mercury flight program,” said Chuck Wexler, the president of the Police Executive Research Forum, a group of law enforcement professionals. “No one knew what an ‘early warning system’ was, how to build it or what to measure. ” By 2002, when the Pittsburgh decree expired, the department was considered a model of progressive policing. By then, Mr. Bush was in the White House, having campaigned on a promise not to meddle with the local police. His attorney general, John Ashcroft, told law enforcement executives that “he did not want the federal government managing local police departments. ” Years later, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions would strike the same chords. “These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers,” Mr. Sessions said at his confirmation hearing. Mr. Bush preferred voluntary arrangements, known as memorandums of agreement. Cleveland, Miami and New Orleans were all investigated by the   Justice Department, but none were required to enter into consent decrees. All three were reinvestigated by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama’s first civil rights division chief, Thomas Perez, came in determined to build on the work of the Clinton administration and consent decrees like that in Los Angeles, which had been hailed as a success in a Harvard study. But Mr. Perez’s   style drew the ire of union leaders, including James O. Pasco Jr. the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police. In an interview, Mr. Pasco accused Mr. Perez of waging “a virtual jihad against    police officers. ” Christy Lopez, a former Justice Department lawyer who worked on police abuse investigations during the Clinton and Obama administrations, said of Mr. Perez: “He represented a shift, and it was very hard for police officers. He was telling them things that no one really had the nerve to tell them before. ” Mr. Perez’s successor, Vanita Gupta, sought to mend fences, but by then, many union leaders say, the relationship had been poisoned. The Fraternal Order of Police, which was founded in 1915 by two Pittsburgh police officers and now has a membership of well over 300, 000 nationwide, has backed presidential candidates of both major political parties over the years but declined to choose between Mr. Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, in 2012. In 2016, the organization backed Mr. Trump.   investigative reports were filled with vivid anecdotes and statistics: a    homeless man shot with a stun gun for refusing to leave a bus stop a   victim who was told that it was “probably just a drunken night and a mistake” a city where blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be accused of “milling” or “loitering. ” The consent decrees grew longer and more detailed, and included metrics and public reports. Instead of simply reviewing documents, Justice Department investigators included the views of officers, union leaders and community advocates in an attempt to make changes last. “In the end, a city completes a consent decree, then the judge goes away, the monitor goes away,” said Samuel Walker, an expert on police accountability. “All cities are on their own, and then it’s dependent on the local community and local politics. ” In 2010, Jordan Miles, 18, an   honor student here, was badly beaten by police officers. Suddenly, Pittsburgh was thrown back into its past. Local news media outlets later reported that between 2010 and 2015, the city had used $4. 9 million in tax money to settle more than 28 civil   lawsuits against the police. Despite the backsliding, Mr. Stevens, the civil rights leader, said the consent decree had had lasting “ripple effects” in Pittsburgh. The city’s recently retired police chief, who left after just two years, pushed hard to improve relations with black residents, and the new chief is also talking about police reform. But Mr. Stevens is worried that what he is hearing from Washington will cause the ripples to subside. So are officials in Chicago and Baltimore, who, in a sign of how some cities have come to embrace federal intervention, have objected to a retreat from   police overhauls. The Baltimore police commissioner, Kevin Davis, called the Justice Department’s effort to delay the agreement “a punch in the gut. ” Chief McNeilly and his wife, a former police commander, now consult with departments seeking to improve and see the federal government as a powerful ally. “To suggest that there aren’t police departments out there that need massive help is naïve,” he said. “You’ve got some of the smartest, best, most experienced attorneys in D. C. and it’s all going to be for naught. ”",0

Gold lending by central banks to bullion banks is one of the most opaque areas of the gold market. Bank of England Asks UK Banks To Detail Their Exposure To Deutsche And Italian Banks Oct 26, 2016 2:13 PM 0 SHARES 
In what may or may not be a coincidence, just hours after Bloomberg reported that DB launched a probe into whether it ""misstated"" derivatives, moments ago the FT reported that the Bank of England is seeking details from large British banks on their current exposure to Deutsche Bank and some of the biggest Italian banks, including Monte dei Paschi , ""amid mounting market jitters over the health of Europe’s financial sector."" 
The FT notes that the request was made in recent weeks by the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority as investors sold off Deutsche and Monte dei Paschi, both of which have been the subject of scrutiny over their capital levels. Supervisors worldwide have attempted to curtail the links between large institutions since the 2008 banking crisis, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers and other big groups threatened to drag down the entire global financial system. 
While the PRA regularly speaks to banks about their exposures, particularly to any lender that might be facing difficulty, the BoE’s recent intervention is a sign of continued nervousness among regulators that the interconnectedness of Europe’s largest banks could harm otherwise healthy groups if one of the weakest links were to fall into crisis. 
Som more details: 
Normally, exposures to other financial institutions are not disclosed to regulators unless they are particularly large or as part of annual stress tests. That forced the BoE to ask for the latest snapshot of the big UK banks’ exposures to their German and Italian rivals as those groups came under market attack. Banks can be exposed to one another directly through lending or derivatives but indirect exposures — such as lending to a counterparty of a bank in trouble — also need to be considered. 

Global rules cap the amount that one bank can hold in another to 25 per cent of the first bank’s capital, while anything above 10 per cent must be disclosed to regulators. Smaller holdings are therefore harder for supervisors to spot. 

Paul Sharma, a former PRA official now a consultant at Alvarez & Marsal, said large UK banks were now able to monitor their direct exposure to troubled banks on a “near real-time” basis but that market turmoil could complicate the picture. 
The FT also writes that British regulators are particularly anxious about the impact of litigation costs on Deutsche’s already weak profitability and that large piles of non-performing loans could have a similarly corrosive impact on Italian banks . 
As we pointed out earlier, Germany’s biggest bank still faces serious doubts on whether it will need to raise billions of euros of extra capital and slash costs drastically to strengthen its balance sheet and boost profits. Among the entities rumored to provide backstop capital are various middle-eastern funds as well as rumored Chinese investors. 
Normally, similar reports of heightened regulatory scrutiny would lead to a brike selling in any named bank; however perhaps because Deutsche Bank has already been through hell and back over the past few months, this latest news will hardly come as a shock to investors. 
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank is set to announce earnings tomorrow, in which it is expected to announce a lower net loss of around €610 million, versus a massive €6 billion loss one year ago, much of which stemmed from write-downs on investment-banking and other assets. At this time last year, Deutsche Bank was kicking off its new, multi-year overhaul under Chief Executive John Cryan. This quarter's loss is expected to be largely due to another large major litigation provision ahead of a potential settlement with the DoJ. Analysts are split on precisely how much the bank will set aside, but their forecasts range from €250m to €1.5bn according to a consensus report compiled by the bank. Analysts also expect third-quarter revenues to be €7.1 billion, according to a consensus of 17 analysts' estimates compiled by the bank. That compares with €7.3 billion a year ago. 
Prolonged uncertainty around Deutsche Bank's capital position-exacerbated by the litigation questions--have fueled persistent questions about whether the lender might be forced to sell shares, shed businesses it has planned to keep, or accelerate cost-cutting plans. 
Keys to Deutsche Bank's plans for building its capital cushion include divesting its German retail-banking division called Postbank. That plan has proved more difficult than expected, and investors want to know the latest-especially if executives have changed their minds. Investors will also want to know when the bank is going to see the cash it is expecting from selling its roughly 20% stake in Chinese bank Hua Xia. The roughly $4 billion deal was announced in December 2015, but the proceeds have taken longer to arrive than executives expected. 
Meanwhile, in an attempt to cut costs, DB has undergone on a major layoff spree and, as reported yesterday, is considering paying banker bonuses in compensation other than cash.",0
17901,Top US General Pleads With Troops Not To Revolt Over 2016 (VIDEO),"By: The Voice of Reason | In recent weeks, a common theme that has run through the vast majority of the stories I’ve covered, has been for people to make sure they are preparing for the possibility of a major emergency. Why? First and foremost, because it was only back in May when President Obama took time out of his extremely busy schedule to deliver an address at the FEMA National Response Coordination Center in Washington where he made a point to stress that Americans who are not preparing for disaster, or who do not have emergency evacuation plans for any given scenario, could find themselves in big trouble in the near future. The following excerpt from Obama’s speech comes directly from the official White House website … “One of the things that we have learned over the course of the last seven and a half years is that government plays a vital role, but it is every citizen’s responsibility to be prepared for a disaster. And that means taking proactive steps, like having an evacuation plan, having a fully stocked disaster supply kit. If your local authorities ask you to evacuate, you have to do it. Don’t wait.” That’s the biggest reason why. Second, all one has to do is look around at our surroundings to see that right now the “perfect storm” of pure chaos is brewing all around us. As our allies in Berlin who have nuclear missiles pointed in their direction by the Russians can attest to, Geopolitical tensions are sky right now. German leaders, along with leaders in the Czeck Republic have issued warnings to their people to begin stockpiling food and emergency supplies in case of what could be an “existence threatening event.” Not helping matters geopolitically is the fact that the entire financial banking system of the West which includes the U.S. Dollar as the World Reserve Currency was built as a debt-based monetary system, and now that the debt saturation process has run its full course, the global economy is on the verge of what is being called a “global reset,” which could occur at any moment. Lastly, here domestically the 2016 presidential election has gotten so divisive, that supporters from both political parties have vowed not to accept the winner if it’s not their candidate, and some groups have even promised the largest civil uprising in our nation’s history if the election doesn’t go their way. If that was all that was in the news, it would be enough to put anyone on edge. What I talk about in the video below, is a recent article from earlier this week from The Daily Caller . In that article, among other things, it reports that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford has had to issue a reminder/warning to the troops to stay committed to their oaths, as well as the chain of command in the coming weeks. In light of everything I’ve been warning people of, this recent report is most troubling… The Daily Caller Reports: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford wrote a Medium blog post Monday to remain committed to its military oath amid the 2016 election. “What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized, or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums,” Dunford reminded troops. Dunford further urged service members that the military must remain committed to the chain of command structure until the next administration comes in, and that the military should not undermine its credibility in the interim with the next president. “I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession,” he continued. Dunford’s comments also come amid increased concern that the U.S. military is becoming too politicized. He is reportedly furious with Retired Marine Gen. John Allen and Retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn for actively campaigning on behalf of the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey openly rebuked Allen and Flynn for injecting themselves into the political process. “The American people should not wonder where their military leaders draw the line between military advice and political preference,” he lamented in a letter to The Washington Post. He continued “our nation’s soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines should not wonder about the political leanings and motivations of their leaders.” The letter is also likely addressing recent political statements by active duty service members on social media. A female sailor posted a video of herself sitting through morning colors in protest of supposed racism in the national anthem in August. The protest video was inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. THE VOICE OF REASON is the pen name of Michael DePinto, a graduate of Capital University Law School, and an attorney in Florida.

17902,Congress Knew For At Least Two Years About Pentagon Efforts To Take Back Bonuses From Veterans,"Print 
Although members of Congress are now absolutely outraged the Pentagon is trying to recoup bonuses given out to thousands of troops, it turns out, Congress actually knew about this problem for at least two years. 
Andreas Mueller, chief of federal policy for the California National Guard, wrote an email to the California congressional delegation, stating the Guard told members of Congress about the bonus reclamation issue two years ago, The Los Angeles Times reports. 
In fact, Mueller noted that the Guard had even offered a solution, but Congress took zero action. 
In effect, the scandal stems back to about a decade when the National Guard was called upon to supply more troops. Guard officials were only supposed to give out bonuses to high-value positions like intelligence or civil affairs, to incentivize more soldiers to head to Iraq and Afghanistan during a marked troop shortage. But that rule was ignored and thousands of soldiers received bonuses they weren’t actually supposed to, unbeknownst to them. 
Now, the Pentagon wants those bonuses back and with interest. 
Since the story first broke Saturday, members of Congress have declared how abhorrent it is for veterans to be targeted with tax liens and wage garnishment for refusing to pay back these bonuses. GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Marine Corps reservist, wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Sunday, asking for him to get involved as to find a solution to this “boneheaded” decision . 
On the other side of the aisle, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi sent House Speaker Paul Ryan a letter Monday arguing that as soon as Congress gets back in session, members should immediately pass legislation to halt the Pentagon’s collection efforts. 
Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer also wrote a letter to Carter, insisting that he had the power to simply forgive the debts without any action from Congress. 
“Thousands of our service members are paying the price for mistakes made by California National Guard managers, some of whom are now serving jail time or paying restitution for their crimes,” Feinstein and Boxer said . “It is outrageous to hold these service members and their families responsible for the illegal behavior of others.” 
But in the meantime, the California Guard certainly does not have the legal power to forgive debts, however much it might want to do so.

17903,Misophonia Sufferers: Scientists May Have Found the Root of Your Pain - The New York Times,"Popcorn munching. Soup slurping. Nose sniffling. Or, simply, breathing. Ever wonder why some ordinary sounds drive you crazy? It’s called misophonia, a mysterious affliction in which seemingly harmless sounds unleash anger, anxiety and, in some cases, panic attacks in some people. If you’re one of them, neuroscientists at Newcastle University in Britain say they may have found an explanation for what ails you. In a report on the latest study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, the neuroscientists say that brain scans of misophonia sufferers show that particular sounds, like eating and drinking, cause the part of their brain that processes emotions, the anterior insular cortex, to go into overdrive. That region in sufferers was also connected differently, compared to normal brains, to the amygdala and the hippocampus, areas that are involved in recalling past experiences, said Dr. Sukhbinder Kumar, the lead researcher from the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University. “We think that misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling past memories, because people with misophonia have had very bad experiences,” he said in a phone interview Friday. The research opens up the possibilities of future therapy for those afflicted with misophonia, a term coined by the American scientists Pawel and Margaret Jastreboff in 2001. A survey of nearly 200 misophonia sufferers showed that the average age at which they first became aware of the condition was 12, Dr. Kumar said. “When they hear these sounds, it’s like their attention is completely absorbed by the sounds, and they can’t do anything else,” he said. “They’re triggering a recall. ” For the study, the team used an M. R. I. to measure the brain activities of 42 people with and without misophonia while they were listening to a range of noises. The sounds were categorized into neutral ones like rain unpleasant sounds like a crying baby and trigger sounds that were mostly linked to eating, chewing, drinking and breathing. When exposed to the noises, those with misophonia showed brain activities different from those without the condition. “The most dominant reaction is anger and anxiety, not disgust,” Dr. Kumar said. But why those sounds, and not others, trigger such averse reactions remains a mystery, he said. The exact number of misophonia sufferers in the world is unknown, he said, because it was only recently diagnosed as a condition. The affliction can be so acute in some people that they can’t stand living with their own families. Olana   29, of Kent, England, was just 8 when family meals became a real chore. “The noise of my family eating forced me to retreat to my own bedroom for meals,” she told the team at Newcastle University. “I can only describe it as a feeling of wanting to punch people in the face when I heard the noise of them eating. ” Dr. Kumar said in a news release,“My hope is to identify the brain signature of the trigger sounds  —   those signatures can be used for treatment such as for   for example, where people can   their reactions by looking at what kind of brain activity is being produced. ” But the study’s findings will come as some relief to misophonia sufferers and reassure some who question the condition’s validity, he added. “This study demonstrates the critical brain changes as further evidence to convince a skeptical medical community that this is a genuine disorder. ”",0
17904,Sen. Liz Warren Refuses to Disavow Madonna’s Wish to ’Blow Up the White House’ - Breitbart,"Two days after Madonna shared her wish to blow up the White House, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D. .) has not come out with a statement condemning the outrageous desire that the pop singer expressed in her address to Saturday’s Women’s March on Washington’s National Mall. [“Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House,” Madonna said to the cheers of tens of thousands of feminists and other opponents of President Donald J. Trump.  Breitbart News sought comment from Warren with an office visit, in addition to emails and a phone message. After being given a   window before posting, the senator’s office did not respond. A survey of Warren’s social media accounts and her official senate office website turned up no condemnation of Madonna’s threat of terrorism against the Executive Mansion. According to Gateway Pundit, the response of the Secret Service was different: A spokesman for the Secret Service told The Gateway Pundit the agency is aware of the comment by aging pop star Madonna made at a large liberal women’s protest against President Donald Trump held in Washington, D. C. Saturday, that she has “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. ” The spokesman said an investigation would be opened but that the decision to prosecute rests with the U. S. Attorney’s office. Sunday, the “Material Girl” songstress walked back her wish to blow up the White House in an exhaustive Instagram post: Yesterday’s Rally. was an amazing and beautiful experience. I came and performed Express Yourself and thats exactly what i did. However I want to clarify some very important things. I am not a violent person, I do not promote violence and it’s important people hear and understand my speech in it’s entirety rather than one phrase taken wildly out of context. My speech began with ” I want to start a revolution of love. ” ♥️ I then go on to take this opportunity to encourage women and all marginalized people to not fall into despair but rather to come together and use it as a starting point for unity and to create positive change in the world. Madonna said her plan to blow up the White House was a metaphor and she does not want to speak or act out of anger: “It was truly an honor to be part of an audience chanting “we choose love”. ♥️♥️♥️♥️ #revoltutionoflove♥️#revolutionoflove♥️***”",0
17905,Two Candidates Vie for One House Seat (for the Fourth Time) - The New York Times," In 2014, I wrote an article about New Hampshire’s very swingy congressional districts. With the same Democrat and Republican facing off in the First District for the fourth  —   yes, fourth  —   time, I couldn’t resist another visit. Presidential candidate after presidential candidate visits this city, the biggest in New Hampshire. In late January or early February, its strip malls and   main drag can feel like the center of the political world, as the news media descends and the voters decide whom they will rocket to the center of the presidential race with their     primary. It has also become part of a more predictable biennial battle: The tug of war between Representative Frank C. Guinta, a Republican, and former Representative Carol   a Democrat, over the congressional seat that one of them has held for a decade. Watching them debate is “like seeing an old married couple rehash the same argument year after year after year,” said Andy Smith, the director of the Survey Center at the University of New Hampshire. No one wants to see that anymore, he said. The extended nature of this particular matchup is due in large part to the dynamics of the district  —   and to the tenacity of two party outsiders who see, in alternating elections, a path to victory. New Hampshire’s First District is one of a shrinking number of swing districts, with a large number of independent voters and perhaps a slightly Republican tilt. Ms.   first elected when she was a   social worker, has done better during presidential election years, and Mr. Guinta in midterm elections. It is hard to keep the seat  —   but also hard to suffer a resounding defeat. Ms.   first won the seat, which had previously been controlled by Republicans for decades, in 2006, amid a swell of antiwar sentiment that helped Democrats around the country. She held on to it in 2008, when President Obama was elected, but lost it to Mr. Guinta, a former mayor of Manchester, in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Ms.   recaptured it as Mr. Obama won   in 2012, but lost it, again to Mr. Guinta, in 2014. This time around, polling shows Ms.   with a clear advantage. A WMUR Granite State poll released this month showed her with 43 percent support among likely voters, and Mr. Guinta with 29 percent. Voters are “probably sick and tired of these two candidates running against each other,” said David Wasserman, the House editor of The Cook Political Report. “The race essentially becomes a function of turnout as a result. ” Both candidates have overcome skepticism within their parties to return to the fray this year. Some of New Hampshire’s top Republicans, including Senator Kelly Ayotte, suggested last year that Mr. Guinta should resign after he settled a campaign finance violation, but he slipped through the primary after embracing Donald J. Trump. Hacked emails from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reviewed by The Portsmouth Herald showed party leaders trying to encourage someone to challenge Ms.   in a primary, but he did not enter the race. “These two, in particular, are so stubborn,” Mr. Wasserman said, “that I’ll be surprised when they stop running against each other. ” For the candidates, it is like seeing disliked neighbors emerge from their house once every two years, and wishing that they would just move away. “I wish I weren’t running against the same person, but he did win his primary, so here we go again,” Ms.   said. Said Mr. Guinta, “She does tend to talk about almost identical issues that she’s campaigned on in previous campaigns. ” There are also   candidates, including Shawn O’Connor, who is running as an independent. He, along with Mr. Guinta and Ms.   spoke at a congressional forum here this month. “That was kind of nice to hear someone else for a change,” said Christine Williams, a college admissions director and a Republican.",0
17906,"Obama Designates Two New National Monuments, Protecting 1.65 Million Acres - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Obama designated two new national monuments on Wednesday, protecting 1. 35 million acres of federal land surrounding the Bears Ears Buttes in southeastern Utah and about 300, 000 acres around Gold Butte in Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas. The monuments are Mr. Obama’s latest effort to protect public lands and waters from development and to nail down as much of his environmental legacy as he can before Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency on Jan. 20. But some local residents and elected Republicans have opposed the Obama administration’s extensive efforts to protect Western landscapes, calling them federal land grabs, and Utah officials voiced vehement opposition on Wednesday. The family of a Nevada rancher, Cliven Bundy, helped take over a national wildlife refuge this year in protest against such federal actions. The new desert monuments, designated under the executive authority of the 1906 Antiquities Act, encompass Native American sites of sacred and archaeological importance, as well as wildlife habitats and hiking and hunting terrain. Efforts to place the Bears Ears Buttes under federal protection have been underway since 1936, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s interior secretary, Harold L. Ickes, proposed the monument designation. Native American tribes began promoting legislation to protect Gold Butte in 2008. “Today’s actions will help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. In Utah, the Bears Ears designation was roundly opposed by statewide elected officials and the congressional delegation. “President Obama’s unilateral decision to invoke the Antiquities Act in Utah politicizes a   conflict,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah. “The midnight move is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes. ” Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which has authority over public lands issues, promised to work to repeal the designation. Mr. Obama has designated about 553 million acres as national monuments, more than any of his predecessors. While Mr. Trump has vowed to undo Mr. Obama’s environmental agenda, White House officials said they did not believe he would have the authority to reverse the designations. No president has undone a predecessor’s designations in the law’s   history. “The Antiquities Act gives the authority to create monuments and does not give explicit authority to undo them,” said Christy Goldfuss, the managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. However, after Mr. Obama this month used an obscure provision of a 1953 law to place about 115 million acres in the Arctic Ocean and about 3. 8 million acres of the Atlantic Ocean permanently   to drilling, opponents, including oil companies, said they intended to file a legal challenge. Native American groups and environmentalists hailed Mr. Obama’s moves Wednesday in Nevada and Utah. Mr. Obama’s designation of Bears Ears as a national monument will create a     tribal commission of representatives from the five Native American tribes that live in the region. The commission will advise the monument’s federal managers. “This is an exciting day for Navajo Nation,” Russell Begaye, the tribe’s president, said in a phone call with reporters. “We have always looked to Bears Ears as a place of refuge, as a place where we can gather herbs and plants and as a place of sacredness,” he said. “It is a place of safety and fortitude. It is a place where our ancestors hid and survived from U. S. cavalry during the Long War. ”",0
17907,Rich People Are Living Longer. That’s Tilting Social Security in Their Favor. - The New York Times,"Social Security is designed to ensure that no workers go penniless in old age and also as an equalizer between rich and poor. It is structured to give more generous retirement benefits to   people, given the taxes they pay during their working years. For example, an American man who is consistently in the top 1 percent of earners  —   making $2 million last year  —   will, if he starts taking Social Security benefits at age 66 and lives to be 87, end up with more money than he and his employers paid into the system in taxes during his lifetime. In the language of finance, he would receive an   “internal rate of return” of 1. 07 percent. By contrast, if a member of Mr. Moneybags’s household staff, born the same year, made about $30, 000 annually and also lived to be 87, he would receive a 2. 57 percent return after inflation. That’s quite a decent return  —   a higher rate than any   United States Treasury bonds pay, for example. That’s progressivity in action. Or rather, it would be if Mr. Moneybags and his gardener actually lived to the same age. But in reality, a large body of research shows that the rich live longer  —   and that the life span gap between rich and poor is growing. And that means that the progressive ideal built into the design of Social Security is, gradually, being thwarted. In some circumstances, the program can actually be regressive, offering richer benefits to those who are already affluent. For example, for American men in the top 1 percent like our Mr. Moneybags, 87 really is a typical life span, according to research by the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and seven colleagues that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this month. Alas, a gardener earning $30, 000 a year is unlikely to live that long. Men in that income tier die, on average, at age 78. In this hypothetical case, that   gap in expected life span radically shifts the relative financial return the two men would receive on their tax dollars. If the gardener died at the age Mr. Chetty’s research suggests is typical for men at that income level, he would lose about $115, 000 in benefits, compared with what he would receive if he lived as long as the wealthy man. And he would earn a 0. 92 percent rate of return on his tax dollars  —   a bit lower than that earned by his much wealthier boss. (The numbers on rate of return come from a model built by The New York Times that is based on the Social Security Administration’s work sheet to help people calculate benefits. The data is for people born in 1954 who began their peak earning years in 1980 and worked for 35 years at a constant   income. At most levels, poorer people still experience higher returns than the wealthy even adjusting for life span, though that could change if the life span gap keeps widening.) That result wasn’t obvious when Social Security benefits were designed. The benefits were intended to replace 90 percent of a person’s first dollar of earnings but only 15 percent of their earnings over $5, 157 a month (and nothing above the income cutoff of $9, 875 a month) giving less affluent people a theoretical advantage. But Social Security has always been designed as a social insurance program, not as an investment fund. Essentially, the people who die unusually young subsidize those who live unusually long lives, so if you look at the program on narrow    grounds, a person who lives to 110 is getting a far better deal than people who die a month after they first draw benefits. And because different groups of people have different life expectancies, some groups receive more value from every dollar of payroll taxes they and their employers pay into the system. Over all, women live longer than men and   die younger than whites. The idea that differing life spans between rich and poor would reduce the progressivity of Social Security isn’t new the Brookings Institution economist Henry J. Aaron identified the problem in a 1977 paper. Research published  in 2000 found that, with certain assumptions, the Social Security retirement system as a whole is regressive, or more favorable to the affluent than to the poor. What is new: It is becoming overwhelmingly evident that the life span gap between rich and poor is widening. A study published this year by Barry Bosworth, Gary Burtless and Kan Zhang found that life expectancy for the bottom 10 percent of male wage earners turning 66 this year has risen 0. 7 of a year compared with what was expected for their   counterparts 30 years ago. For the top 10 percent of male wage earners, however, life span rose 8. 1 years in the same period. The research from Mr. Chetty and his colleagues indicates that the richest 1 percent of Americans gained three years of life expectancy from 2001 to 2014 alone, while the poorest had almost no gain (0. 3 of a year). For anyone who believes that it’s important for the Social Security program to remain progressive, the   shifts have big implications that are made more acute by the program’s financial problems. Money coming into the system each year isn’t enough to pay benefits, and the Social Security Trust Fund is forecast to be depleted in 2034. That implies benefit cuts, tax increases or some combination or variation in the years ahead. As lawmakers consider Social Security’s future, the lessons from the latest research on inequality and life span are pressingly relevant. A popular idea among many fiscal centrists and conservatives is to fix the finances of Social Security by increasing the full retirement age. (It is currently 66 and on track to rise to 67, though retirees can take a reduced level of benefits at age 62 and higher levels up to age 70.) But the life span differential suggests that such a change would fall heavily on the backs of the poor. It’s true that on average Americans are living longer than they were in 1983, when the last major overhaul to the finances of the program was made. “The way it’s usually put is: Has the health status of people near retirement age improved across the board?” said Mr. Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “But for many people it has not. People who have done backbreaking work or physically demanding work were no more fit in 1984 than in 1964. ” By contrast, he argued that raising the maximum annual income level on which Social Security taxes are paid, currently $118, 500, would maintain   solvency while not putting more of a burden on the poor. That would effectively raise taxes for   people. Another alternative might be to make the benefits structure more progressive, essentially reducing benefits for   workers only. That points to an important reality: The battles over Social Security aren’t confined to merely technocratic questions. They also concern core issues about government and social justice, and in formulating answers, the new body of research on income and life span really matters.",0

Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: “Like an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, ‘I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.’ “I took a few steps towards them and said, ‘F*** you, I’m Millwall.’ So they started attacking me. “I stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that’s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. “I got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. “They were saying, ‘Islam, Islam!’ I said again, ‘F*** you, I’m Millwall!’ “It was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. “Luckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I’d be dead. ” A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it’s really hard to imagine that he won’t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. “F*** you, I’m Millwall!” has a nice ring to it. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
17910,China Launches 2 Astronauts on Its Longest Space Mission - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   In the latest move in its ambitious space program, China launched a manned spacecraft from the Gobi Desert on Monday morning. Images broadcast on CCTV showed the astronauts giving a salute seconds before launch, and 15 minutes later they could be seen on the live feed clasping their gloved hands, apparently a sign of a successful launch. The spacecraft, called   is to dock with an orbiting space laboratory launched last month. The astronauts are expected to stay in the   lab for 30 days before returning to Earth, the deputy director of China’s Manned Space Agency, Wu Ping, said before the launch. The mission is the third flight for one of the astronauts, Jing Haipeng. “It is any astronaut’s dream and pursuit to be able to perform many space missions,” Mr. Jing said, according to Xinhua, the   news agency. The mission is China’s sixth manned space launch, and by staying aloft for 30 days the two astronauts will more than double the national record for staying in space, CCTV, the national broadcaster reported. The main tasks in the space lab will include testing computers, as well as propulsion and life support systems and other experiments, according to CCTV. The activities in the lab are intended to help China reach its goal of launching a more permanent space station,   in 2018. The docking of the spacecraft with the lab will take place about two days after the liftoff, Chinese space officials said. China launched its first lunar probe in 2013, and plans to land another lunar probe on the far side of the moon by 2018. In 2020, China aims to send an unmanned rover to Mars. The target date for sending an astronaut to the moon is 2025. This year is the 46th anniversary of China’s space program, which has bolstered its spending in the past decade in an effort to catch up with the United States and Russia. Chinese official media reported that the space program expects to complete 20 launches this year, including the deployment of the world’s first quantum communications satellite and a military satellite. The Chinese word for Shenzhou means “heavenly vessel,” and Tiangong means “heavenly palace. ”",0

17912,17 Injured When Hudson River Ferry Hits Dock in Jersey City - The New York Times,"Seventeen passengers aboard a ferry on the Hudson River were injured after it struck a dock in Jersey City on Saturday night, a city spokeswoman said. Three people were removed on stretchers and the rest were able to walk off the ferry, the Peter R. Weiss operated by New York Waterway, said the spokeswoman, Jennifer Morrill. All of the injuries were minor, she said. A spokesman for the Coast Guard, Petty Officer Third Class Steve Strohmaier, said the ferry hit the Paulus Hook dock at a “fast rate of speed” around 7:20 p. m. The ferry, with 57 people on board, was arriving from the World Financial Center in Manhattan when it struck the dock, said Pat Smith, a spokesman for New York Waterway. He described it as a “hard landing” and equated it to a jolt passengers get while the riding the subway. Accounts of the number of injured varied. Ms. Morrill, citing figures from the Jersey City Fire Department, said five passengers were taken to Christ Hospital and 12 to Jersey City Medical Center. Mr. Smith said crew members reported six people injured with bumps and bruises, and Petty Officer Strohmaier said 15 people were injured, with four of them seeking medical attention. Mr. Smith said the ferry, which has a capacity for 150 passengers, was not damaged. Petty Officer Strohmaier said the Coast Guard was investigating.",0
17913,‘Flags of Our Fathers’ Author Now Doubts His Father Was in Iwo Jima Photo - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   It is an iconic photograph of American patriotism, depicting the heroism of service members raising the flag over Iwo Jima during World War II, which inspired the book and movie “Flags of Our Fathers. ” But while the image has become a symbol of the sacrifices of American troops, the Marine Corps has also had to defend it for 70 years against accusations that it was staged and that some of the men were misidentified. Now, the man who wrote the   book, which chronicled how his father and five Marines came together to lift the flag in the famous photograph, has raised new doubts about the image, saying that he now believes his father is not actually in it. The author, James Bradley, revealed his conclusion in an interview on Tuesday, just days after the Marine Corps said that it had opened an inquiry into whether the identifications in the photograph were correct. He said that his father, John, a Navy corpsman, had participated in raising a flag on Iwo Jima on Feb. 23, 1945, but had not taken part in another   the same day, which became the famous photograph. His father, he said, probably thought that the first   was the one that was captured in the famous picture taken by Joe Rosenthal, a photographer for The Associated Press. Mr. Bradley’s doubts tell a story about the fog of war, the efforts of a son to memorialize his father and the apparent willingness of the Marines to at first brush aside questions about one of their most historic moments. Mr. Bradley said he had become convinced that his father was not in the photograph after studying evidence that was published in a 2014 article in The Omaha   which described doubts raised by amateur historians who compared that photograph to images of the first  . They found that the pants, headgear and cartridge belt on the Navy corpsman identified as John Bradley were different from the gear he wore that day. Mr. Bradley said he had waited a year to examine the evidence in the newspaper article because he was working on a new book in Vietnam, and then became ill. He did not come forward with his belief that his father was not in the photograph, he said, because there was little interest from the news media and the Marines. “It wasn’t top of mind,” Mr. Bradley said in the interview. “It wasn’t a priority. I was overseas, and this past fall I was recovering from a disease I got in New Guinea that almost killed me. Now there’s interest in this, and I’m talking about it. I didn’t have the energy to carry the water all by myself. ” The photograph, taken during one of the bloodiest battles of the war, was splashed across the front pages of newspapers throughout the country less than 48 hours after it was taken, exceptionally fast for the time. It was an immediate source of patriotism and controversy. President Harry S. Truman used it to sell bonds to fund the war, and Mr. Rosenthal brushed back accusations that it had been staged. And two years after the image was taken, one of the men identified as being in it hitchhiked to Texas from Arizona to tell the family of a man who died on Iwo Jima that the man had been incorrectly named as one of those depicted. That spurred a congressional investigation that led the military to acknowledge that it had misidentified one of the men. “Flags of Our Fathers,” first published in 2000, was on   lists for nearly a year. It was later made into a movie directed by Clint Eastwood. The photograph was also the inspiration for the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Va. a statue in which six    figures are depicted in the positions captured by Mr. Rosenthal. Mr. Bradley said that his father had met with the sculptor of the memorial, who based some of the figures on his body. All of the men identified in the photograph are dead. Three of the men died fighting the Japanese on Iwo Jima. John Bradley died in 1994. The 2014 article in the Omaha newspaper detailed how Stephen Foley, a man in Ireland who worked at a building supply company, and Eric Krelle, an   historian, had concluded that Mr. Bradley was misidentified after poring over the images and studying uniforms worn on the island. At the time, however, the Marines and James Bradley discounted the research. “Listen, I wrote the book based on facts told to me by guys who had actually been there,” Mr. Bradley was quoted saying in the article. “That’s my research. That’s what I trust. ” He added: “At the end of the day, the truth is the truth. Everything is possible. But really?” The Marines said at the time that they “firmly” stood by the established accounts of who was in the photograph. Last year, Dustin Spence, a historian from California who made a documentary about the   and Mr. Foley approached the Marines with findings that they said showed problems with the identifications, Mr. Spence said in a telephone interview. The Marines, Mr. Spence said, did not seriously look into their claims. “I believe it’s something difficult for some in the Marine Corps to swallow,” Mr. Spence said. The Smithsonian Channel said it had gone to the Marines after “months of thorough, scientific analysis” and had since been working closely with the service. It added that it would broadcast the findings this year. The Marine Corps acknowledged the inquiry in a statement, but provided few details. ”Our history is important to us, and even today, this iconic image still represents the fighting spirit of Marines and is a symbol of the tremendous accomplishments of our corps,” the Marines said. “As such, with the information and research provided by the Smithsonian Channel, who used advanced digital technology to examine battle footage, the Marine Corps decided to review their photo enhancements, film analysis and findings. ” It added, “Joe Rosenthal’s photo captured a single moment in the   battle during which more than 6, 500 U. S. servicemen made the ultimate sacrifice, and it is representative of the more than 70, 000 U. S. Marines, sailors, soldiers and Coast Guardsmen that contributed to the battle. ” A summary on the paperback edition of “Flags of Our Fathers” reads: “Here is the true story behind the six flag raisers and the immortal photograph that came to symbolize the power and courage of America during World War II. In ‘Flags of Our Fathers,’ the son of one of the flag raisers captures the glory, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six ordinary boys who came together at a crucial moment in one of history’s bloodiest battles  —   and lifted the heart and spirit of a nation at war. ”",0

Recently, tensions between law enforcement workers and peaceful protestors with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have escalated. A series of standoffs have resulted in protesters being maced, shot with rubber bullets, tased, and even attacked with concussion cannons. 
After months of struggles to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri River, opposition of the DAPL were blessed when a herd of buffalo appeared out of nowhere. Buffalo were seen on the hill during the current front line standoff at Standing Rock. 
— Kat Maguire (@katworldmusic) October 27, 2016 
I’m in tears over the buffalo appearing at #StandingRock ! The ppl have been praying & the ancestors responded. https://t.co/qouCvCCgtZ 
A cry of joy was heard over the crowd because The Standing Rock Sioux had reportedly been praying for help in the midst of the standoff. 
“The ancestors are with us,” said Myron Dewey, who uploaded video footage of the stampede to Facebook. 
Buffalo are revered as symbols of sacrifice in Native American culture. Indigenous people believe the animals, known as “Tatanka Oyate” or “Buffalo Nation,” sacrifice themselves in order to supply their meat and hides for people. 
According to RT: 
At least 117 demonstrators have been arrested in North Dakota as protesters continue to protest against the construction of the controversial pipeline, which will cut through Native American land. Protesters say its construction will destroy sacred sites and have a negative impact on the region’s water supplies. 
In a statement from the tribe’s chairman, David Archambault II, the leader condemned what he called the recent “militarized law enforcement” against protesters. 
“Militarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today,” he said. “We continue to pray for peace. We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone’s safety.”",0
17915,Is Western Civilization Worth Saving?,"Home This Month Popular Is Western Civilization Worth Saving? Is Western Civilization Worth Saving? Beau Albrecht 
My father was a high-ranking student radical poobah and still thinks Castro is the bees' knees. Although this makes me technically a red diaper baby, I rejected all that baloney early on. These days, I write stories - mostly comedy science fiction - as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice, political commentary, and my writing projects. November 4, 2016 Politics 
By 2050, it’s predicted the USA will no longer have a white majority, which in 1960 was 90%. For this, we can thank Ted Kennedy’s Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which the politicians swore up and down wouldn’t change the American ethnic composition. In Europe, due to declining native birth rates and mass immigration , this will eventually come to pass for several other nations later this century, all according to the Coudenhove-Kalergi Plan . The leftists, with their really big hearts , think all this will be wonderful. 
Globalism and cultural Marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies, but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem . Some think that if Western civilization will go down the toilet, they should just “go with the flow” and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes. Thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination, they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything, and don’t have the slightest concern for their own posterity. Still, they’re pretty naive to believe that things can’t turn far worse within their own lifetimes. Why this is bad (for those who need reminding) In the future, is this going to get better, or worse? 
If trends continue unabated, the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny. History shows that when this happens, the results are not good. Pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times (though not always ) but you’re still not going to like it. Will your new rulers say, “Since things have changed so much, how about we abolish Affirmative Action and set-asides to show we’ve transcended race?” Don’t count on it. More likely, they’ll double down on these preferential treatment programs, and come up with new ones, and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems. 
That’s just the beginning, too. The “ diversification ” of cities for the last several decades has been bad—Detroit, need I say more?—and riots really are getting out of hand. Now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like Section 8 housing moving into your neighborhood, or if you’ll get any real police protection. 
This is what we’re facing if the Aztlán crowd takes over the Southwest, the community agitators get in charge of the big cities, and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the Federal government. (Also remember that they’ve been told since the 1960s that you’re evil oppressors responsible for all their problems.) Parts of “flyover country” might be able to hold out for a while, but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of “progress”. If it were ever to come to secession, they’ll be surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned. Let’s keep things from getting to that point. Is there any hope? “Refugees” have taken on the characteristics of invaders 
I’ve painted a grim picture, but I have to be realistic. As for what will happen later, things only look worse; Jean Raspail’s Camp Of The Saints describes a bleak future like that. This isn’t just the USA on the line, but Western Europe too, and perhaps Eastern Europe and Australia in time. If we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night, the time to act is now. 
Sometimes, with luck, sovereignty can be regained: for example, the Spanish Reconquista, or the nations of the Balkans rising after a few centuries under the Turkish yoke. However, the results aren’t guaranteed; some nations may never recover. In these examples, the “dhimmis” were subjugated under military occupation, but they were not outnumbered in their own lands. The founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place. 
Granted, the dark forces of globalism are very powerful—and they’d like us to think they’re invincible—but they must be stopped. They also want you to think they’re smarter than you and know what’s good for you . (If they’d simply focus on getting richer, and cease their social engineering, they’d have far less to answer for.) Not only has our political establishment failed us, they’re working against the public . It won’t be easy, but we must reassert control over our destiny. Do we deserve to be dispossessed? Brainwashed SJWs welcoming their own destruction 
Some will even say—often with haughty condescension—that if we lose our countries, then we deserve this fate. Ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness, as well as the “might makes right” argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the “prepare to be assimilated, resistance is futile” crowd, let’s consider the following facts: In the 1920s, a Communist propaganda campaign was launched in the Western world. In the 1930s, this mutated into cultural Marxism and kicked into high gear during the 1960s. Most people have no idea of the scope of it all, or where things like political correctness came from. Only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country. Even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another. The rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment. The Western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy. For this reason, we don’t conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days. We play fair, even if our enemies often don’t . Further, political correctness encourages the “disadvantaged” to have solidarity, but vilifies the same in the majority. This is one reason why we’re on the defensive, and (for now) usually losing. Most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption. Those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties, not realizing that they’ve sold out to deep-pockets globalists too. “Mainstream” conservatism is a controlled opposition , providing token resistance at best. 
So with that extent of treachery, disinformation, limited options for resistance, and managed democracy, it’s grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that we’re losing a fair fight! As for their opinion that we should just give up, I have one word: No. 
Whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we “deserve” it, remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening. (The same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is “hatred”.) Suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle, orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness, caring, and honesty. It would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen. The depopulation and population replacement agenda “First, the EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future… The EU should provide 15,000 euros ($16,800) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health-care and education costs—and to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states.” 
Don’t be fooled: this isn’t happening because some vague, invisible force called “progress” is pushing things inevitably in this direction. No, it’s being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural Marxism as a means of control. 
Why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level? The major factors are: Women are encouraged to spend their 20s partying and their 30s trying to get rich in a cube farm. Encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term, and many will miss the chance to begin. Good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates. During recessions, births go down. The implications are obvious. If less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spit-in-your-eye wars, then they’d be able to afford more children. Sending the guilty to prison (instead of bailing them out) when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too. About a third of American babies conceived end up aborted . (Thanks, feminism!) The same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on Death Row is executed, but all that’s another matter. 
Because of declining fertility rates, the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of Third World immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens. So they’ve fed us poison, and to soothe the symptoms, they want to feed us another kind of poison. To hell with that! 
Granted, keeping Social Security going in the USA will be a challenge. Still, it’s pretty uncertain that newly-arriving immigrants—if they become the majority—will be able or willing to support millions of elderly “gringos”. As for future European retirees, will they be well cared for by “refugees” from Africa and the Middle East? The way things are now, many of them prefer rioting , looting, and collecting welfare over working. So these are going to be the people propping up the European retirement programs? 
Dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen. For now, we must educate the rest of the public about what’s going on, and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving. Once we’ve achieved critical mass, we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us What’s in it for us? Whenever someone writes that Western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression, they’re using technology we invented to complain about us. 
It’s fashionable—especially in academia—to bash Western civilization. We’re not perfect, but nobody else is either. The truth is that we’re a creative, dynamic, and industrious people. Some of us are under the impression that we don’t have any culture (only other people do) but that’s mistaken. I could spend all day listing our major artists, composers, poets, philosophers, writers, theologians, and the like, but I only would scratch the surface. 
Other cultures have made notable contributions—particularly East Asia and the Middle East—but the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the Western world. Electricity, motorized transportation, refrigeration, telecommunications, computers (need I go on)? Yep, that was us. We shared our medical advances with the rest of the world, increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe. Whether the world’s future looks more like Star Trek or more like Blade Runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive. 
Finally, most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries. Do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in? Some time in the future, today’s youth will be running the show while we’re elderly. What kind of a place do we want it to be by then? Western civilization is great; let’s keep it going.",0
17916,Chicago’s Top Prosecutor Minces No Words on His Way Out - The New York Times,"On his last day in office, the chief federal prosecutor in Chicago made an impassioned plea for big changes to combat the city’s soaring violence, departing from the Justice Department’s usual   tone to criticize the local political culture, federal budget cuts and   reformers. In a   statement issued as he resigned on Monday, Zachary Fardon, the United States attorney for Northern Illinois, outlined a plan for taking on crime and the ills of the Chicago Police Department, including a pattern of excessive force that was documented by the Justice Department in January. Most of all, he said, the Chicago police need a major increase in resources and a   consent decree, with a monitor, to make sure change occurs. “For decades, C. P. D. has been run on the cheap,” Mr. Fardon wrote. “Officers don’t have the training, the supervision, the equipment or the culture they need and deserve. “If you leave correcting those deficiencies to the vagaries of city politics, then you likely lose the   fight. ” Chicago police officials outlined a plan for improvement on Tuesday that they pledged to follow even if the Justice Department does not pursue a consent decree. Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the police training program would be overhauled, that supervision would be improved by having fewer officers assigned to each sergeant, and that a new    policy would soon be finalized. “We’re not just saying we’re going to reform  —   we’re showing you that we’re reforming,” Mr. Johnson said. “If you go out there right now, C. P. D. is different than it was this time last year. So we don’t need a piece of paper to ensure that we do it. We’re doing it. ” Mr. Fardon was one of 46 United States attorneys whom the Trump administration told on Friday to resign immediately. The suddenness was unusual new presidents routinely remove the prosecutors but often keep them on while searching for their replacements. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, refused to step down and was fired. His counterpart in Montana, Michael W. Cotter, resigned but called the administration’s handling of the matter “very unprofessional. ” A few others called it abrupt and unnecessary. Mr. Fardon’s parting message was different, raising no objection to his ouster. Instead, it was a call to address a surge of violence in Chicago that has defied the efforts of police officers who “in their quiet moments struggled with their own sense of frustration and despair. ” Mr. Johnson called Mr. Fardon “a great partner” to the Police Department and said he agreed with Mr. Fardon’s call for more prosecutions on federal gun laws. He also addressed Mr. Fardon’s claim that police officers had become hamstrung and too passive on patrol. “Listen, there are things within C. P. D. that we did need to fundamentally change, and we’re changing them,” Mr. Johnson said, adding that officers were focusing on arresting gun offenders and other serious criminals. “I think that the    understand that we have a job to do,” he said. “You know, we swore an oath to protect the citizens of the city, and that’s what we’re going to do. ” Donovan Price, an   activist who agreed with parts of Mr. Fardon’s statement, said, “I believe he shed some tears when he wrote this. ” Consent decrees and federal oversight, favorite tools of the Obama administration and police critics, are opposed by many conservatives, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Fardon criticized budget cuts that have thinned the ranks of federal prosecutors. He called for a significant increase and better cooperation among federal law enforcement agencies. But he also said that criticism of the police, and efforts to restrain them, had undermined morale and contributed to the rise in crime  —   a claim often made by conservatives but rejected by liberal advocates of police reform. Mr. Fardon took particular aim at a 2015 agreement between the police and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois that sharply curtailed the number of people  —   primarily black men  —   the police could stop on Chicago’s streets. He wrote that the settlement had told officers, “If you go talk to those kids on the corner, you’re going to have to take 40 minutes to fill out a form. ” He said that change, along with the firing of a police superintendent and the release of a video showing an officer shooting a    Laquan McDonald, 16 times, had created a morale crisis. As officers made fewer stops, he said, “kids started shooting more. ” Karen Sheley, director of police practices for the A. C. L. U. of Illinois, said Mr. Fardon had overstated the burden of the 2015 agreement, adding, “Trying to blame reform for a rise in crime is a mistake. ” Many cities had increases in violent crime last year, but Chicago stood out as homicides jumped more than 50 percent, to 762, more than New York and Los Angeles combined. Mr. Fardon wrote that   communities needed a far bigger police presence and more programs to divert young people from gangs. And he called for an aggressive crackdown on social media, where people air grievances that escalate to gunfire. These prescriptions require money, so their prospects are unsure, at best, in a city and state with serious financial challenges and under an administration in Washington that has promised to cut spending. Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a law enforcement research group, praised some of the ideas and was hesitant about others. But he said it was important that Mr. Fardon had aired them. “There are a lot of people that work in the criminal justice system that feel deeply and personally about these issues, but the public doesn’t hear that very often,” Mr. Bueermann said. “I think more prosecutors and police chiefs should do what he did. ”",0
17917,"Comment on Entitled Customer Slams Restaurant On Yelp, What Happens Next Is Sheer Badassery by customize your own jerseys","Entitled Customer Slams Restaurant On Yelp, What Happens Next Is Sheer Badassery By Tiffany Willis on October 11, 2014 Subscribe 
A customer ( Yelp name Sonal B) was visiting Kansas City for a conference when she decided to try to get take-out food from Voltaire , “an upscale restaurant across the street from her conference building. The only problem with that is that Voltaire doesn’t offer take-out and they never have, by policy.” The customer pitched a fit, threatened to get her “lawyer” husband involved (and did), and threatened the manager with a bad Yelp review, which she did minutes after leaving the restaurant. 
But Voltaire’s owner responded. And it was fabulous. 
The Yelp review: Most unfriendly and arrogant restaurant in KC. Just called Voltaire to try to order some food because we’re in a late business meeting across the street. First, they refused to answer our question about what type of broth is used in the risotto. Then they said they won’t pack food to go. My husband spoke to the manager and explained that we’re in a conference room across the street, and asked if they can pack our dinner (which we would pick up). The hostess flat-out refused to answer our question about the food or to try and work with us so we could get food in our meeting. My husband asked to speak with the manager. The manager, Jamie, said, “our food is plated beautifully, and we can’t put it in a ‘to go’ container.” So thanks, Jamie, we’ll just starve. (What the manager said is just not true by the way we’ve eaten there before, and they did pack our food to go.) When my husband said that he was going to post a Yelp review about the way the restaurant was treating us, the manager questioned, “Are you a grown man and an adult?” Yes, Jamie, we are grown adults, and we do not do business with people who behave like you do. We regularly travel to NYC and eat at a variety of restaurants, which are more than happy to accommodate people by packing food to go. This restaurant thinks they’re too good for their customers. They will soon learn that if you ignore your customers, they’re going to start ignoring you. I would not even give this place one star after this experience, and I’m dismayed by their unprofessional and arrogant behavior. 
The owner’s response: I sincerely apologize that we don’t offer ‘take-out’ food at our restaurant. Being a Yelp user, I’m sure you were aware that on our Yelp business page, on the right side of the screen, it lists details about our establishment. There is an item listed ‘Take-Out : No.’ We have never offered take-out food as we believe the food we prepare should be presented as we see fit, (usually) on a plate inside the dining room. As for the risotto, its made with a vegetable stock – this dish is vegetarian, and I’m certain that who you were speaking with wanted to make extra certain the information provided to you was accurate. On your previous visits, you say you have witnessed dishes being boxed up as proof that we provide ‘take-out’ food. Although we do allow our guests to take their uneaten food with them in to-go boxes after they have dined with us, we have never offered ‘take-out’ food. If you were actually starving, as in a life threatening condition requiring nutritional sustenance, we would be happy to assist you..we do make exceptions for emergency situations. Our general manager did question the age/maturity of your husband after he became combative and threatened us with a negative Yelp review if we did not alter our operational practice and provide him with ‘take-out’ food. 15 minutes later you indeed came through with this threat. I can assure you that we don’t offer ‘take-out’ food because we feel we are ‘too good’ for our customers; we just prefer to have our guests dine with us, allowing for the proper presentation (and temperature) of their fare that has been skillfully prepared by our kitchen. I am very pleased that you frequent New York. We travel often as well. And I can assure you that there are many restaurants in NYC that do not offer ‘take-out’ food. Although there are many other options that do – in Kansas City as well (Go Royals!). It was made REPEATEDLY clear in the conversation with your husband that he is a lawyer. Let me provide the following analogy/role reversal-it may assist in clarifying your request. YOU: I want to hire you to handle my divorce. ME: But, I’m a tax lawyer. YOU: I don’t care I want you to handle my divorce. ME: Sorry, but I don’t practice that form of law. YOU: Just handle my divorce, I’ll pay you-it will be fine. ME: I don’t feel comfortable providing my services as a divorce lawyer, as I am a tax lawyer. You won’t receive the service you are wanting or that I am willing to provide. YOU: Well, I travel to NYC often, and in NYC, Tax lawyers handle my divorce litigation all the time. I don’t know what the problem is. I’ve told you I’m a chef, right? ME: Well, that’s nice sir, but I really can’t help you. It goes against my business practice. YOU: If you don’t represent me in my divorce, I’m going to post it all over the [most frequented social media review of lawyers] that you refused to provide me with the service I requested, and make baseless allegations about how you are very pretentious, arrogant and unprofessional. I will also try to prevent you from getting any additional business by damning you on said social media platform. Now will you represent me? ME: I don’t take kindly to threats. Thanks for your feedback. We will let you know if we decide in the future to practice divorce law, I mean, provide ‘take-out’ food.

17918,A 70-Year-Old Woman Gave Birth—And What You Should Know About It,"posted by Eddie Each one of us has been told about our ticking biological clock, but those in their 30’s or 40’s who are hoping to have kids, probably think having a baby, is just not possible anymore. Well, it is, but with a few risks. But, after hearing the story about a 70-year-old who gave birth, you now have the perfect comeback to whoever says your lady parts are slowly reaching its best-before date. A 70-year-old woman named, Daljinder Kaur, in India has become the world’s first-mom to give birth to a son, using in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Despite, two failed pregnancies before, the third time was the charm, giving her a boy she named, Arman. What’s more is, it’s been years since Daljinder had her menopause (the end of a woman’s menstrual cycle in life), so theory has it that Daljinder used an egg from a younger donor, although this has not been confirmed. Studies by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) say that although medicine has endless phenomenon, a woman’s chances of fertility does reduce as they age. This usually occurs by the early-30’s, and plummets faster by their late-30’s. The reason for this is because a woman is born with just one to two million eggs and they are lost gradually with each menstrual cycle, till it finally ends. By the early 50’s, when menopause begins on average, there may be just around a thousand eggs left. But IVF and other assisted reproductive procedures, is usually taken up as a solution to this, especially women who are suffering from infertility and want to improve their chances of getting pregnant. So here’s how IVF works. An egg is taken from a woman and fertilized using a man’s sperm, outside of the body. The embryo is then placed back inside the woman’s womb with the hope that she will get pregnant. The age-limit for allowing IVF and such procedures, in the US is those in their mid-40’s or 50’s. In addition, women in their 40’s are usually impregnated with donor eggs from women in their 20’s and 30’s, to increase their fertility chances. Statistics suggest that women for all ages recorded, who used donor eggs, had a 50% success rate and gave birth. However, a 70-year-old is stretching it a bit, making Daljinder one of the oldest women on the planet to give birth. This is despite the fact that, aged women have a lower blood flow to their uterus, making it close to impossible to conceive and sustain a baby’s life through the pregnancy. It could also take a huge toll on an older woman’s body and put their heart at risk, as it would be unable to handle the blood flow for their own body, let alone a baby. Old-age also comes with its classic creaks from high blood pressure to diabetes and weak bone structures. So, could Daljinder’s case change the face of fertility possibilities as we know it? As a fellow myth-buster, maybe. But the older-mom trend is on a rise, such as, 50-year-old Janet Jackson, who is now pregnant with her first baby as well as Halle Berry who gave birth when she was 47. And hearing from the woman who made history herself, Daljinder’s says she is doing well and feels blessed to hold her own baby. Whoever said motherhood is timeless, has probably found a whole new dimension of meaning to it now. Source:",0
17919,The Chinese Hackers in the Back Office - The New York Times,"BELLEVILLE, Wis.  —   Drive past the dairy farms, cornfields and horse pastures here and you will eventually arrive at Cate Machine  Welding, a   business run by Gene and Lori Cate and their sons. For 46 years, the Cates have welded many things  —   fertilizer tanks,   parts, cheese molds, even a farmer’s broken glasses. And like many small businesses, they have a dusty old computer humming away in the back office. On this one, however, an unusual    battle is playing out: The machine has been taken over by Chinese hackers. The hackers use it to plan and stage attacks. But unbeknown to them, a Silicon Valley   is tracking them here, in real time, watching their every move and, in some cases, blocking their efforts. “When they first told us, we said, ‘No way,’” Mr. Cate said one afternoon recently over pizza and cheese curds, recalling when he first learned the computer server his family used to manage its welding business had been secretly repurposed. “We were totally freaked out,” Ms. Cate said. “We had no idea we could be used as an infiltration unit for Chinese attacks. ” On a recent Thursday, the hackers’ targets appeared to be a Silicon Valley food delivery   a major Manhattan law firm, one of the world’s biggest airlines, a prominent Southern university and a smattering of targets across Thailand and Malaysia. The New York Times viewed the action on the Cates’ computer on the condition that it not name the targets. The activity had the hallmarks of Chinese hackers known as the C0d0s0 group, a collection of hackers for hire that the security industry has been tracking for years. Over the years, the group has breached banks, law firms and tech companies, and once hijacked the Forbes website to try to infect visitors’ computers with malware. There is a murky and much hyped emerging industry in selling intelligence about attack groups like the C0d0s0 group. Until recently, companies typically adopted a defensive strategy of trying to make their networks as impermeable as possible in hopes of repelling attacks. Today,   threat intelligence providers sell services that promise to go on the offensive. They track hackers, and for annual fees that can climb into the seven figures, they try to spot and thwart attacks before they happen. These companies have a mixed record of success. Still, after years of highly publicized incidents, Gartner, a market research company, expects the market for threat intelligence to reach $1 billion next year, up from $255 million in 2013. Remarkably, many attacks rely on a tangled maze of compromised computers including those    shops like Cate Machine  Welding. The hackers aren’t after the Cates’ data. Rather, they have converted their server, and others like it, into launchpads for their attacks. These servers offer the perfect cover. They aren’t terribly well protected, and rarely, if ever, do the owners discover that their computers have become conduits for spies and digital thieves. And who would suspect the Cate family? Two years ago, the Cates received a visit from men informing them that their server had become a conduit for Chinese spies. The Cates asked: “Are you from the N. S. A. ?” One of the men had, in fact, worked at the National Security Agency years before joining a   company, Area 1, that focuses on tracking digital attacks against businesses. “It’s like being a priest,” said Blake Darché, Area 1’s chief security officer, of his N. S. A. background. “In other people’s minds, you never quite leave the profession. ” Mr. Darché wanted to add the Cates’ server to Area 1’s network of 50 others that had been   by hackers. Area 1 monitors the activity flowing into and out of these computers to glean insights into attackers’ methods, tools and websites so that it can block them from hitting its clients’ networks, or give them a   days, weeks or even months before they hit. The Cates called a family meeting. “People work really hard to make products, and they’re getting stolen,” Ms. Cate said. “It seemed like the least we could do. ” Area 1 paid for the installation cost, about $150. Shortly after installing a sensor on the machine, Mr. Darché said his hunch was confirmed: The sensor lit up with attacks. Area 1 began to make out the patterns of a familiar adversary: the C0d0s0 group. Area 1 was founded by three former N. S. A. analysts, Mr. Darché, Oren Falkowitz and Phil Syme. The three sat side by side at Fort Meade, tracking and, in some cases, penetrating adversaries’ weapons systems for intelligence. A little over two years ago, they decided to start their own company and raised $25. 5 million in funding from major venture capitalists and security entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, including Kleiner Perkins Caulfield  Byers and Cowboy Ventures, and security veterans like Ray Rothrock, the chief executive of RedSeal, and Derek Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security. Area 1 is a new player in threat intelligence, a nascent subsector of the security business that includes companies like iSight Partners and Recorded Future that track attackers in underground web forums and on social media, gleaning intelligence about them. Threat intelligence is still more art than science. The jury is still out on whether companies are equipped to use that intelligence to thwart hackers. Area 1 claims that it can head off attacks through the compromised servers it is tracking. It can also use its vantage point to see where attackers are setting up shop on the web and how they plan to target their intended victims. A handful of Area 1 customers confirmed that its technology had helped head off attackers. One client, a chief information security officer at a large health care provider, said the health care sector had been slammed by digital criminals and governments in recent years. He asked that the company not be named, to avoid becoming a more visible target. He credited Area 1’s sensors with blocking several attacks on his network, helping his company avoid the fates of the health insurer Anthem, which was breached by Chinese hackers last year, and a growing number of hospitals hit by attacks that have forced them to pay a ransom to get important information back. Mr. Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security, said Area 1 gave his company warning of three attacks before they happened, providing time to block them. Mr. Smith said he was impressed enough that he made a small investment in Area 1. “Many of these    shops are ambivalent because the attacks don’t directly impact their business and revenue,” he said. “Meanwhile, they unwittingly operate this attack infrastructure. ” But Area 1’s business model can pose ethical dilemmas. What does the company do when it sees attacks against prominent companies and government agencies who are not Area 1 customers? “We think of ourselves as a bodyguard, not a police force that runs around telling everyone they’re a victim,” said Mr. Falkowitz, Area 1’s chief executive. “We’re in the business of  . ” They do warn some victims, he said. For instance, they tipped off a law firm, a manufacturer, a financial services firm and electronics company that were attacked via the Cates’ server after they saw the C0d0s0 hackers make off with their intellectual property. Some of those victims, including the law firm, later signed up for Area 1 services. Not all companies heed the warning. A security consultant for one victim, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements, said that his client chose not to act on a tip from Area 1 last year out of concern that a scandal over a successful online attack against the company would jeopardize its recent acquisition. It figured its acquirer would not have been thrilled to learn that the  ’s proprietary technology was now in Chinese hacker’s hands. Posted on the wall of Area 1’s headquarters in a historic house in Redwood City, Calif. is a list titled “45 Things That Are Harder Than Cybersecurity. ” It includes flight, solar power, the flu vaccine, brain surgery, the internet, heart transplants, skyscrapers, the Thermos and the  . Mr. Falkowitz disagrees with a growing concern that it is too difficult or impossible to stop online attacks. As attackers have grown more sophisticated, many security companies have stopped believing they can block attacks with traditional defenses like antivirus software. Instead, many focus on trying to detect an intrusion “in real time,” to catch hackers before they steal too much. Eighty percent of the time, victims learn they have been breached only when law enforcement or someone else shows up with their stolen data, according to Verizon, which tracks breach data. At the N. S. A. Mr. Falkowitz had worked with teams that detected North Korean missile launches. Much of that early work was done with satellites that would look for sudden heat blasts. Eventually, Mr. Falkowitz’s team tried a more proactive approach. If they could hack the computers that controlled the missile launch systems, they could glean launch schedules. Area 1 is now taking a similar approach to digital attacks, tapping into the attackers’ launchpads, as it were, rather than waiting for them to attack. Hackers don’t just press a big red “attack” button one day. They do reconnaissance, scout out employees on LinkedIn, draft carefully worded emails to trick unsuspecting employees to open them and click on links or email attachments that will try to launch malicious attacks. Once they persuade a target to click  —   and 91 percent of attacks start this way, according to Trend Micro, the security firm  —   it takes time to crawl through a victim’s network to find something worth taking. Then they have to pull that data off the network. The process can take weeks, months, even years and leaves a digital trail. Area 1 watches for this kind of activity and then teams up with firms like Blue Coat, a web security company, to build what it has learned into security software that can try to block attacks when they come. The owners of Cate Machine  Welding say that living with Chinese attackers in your office can be a strange feeling. Recently, Area 1 executives visited the shop and showed them some of what they had learned from watching their computer. The C0d0s0 group had used their server to pilfer a law firm’s due diligence on an impending acquisition, a financial services firm’s confidential trading plans, a mobile payment  ’s proprietary source code, some blueprints and loan applications at a mortgage company. Hearing that, Mr. Cate expressed pride  —   and maybe even a hint of schadenfreude. For years, the welding business that is his family’s bread and butter has been migrating to China. Now his family is helping American businesses fight back. “We want to do the right thing for these businesses,” Mr. Cate said, “For our country. ”",0
17920,Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person - The New York Times,"IT’S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the wrong person. Partly, it’s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others. We seem normal only to those who don’t know us very well. In a wiser, more   society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: “And how are you crazy?” Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working perhaps we’re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation. Nobody’s perfect. The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day. As for our friends, they don’t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more  . Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we’ve done our homework. We haven’t. Marriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating. For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons: because her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle to keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text. And from such reasonable marriages, there flowed loneliness, infidelity, abuse, hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors. The marriage of reason was not, in hindsight, reasonable at all it was often expedient,   snobbish and exploitative. That is why what has replaced it  —   the marriage of feeling  —   has largely been spared the need to account for itself. What matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right. Indeed, the more imprudent a marriage appears (perhaps it’s been only six months since they met one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens) the safer it can feel. Recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason, that catalyst of misery, that accountant’s demand. The prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason. But though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage, it isn’t that simple. What we really seek is familiarity  —   which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness. We are looking to recreate, within our adult relationships, the feelings we knew so well in childhood. The love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent’s warmth or scared of his anger, of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes. How logical, then, that we should as   find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right  —   too balanced, mature, understanding and reliable  —   given that in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign. We marry the wrong people because we don’t associate being loved with feeling happy. We make mistakes, too, because we are so lonely. No one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky otherwise, we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate. Finally, we marry to make a nice feeling permanent. We imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: Perhaps we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea, chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before, with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later. We married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage. Indeed, marriage tends decisively to move us onto another, very different and more administrative plane, which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house, with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle. The good news is that it doesn’t matter if we find we have married the wrong person. We mustn’t abandon him or her, only the founding Romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning. We need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us  —   and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for. This philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage. It might sound odd, but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage. The failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded. The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn’t exist) but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently  —   the person who is good at disagreement. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the “not overly wrong” person. Compatibility is an achievement of love it must not be its precondition. Romanticism has been unhelpful to us it is a harsh philosophy. It has made a lot of what we go through in marriage seem exceptional and appalling. We end up lonely and convinced that our union, with its imperfections, is not “normal. ” We should learn to accommodate ourselves to “wrongness,” striving always to adopt a more forgiving, humorous and kindly perspective on its multiple examples in ourselves and in our partners.",0

17924,"Home Runs Are Way, Way Up. So Are the Theories Why. - The New York Times","SAN DIEGO  —   The   dressed in yellow and brown on Monday, making the field at Petco Park look, from above, like a grill full of cheeseburgers. The homage to the host San Diego Padres, who once wore similar uniforms, helped distinguish Home Run Derby day from every other day of this curious baseball season. Home runs are up. Way, way up. Baseball arrived at the   break with hitters on pace for more than 5, 600 home runs, a level exceeded only once in history: in 2000, at the height of the steroid era. “I’d like to say that guys aren’t cheating,” said Stephen Vogt, the Oakland Athletics’ catcher. “Everybody’s going to speculate  —   right?  —   when the home run numbers go up. But we are cleaning up the game, and I hope that’s not the reason behind it. ” Before 2003, when baseball began testing for   drugs, we searched for reasons to explain the surge in home runs. Expansion, smaller ballparks and better nutrition all played a part  —   but history, rightly, gave steroids most of the blame. So what now? Besides Dee Gordon  —   last year’s National League leader in batting average and steals  —   the players caught in this season’s drug net have mostly been marginal. Perhaps some sluggers are beating the system, but a widespread cheating epidemic seems unlikely. But something is happening. Two years ago, there were 4, 186 home runs, or 0. 86 per team per game. That was the lowest figure in any of the last 20 full seasons, dating to 1996. This season, there are 1. 16 homers per team per game, up from 1. 01 in 2015. Put another way, at the current pace, home runs will rise by more than 700 over the previous season for the second year in a row. That’s a lot more balls soaring over fences, and one pitcher is keeping his theories private. “I’m not going to be the one who throws that stone,” said Washington Nationals starter Max Scherzer, who leads the National League in homers allowed. “I’m not going to sit here and say anything and make accusations. That’s not the way you do things. But if they are up significantly, it would be interesting to see what M. L. B. actually thinks about it. ” Mike Teevan, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said the league does “extensive reviews of the performance of the baseball, and there have been no differences” to explain the increase in homers. Strikeouts, said starter Jon Lester of the Chicago Cubs, are also rising, and hitters are taking a different approach. “I know our hitting coach wants you to hit the ball in the air,” Lester said. “There’s no slug on the ground. Guys are willing to take their   to hit the ball in the air, and swing hard in case they hit it. ” That theory would seem to make sense, especially as hitters react to the increasing use of extreme infield shifts. Yet the overall percentage of fly balls has not risen. According to Fangraphs, it is 34. 2 percent now only two of the past 15 seasons have been lower. What has changed is that a greater percentage of fly balls are turning into home runs. At 12. 9 percent, that figure is the highest it has been since Fangraphs started tracking the statistic in 2002. At least in one sense, perhaps, throwing harder may be working against pitchers. “Secondary stuff isn’t as big of a thing as it used to be, I feel like,” Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said. “It’s now, ‘Can you throw 98, 99?’ And a lot of breaking balls that are hanging end up getting hit out. “That’s my theory: The types of arms that are getting moved through the system are guys that can really throw hard, and command sometimes comes later for them. But they get to the big league level while they’re throwing hard, and then they learn command. Home runs, more times than not, are mistakes  —   they’re not the wrong pitch, they’re just mistakes in the middle of the plate. ” Vogt, the Oakland catcher, said he had been calling more fastballs up in the zone lately, because umpires seem more willing to call them strikes. Missing with a high fastball can lead to home runs, of course, and so can a poorly placed cutter. If a cutter does not dart sharply at the last moment, it is just a slower fastball that stays in a hitter’s bat path. “The cutter has become such a big pitch, and more guys are trying to throw it,” Vogt said. “But a cutter that doesn’t cut is a really good pitch to hit out. ” Vogt and other catchers, like San Francisco’s Buster Posey and Milwaukee’s Jonathan Lucroy, said they had noticed nothing different about the actual baseballs  —   which, of course, they handle just as often as pitchers, though not with the same intent. “We throw those things so much, we’d be able to tell if there’s something different about them,” Lucroy said. Lucroy pointed to recent changes at ballparks  —   like Petco Park, Citi Field and Marlins Park, where fences have all come in  —   as having an impact. But some pitchers, like Texas’ Cole Hamels, have thrived at smaller venues because they have multiple weapons to keep hitters guessing. Younger pitchers are rarely as skilled. “It’s not only having that second pitch, but having that third pitch,” Hamels said. “It’s easier for hitters to have success when it’s    —   a lot better than a 25 percent chance. So when guys don’t have four pitches they can essentially throw for strikes, that makes it a lot tougher. Guys are just homing in on certain counts and what guys have done statistically in the past, and they’re getting it. ” Daniel Murphy of the Nationals best embodies the trend around him. Murphy made the   team with the Mets in 2014, when he played a full season and hit nine homers. Now he has 17 to go with a . 348 average. Murphy emphasizes damage over contact, with startling results  —   and fastballs do not bother him. “Guys throw so hard now, you either become accustomed to it or you have to find another line of work,” Murphy said. “The more velocity you see, you’re able to slow it down a little more. ” That last sentence might only make sense in the peculiar orbit of baseball, where fast can mean slow and a trend can quickly reverse itself.",0
17925,The Two Bibles Donald Trump Used at the Inauguration - The New York Times,"When Donald J. Trump takes the oath of office on Friday, he will do so with his hand on two Bibles: his own, and one used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Only one other president has used that Bible for the oath: Mr. Trump’s predecessor. Thomas Barrack Jr. the chairman of Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee, said in a statement earlier this week that the   “is humbled to place his hand on Bibles that hold special meaning both to his family and to our country. ” Mr. Trump’s personal Bible was given to him by his mother in 1955, two days before his ninth birthday, according to a statement from the inaugural committee. He had just completed the Sunday Church Primary School at the First Presbyterian Church in Queens, where he grew up. To use the Lincoln Bible, the inaugural committee has to borrow it from its permanent home at the Library of Congress. Lincoln swore the oath on it at his first inaugural in 1861, as the United States stood on the cusp of the Civil War. It was not used again at an inauguration until the election of Barack Obama, who was sworn in on it in 2009 and again in 2013. Conservationists at the Library of Congress said the book was ready for another big day, though they have wary eyes turned toward a weather forecast that hints at the possibility of rain. “We always have it in the back of our mind that this might be happening,” said Elmer Eusman, who is the head of conservation. “So we’re prepared. ” “We already had made a protective box for it for Obama’s inauguration,” he said, adding that the library is creating a Mylar wraparound for the cover to protect it from rain. Mr. Eusman said the library would also have someone on standby who will be notified immediately if the Bible has been damaged and will whisk it back to a conservation lab for immediate repair. The steps are mostly precautionary. The Lincoln Bible is in good shape, and “it can certainly sustain this kind of activity,” said Mark Dimunation, the head of rare books and special collections. The Bible was given to the library by Mary Lincoln, the widow of Robert Todd Lincoln, the president’s son, Mr. Dimunation said. The collection also included the contents of President Lincoln’s pocket from the night he was killed. “We’ve used it from time to time in exhibitions, and when we talk about Lincoln, it gives us the opportunity to bring out the Bible and talk about the content of the first inaugural address,” Mr. Dimunation said. “It does have a certain kind of electricity about it because of the nature of that inaugural event. ” Because his election had been so divisive  —   between the election and the inauguration, seven states had seceded from the Union  —   there was real concern that Lincoln would be attacked and so he was smuggled into Washington. His household effects, including his family Bible, were still being shipped from Springfield, Ill. Mr. Dimunation said. A clerk for the Supreme Court, William Thomas Carroll, was sent out to buy what became the Lincoln Bible. The book is an 1853 Oxford University Press printing of the King James Bible, Mr. Eusman said, and it is bound in burgundy velvet with metal trim. It is approximately six by four inches and about an inch and a quarter thick. “It’s not very big,” he said. The back holds a large blue paper seal on yellow paper, where Mr. Carroll recorded the events of the day. “It has an accretion of ceremonial use that really gives this object an emotional and historical weight at this point,” Mr. Dimunation said. While the Constitution requires presidents to take an oath of office, there is no rule requiring them to do so with their hands on a religious book, or any book at all. Most have used a family Bible. The Bible used by George Washington at the first inauguration has been popular with his successors. Warren G. Harding, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush all used it, and in 2001, George W. Bush had made preparations to be the sixth president to do so. Members of the New York Masonic temple that cares for the bible carried it to the Capitol, but rain intervened. Mr. Bush used his father’s family Bible instead. In 1825, John Quincy Adams was sworn in on a law book, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Adams was also, according to the committee, the first president to wear long trousers at his inauguration, breaking with the five presidents before him, who all had worn knee breeches. Lyndon B. Johnson, a Protestant, was sworn in aboard Air Force One using a Roman Catholic missal, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The prayer book had been found at Kennedy’s bedside table on the plane. And in 1901, Theodore Roosevelt was hiking in the Adirondack Mountains when he received word that William McKinley was not likely to survive being shot in Buffalo. By the time Roosevelt got there, McKinley had died. “When he arrived there was a fair amount of confusion,” said Mark Lozo, the director of education and interpretation at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site in Buffalo. “They were still making arrangements for administering the oath of office. ” No Bible could be found for the   ceremony at the home of Roosevelt’s friend Ansley Wilcox, now the site of the museum. “With the ceremony already underway, they decided to proceed without one,” Mr. Lozo said.",0

Quite a few Trump voters in Maryland have checked their votes and discovered this, with the election officials explaining that it was an electronic/mechanical error.

17928,California Today: Some Opt to Pass on Thanksgiving Politics - The New York Times,"Good morning. Please note: California Today is taking a break on Thursday and Friday for the holiday. We’ll be back on Monday. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) For Thanksgiving this year, many Americans are anticipating turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie  —   and postelection combat with relatives. Every election provokes some level of stress among voters, but mental health professionals say that the polarization of this year’s presidential race appeared to have amplified the tension. “It was a very significant stressor for people this year,” said Dr. Vaile Wright, director of research and special projects at the American Psychological Association. On Tuesday, we asked readers to tell us whether they expected their Thanksgiving gatherings to provide a stage for potential blowups as   relatives congregate for the first time since Election Day. Several people wrote to say they planned to adhere to a    rule. Others said they were taking a more extreme approach  —   avoiding Thanksgiving   altogether. For those disappointed by the presidential outcome, much of the anxiety stemmed from concerns that relatives who supported Donald J. Trump might gloat about his victory. Vince Garcia, 48, said he heard rumblings that two relatives were planning to wear Trump gear at their Thanksgiving gathering. “Quite honestly I’m not looking forward to it at all,” he wrote in an email. Martin Johnson, a retired engineer in San Clemente, said he and his wife worried that sparks could fly during their gathering of 18 family members. About half are loyal Democrats, he said, and half dedicated Trump supporters. If things get out of hand, Mr. Johnson, 66, said he planned to tell his guests: “Just put all that stuff in a shoe box and put it on a shelf. Let’s just not get into that topic. ” Dr. Wright said avoiding politics was sometimes the right approach. If the election outcome is weighing heavily on your mind, Thanksgiving can be a time to talk about it, she said. But if reconnecting with family is what’s most important, it could be wise to just postpone the political talk for another time. Kathy Winter, 61, a reader in San Diego, wrote in with a reminder that Thanksgiving is intended to be a moment to count blessings and connect with family. But, she added, “If we are all mature adults, we should be able to talk politics. ” • The Salinas Valley, known as the salad bowl of the nation, is struggling with a crisis of poverty and malnutrition among its farmworkers.

We asked Cortney Burns, a chef at Bar Tartine in San Francisco, to suggest a dish that takes advantage of the fall season. She offered this one from a book she wrote with Nicolaus Balla, “Bar Tartine: Techniques  Recipes,” winner of a 2015 James Beard award: Potato and Green Bean Soup This is a soup to make in late summer, or autumn when the days get shorter and the green beans grow big and tough. It is ideal for those    beans, which are much better cooked well past the bright green and crisp stage that culinary professionals prize. In this soup, the beans are cooked   until they are quite tender and develop a deep, earthy flavor. The butter that floats on the surface of this soup is essential to the soup’s texture and flavor. We recommend you use cultured butter, which has a subtle tang. You can make it yourself or buy it. Serves 4 to 6 1 tbsp. filtered grapeseed oil or good cooking oil 1 sweet white onion, cut into 1⁄    dice 4 garlic cloves, minced 3   ML vegetable or poultry broth 12   g russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1⁄    dice 1   g green beans, trimmed and cut into 3⁄    pieces 3   ML buttermilk 1 tbsp. plus 2 tsp. kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1   ML sour cream 3 tbsp. apple cider vinegar 2 tbsp. butter, melted Chopped fresh   parsley for garnish Chopped fresh dill for garnish Chopped fresh chives for garnish Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat until a drop of water flicked on the surface sizzles gently on contact. Add the grapeseed oil, then immediately add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are slightly softened but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the broth, potatoes and green beans and simmer until the potatoes are tender enough to be easily pierced with a skewer, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a blender, combine 2   ML of the broth and vegetables and the buttermilk and purée until smooth. Add the purée back to the saucepan, add the salt and 1⁄2 tsp. pepper, and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook gently until heated through, about five minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 3⁄4   ML of the sour cream and the vinegar. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and garnish with melted butter, the remaining 1⁄4   ML sour cream, the parsley, dill, chives, and plenty of pepper. Leftover soup will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.

17929,"‘Veep’ and ‘Game of Thrones’ Echo Our Politics, as Farce and Tragedy - The New York Times","In Sunday’s season premiere of HBO’s “Veep,” Selina Meyer (Julia  ) is locked in a cliffhanger   tie, girding for a recount in Nevada and facing the possibility that Congress may give the presidency to her running mate and frenemy, Tom James (Hugh Laurie). But her more immediate problem is appearing in public with an enormous “stress pimple” on her face. Richard Nixon had a cancer on the presidency. “Veep” has a zit on the president. Over four seasons, “Veep,” created by Armando Iannucci (the BBC’s “The Thick of It”) has been American politics’ most obscenely funny satire, developing a feel for the war of appearances and the exquisite humiliations of Washington. By focusing on the vice presidency, the spare tire of democracy, it rendered the government small enough to drown in an acid bathtub. Its fifth season is in fine, familiar form. But something funny has happened to its context. Amid the threats, apocalypticism and ugly passions of the 2016 election, its bloodless cynicism and petty stakes are almost reassuring, like President Bartlet’s idealism was after the Clinton impeachment. This is what we’ve come to, America. “Veep” is now our “West Wing. ” As expressed through Ms.  ’s electric hunger, “Veep” is about the Sisyphean tease of being this close to power and never quite grasping it. Even when Selina became president last season, after a surprise resignation, she was already   empowered but not elected, sworn in but not ratified. In the premiere, Selina addresses the public    —   “It falls to the people to choose their president, and that is what you attempted to do last night”  —   and assembles a team to litigate the recount. (  she snaps, “I forgot to thank the voters for making our country look like a high school Spanish club. ”) The tie puts the new season in the zone of uncertainty where “Veep” thrives, a Schrödinger’s Oval Office in which Selina is simultaneously president and not president. Her toadies and allies of convenience are unsure where the power lies now, who best to suck up to. Mr. Iannucci left the show after Season 4, but while his caustic language is indispensable, it is fortunately not inimitable. The new episodes are just as amorally hilarious. When Selina needs to keep a conversation from going public, she tells her aide Amy (Anna Chlumsky) “This meeting cannot make it past the schoolbook depository. ” Amy answers, “I’m loading my gun, I’m going to the sixth floor. ” Right, Amy’s back. You remember her quitting in exasperation last year? On “Veep,” fits of principle are seasonal, like allergies. If a character wants something  —   a job, a bill, a policy  —   you can bet that thing will soon become undesirable and the character will switch positions on a dime. At the Nevada recount, Meyer staffers organize a protest when they realize that the decision they’re arguing for would go against them, they change the chant midrally. That’s democracy, but “Veep” is only nominally about politics. It’s about careerists, workaholics who marry their jobs and sleep with their phones. The closest thing to love here is the creepy filial devotion of Selina’s body man, Gary (Tony Hale). The more likely a character is to have actual feeling  —   say, Selina’s daughter, Catherine (Sarah Sutherland)  —   the more ridiculous she is. Everyone else is just a résumé with a pulse. We’ve seen joyless ambition on another show about a    “House of Cards. ” (“Veep” even has a similar story line about using a family medical crisis for a political bump.) But “Veep” makes the point more universal by making it less histrionic. Few of us can be monsters like the Underwoods, but we all have it in us to be as pathetic as the Meyer staff. It’s tempting to say that life has caught up to “Veep. ” It’s true this election shares the series’s    linguistic fixation, though “Veep” doesn’t bother with “small hands” euphemisms. A subplot in which Selina hires a grizzled recount expert (Martin Mull) echoes today’s candidates enlisting   who remember the arcane game of contested conventions. But there’s a piece missing: the fury, resentment and zealotry driving the real election. They may exist in “Veep,” but they’re somewhere offscreen, out in   . That none of the Beltway lifers in “Veep” believe in anything is not exactly unrealistic, but it’s also oddly comforting. They may be the worst, but at least they lack all conviction. For the dangers of passionate intensity, watch “Game of Thrones,” which returns for its sixth season an hour and a half earlier on Sunday. Beyond its derrières and dragons, “Thrones” has been an astute study of power politics and flexible alliances. (Give Littlefinger 30 minutes on the convention floor in Cleveland and he’d be picking out the White House drapes.) A story line from last season feels especially prescient today. (HBO has kept the new episodes locked in its own Iron Bank.) After years of war, a   religious movement has emerged in Westeros, led by the High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce). The Queen Mother Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) in need of allies, raises him to High Septon of the Faith of the Seven, restoring the church’s private military in hope that he will use it against her enemies. He does  —   but then his puritans turn on the corrupt ruling class, including Cersei. Not unlike certain party establishments, Cersei believed the High Sparrow’s   base could be useful as long as she harnessed its rage for her purposes. She ended the season its prisoner, paraded nude before a jeering, misogynist crowd by a holy woman chanting “Shame!” Her final hope for vengeance lies in the brawny form of a mysterious, unspeaking knight whose face is hidden by armor. (Paul Ryan? Is that you?) All analogies break down, of course. Donald J. Trump may be a populist insurgent, yet he shares the establishment Lannisters’ taste for gold. But between these two series, you can assemble something like a full sense of our political moment. Come to “Game of Thrones” for the shame. Stay through “Veep” for the shamelessness.",0
17930,"Apple’s New MacBook Pro: Fast and Light, but Not for Everyone - The New York Times","When Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro laptops at a media event last month, Adam Leventhal, a software engineer, was eager to learn about them. Yet by the time he finished watching a live stream of the event, Mr. Leventhal, who has owned only Mac computers for the last 30 years, was turned off. “With this one I was really disappointed,” he said. For a new laptop, the MacBook Pro has been divisive. That may partly be because the model, which has long been used by creative professionals and coders, has stayed largely the same since 2012. So this time, when Apple introduced some fairly radical changes, emotions among some longtime Mac customers ran high. In their latest incarnation, MacBook Pros have only one type of connection port, as opposed to the several types they had before. That will require people to buy adapters to plug in devices that use different types of connectors. On the keyboard, Apple also replaced the top row of physical keys, including the Escape key, with a virtual touch strip called the Touch Bar. The benefits? The new laptops are faster, much thinner and lighter than the previous generation, and they have about 10 hours of battery life. The Touch Bar’s virtual buttons transform depending on the app you are using, unlocking the potential for software makers to create custom shortcuts. I tested the new MacBook Pros  —   which cost $1, 500 to $2, 800, depending on the model  —   while gathering reactions to the new computers from engineers and information technology professionals over two weeks. I concluded that while the new laptops are capable enough for many professionals, there is no need to rush to buy one. Here are the highlights and lowlights of the new MacBook Pros: With the new laptops, Apple has gone all in on   the   USB port. This small,   connection is expected to replace the bulkier, rectangular port known as   on many computing devices and accessories in the next few years. In my tests, having only   on the MacBook Pros was the biggest change. The previous MacBook Pros included   and some other types of ports, including HDMI, for connecting devices like printers and monitors. Now the   ports will be the only way to hook up just about everything, including power chargers, external screens and   readers, to the laptop. The   MacBook Pro has two   ports, and the   models include four. What this means in the near term is that you may have to buy adapters to plug in devices with different connectors. Annoyingly, that includes the iPhone power cable, which has a   connector. So to charge an iPhone on a new MacBook Pro, for example, you have to hook up the cable to a dongle that connects   and   devices. The transition to   might be a headache, but it is easily resolved by picking up some inexpensive adapters. I bought mine from Monoprice. In the long run, Apple’s shift to   will help set an industry standard, said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. The goal is to reach a point where all peripheral devices are made with a   connector. So eventually you won’t need adapters. “We’re going to cut ties with the past and go with the new standard, finally,” Mr. Denslow said. With the Touch Bar, Apple intended to replace some outdated keys with a versatile strip that adapts to the apps you are using. Apple also built a fingerprint sensor into the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is a breeze to get the hang of, but I didn’t find it helpful in streamlining tasks. If you open the Photos app, for example, the Touch Bar displays thumbnails of photos in your library, and you can tap one to select a photo to edit. That’s neat, but why not just select the photo on your laptop screen? When using the Safari browser, you can use the Touch Bar to select a different browser tab  —   but using keyboard shortcuts (Command+1 to choose the first tab, for instance) is quicker. The Escape key also exists as a virtual button on the Touch Bar. I didn’t mind that because I rarely use this key, but the design decision made Mr. Leventhal, the software engineer, wince. He said the physical Escape key was crucial for coders, and not being able to press it seemed crippling. The jury is still out on whether the Touch Bar will be a  . When switching back to a laptop with a normal keyboard, I didn’t feel as if I was missing anything. But much like the iPhone on Day 1, the Touch Bar is essentially a blank slate, and the onus is on app developers to make it more compelling. Many Apple loyalists have fixated on the memory constraints and underwhelming performance of the new MacBook Pros. The new models have a maximum of 16 gigabytes of RAM  —   the same limit as the previous MacBook Pro  —   and roughly the same processor speed as the last professional notebooks. But that’s not the full story. The new notebooks are much faster in some ways than older models, while other parts are only slightly faster. In speed tests run with the app Geekbench 4, the   MacBook Pro’s computer processor was only 10 percent to 17 percent faster than the   model released in 2012. Yet the graphics processor, which is crucial for heavy computing tasks, in the new MacBook Pro is about twice as fast as the one in the older model, and the storage drives are much faster, too. The RAM limit might irk users who need power. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can open and the more quickly your computer can juggle them. The problem, in theory, is that in a few years if your future apps hog more memory, you won’t be able to add more memory to MacBook Pros because the most they can hold is 16 gigabytes. Professional Mac users are too divided on the MacBook Pro for me to make a blanket recommendation. One thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. A Chromebook, like the $430 Chromebook 13 from Dell, or the $1, 000 MacBook Air, Apple’s least expensive notebook computer, are slower and have   screens, but they are powerful enough for your needs. The new MacBook Pros are probably powerful enough for most professionals. But if you consider yourself a power user and are skeptical about the MacBook Pro, you might wait to see whether the initial concerns are borne out after early adopters start using their machines. Plenty have already bought them: Apple said early orders for the new MacBook Pro have been stronger than for past professional notebooks. On the plus side, these notebooks are fast, with   screens and responsive keyboards. But the Touch Bar so far feels gimmicky, and not many devices or accessories come with   connectors yet. The MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for   like extra storage. So if you aren’t ready to make the jump to   and you don’t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it’s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price. Mr. Leventhal says he is exploring other options such as a Hackintosh  —   a generic PC that is modified to run the Mac operating system. “It’s a dark place where you’re doing something that is basically illegal and spending a ton of time to even make it feasible, but I have no good options,” he said.",0
17931,Trump Nominates Judge Neil Gorsuch to Supreme Court - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON  —   President Donald Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch on Tuesday evening to fill the seat on the U. S. Supreme Court left open by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. [President George W. Bush appointed Gorsuch to the federal bench in 2006, after he worked in the Bush administration for two years as a deputy associate attorney general at the U. S. Department of Justice. Gorsuch currently serves as a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over Wyoming, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, New Mexico, and his native Colorado.  Gorsuch is considered one of the most intellectual jurists on the federal bench, evinced by his gilded pedigree. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University in 1988 and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991. Later in his career, he earned a Ph. D. from Oxford University in 2004. He would be the first Supreme Court justice in decades to hold a doctoral degree. He’s had a   legal career. He served as a law clerk for Judge David Sentelle on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, then clerked for both Justice Byron White and later Justice Anthony Kennedy on the U. S. Supreme Court. He went on to a very successful career in the private sector before joining the Bush Justice Department in 2005. Gorsuch has embraced a textualist view of constitutional interpretation, including language that suggests he might share Justice Scalia’s view that judges should further construe the text only in a manner consistent with its original meaning. In Cordova v. City of Albuquerque (2016) he wrote: Ours is the job of interpreting the Constitution. And that document isn’t some inkblot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams . . . but a carefully drafted text judges are charged with applying according to its original public meaning. If a party wishes to claim a constitutional right, it is incumbent on him to tell us where it lies, not to assume or stipulate with the other side that it must be in there someplace. That same year, Gorsuch authored a scholarly publication about judicial philosophy, in which he explained his view that, an assiduous focus on text, structure, and history is essential to the proper exercise of the judicial function. That, yes, judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is using the traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own political views, always with an eye on the outcome  …     He concluded: “Though the critics are loud and the temptations to join them may be many, mark me down too as a believer that the traditional account of the judicial role Justice Scalia defended will endure. ” Gorsuch is known for a number of constitutional rulings that conservatives have applauded. He has consistently ruled in favor of religious liberty. In American Atheists v. Duncan (2010) he took the position that the Constitution’s Establishment Clause permits roadside memorials honoring fallen state troopers on public land. Regarding the free exercise of religion and federal statutes, he took the position that Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate violated Hobby Lobby’s rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a case that eventually became a landmark Supreme Court case. He has not been as outspoken on some other issues, such as the Second Amendment, but has nonetheless been generally supportive of gun rights when the matter has come before him. Judge Gorsuch was born in 1967 in Denver, Colorado. At age 49, he would be one of the youngest justices in decades, nearing Justice Elena Kagan’s age (50) when she was confirmed in 2010. Gorsuch has been married to his wife Marie for 20 years. They have two teenage daughters together. Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.",0
17933,Obama to Veto Bill Allowing 9/11 Lawsuits Against Saudi Arabia - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The White House said on Monday that President Obama would veto legislation approved by Congress that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot, escalating a bipartisan dispute with lawmakers over the measure. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama “does intend to veto this legislation,” and would work to persuade lawmakers in both parties to change course. If he cannot, the measure could lead to the first veto override of his presidency, as the legislation drew the backing of lopsided majorities in both the House and Senate. “The president feels quite strongly about this,” Mr. Earnest said of the legislation, which Mr. Obama has said could dangerously undermine the United States’ interests globally, opening the country to a raft of lawsuits by private citizens overseas. “The concept of sovereign immunity is one that protects the United States as much as any other country in the world,” Mr. Earnest said, referring to the rationale behind a 1976 law that gives other countries broad immunity from American lawsuits. “It’s not hard to imagine other countries using this law as an excuse to haul U. S. diplomats or U. S. service members, or even U. S. companies, into courts around the world. ” The bill has placed Mr. Obama in an awkward position, pitting him against the grieving families of victims of terrorism and many of his strongest Democratic allies, including in New York’s congressional delegation. “The families of the   victims have suffered so much and fought so hard for justice,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. “I hope for their sake that the administration will rethink vetoing this bill. ” The legislation would alter that 1976 statute to allow nations to be sued in federal courts if they are found to have played any role in terrorist attacks that killed Americans on United States soil. It also allows Americans to file financial claims against those who funded the attacks. Supported by the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, the measure also reflects a broader   in Washington of the alliance with Saudi Arabia, once an unquestioned partner. The measure passed the Senate in May without opposition, and sailed through the House by a large margin on Friday. It takes a   vote of both the House and Senate to override a veto. The president will lobby lawmakers to change their votes, Mr. Earnest said, including many members he said had privately agreed with Mr. Obama’s position on the bill, but felt that voting against it would harm their political prospects. “In many cases, we had members of Congress who were sympathetic to our concerns, but I think those same members of Congress were concerned about the impact this might have on their political standing, to oppose this bill,” Mr. Earnest said.",0
17934,Donald Trump Plans ‘Direct’ Speech to Muslims About Radical Islamic Terror,"President Donald Trump will visit Saudi Arabia during his first   trip overseas, meeting with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries. [Trump will deliver “an inspiring, yet direct speech on the need to confront radical ideology,” according to National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, who briefed reporters on the president’s trip. He added that Trump would talk about his hopes “for a peaceful vision of Islam to dominate across the world. ”  Trump will join bilateral meetings with Gulf Cooperation Council leaders, as well as leaders of other Muslim countries. The White House said that Trump would also personally participate in the opening of a new center in the Middle East for fighting radicalism and promoting moderation. “By establishing and operating this center, our Muslim friends, including Saudi Arabia, are taking a firm stand against extremism and those who use a perverted interpretation of religion to advance their criminal and political agenda,” McMaster said. According to the White House, Trump also plans to participate in a Twitter forum with young people during his visit.",0
17935,И снова о Добрыне…,"Политика 
Победив на президентских выборах, Дональд Трамп стал самой яркой звездой на мировом небосклоне. Общественность вмиг позабыла о нефти, долларе, беременной Собчак, отобранном у Украины Крыме, политических трениях и сирийском конфликте. Николаю Баскову перестали дарить цветы (ведь все розы ушли на празднование победы Трампа), а Филип Киркоров, даже роди он десять детей и одну обезьяну, не смог бы попасть на страницы известных таблоидов. Ибо все внимание приковано к Дональду – ещё вчера к 70-летнему старику с манией величия, а сегодня – к перспективному политику и владыке Северной Америки (точнее, её половины). 
С именем Дональда Трампа сегодня связано всё. Политолог Сэм Ванг, ранее предрёкший поражение лидера республиканцев и сделав ставку на Хиллари, проиграл спор и съел живого сверчка в прямом эфире. Пока все наблюдали публичную казнь насекомого, в сети появились кадры якобы НЛО, кружившего возле вертолёта нового президента. Наверное, инопланетяне хотели селфи замутить с новым лидером. 
На этом фоне известие, что Трамп принадлежит к роду киевских князей Рюриковичей, легко и органично вплелось в поток безумных новостей, связанных с миллиардером. Трамп оказался никем иным, как потомком варяга Рюрика – основателя княжеской династии на Руси. В этом уверен историк и эксперт в генеалогии Александр Нилогов. Ну, вот теперь всё встало на свои места, господа! Раскрыта тайна потрясающей харизмы и тонкого ума американского лидера. Наш он, наш! Матушка будущего президента Мэри Энн Трамп приходится потомком Рюрику сразу по трём линиям, в 36-м, 37-м и 38-м колене (чтобы уж наверняка). Родство идёт от дочери Ярослава Мудрого – Анны Ярославны, которая приходилась женой французскому королю Генриху I. Вторая линия связана с династией Стюартов и происходит от дочери Великого князя Мстислава Владимировича. Ну, и последняя линия — от Изяслава Ярославича. 
Своё исследование историк провёл на основании открытых документов и в доказательство продемонстрировал рисунок генеалогического древа. Что же получается? Семь десятков лет ходил человек по земле под именем Дональд. Может, пришло время открыть всем глаза? Какой там Дональд?.. Добрыня! Добрыня и есть! Как сам трижды потомок Рюрика отреагировал на новость, пока неизвестно. 
Автор открытия не считает новость сенсацией. Дескать, многие президенты США являются потомками европейских аристократических родов. А те, в свою очередь, в родстве с потомками Рюрика, в основном по женской линии. К слову, Барак Обама несмотря на цвет кожи и мелодичное второе имя «Хусейн» через свою матушку тоже является родичем Рюрика по женской линии. Но его президентские дни сочтены, и эта информация уже малоинтересна.",0
17936,A Chinese Mystery: Who Owns a Firm on a Global Shopping Spree? - The New York Times,"Pingyang County’s verdant hills still hint at a   China. Rice paddies and villages surround its bustling towns, and in the fields, farmers wade into the mud to plant seedlings as they have for thousands of years. It is an odd place to find the people behind a Chinese corporate powerhouse that is turning heads on Wall Street with a global takeover binge. Yet the area is home to a tiny group of just such people  —     merchants and villagers who happen to control   stakes in the Anbang Insurance Group, which owns the Waldorf Astoria in New York and a portfolio of global names and properties. American regulators are now asking who these shareholders are  —   and whether they are holding their stakes on behalf of others. The questions add to the mystery surrounding a company that seemed to come out of nowhere, surprising deal makers with offers to pay more than $30 billion for assets around the world. Anbang’s shopping spree is part of an outflow of money from China that has reshaped global markets but has often been shrouded in secrecy, sometimes by prominent Chinese looking to shift their wealth abroad without attracting attention at home. That poses a problem for international regulators trying to identify the buyers behind major acquisitions and to assess the riskiness of these deals. The Anbang shareholders in the Pingyang County area hold their stakes through a byzantine collection of holding companies. But according to dozens of interviews and a review of thousands of pages of Anbang filings by The New York Times, many of them have something in common: They are family members and acquaintances of Wu Xiaohui, Anbang’s chairman, a native of the county who married into the family of Deng Xiaoping, China’s paramount leader in the 1980s and ’90s. In many ways, Anbang and Mr. Wu appear to be archetypal products of China’s mix of freewheeling capitalism and Communist Party dominance, a formula that has fueled nearly four decades of untrammeled growth. Anbang got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. For years it was only a minor player. But it took off as it became more aggressive with its finances, buying stakes in Chinese banks and bringing in money by selling     investment funds to ordinary Chinese. Mr. Wu, 49, a former car salesman and   antismuggling official, led Anbang through this transformation and is now known as one of China’s most successful businessmen. He wears tailored suits and polished loafers, hobnobs with the likes of Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone, and sometimes holds court at Harvard. But he does not appear in Anbang’s filings as an owner. It is common in China for the wealthy to have their shares in companies held in others’ names. Known in Chinese as baishoutao, or white gloves, these people are often trusted relatives or acquaintances. Many defend the practice as a way to protect their privacy in a nation where riches can be a political liability. But others say white gloves can be used to hide   gains and thwart corruption investigators. Anbang did not respond when asked if Mr. Wu was a shareholder and declined to answer questions about its owners. The company, a spokesman said, “has multiple shareholders who have made all required disclosures under Chinese law. They are a mix of individual and institutional shareholders who made a commercial decision to invest in the company. Anbang has now grown to be a global company thanks to the support of these   shareholders. ” For investors and regulators, white gloves can make it difficult to evaluate the financial health of a Chinese buyer. Ownership may be concentrated in the hands of a few people, posing hidden risks, and companies with government connections could be vulnerable to political shifts or become magnets for corruption. “It is very important for businesses to know who they are ultimately doing business with, and for investors, what they are investing in,” said Keith Williamson, a managing director in Hong Kong at Alvarez  Marsal, a firm that carries out corporate fraud investigations. It is not clear whether the shareholders in the Pingyang County region are holding large stakes on behalf of anyone else. But on May 27, Anbang withdrew its application with New York State to buy an Iowa insurer, Fidelity  Guaranty Life, for $1. 6 billion. Regulators had asked about ties between several shareholders with the same family names, said one person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A $6. 5 billion deal for a portfolio of hotels that includes the Essex House in New York and several Four Seasons locations is awaiting results from a security review by the American government. In March, Anbang withdrew a $14 billion bid for Starwood, the operator of Sheraton and Westin hotels, in a move that surprised Wall Street. The company could come under greater scrutiny as it prepares to sell shares in its life insurance business on the Hong Kong stock exchange next year. Already, at least one major New   investment bank has raised concerns about Anbang’s ownership after studying its shareholding structure to evaluate whether to help with its overseas deals, according to two people involved in the matter who asked not to be identified because the process was private. The bank did not participate in Anbang’s deals. Separately, the Chinese magazine Caixin reported in May that Chinese regulators were examining Anbang’s riskier financial products. It is unclear where that inquiry stands or whether Anbang’s ownership structure is being investigated. President Xi Jinping has waged a campaign against graft since taking office, and the use of white gloves has recently come under scrutiny. “White gloves are accompanied by power’s black hands,” the Communist Party’s disciplinary watchdog wrote in a report last year. Questions about Anbang’s owners come as Chinese companies make deals around the world  —   sometimes representing efforts by China’s powerful to move money out of the country, as the economy slows and the party tightens its grip on everyday life. China has encouraged some capital outflow to improve the performance of its investments and expand its influence. But the subject of the elite moving money overseas is politically sensitive, raising questions about the source of their wealth and their confidence in the Chinese economy. Luo Yu, the son of a former chief of staff of China’s military, said China’s most politically powerful families had been transferring money out of the country for some time. “They don’t believe they will hold on to power long enough  —   sooner or later they would collapse,” said Mr. Luo, a former colonel in the Chinese Army whose younger brother was a business partner with one of Anbang’s founders. “So they transfer their money. ” At its founding in 2004, Anbang had an impressive list of politically connected directors. Records show early Anbang directors included Levin Zhu, son of a former prime minister, and Chen Xiaolu, the son of an army marshal who helped bring Communist rule to China. Then there was Mr. Wu, who was born Wu Guanghui but was known as Wu Xiaohui from a young age. Relatives said he grew up in a Catholic family a crucifix sat on his aunt’s dining room table, and she wears a necklace with a portrait of the Virgin Mary. Mr. Wu married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng, the Chinese leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Together, Mr. Wu, Ms. Zhuo, Mr. Chen and their relatives owned or ran the companies that controlled Anbang, according to company filings. Anbang leapt onto the global stage with last year’s purchase of the Waldorf Astoria and its aborted bid for the Starwood chain. By this year, Anbang’s assets had swelled to $295 billion. It is not clear what prompted Anbang’s sudden interest in overseas assets. But the shift came after a reshuffling of its ownership structure that also led to the injection of more than $7. 5 billion into the company. Company documents filed with Chinese agencies show that the number of firms holding Anbang’s shares jumped to 39, from eight, over six months in 2014. Most of those firms received large injections of funds. At the same time, Anbang’s capital more than quintupled. Ms. Zhuo disappeared from the ownership records by the end of that year. Many of Mr. Wu’s relatives did as well. Mr. Wu and Mr. Chen had disappeared earlier from the records. Mr. Zhu, who does not appear to have owned shares, disappeared in paper filings from Anbang’s roster of directors by 2009, though he was listed as a director on online government filings as late as 2014. Mr. Wu, Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhu did not respond to requests for comment, and Ms. Zhuo could not be reached. In March, Mr. Zhu told Chinese reporters that he was not an Anbang director. Anbang’s current shareholding firms are not   names in China, and some appear to have been set up just to hold Anbang shares. One lists its address as the empty 27th floor of a dusty Beijing office building. Two more list an address at a mail drop above a Beijing post office. Using corporate filings, The Times compiled a list of nearly 100 people who own shares in the firms and traced about a dozen to Pingyang County or nearby. Reporters visited the area, in China’s eastern Zhejiang Province, and interviewed dozens of residents, including several whose names appeared on the list. They also interviewed an uncle, an aunt and a nephew of Mr. Wu. The latter two, as well as others in the area, said one name matched that of his sister, Wu Xiaoxia. The family members said several other names matched those of Mr. Wu’s extended kin, including two cousins and others on his mother’s side of the family. Through their various stakes in Anbang shareholding companies, these people control a stake representing more than $17 billion in assets. Other names matched local acquaintances of Mr. Wu, including Huang Maosheng, a local businessman who confirmed in a brief phone interview that he had a business relationship with Mr. Wu but declined to elaborate. One village leader and neighbors identified the names of four of Mr. Huang’s relatives  —   including some whom they described as common workers  —   from among those on the list. Their Anbang holdings represent about $12 billion in assets. Another resident, Mei Xiaojing, said two names on the list matched those of her relatives. Asked if she knew Mr. Wu, she said, “Well, yes,” then ended the phone conversation and did not respond to subsequent calls. Through multiple holding companies, those three people have a stake representing about $19 billion in Anbang assets. As Anbang rose, so did Mr. Wu’s profile. In 2013 Mr. Wu secured a yearlong position as a visiting fellow at the Asia Center of Harvard, joining a growing list of politically connected Chinese billionaires with ties to Harvard. Ezra F. Vogel, a professor emeritus at Harvard who wrote a biography of Deng, said he met Mr. Wu on several occasions. “He had this staff of sharp people who were working for him,” Mr. Vogel said. “It seems that they were doing the detail work, and he was the friendly man supplying the connections. ”",0

17938,Drummer Defends Stanford Student Convicted in Rape Case. Her Band Pays a Price. - The New York Times,"Good English is a   band from Oakwood, Ohio, three sisters with a garage rock vibe. In Brooklyn, this week, they became pariahs. The women have found themselves at the center of a debate about sexual assault after a   letter written to a judge a few months ago by one of the sisters, Leslie Rasmussen, involving the case of a Stanford University student who was convicted of sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman, was made public. Ms. Rasmussen, in her letter, described the student, Brock Allen Turner, as a childhood friend and an elementary school classmate, and defended him. In rapid succession, Good English has been dropped from several Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to play, as well as the Northside Festival, a weeklong music festival that began on Monday. Other festivals have also announced that the band will no longer be performing. “When people choose to defend something, then I think they should be held accountable for it,” said Daniel Stedman, a founder of the Northside Media Group, which runs the Brooklyn festival. After Mr. Turner’s sentencing last week, Mr. Stedman said he found himself moved to tears as he read the graphic courtroom statement from the woman whom Mr. Turner sexually assaulted. The statement has been widely distributed since, describing the attack and what followed. “How does the average person who is really upset and troubled about the Brock story, how does somebody participate in that, making right of a wrong?” Mr. Stedman said. “We are really just one tiny, infinitesimal part of that puzzle, but I think it was a   for us. ” In her letter, Ms. Rasmussen, 20, says that there was a distinction between rape and Mr. Turner’s case, and suggested that alcohol was to blame for his actions. Mr. Turner, 20, a swimmer at Stanford, was found by two   partially clothed behind a trash bin on campus, on top of the    woman, who was incapacitated by alcohol, according to the authorities. The   stopped the assault and held Mr. Turner down as he tried to flee. “I don’t think it’s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn’t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him,” Ms. Rasmussen, who plays drums in the band, wrote. “But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campus isn’t always because people are rapists. ” Mr. Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault for the attack, which took place in January 2015. This week the judge in the case, Aaron Persky of Superior Court in Santa Clara County, Calif. came under withering criticism from the public for the sentence he imposed: six months in jail and probation. Ms. Rasmussen’s letter was part of a package of letters sent to the judge on behalf of Mr. Turner before his sentencing, a standard practice in which people seek to influence a sentencing decision by sharing their experiences of the defendant. His father also sent a letter that had an even more explosive effect when it was made public this week he said that the episode had affected his son’s appetite and that, in particular, he no longer enjoyed   steaks. Following the firestorm her letter provoked, Ms. Rasmussen said that her words were being twisted and that she was being unfairly stigmatized. “This appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests I sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that I blame the victim involved,” she said in a statement. Ms. Rasmussen also believed that the letter to the judge was private. But a spokesman for the court said she was wrong  —   such letters, like most documents entered into the court, are a matter of public record. Within hours of Ms. Rasmussen’s letter being made public by New York magazine, Good English was removed from a roster of Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to perform in the coming days, including Rock Shop in Gowanus, Industry City Distillery in Greenwood, Gold Sounds in Bushwick, and Bar Matchless in Greenpoint. “We don’t want to be affiliated with anyone that’s going to try to   or even just downplay rape,” said Larry Hyland, an owner of Bar Matchless. Mr. Hyland said he had received over 50 emails and posts on the bar’s Facebook page demanding that the band’s show be canceled. Some of the messages, he said, included threats to confront the band members if they did perform. “We didn’t cancel the show because of censorship,” he said, adding that while he disagreed with the content of Ms. Rasmussen’s letter, he understood the impulse to want to help a childhood friend. “I wanted to avoid an unsafe environment. ” On Tuesday, the Dayton Music Art and Film Festival near the band’s hometown announced that it, too, was removing the band from its September lineup. “Such actions should not be defended, friend or not,” the festival wrote on its Facebook page. On Wednesday, Behind the Curtains Media, the public relations firm that represented Good English, dropped them from its client roster. In her statement, Ms. Rasmussen attributed the fallout from her initial letter not to what she wrote, but to “the overzealous nature of social media. ” In particular, she lamented the “uproar of judgment and hatred unleashed on me” and the effect it was having on her musical aspirations.",0
17939,Yahoo’s Suitors Uncover Few Financial Details - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   As Yahoo prepares to accept   bids for its core Internet business on Monday, potential buyers have found themselves facing one big problem: How do you value a company with a declining business when the company appears reluctant to share vital financial details? In meetings and phone calls with potential bidders, Yahoo executives have offered gloomy financial projections for the current year, but have refused to discuss the outlook for 2017 or answer questions about crucial aspects of the business. Some of the three dozen or so potential suitors have even questioned what is truly for sale. But several big companies are expected to place bids for Yahoo anyway, according to people briefed on the matter. Verizon Communications, which has publicly expressed interest in buying Yahoo’s core Internet business and merging it with its AOL division, plans to press forward with a bid, some of these people said. The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, said publicly that it had considered joining with potential investors, including one or more private equity firm, for a bid. And the private equity firm TPG plans to make a bid in the first round on its own, according to a person briefed on the matter. Yet other huge companies plan to sit out the bidding. Google, which competes with Yahoo on search and display advertising and has a search partnership with the company, considered making an offer, but is unlikely to proceed because it fears any deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutiny, according to people briefed on the company’s thinking. Other notable businesses, including ATT, CBS and the investment firms Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, are unlikely to bid, according to others briefed on their plans. And SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant that controls Yahoo Japan, does not plan to bid despite press reports to the contrary. A   presentation shown to potential Yahoo bidders is dense with figures, but even people familiar with the company’s operations have struggled to make sense of them. At the same time, Yahoo devoted just a couple of slides to important strategies, like its costly Hail Mary project to create an entirely new mobile search experience to leapfrog competitors like Google, Apple and Amazon. Representatives of Verizon, Google, ATT and CBS declined to comment. A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment on the sales process. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, is expected to face questions about the bidding on Tuesday, when the company reports its latest quarterly earnings. The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weathering the upheaval caused by the layoff of 15 percent of its work force announced in February. The total value of Yahoo shares is now about $35 billion. The company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate, which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $1 billion to $3 billion. One reason for Yahoo’s reluctance to share information may be that the business is worse than the company has publicly disclosed. That has added to confusion regarding the intentions of a board of directors that, just a few months ago, publicly said it had no intention of selling. Ms. Mayer has often said she wants to make Yahoo services a “daily habit” for Internet users. But after nearly four years of effort, only about 10 percent of the one billion monthly visitors to Yahoo sites return every day, suggesting little attachment to the brand, according to people who have seen confidential internal data. At Facebook, by comparison, 65 percent of users visit daily. Yahoo is in a difficult position. Ms. Mayer’s   turnaround effort has failed to deliver significant improvements at a company that has been in decline for a decade. Ms. Mayer argues that she is turning the tide with new investments in areas like video and native advertising. Activist investors, led by the Starboard Value hedge fund, have run out of patience and are pressing the board to sell the core business, separating it from the company’s far more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China’s leading   company, and Yahoo Japan, a separate, publicly traded company. Yahoo’s board, which spent more than a year working on other plans to separate the investment stakes, reluctantly agreed to explore a sale of all or parts of the company and hired three investment banking firms to run the process. Starboard has formally threatened a proxy fight to replace the entire board at the next shareholder meeting if the directors do not follow through on a sale. Ms. Mayer has publicly laid out a path for an independent Yahoo and made the case to potential bidders that they should retain her as chief to carry out the plan. Abandoning previous forays into video and digital magazines, Ms. Mayer, who formerly headed search at Google, is now focused on returning Yahoo to its glory days as a search engine. Although comScore says that Yahoo is currently the No. 3 player in desktop searches, behind Google and Microsoft, Ms. Mayer argues that Yahoo can leap ahead through a “complete reimagination of mobile search. ” Ms. Mayer has assigned about 1, 000 people to search products, or about 10 percent of the company’s staff, according to people briefed on the business. The mobile effort,   Project Index, has officially been underway for two years and aims to create a search tool similar to Google Now on Android phones, Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa. But the team has little to show for its work, and many at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest. Industry experts as well as Yahoo insiders say that without the location and personal data that Apple and Google have, Yahoo will have a difficult time predicting what people want with enough accuracy to get them to switch from other services. “There is a massive opportunity for mobile search,” said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, who invests in search  . “But I don’t think Yahoo has the core assets or skills you would need to succeed or thrive right now. ” A Yahoo spokesman said that the company was exploring many search ideas, including the use of software bots that would fetch information on behalf of users. Ms. Mayer’s vague plans for reversing Yahoo’s decline, along with the lack of disclosure about the company’s finances, have made prospective bidders nervous. Though several private equity firms have been looking at the company, people involved in the bidding process said that they were unlikely to prevail against a determined corporate buyer. Verizon is viewed by analysts as the leading bidder for Yahoo, but its likely offer comes despite trepidation among its executives, according to the people briefed on the bidding. Verizon is still struggling to digest its $4. 4 billion acquisition last year of AOL, and some executives worry that buying Yahoo would simply be doubling down on integration troubles. Verizon could certainly combine the content properties and ad products and networks run by Yahoo and AOL. The company, with more than 112 million cellphone customers on top of its landline Internet subscribers, would have the ability to preinstall Yahoo services and distribute them widely. However, the contracts governing Apple iPhones and phones running Google’s Android operating system generally restrict what phone carriers can do to promote alternatives for major services like search and email. So Yahoo would still need to build products good enough to persuade people to switch. Wall Street is hoping for a quick sale, to anybody, at any reasonable price. “We continue to believe that one of the greatest risks in the stock is the core being a ‘melting ice cube,’ as a prolonged sale process draws on, creating questions for employees, advertisers and partners,” wrote Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, on Wednesday.",0
17940,Ann Coulter: Rome Burns - Nero Worries About Pyrophobia,"The latest Muslim terrorist attack ripped apart little girls at a concert in Manchester, England, on Monday, killing 22.

Even then, the answer was difficult to find on either network’s Twitter feeds, which were bristling with    updates on former CIA Director John Brennan’s congressional testimony about Russia and Trump: Yes, collusion was investigated. No, Brennan is not aware of any evidence to support the theory. BREAKING NEWS! The media didn’t gaudily broadcast the bomber’s name, religion or ethnicity in their headlines, but at least they finally coughed up the information. He was Salman Abedi, son of Libyan “refugees. ” Apparently, the media think you can’t be trusted with that information. You might notice that the West is deliberately importing people who enjoy killing kids. According to ABC News, the bomber’s father, Ramadan Abedi (not to be confused with Huma Abedin) was a member of an    Islamic group in Libya. For this, he was accepted as a “refugee” by the British government. Liberals’ main reaction to the attack was not to demand the toppling of the   British government, but to worry about an upsurge in Islamophobia. They say there’s nothing we can do about terrorism and we probably shouldn’t do anything anyway, because we deserve it. These were teen and preteen girls! Is there any fuel left in the gas tank of humanity, or are we just running on fumes now? While liberals are impatient to get back to their murderous immigration policies, conservatives are pining for war. And really, who wouldn’t want to send ground troops to Syria after our tremendous successes in Iraq and Afghanistan? Why do we need to fight ISIS in Syria again? I forget. How about we NOT send U. S. troops to some godforsaken nation of primitives? My reasoning is: It will cost us trillions of dollars we will sacrifice the lives of an untold number of our best young men in combat (and little girls  —   thanks, liberals!) and we will accomplish absolutely nothing, apart from creating a new stream of “refugees” and making the primitives even angrier with us, if that’s possible. Historically, starting wars in the Third World has not proved salutary. Trump was elected for one reason: Because he promised to put Americans’ interests first. If only he’d stuck to his campaign promises, he’d be a hero right now. The one promise Trump has kept is the   “Muslim ban”  —   and he’s looking prophetic on that. The Ninth Circuit was probably just about to release its opinion affirming a Hawaii judge’s revocation of Trump’s travel ban, but after Manchester, they’ll have to sit on it for a few weeks. Wouldn’t you rather be defending Trump for imposing a travel ban, building a wall and deporting “Dreamers,” than for idiotic leaks about nothing? If Trump started removing undesirable foreigners, liberals would rush back to the airports, en masse, and forget all about Russia. The most humane response to terrorist attacks in the West is to kill a bunch of them for revenge, and then concentrate on our own problems. Instead of sending ground troops to Syria, we should be sending them to San Diego. Our policy following every Islamic terrorist attack anyplace in the West should be the following: 1) We drop a nuke on some   city involved in terrorism. 2) We add six months to the immigration moratorium (which Trump promised us in his Aug. 16, 2015, immigration policy paper, the greatest political document since the Magna Carta). 3) We deport one Ninth Circuit judge. Since Trump, politics has become a game to liberals. The media is a game. Hollywood is a game. Islamic terrorists are killing little girls in England. This isn’t a game.",0
17941,Former DEA Prescription Head Drops a BombShell — Congress Protects Big Pharma & Fuels Opioid Crisis,"Home / Health / Former DEA Prescription Head Drops a BombShell — Congress Protects Big Pharma & Fuels Opioid Crisis Former DEA Prescription Head Drops a BombShell — Congress Protects Big Pharma & Fuels Opioid Crisis Claire Bernish October 31, 2016 8 Comments 
Congress would rather protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies than the health of those addicted to dangerous opioid drugs, says a former head of the DEA responsible for preventing abuse of medications. 
Joseph Rannazzisi, former Deputy Assistant Administrator at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, asserts Big Pharma and its lobbyists have a “stranglehold” on legislators in Congress and have engineered the protection of a $9 billion per year industry over the health of American citizens, according to a report from the Guardian . 
“Congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive,” he said, according to the outlet. “As long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists, nothing’s going to change.” 
Rannazzisi explained lobbyists have spent millions thwarting legislative and policy efforts to provide guidelines for reducing the prescribing of opioid medications closely related to heroin — and helped limit the DEA’s powers to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosages of the same. 
A pharmacist himself, Rannazzisi severely criticized lawmakers he claims hold a double standard — publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic, while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the industry’s profits. 
“These congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for re-election, it’s a sham,” he told the Guardian . “The congressmen and senators who are championing this fight, the ones who really believe in what they’re doing, their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence.” 
With the unique insight of having been an insider, Rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislators’ public lamentation of addiction and deaths from the opioid crisis during election years, and private efforts to protect drugmakers from liability. 
And he would know. According to Rannazzisi’s LinkedIn profile, as Chief of Diversion, he had been tasked with “oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 1.6 million DEA registrants” — but if the standards are lowered by Congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids, the threshold of criminality is raised. 
As the Guardian points out, legislation to fight the opioid epidemic, Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act , did, in fact, pass in July — but partisan controversy erupted when Republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth. Democrats then issued a report titled “ Dying Waiting for Treatment ” in response, which “likened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to ‘using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam.’” 
Indeed the report sharply criticized the bill, equating its policies to ‘empty promises’ for the lack of financial follow-through. 
As the Washington Post detailed in a report earlier this month, the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal ‘pill mills’ and corrupt pharmacies, who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets. 
Headed by Rannazzisi, the Office of Diversion Control sent investigators into the field, and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets. 
But the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry — fearing a potential significant loss in profits — fought back. Hard. 
According to the Post , the deputy attorney general summoned Rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012, concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies. 
“That meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and that’s all that meeting was about,” the now-retired DEA official told the Post . 
Then, in 2014, came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the Department of Justice and congressional legislators: the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act — legislation initiated by the Healthcare Distribution Management Association — the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy. 
An analysis of lobbying records by the Post found “the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, spent $13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016.” 
Rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in July 2014, and recalled telling them, “This bill passes the way it’s written we won’t be able to get immediate suspension orders, we won’t be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations.” 
Stunned at the massive — and ultimately successful — effort to take the bite out of DEA attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19,000 lives every year, Rannazzisi likened the legislation to a “free pass” for legal drug pushers. 
“This doesn’t ensure patient access and it doesn’t help drug enforcement at all,” he told the Guardian. “What this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. What this bill does is take away DEA’s ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor.” 
“This was a gift. A gift to the industry,” he added. 
After heading the diversion office for a decade, Rannazzisi retired in 2015 — likely disgusted over legislators’ dedication to the legal drug industry, rather than the people whose interests they’re ostensibly obligated to protect. 
“The bill passed because ‘Big Pharma’ wanted it to pass,” he told the Guardian in no uncertain terms. “The DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and they’re not going to like being regulated.” 
Big Pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation. As the Center for Public Integrity found , the Guardian noted, Purdue Pharma — at the heart of the epidemic for its highly-addictive drug introduced in the late 1990s, OxyContin — spent a breathtaking $740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts. 
However, Big Pharma’s power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying — the government-run Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) has been accused by Sen. Ron Wyden of being a tool to “weaken” CDC guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids. 
Wyden wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell of his concerns the IPRCC had been staffed with ‘experts’ with conflicts of interest for their close ties to Big Pharma, including a scientist with a $1.5 million endowment from Purdue, reported the Guardian . 
“You’ve got a panel that’s certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. That’s something you’ve got to root out,” Wyden asserted . “The role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests.” 
Families of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of Big Pharma’s pro-opioid cash appalling — yet it continues to this day. Policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem, which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap blood-tainted profits. 
“Corporations have no conscience,” Rannazzisi flatly told the Guardian . “Unfortunately, with my job, I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, I’d bet you they’d change their mind. 
“When you sit with a parent who can’t understand why there’s so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isn’t the government doing anything, well the DEA was doing something. Unfortunately what we’re trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws.” Share Google + skyp0ckets 
You know, even if a pharma head talked to the family of someone who lost a loved one to opiod addiction, or had a family member suffer that fate, I don’t think it would change them in the least. These people who are hard-wired to accumulate massive amounts of wealth are usually somewhere between sociopathic and psychopathic. This is why it is very difficult for people to trust medicine, and in many cases, the doctors who dispense it. Have you ever been sitting in a waiting room and watched the number of salespeople revolve in and out, many with carry-out food? Disgusting. Bwin51 
Ever notice how the sales reps are all well dressed attractive women? rav1 TZM_TVP_RBE 
The entire system is inherently corrupt. 
Imagine you are the CEO of one of these Big Pharma corporations and you decided to cut the price of your drugs across the board, making them accessible to everyone that needed them. You would be out the door so fast your head would spin! 
The board and the shareholders would be furious and demand a CEO that only cares about share prices. 
And so you have it, inherent corruption. 
The solution: 
http://www.thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project/ Bwin51 
If there was ever a conspiracy, it’s this one where government and business agree that those who wish to abuse drugs to their eventual demise are given the freedom to destroy themselves, reproduce freely thereby creating a new generation of consumers, generating profits for a few and tax dollars for the country. It’s not the cost of pharmaceuticals as much as the enablement of opioid addiction in the name of profits that is disturbing. Purdue pharma had an opportunity to change their formulation of OxyContin long ago to make their drug nonaddicting, but they chose not to according to Chasing the Scream. If that’s true, and so far no one has denied the assertion, then what do we have here. 
This is a “bombshell”? I thought it was common knowledge. rav1 
We’ve known this for some time now – maybe it’s a bombshell to those who believe and defend the corrupt system – but… it’s been known for a long time.

17943,"Hurricane Matthew Avoids Direct Hit on Florida, Continues North - The New York Times","Hurricane Matthew churned north along the coast of Florida on Friday, staying far enough offshore to spare the state a direct hit, but still caused flooding, wind damage and power failures. By Friday evening, it was a Category 2 storm, with sustained winds of up to 110 miles per hour, and government officials and forecasters shifted their focus to the threat of more serious damage on Saturday as the storm approaches Savannah and Charleston. The storm was blamed for the deaths of more than 800 people in Haiti, according to a Reuters report based on information from civil protection and local officials. For much of the day, officials warned that Jacksonville could suffer the worst damage. But while there was flooding in the area, the eye of the storm remained about 40 miles offshore as it passed Jacksonville. Dispatches from our reporters on the ground a live storm tracker map and answers to reader questions will be updated below. ■ At 10 p. m. the hurricane’s center was 50 miles   of St. Simons Island, Ga. and 90 miles   of Savannah, Ga. The storm was moving at about 12 m. p. h. with maximum sustained winds of 110 m. p. h. ■ It was predicted to continue to parallel the coast into Georgia and the Carolinas, putting Savannah Charleston, S. C. and Wilmington, N. C. at risk, before turning out to sea. ■ Florida officials blamed the storm for at least five deaths: three in St. Lucie County, one in Volusia County and one in Putnam County. Early on Friday, the St. Lucie County fire service received a call to aid a woman who had suffered a heart attack, but winds approaching hurricane force prevented emergency vehicles from responding. An older couple running a generator inside a garage died from carbon monoxide poisoning, the county said in a social media post. Around noon, another woman was killed in Volusia, Fla. when a tree fell on her after she went outside to feed animals, according to James T. Dinneen, the Volusia County manager. In Putnam County, between Gainesville and Daytona Beach, the sheriff’s office said a woman had been killed when a tree fell onto a camper. Another man was injured. ■ Florida officials said Friday afternoon that more than 1 million customers were without electricity. ■ Significant flooding hit cities south of Jacksonville, including St. Augustine and Ormond Beach, on Friday. ■ The National Weather Service extended its hurricane warning northward into North Carolina. The Weather Service downgraded the hurricane warning for Florida’s   coast to a tropical storm warning, and lifted the tropical storm warning for the state’s southern coast. ■ President Obama warned against complacency. “I just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane, that the potential for storm surge, flooding, loss of life and severe property damage continues to exist,” he told reporters at the White House. “Pay attention to what your local officials are telling you. If they tell you to evacuate, you need to get out of there and move to higher ground. ” The president has declared a state of emergency in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing federal agencies to coordinate relief efforts. ■ To cover the storm and its aftermath, The New York Times has journalists deployed along the path of Hurricane Matthew. Follow our correspondents on Twitter. Miami may have been spared the wrath of Hurricane Matthew, but for residents of the city’s Little Haiti neighborhood the anxiety over the storm was acute. Haiti, birth nation to most of the people in the Miami enclave, was devastated by the storm, which killed hundreds of people on the island and left fears of an even greater toll. “I have two cousins I have not heard from  —   I’m very worried,” Daniel Fils Aimé, who has lived in Little Haiti for a quarter of a century and was last in his native Les Cayes two years ago, said. “Somebody is supposed to let me know. Someone is investigating. ” Mr. Aimé, 72, managed to get in touch with several friends in the devastated southwestern region of Haiti. “I’ve heard from some friends  —   not others,” he said as he bought pastries and bread at the Piman Bouk Bakery. “They’re all scattered now. People lost their houses. They had chickens and cows in the yard  —   everything went straight into the ocean. ” As the chairman of the   Chamber of Commerce, which he founded in 2005, Mr. Aimé said he was trying raise money to buy enough food to fill a container, with the intention of sending it to Les Cayes. Sitting with a friend in a small park at the intersection of 62nd Street and North Miami Avenue, Maximin Raphael, 59, closed his eyes and pursed his lips as he thought about his    sister, Gyslaine Joseph, in Les Cayes, and what she went through during the hurricane. Mr. Raphael, who has lived in the United States for 34 years, had finally managed to reach her by telephone on Friday morning, after days of trying. “Her house is gone,” Mr. Raphael said. “The roof flew away. Everybody that lives there has a big problem. ” At the Piman Bouk Bakery, murals, both inside and out, portray a verdant and abundant Haiti in the manner of much of the country’s art. But the crushing realities of life there, made even more so by frequent batterings it takes from natural calamities like storms and earthquakes, were all too plain to the customers  —   almost invariably Haitian immigrants  —   who lined up Friday afternoon to buy goods. “We are all Haitian, so we have to be concerned, regardless of whether they are family or not,” said   Richardson, a registered nurse who was born in Cap Haitien, in the country’s north, and who moved to Miami in 1986 after completing high school in her native country.  —   NICK MADIGAN, in Miami Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, declined to extend the deadline after a call from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign to accommodate people disrupted by the hurricane.

C. officials warned of potentially   high tides, urged people to evacuate if they had not done so and set a curfew, from midnight until 6 a. m. Saturday, for those who remained. But as the wind whistled and rain began to spit on this peninsular city, those who remained here seemed remarkably relaxed. “There’s parties all over,” said Elle Norton, 58, as she boarded up the windows of her pale pink house in downtown Charleston, and brought her potted plants inside. “I have to go to the store now to get some appetizers. ” To Ms. Norton and many others here, the emptiness of Charleston’s    streets, where antebellum architecture is dotted with hidden courtyards and lush window boxes, was a refreshing break, because the city is usually brimming with tourists. “It’s so pleasant just hearing the birds,” Ms. Norton said. A few streets over, Normandy Farm Bakery had filled the case it normally reserved for oysters  —   of which there were only three left  —   with hot dogs and beer, and strung up a random assortment of celebratory balloons outside to signal they were staying open. “You ride it out in your house, you’re gonna go bananas,” said the owner, Mike Ray, who seemed unmoved by the dire warnings from public officials. “I don’t think it’s gonna flood right here. ” Nearby, Jerome Monroe, a local handy man, closed the shutters on a fine arts gallery. He was planning to ride out the storm inside the Footlight Player’s Theater, where he would use a ShopVac to try to minimize flooding, though he knew he was powerless to prevent it entirely. “When the water comes,” Mr. Monroe said, “you’re not stopping it. ”  —   JESSICA BIDGOOD in Charleston, S. C. John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the storm. He rode out his first hurricane, Carla, in his hometown, Galveston, Tex. at age 4. He has covered the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as well as other storms for The Times.  Ask your hurricane questions here. Why do weather agencies and the news media keep getting the forecasts so wrong and overstate the severity of hurricanes? Is this some kind of insurance liability issue, where they are afraid of getting sued if they don’t paint a ‘doomsday’ picture?  —   Jim The conservative approach isn’t about liability, Jim, it’s about saving lives. The storm track that Matthew has followed has been well within the range of possibilities that the National Hurricane Center has been talking about all along. This is still a dangerous storm, and just because some stretches of the Florida coast have not been hit as catastrophically as was possible, that does not mean the rest of Florida or Georgia or South Carolina are in the clear. Marshall Shepherd, the director of Atmospheric Sciences Program, University of Georgia, has been fiercely defending the warnings on Twitter, and I’ll let him do the talking here: Chris W. Landsea, science and operations officer for the National Hurricane Center, said that while the storm has weakened somewhat, it is now spread over a larger area, and “a larger hurricane can cause more storm surge,” and a larger wind field the wind damage, in other words, can be felt over a larger area. So a slightly weaker but larger storm is “kind of a wash, as far as impacts,” he said. I grew up in Houston and also rode out Carla as a child as well as Henrietta in Cabo as an adult. I certainly believe in climate change, but is the hurricane season really worse now? What about the 1900 Galveston hurricane?  —   Jackie Berry There have always been hurricanes, and many have been profoundly destructive. The Great Storm of 1900 killed at least 6, 000 people on Galveston Island, and remains the deadliest natural disaster in United States history. But climate change isn’t about these isolated incidents. It’s the   trend, and the   trend is not good. People remember the 1900 storm  —   and the haunting song about it, Wasn’t that a Mighty Storm? and Erik Larson’s book “Isaac’s Storm”  —   because it stands out in the damage that it did. What climate change is doing is dumping more heat into the oceans and more moisture into the air  —   conditions that are likely, over time, to make the strong storms that do develop become more powerful, and possibly more frequent, as well. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, noted that while global average temperatures are rising, “20 times more heat is going into the ocean” than into the atmosphere, and so that’s a lot of power in the sea for hurricanes to draw on. And, in fact, while the 1900 storm was terribly destructive, much of that tragedy could be blamed on the lack of warning in those   times. It’s hard to attribute any single weather event to climate change, but it’s clear that climate change sets up conditions that can lead to more 1900 storms, more Katrinas, more Sandys. When I wrote about the science of attribution last year, Andrew E. Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A  M, told me determining whether an extreme weather event like a flood is caused by climate change is like trying to figure out which of Barry Bonds’s home runs were caused by his steroid use. “You know statistically some of them were, but you don’t know which ones,” he said. “Almost certainly, it would have rained a lot even without climate change  —   but it’s possible climate change juiced it, added a little bit. ”",0
17944,Why BPA Hasn’t Been Banned?,"Why BPA Hasn’t Been Banned? VN:F [1.9.22_1171] 
If the synthetic estrogen BPA is linked to billions of dollars’ worth of medical problems a year, why is it still allowed in the food supply?   Why BPA Hasn’t Been Banned? 
  
“The number of new chemicals is increasing exponentially”—we’re talking 12,000 new substances a day. Yet, data aren’t available on the hazards of even some of the high volume chemicals. BPA is one of the highest volume chemicals, with billions of pounds produced each year. And, studies have “raised concerns about its possible implication in the [cause] of some chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, reproductive disorders, cardiovascular diseases, birth defects, chronic respiratory and kidney diseases and breast cancer.” 
A new study on the health implications of BPA comes out nearly every week. BPA was first developed over a hundred years ago as a synthetic estrogen. But it wasn’t until the 1950s that industry realized it could be used to make polycarbonate plastic, and it rapidly became one of the most used chemicals worldwide, even though it was recognized to have hormonal effects. About a billion pounds are also used to line food and beverage cans—especially, it seems, in tuna and condensed soups. 
And now, we basically all have BPA in our bodies, and our children’s bodies. But, not to worry; the government says up to 50 a day is safe; 50 micrograms per kilogram. And, even those working in Chinese BPA factories don’t get exposed to more than like 70 times lower than that safety limit. Okay, then, why did exposure seem to affect the male workers’ sperm counts? 
In the U.S., the general population only gets less than like a thousand times lower than the safety limit. Yet, still, we seem to be seeing “adverse effects on thyroid function, weight control, blood sugar control, cardiovascular disease, liver function, and immune function”—even at those incredibly low doses. So, “[t]he fact that there are significant adverse effects in populations exposed to BPA at concentrations [thousands of] times lower than the [official tolerable daily limit] indicates that the safe exposure to BPA may be much lower than previously thought in humans.” Yet, the limit hasn’t been changed. It’s been banned from baby bottles and sippy cups, but nearly unlimited doses are still apparently okay for everyone else. What’s the disconnect here? 
It has to do with the fascinating world of low-dose effects of hormone-disrupting chemicals. “For decades, [these chemicals] “have challenged traditional concepts in toxicology”—particularly the old adage that it’s “the dose makes the poison,” the concept “that lower exposures to a hazardous compound will, therefore, always generate lower risks.” That’s “the core assumption underlying [our] system of chemical-safety testing.” They start dosing lab animals with super high amounts, and then keep lowering the dose until whatever adverse effects disappear; then, add a safety buffer, and assume everything below that dose should be okay, assuming the curve looks like this. You know, the higher the dose, the higher the effect. But, hormone-disrupting chemicals can have all sorts of “curious curves.” Basically, how could something have more of an effect at a lower dose? 
Think about a hormone, and its receptors in the body. At low levels of the hormone, like going from 0 to 1, the receptors can fill up quickly. But, once they’re almost all filled up, going from 4 to 5, adding really high doses may not change things much. Let’s use an actual BPA example. This was a study to see if BPA suppressed an obesity-protective hormone in fat samples taken from breast reduction and tummy tuck patients. As you can see, at a hundred nanomoles of BPA (I feel like a weatherman here!), but at a hundred nanomoles of BPA, you can see hormone levels are no lower than they are at 0 BPA. And, since most people have levels like between 1 and 20, then BPA must be safe. But, here’s the actual graph. So, no suppression at 0; no suppression at 100. But, right where levels are in people’s bodies, BPA appears to cut hormone release nearly in half. 
As the world’s oldest, largest, and most active organization devoted to research on hormones concluded, “even infinitesimally low levels of exposure—indeed, any level of exposure at all—may cause [problems],” nearly three billion dollars’ worth of problems every year, just counting the estimated effects of BPA on childhood obesity and heart disease alone. 
Now, there are alternatives that the industry could use; the problem, though, is that they may cost two cents more.  ",0
17945,House GOP Now Eyeing Repeal of Gun Ban for Military Veterans - Breitbart,"With the Social Security gun ban repealed and the lead ammunition ban revoked, the   House is now eyeing a repeal of the gun ban for U. S. military veterans. [The gun ban for military veterans works in the same way the Social Security gun ban was designed to work, and was actually a precursor to the Social Security ban.  In the Social Security ban, the Social Security Administration (SSA) could investigate beneficiaries who were under mental duress and needed help managing their finances. Following the investigation, the beneficiaries could be turned over to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and prohibited from making firearm purchases. In the gun ban for military veterans, the Veterans Administration does the investigation of military personnel receiving disability benefits. If the VA declares said recipients “incompetent,” those recipients are turned over NICS and barred from buying firearms. In the gun ban for military veterans, the Veterans Administration does the investigation of military personnel receiving disability benefits. If the VA declares said recipients “incompetent,” those recipients are turned over to NICS and barred from buying firearms. As seen with the Social Security gun ban, the gun ban for military veterans operates by using the broad language of mental health to deny natural rights to those who served our country in uniform. The   reports that military veterans turned over to NICS are “subject to a lifetime ban on the acquisition and possession of firearms, unless he or she successfully petitions for ‘relief from disabilities. ’” The legislation that will end the gun ban for military veterans is House Committee on Veteran Affairs chairman Phil Roe’s (  ) Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. Roe’s Act has already passed in committee and will be taken up by the full house as early as this week. On December 5, 2012, Breitbart News reported that Senator Chuck Schumer ( ) was supporting an amendment to strip gun rights from military veterans via the language of mental health. Schumer defended the action, saying, “If you are mentally ill, whether you’re a veteran or not, just like if you’re a felon, if you’re a veteran or not, and you have been judged mentally infirm, you should not have a gun. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

You have to wonder if these documents are being correctly characterized, whether the interpretation of the documents is as   as is being suggested by the New York Times and the other media. We can’t presume that. ” “Where are all the Comey memos?” continued Fitton. “If Mr. Comey’s habits are to be believed, he wrote memos about all his interactions with the president and   officials, and I think all these memos ought to be made public if they’re out there. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

17947,Friday Mailbag: No More Politics. Just Kidding. - The New York Times,"Last week, our first Friday mailbag was mostly election themed, with Donald Trump’s surprise victory occupying most readers’ minds. This week has been no different: The number of letters only increased over the weekend and during the first half of the week, coming in  —   at their highest rate  —   at around 500 per day. Many readers were still questioning The Times’s election coverage  —   more on that in Sunday’s public editor column. Another related topic was the paper’s plans to cover the Trump presidency over the next four years. Some offered suggestions. Several other writers proposed methods for responding to a president whose falsehoods, thus far, have been difficult to keep up with. Others offered words of encouragement in response to the  ’s barrage of angry tweets about The Times. One reader wrote: When The Times reported on Trump’s first White House appointees, many readers believed that the paper was already normalizing Trump’s presidency by inaccurately describing them. On The Times’s description of Trump’s pick to reshape the Environmental Protection Agency, Myron Ebell, as a climate “contrarian”: (A memo that went out to Times editors last year advised that the paper “should not use the shorthand ‘climate skeptics’ except when referring to the (relatively few) trained scientists who see only moderate consequences in global warming. Other doubters  —   political, religious, whatever  —   need a more deliberate description, like ‘people who reject established climate science’ or, subsequently, ‘climate denialists’ or ‘climate contrarians.’ ”) On The Times’s description of Trump’s pick for a top White House post, Stephen Bannon, as “a   media provocateur” and “a nationalist media mogul”: Some readers were mystified by The Times’s postelection analysis. Several were concerned with a story that featured a map describing two separate Americas: one Hillary Clinton’s, one Trump’s. A story on the Trump camp’s refusal to close the door on putting Hillary Clinton in jail raised readers’ eyebrows when it compared Trump’s possible investigation to President Obama’s decision over whether to investigate the George W. Bush administration for torture. The sentence has since been updated, though readers were not notified. The earlier sentence read: “The decision [Trump] faces echoes one confronted by Mr. Obama and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. over whether to investigate Bush administration officials for extreme interrogation tactics against terrorism suspects that the Obama administration later deemed to be torture. ” It was changed to: “When Mr. Obama took office, he and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. also faced a decision over whether to investigate the previous administration. ” One reader wrote: The public editor’s take: The editors were wise to rethink their    comparison. Equating Clinton’s email travails to the actions of C. I. A. water boarders just doesn’t hold up. After a Times live briefing included the term “death tax,” a slew of readers wrote in to point out the misstep. One reader wrote: We raised the concern with the editor of the briefing he told us that the term had slipped by, and that he’d discuss it with the author. (The term still remains in the briefing at time of publication.) Notwithstanding the various complaints  —   and Trump’s claim otherwise  —   The Times this week reported a drastic uptick in paid subscriptions since the election  —   41, 000, to be exact. Many of the new subscribers wrote in to our office to explain their decisions. One reader even asked how he could go a step further: Another reader said she would will be relying on The Times not just for its reporting but also for inspiration. Although we can’t speak for the newsroom, we can promise Beth that the public editor’s office will do its best to help the newsroom answer the call.",0
17948,“Tech” Malaise Pricks San Francisco Office Space Bubble,"“Tech” Malaise Pricks San Francisco Office Space Bubble   
Wolf Richter wolfstreet.com , www.amazon.com/author/wolfrichter Tough business decisions loom. 
The rumored second round of layoffs at Twitter – which in 2011 was granted by the befuddled city of San Francisco the “Twitter tax break” on employment taxes – comes at a very inopportune moment for the glory of commercial real estate. These layoffs would amount to 8% to Twitter’s workforce, or about 300 people, according to Bloomberg . 
Already, Twitter has thrown 183,642 square feet of vacant office space at its two-building Mid-Market headquarters on the sublease market, thus bringing it to 1.51 million square feet (msf). 
This comes at a time when, according to the “ snapshot ” from Cushman & Wakefield, leasing activity nearly ground to a halt in the third quarter, with only 875,000 sf leased – the lowest since 2001! 
There was only one major lease deal over 100,000 sf: Amazon’s live streaming video platform Twitch, which took 178,000 sf. The next largest deal was less than half that size: WeWork leased 78,000 sf. 
Leasing activity for the three quarters this year plunged 30% from the same period last year, to just 4.7 msf, according to a report released this week by commercial real estate services firm Savills Studley , which added dryly, “The competition for space has calmed dramatically from several quarters ago.” 
And there is a lot of new supply coming on the market, according to Cushman & Wakefield: currently, 3.8 msf of office space are under construction, with 31% preleased. 
Overall vacancy rose 0.7 percentage points from the prior quarter to 9.0% in Q3, according to Savills Studley. In Class A buildings, availability jumped 1.1 percentage points to 10.4%. Some areas were still red-hot, but others are turning cold: In the SOMA area, there were practically no vacancies (1.0%). But at the other end of the spectrum, vacancies at the Financial District South spiked 2.5 percentage points to 12.3%. 
Overall, the San Francisco office market, though it has turned the corner, is still tight, compared to the 17.9% vacancy rate of the US index 
As leasing activity has ground into slow-motion, with demand fizzling and companies waiting for rates to drop, while landlords still try to hold on, overall office rents edged up 1.4% to $65.20 per square foot. For Class A buildings, rents rose by 0.9% to $66.75/sf. 
In some submarkets, rents are still rising: at one end of the spectrum, Financial District North, rents rose 2.3% from a year ago, very tepid by San Francisco’s explosive standards. But in other submarkets, rents are coming down: at Jackson Square (the area just north of the Transamerica Pyramid, one of the oldest commercial areas) rents fell 4.7%, and at Rincon/South Beach rents fell 2.4%, with Class A rents down 5.2%. 

How tough is it for businesses to make these sky-high rents work? Charles Schwab’s entire 435,000 sf headquarters building is up for lease. The lease expires in May 2018, and Schwab hasn’t renewed it yet. It’s contemplating moving at least some of its operations to cheaper areas and states, including North Texas. Other companies have already moved out of San Francisco, and others are working on it, including Uber, which is moving across the Bay. 
The rate of $65.20/sf in San Francisco is about double the US index of $33.82/sf. And that’s part of the problem. Because it’s not a perfect world anymore. 
The office sector in San Francisco is dependent on the startup boom, the stock market, the IPO market, the rush of global money, and exuberant optimism in the VC community that this is going to work out somehow, that these startups in bio tech, medical devices, social media, ad tech, fin tech, travel tech, and beer-home-delivery tech are going to be unicorns someday, and that enough of these unicorns are actually going to fly. 
That’s where the money comes from to fund companies with big cash drains that hire lots of people and lease a lot more office space then they’ll ever need in the hope of growing into it as they soar along their exponential growth curve on their way to disrupting dinner as we know it. 
But when VCs and other investors suddenly get skittish, as they did last year and earlier this year as IPOs were drying up, they tighten their purse strings, and some startup shut down while others are laying off people and are putting expansion plans on hold. Valuations have fallen from crazy levels to still crazy levels. More mature companies, like Twitter, have run into the wall of reality where dreams go POP. And others are moving to cheaper pastures. 
But all the fretting appeared to settle down this spring and summer. Stock markets became perky again, some IPOs started flying once again off the shelf in September, mid and later-stage startups were able to secure funding, thus creating some support for office space, and the hope is that the office sector would escape a total rout this time. 
Landlords are trying to navigate this new era, and they’re piling on concessions. Savills Studley: 
They continue to lock in creditworthy tenants over the long-term by boosting concession packages for relocating tenants and current tenants extending their lease term. The rise in concessions is a direct response to a very sharp drop-off in leasing over the last several quarters. 
As recently as mid-year 2015, tech firms were making pre-emptive strikes on space well before they had the staff to fill it. Bidding wars for space have become few and far between. Additionally, some companies are delaying space-use decisions, either due to lightened budgets or a belief that rent will be lower in the immediate future. 
And the new fancy office towers and other buildings coming on the market are facing a widening gap between their $80/sf asking rents and the “growing pool of sublet space now available under $60/sf.” 
This is how office markets turn. Activity plunges as demand suddenly fizzles, while new supply floods the market. Exuberance evaporates. Suddenly companies and landlords go into a standoff, and not much happens until rents come down. But once rents start coming down, companies are holding out for even more concessions and lower rents. Rather than bidding wars, tough negotiations set in, now that vacancies are rising for everyone to see. And the whole bubble mentality collapses into something resembling rational and focused business decision making.",0
17949,US Woman’s Soccer Player Rapinoe Won’t Stop Speaking Out on Social Issues - Breitbart,"Last year, after some players used the sport to protest against the country, the U. S. Women’s National soccer team added a rule requiring all players to stand for the playing of the national anthem. But, one of the players whose actions forced the rule by refusing to stand, Megan Rapinoe, is insisting that she won’t stop speaking out about social issues no matter what rules the team implements. [Rapinoe, 31, took flack last season for joining former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick in his   protests by taking a knee instead of standing during the anthem. But, after several players indulged the protests, the national team added rules requiring all players representing the U. S. to stand during the anthem.  The player, who has been on national teams since 2003, says she will obey the new rule but it won’t stop her from speaking about about the “inequality” she claims to see in the U. S. A. “What has surprised me the most, especially   is that people are still sort of arguing against it. It’s really obvious that we have very serious inequality in this country across many different spectrums,” Rapinoe told the U. K. Guardian. “Yes, we can talk about the form of protest, or the way it’s done, or this or that. But it’s still not really the conversation that I think we desperately need to have more of in this country. ” Rapinoe insisted that the anthem protest is not the only way to speak out against the United States. “I don’t think there’s any perfect way to protest. I think if there was something else being done, something else would have been said about it,” Rapinoe exclaimed. “I can’t look back and say that I would have done this different, this different or this different. ” But the player also said that she was not sorry for her protests. “I can sleep at night knowing that I genuinely tried to have a really important conversation, or at least tried to open it up,” she said. “I think I came to it with an open mind, an open heart and tried to get as many people to talk about it as I could. ” “God forbid you be a gay woman and a person of color in this country because you’d be really fu**ed,” she added. Rapinoe also said she is widening her protests after “learning” more about the “inequalities” in the U. S. “As I got more into gay rights, I got more into equal pay and you just see that it’s all connected. You can’t really speak out on one thing and not another without it not being the full picture,” she insisted. “We need to talk about a larger conversation in this country about equality in general and respect  —   especially with the recent election and subsequent narrative that’s coming from the White House right now. ” “I hope to continue to have the conversation,” Rapinoe concluded. “Hopefully people who disagree with me continue to have the conversation and we can kind of open each other up even more than we already have. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
17950,F.B.I. Papers Offer Closer Look at Hillary Clinton Email Inquiry - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   F. B. I. officials questioned Hillary Clinton extensively about her judgment in using her private email system to discuss classified drone strikes and in allowing aides to destroy large numbers of emails, before ultimately deciding she should not face criminal charges, according to investigative documents released Friday. The documents provided a number of new details about Mrs. Clinton’s private server, including what appeared to be a frantic effort by a computer specialist to delete an archive of her emails even after a congressional committee had requested they be preserved. In a   interview with the Justice Department’s top counterintelligence officials on July 2, Mrs. Clinton defended her handling of the private email system by repeatedly saying she had deferred to the judgment of her aides, an F. B. I. summary of the interview showed. Mrs. Clinton’s use of the private server has shadowed her presidential campaign for a year and a half. And the newly disclosed records, while largely reinforcing what had already been known about the F. B. I. investigation, provided Republicans more ammunition to attack the Democratic nominee’s judgment and honesty as she heads into the final,   Day phase of the campaign. Among the other key findings in the F. B. I. documents: ■ Mrs. Clinton regarded emails containing classified discussions about planned drone strikes as “routine. ” ■ She said she was either unaware of or misunderstood some classification procedures. ■ Colin L. Powell, a former secretary of state, had advised her to “be very careful” in how she used email. The F. B. I. documents show that an unnamed computer specialist deleted the archive of Mrs. Clinton’s emails weeks after the existence of the private server became public in March 2015. Days after The New York Times first reported that Mrs. Clinton had used a private email system exclusively as secretary of state, the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, asked that her emails be preserved and subpoenaed those that were related to the attacks. About three weeks later, however, the unnamed specialist “had an ‘oh shit’ moment” and realized that he had not destroyed an archive of emails that was supposed to have been deleted a year earlier, according to the F. B. I. report. The specialist then used a program known as BleachBit to delete an unknown number of emails, according to the report. Mrs. Clinton told investigators that she was unaware that the aide had deleted the emails. Dozens of times during her interview, Mrs. Clinton said she did not remember details about the server or guidance she had received on how to handle classified information. In its summary of the investigation, the F. B. I. said that Mrs. Clinton had emailed Colin Powell, a former secretary of state, a day after she was sworn in to office about Mr. Powell’s use of a personal email account when he was the country’s top diplomat. Mr. Powell warned Mrs. Clinton that if she used her BlackBerry for official business, those emails could become “official record[s] and subject to the law. ” Mr. Powell, apparently implying that he was cautious in his use of a personal email account, added: “Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data. ” According to the summary of her interview, Mrs. Clinton said that she did not know exactly what Mr. Powell was saying in that email and that his message “did not factor into her decision to use a personal email account. ” F. B. I. officials appear to have questioned Mrs. Clinton most aggressively about her judgment in using her private, unsecured system to get emails about how or where the Obama administration was planning to launch drone strikes against terrorism suspects, the documents indicated. The F. B. I. showed her one email after another containing information about possible drone strikes that was considered classified. But Mrs. Clinton appeared almost blasé in explaining her use of her private system to gather information on drone strikes. After being shown one email that was redacted from the public release of her emails, Mrs. Clinton “stated deliberation over a future drone strike did not give her cause for concern regarding classification,” according to the F. B. I. summary of the interview. “Clinton understood this type of conversation as part of the routine deliberation process,” the summary said. “Moreover, she recalled many conversations about future strikes that never occurred. ” Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, declined to comment. In a statement, her campaign said it was pleased that the F. B. I. had made the documents public. “While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,” the campaign said. But Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that the deletion of the emails violated an order his committee issued to Mrs. Clinton in 2012 and a subpoena issued by the Benghazi committee in 2015. He said he planned to seek answers from Mrs. Clinton about the deletions. “These were not Hillary Clinton’s emails  —   they were government records, and this was potentially one of the largest security breaches at the State Department because they had all these years of security records that just went out the door,” Mr. Chaffetz said. “It’s a very    order. There’s no wiggle room. ” Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, called the F. B. I. documents “a devastating indictment of her judgment, honesty and basic competency. ” The F. B. I. released only small portions of its thick files on the Clinton investigation, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the F. B. I. of withholding key documents  —   including many unclassified ones  —   from public view. The selective release, he said, produced “an incomplete and possibly misleading picture of the facts without the other unclassified information that is still locked away from the public and even most congressional staff. ” Mrs. Clinton told F. B. I. investigators that she had used a personal email server “out of convenience” and did not remember anyone raising legal concerns about the practice. She also said that she “did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,” the F. B. I. documents say. “She relied on State officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address,” they say. The document summarizing Mrs. Clinton’s interview, known in the F. B. I. as a 302 report, runs only a dozen pages. The memorandum on the investigation is lengthier, and goes into greater detail about aspects of the case. The materials were presumably provided to James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, who later decided to not recommend charges in the case. A senior law enforcement official said the interview at F. B. I. headquarters had been intended “to fill the gaps” of what the F. B. I. did not know about why Mrs. Clinton used a private email server. Both documents were partly redacted, which slowed their release as the bureau sought to protect some information while satisfying the public’s right to know. The documents offer the most detailed account of Mrs. Clinton’s role from the bureau’s yearlong investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by using a private system  —   clintonemail. com  —   to send tens of thousands of emails about government business, including classified matters.",0
17951,Trump Budget Proposal Reflects Working-Class Resentment of the Poor - The New York Times,"You could almost hear the gasps from both sides of the ideological divide when President Trump unveiled the outline of his first budget late last month, proposing to slice $54 billion from the discretionary civilian budget next year to pay for a   defense. That part of the budget pays for pretty much everything the government does other than the military, pensions and health insurance for older people. And it has been slashed repeatedly already. It adds up to only some $500 billion, hardly the best place to balance a $4 trillion federal budget. After Mr. Trump’s proposed cuts it would be 25 percent smaller than it was in 2010, adjusted for inflation. Even Republicans in Congress, no friends of government spending, argued that the math made little sense. While they share Mr. Trump’s twin goals of balancing the budget and slashing taxes, they would prefer to square the circle by cutting the entitlements of Social Security and Medicare. And yet Mr. Trump’s approach possesses a powerful political logic: The frazzled, anxious   men and women who voted for him like Social Security, Medicare and defense. Other government spending, not so much. Notably, there is little political cost for Mr. Trump  —   in fact, potential benefit  —   in going after   programs for the poor. These programs appeal to two constituencies that   voters show little affinity for: the poor and urban liberal elites who can express enormous sympathy for the disenfranchised while ignoring the struggle of the white working class. While Mr. Trump is not the first Republican to propose cutting   programs to pay for tax cuts, his bluntness breaks, at least rhetorically, with a Republican establishment that insists it cares about poverty. His political calculation could, paradoxically, protect Social Security and Medicare, entitlements that the Republican Party has tried so hard to rein in. But in areas as diverse as food stamps and housing assistance, education for the disadvantaged and Head Start, it could further fray the rest of America’s threadbare social safety net. In “White Working Class: Overcoming Class Cluelessness in America,” due out in May from Harvard Business Review Press, Joan C. Williams argues that white workers’ resentment of the safety net should not be surprising: They get next to no benefit from it. Ms. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, writes that these struggling workers resent not only the poor beneficiaries of the government’s largess but also the liberal policy makers who seem to believe that only the poor are deserving of help. And they bristle at the perceived condescension of a liberal elite that seems to blame them for their failure to acquire the necessary skills to rise to the professional class. By contrast, they see themselves as   citizens who struggle to make ends meet, only to be left out of many of the government programs their taxes pay for. Over all, 61 percent of poor Americans draw from one   benefit program or another, according to an analysis by the Census Bureau. But among families with incomes above the poverty line  —   many of which are barely better off, making just over $24, 000 for a family of four  —   only 13 percent do. Struggling   families may not understand that welfare programs are so meager that the poor hardly get any help. But they can directly understand that they missed out on the   tax credit because their family income hit $50, 000. It is not surprising that harried working mothers resent that 30 percent of   families using   child care receive some form of subsidy while   families get next to nothing. “All they see is their   daily lives, and they resent subsidies and sympathy available to the poor,” Professor Williams wrote. President Barack Obama’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act  —   the most significant expansion of the safety net since the War on Poverty in the 1960s  —   has unsurprisingly bred class resentment, too. Many disgruntled workers see it as another program for poor people that just pushed up their own premiums, offering little of benefit. The   whites who turned out so enthusiastically for Mr. Trump include people like Lee Sherman, 82, from Louisiana, living precariously on Social Security after a life of hard and dangerous work fitting pipes, and exposed to all manner of toxic chemicals, at a petrochemical plant. Aversion to the safety net is built into his moral view of the world. “He knew liberal Democrats wanted him to care more about welfare recipients,” wrote the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild, who portrayed Mr. Sherman in her book “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right” (The New Press). “But he didn’t want their P. C. rules telling him who to feel sorry for. ” To people like Mr. Sherman, government benefits tied to work, like Social Security and unemployment insurance, are legitimate rewards for one’s effort. Welfare recipients, by contrast, just “lazed around days and partied at nights,” he told Professor Hochschild. Racial mistrust is never far from the surface: Only 13 percent of   whites draw benefits from   programs, according to the Census Bureau analysis, compared with 42 percent of   and 36 percent of Hispanics. So while most beneficiaries of welfare programs are white, many   whites perceive them as schemes to hand their tax dollars to minorities. Mr. Trump’s agenda serves both race and class resentment: Whites are twice as likely as blacks to prefer a smaller government, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Among   Americans, 56 percent would like the government to be smaller and offer fewer services, while among the poor, only 38 percent would like the government to shrink. It is the   whites whom Mr. Trump has promised to serve. These resentments are hard to swallow on the left of the political spectrum. Since the 1960s, at least, liberal activists have held to the belief that a grand progressive alliance was possible: working men and women, the poor, immigrants, racial and other minorities coming together in a coalition to counter conservatives and their corporate allies. November’s election  —   when whites without a college degree voted for Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton by 39 percentage points  —   pretty much drove a stake into those hopes. But could they be revived? As the president takes an ax to much of the government, the pressing question for liberals is whether a coalition can be built to protect the meager social safety net that remains. Could they draw back in the white   voters who rejected them so soundly in November? These voters care less about gender rights and minorities. They may not share liberal views on abortion rights. They are unlikely to support a safety net that allows a poor woman to stay at home while offering nothing to a   couple   day and night shifts to care for their children. But, Professor Williams notes, the liberal goal can’t be saved without them: “If America’s policy makers better understood white   anger against the social safety net, they might have a shot at creating programs that don’t get gutted in this way. ”",0
17952,Pakistan army says Indian troops killed two civilians in Kashmir,"Pakistani troops are seen in a village near the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, October 1, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Pakistan’s army says Indian troops have killed two civilians in the disputed region of Kashmir. 
A military statement said on Wednesday that “unprovoked” firing by the Indian forces took place along the “working boundary,” which separates Pakistan’s Punjab province from Indian-controlled Kashmir. 
The two were killed in the village of Chaprar, the statement said, adding that ""eight civilians were also injured by the Indian fire."" 
Separately, a Pakistani civilian who was injured due to an earlier cross-border shelling succumbed to injuries on Wednesday. 
The Pakistani military said, ""Another civilian... who was injured by the Indian firing at Line of Control (LoC) Monday (October 24), succumbed to injuries today."" 
Tensions have been running high along the Line of Control, which divides the two neighbors in Kashmir. Pakistani villagers show the wall of a house damaged by heavy mortar shells fired by Indian troops in the border village of Chaprar on October 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned a senior Indian diplomat to lodge a protest ""over the unprovoked firing by India on the LoC and the working boundary on October 25 and 26."" 
The ministry called on India to ""instruct its troops to respect the ceasefire"" and ""refrain from intentionally targeting the villages and maintain peace."" 
Relations between the two countries have plummeted in recent months, with India blaming Pakistan for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. New Delhi responded with what it called ""surgical strikes,"" infuriating Islamabad. 
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. 
India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in Kashmir on November 26, 2003, and launched a peace process the following year. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes, with the two sides trading accusations of violating the ceasefire along their de facto border. Loading ...",0
17953,Speaker Ryan’s Obamacare-Lite Plan Primer - Breitbart,"Speaker Ryan’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare elicits calls of “ ” in some quarters. [Here are some of the larger reforms in the Ryan’s American Health Care Act:  Individual Mandate, Under Obamacare, individuals are required to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. The Ryan plan replaces the individual mandate penalty with a penalty payable to the health insurance companies. Individuals who forgo health insurance for longer than 63 days face a 30 percent surcharge on their health insurance premiums. Since premiums are based on age, older Americans face a more expensive penalty for forgoing health insurance. The Ryan mandate’s penalty is based on age, not on income, so   Americans could be subject to a disproportionately higher penalty than wealthier Americans. Employer Mandate, Obamacare required that employers with 50 or more   employees must provide health insurance to their employees and their dependents. The American Health Care Act repeals the employer mandate. Taxes on ‘Cadillac’   Health Plans, The Affordable Care Act taxed expensive health care plans provided by employers at 40 percent. Rather than repealing the Cadillac tax, Speaker Ryan’s plan delays the Cadillac tax until 2025. Repeal of Various Taxes, Paul Ryan’s plan would repeal taxes on: Refundable Tax Credits  The American Health Care Act creates refundable tax credits for individuals to purchase health insurance. The tax credits are adjusted by age: These credits are available for those making $75, 000 or those who file jointly at $150, 000, and the credit phases out by $100 for every $1, 000 higher in income in these age brackets. Raises Limits on Contributions to Health Savings Accounts, Health Savings Accounts allow individuals and families to pay for out of pocket costs medical costs. The American Health Care Act raises the annual contribution limit to $6, 550 or $13, 100 for family coverage. Essential Health Benefits, Paul Ryan’s Obamacare replacement retains Obamacare’s essential health benefits. The essential health benefits provisions requires that insurers maintain a minimum level of coverage, including emergency services, prescription drugs, laboratory services, vision, and dental. State Innovation Funds, The Ryan plan creates a $100 billion “Patient and State Stability Fund” that creates subsidies for states to provide care to   individuals, stabilize private insurance premiums, promote aces to preventive services, and provide cost sharing subsidies. Medicaid Expansion Reform, Medicaid expansion will be capped per capita in 2020. Not in the Ryan Plan, For a Conservative alternative to Speaker Ryan’s plan, see Senator Rand Paul’s plan here:",0

Todos os países que não são simpáticos ou que contrarie os interesses dos Estados Unidos, a forte propaganda de manipulação trata de disseminar pelo mundo de que aquele governante é um ditador. E assim é feito com a Síria, onde apesar de Assad ter vencido duas ou três eleições presidenciais, recebeu o carimbo de ditador pelo simples fato de contrariar os interesses dos Estados Unidos e ter sido eleito, a propaganda dissemina pelo mundo de que foi uma eleição fraudulenta e isso o ocidental não aceita como aceitou o resultado da eleição em que Bush venceu Al Gore. Enviar para um amigo Os Estados Unidos destruíram o Iraque com a propaganda de que o país possuía armas de destruição em massa o que não era verdadeiro e isso foi atestado pelas próprias forças de ocupação. Como a mentira já não colava nos quatro cantos do mundo e inventaram de que estavam levando a democracia a um pais governado pelo ditador Saddam Hussein e que até​ então, tinha sido aliado dos americanos. Hoje os iraquianos vivem em situação muito pior, com conflitos de toda natureza onde os grupos diversos recebem armas do ocidente para guerrearem entre si enquanto as Hal​l​iburton da vida segue tranquila roubando o seu petróleo. ​ Halliburton foi administrada pelo ex-vice-presidente americano Dick Cheney: Tutti cosa nostra... A mesma coisa aconteceu com a Líbia que depois de Israel era o segundo IDH do Oriente Médio segundo a ONU. Mesmo assim, precisaram formar uma coalizão internacional de 46 países para derrubar e assassinar Khadaffi. E usando o pretexto de que estavam derrubando um ditador, destruíram o pai​s, onde grupos rivais armados pelo ocidente se matam e as Halliburton Depois do Afeganistão, Iraque e Líbia chegou à vez da Síria onde os norte americanos acreditavam que seria muito mais fácil e ai houve o engano, pois Assad resistiu e de imediato trataram de disseminar pelo mundo de que ali era mais um ditador e como midiotizado é uma praga que existe em todo o planeta, Assad passou a ser demonizado pelo simples fato de ter enfrentado as forças criadas pelos Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, França, Alemanha, Arábia Saudita, Qatar, Turquia (que parece esta mudando de lado depois do tal golpe em que acusam os norte americanos) e a cumplicidade de Israel que oferece ajuda mé​dica e vez por outra derruba aviões da força aérea da Síria que ousa bombardear as forças do Estado Islâmico nas imediações das Colinas de Golan. Com a chegada dos russos as coisas mudaram de um Assad quase derrotado para um presidente mais forte no poder. Os russos lá estão com a anuência do presidente sírio enquanto as forças ocidentais que não tiveram autorização são meras invasoras. E isso fere a carta da ONU e a soberania Síria, mas a ONU não vale nada para as potências​ do ocidente, onde na sua maioria participam da força agressora que é a OTAN = Organização Terrorista do Atlântico Norte e que no final dos anos 80 bombardeou Belgrado capital da Iugoslávia em pleno coração da Europa, mas como diz um amigo Croata, ""naquela época não existia o Putin"". Na questão de Aleppo, vários grupos terroristas estão no domínio da cidade perpetrando toda desgraça sobre a população, usando armas químicas, mas o culpado é Assad que ousou enfrentá-los. Na Venezuela, apesar de Chávez e Maduro terem sido eleitos pelo voto da maioria da população, a mídia e o atual governo golpista do Brasil, Argentina e Paraguai trata os governantes venezuelanos como ditadores o que parece até​ piada. O de lá eleito pelo voto direto é ditador. O golpista do Brasil, o ​que é? Na Venezuela depois do fracassado golpe com armas em que Chávez foi preso e voltou nos braços do povo, à direita e seus apoiadores internacionais mudaram de tática e usaram a mesma que destronou o governo ucraniano, defenestrado com denuncias de corrupção e hoje uma quadrilha de corruptos estão no poder com a ajuda do ""campeão da democracia"". Usaram desse expediente aqui e estão usando o mesmo na Venezuela onde de repente desapareceram dos supermercados os gêneros alimentícios ​​sabotados pela burguesia empresarial. ​ O governo criou uma espécie de Cesta do Povo o que se mostrou ineficaz contra o desabastecimento e assim os grandes grupos econômicos com ajuda externa que despejam bilhões de dólares para acumpliciar mídia e uma parte dos parlamentares. Com o judiciário a coisa é bem diferente do que é o daqui. Maduro que não tem um perfil Dilma Rousseff e nem na sua equipe republicanos covardes, reage às provocações e recebe o carimbo de ditador pela sua ousadia em resistir. O pior de tudo isso, é que a midiotização geral leva a ""boiada"" a acreditar que realmente ele é um ditador, enquanto o nosso aqui é um democrata e que aquele pais destruidor de países, é nada mais, nada menos que o verdadeiro campeão da democracia no mundo e a ""boiada"" acredita. Ô, raça! Em tempo Lula precisa fazer o mesmo que Maduro faz na Venezuela, Rafael Correa no Equador, Evo Morales na Bolívia e o que diz o escritor Mo​niz Bandeira, que é o envolvimento dos Estados Unidos em toda essa tram​a em que participa a mídia, o congresso e o judiciário e denunciar isso para o mundo, pois existe um interessado maior no enfraquecimento do país e esse interessado, o mundo sabe quem é. Isso é o que tem de ser feito. *Valter Xéu é diretor e editor dos portais Pátria Latina e Irã News. analista politico do Palestina Liberation, Pravda e diversas publicações no Brasil e exterior.",0
17956,Paul Ryan Calls for Facts After Comey Memo: People ‘Want to Hurt the President”,"House Speaker Paul Ryan urged Republican investigators to focus on facts, responding to a New York Times report that President Donald Trump tried to stop an FBI investigation into his former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn. [“We need the facts,” Ryan told reporters at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington D. C. on Wednesday. “It is obvious that there are some people out there that want to hurt the president. ”  Ryan said the New York Times report based on a memo from James Comey “needs close examination” as it left unanswered questions. “I’m sure we’re going to go on to hear from Mr. Comey about why, if this happens as he allegedly describes, why he didn’t take action at the time,” he said. Ryan called for Republicans to be “responsible” and “sober” in the ongoing Congressional investigations, and focus only on facts. “We can’t deal with speculation and innuendo and there is clearly a lot of politics being played,” he said. When Ryan was asked if he still had confidence in the president to lead the country, he replied, “I do. ”",0
17957,The Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
“Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order.” Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order 
Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the “white trash” that they are denouncing. 
I think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump’s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup. 
The organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions. 
The Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians. 
The same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that “for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump’s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.” This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got. 
I hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election? 
What is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, “who benefits?” 
There is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits. 
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as “free trade,” is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent. 
When US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires. 
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the “Russian Threat” by demonizing Russia. 
Accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
The military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up “the war on terror” to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of “the Muslim threat,” even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven’t needed an army. Refugees from Washington’s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe. 
The excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created “the New Hitler” in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy’s principle agent for heating up the new Cold War. 
Hillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But if Trump resolves “the Russian threat,” the Oligarchy takes an income hit. 
Hillary’s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare. 
Those Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues. ORDER IT NOW 
In other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that “there can be no crime without intent.” (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .) 
One would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump’s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him. 
In other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump’s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination. 
The protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy’s wars to overrun Europe. 
Trump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did. 
So what are the protesters protesting? 
There is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs. 
The protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet. 
The Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia. 
Trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be. 
Trump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs. 
Karl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington. 
Washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum. 
Hugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go. 
According to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution. 
Latin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be conciliatory. 
Trump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change. 
Trump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington’s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans’ economic prospects. 
If tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won’t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him. 
Note: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters’ mandate for their platform. (Reprinted from PaulCraigRoberts.org by permission of author or representative)",0
17958,The Next Big Shoe to Drop,"The Next Big Shoe to Drop Posted on   The Next Big Shoe to Drop 
This is yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in… 

From Dr. Jeffrey Lewis : 
More than 40 million young Americans carry federal and private student loan debt – amounting to over $1 trillion. Defaults are on the rise and the issue has grown to become a nasty wealth transfer mechanism, as well as sad example of the failure of finance in general. 
This week, President Obama announced a new initiative framed as a way of addressing the issue. Sadly, it is far from the mark, and just one more indication that monetary masters are the real puppeteers. 
Many have pointed out that the student loan debt bubble could be the next subprime crisis. 
Perhaps so, but it is potentially much worse, acting as an anvil when considered in the context of other consumer debt like car loans and credit cards. 
The student debt debacle has the potential of corrupting not only education, but a generation as well. 
It risks becoming the blight on a generation of would-be productive and innovative work force. 
Furthermore, the workforce declines, and falls behind, as more students return home to live with parents. And the extra burden on multi-generational households adds yet another deflationary force to the natural trend. 
From the perspective of bankers, policy makers, and the propaganda machine, college loan programs have been a tremendous success, providing access for students who would otherwise not be able to afford the privilege. 
It is about threading a narrow political path. 
Defaults are on the rise and the notional value of student loans went north of $1 trillion. 
Servicers must be getting nervous; the lobbyists are circling the wagons. 
There is no clear indication of who will pay for it – or how. 
Defaults on the rise; one in seven currently default. 
The news of doing something comes around to yet another intervention with all the familiar signs that it is meant to save the financiers and has very little to do with helping students. 
The problem is that this is too little too late. 
Student loan debt is a trillion dollar reality in the context of a major, ongoing depression. 
We are a Nanny state – with almost 50 million on food stamps and more on some sort of assistance. Labor force participation is at 40 year lows. 
There is already a major dis-incentive to work. If you take a horrible minimum wage job, you lose valuable benefits, entitlements. 
Which, incidentally, also explains why while it took the U.S. economy 6 years to recover all the job losses since Lehman. This took place at the expense of 13 million Americans leaving the labor force for good even as the U.S. population rose by 15 million. 
It also means that using a historical average participation rate, U.S. unemployment is over 11%, while underemployment is currently well in the 20% range – a far more realistic assessment of where the U.S. economy really is. 
People on assistance programs are literally paid to stay home – think of the cultural implications. 
It’s almost a conspiracy. You have a massive class of under the table people with no voice. Give them bread and circuses. 
The student loan debacle is another story. 
For the parents, the typical situation is framed by skyrocketing tuition; and little help from scholarships become fractions in the face of rising tuition. 
The income cut-off for need-based financial aid is low. 
Parents are expected to contribute 25% of pre-tax income to the cost of tuition. 
If you earn $80K a year and your child’s college tuition is $20K, you get nothing in terms of need-based financial aid. And that 25% doesn’t count room & board, books, etc. 
So, it’s basically impossible for middle-class families to send their kids to college without taking out student loans. In fact, the entire higher-education system is built to force people into debt if they want to send their kids to college. 
And it has a sinister underlying theme… 
It’s always about the “irresponsible student” or the “hairdresser subprime loan borrower” who “should have known better”. 
They should have known that housing prices eventually fall, even though “everyone” in the mainstream, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve said they would not. They should have read carefully the fine print instead of trusting the fancy loan officer. 
And everyone knows that without a college education you will not succeed, so “borrow whatever it takes”. You’ll pay it back. 
Two decades of further tweaks to the bankruptcy code ensued until 2005, when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This Act made it so that no student loan — federal or private — could be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower can prove repaying the loan would cause “undue hardship,” a condition that is incredibly difficult to demonstrate unless the person has a severe disability. It essentially lumps student loan debt in with child support and criminal fines — other types of debt that can’t be discharged. 
But our system is perfectly fine going after the invisible – those without a political voice – whether the poor or elderly who get crushed by inflation, or the 18 year olds who get out with $100K in debt and an art appreciation degree. 
But the price of education should tell an even deeper story…. 
Quality of Education Suffers 
The compounding irony is that not only does the price of education go up, but the quality goes down. Institutions become entrenched. There is little incentive evolve, tenure runs rampant. And the curriculum declines. 
Higher education becomes both a commodity and a spectacle. Not a vehicle for progress or a reflection of the needs of the culture or the economy. 
That may not be hyperinflation…but it’s very sad. College education quality has not risen proportionately with price. 
Student loan debt is out of control by any and all measures. It’s a debacle that benefits no one besides the banker and the servicers. The schools lose by making themselves unviable in the long run. 
The students come away with non-dischargeable student loans and enter a world without, for the most part, having any marketable skills. 
Sadly, the student loans are just one more politically untouchable issue providing yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in.",0
17959,Socialismo ou Barbárie,"Enviar para um amigo No modelo chinês, ele é sustentado por um regime autoritário e pode se expandir livremente, sem quaisquer contestações. O ocidental, teoricamente, deve respeitar determinadas regras democráticas, embora em caso de necessidade, essas regras possam ser sempre flexibilizadas. O capitalismo ocidental, que nos diz mais respeito, não olha para a geografia mundial com os mesmos olhos de quem examina um mapa. Ele não enxerga países. Mercados produtores e mercados consumidores. Seu único objetivo é o lucro acima de tudo. E para alcançá-lo não existem mais barreiras nacionais. Sua bandeira é o livre comércio. Todas as fronteiras abertas, não para facilitar a circulação das pessoas, mas para garantir a compra e venda de bens de consumo. Quando alguns países teimam em resistir e procuram defender suas riquezas em proveito de seus povos, os meios de persuasão vão de guerras comerciais às guerras reais. O Iraque não aceitou as condições das grandes companhias internacionais para explorar o seu petróleo e para puni-lo, criou-se o governo dos Estados Unidos, como o principal representante desse capitalismo belicoso, praticamente destruí o País. Quando se precisou prejudicar as economias da Rússia e do Irã, baseadas na produção e exportação do petróleo, se forçou a baixa no preço do produto nos mercados internacionais, prejudicando por tabela a economia da Venezuela. Mas não é apenas pela ação armada, que se calam os que resistem a esse capitalismo internacional e ainda sonham com um outro modelo de economia. Veja-se o caso da América do Sul. Depois de derrubar os governos do Paraguai e Honduras com golpes parlamentares, os interesses imperialistas se voltaram para a desestabilização dos governos dos dois principais países sul-americanos, Argentina e Brasil. No caso da Argentina, com uma ampla campanha de denúncias através de uma mídia corrupta e venal, foi possível se chegar ao poder por via eleitoral e liquidar o projeto populista dos governos do casal Kirchner e colocar no poder um político sensível aos interesses imperialistas. No Brasil, houve uma conjugação de forças entre um parlamento extremamente corrompido, o judiciário e a mídia, para afastar uma Presidente que, de alguma maneira, não seguia todos os pontos do modelo neoliberal que interessa ao capitalismo internacional. Não é coincidência, que o processo de desestabilizou do Governo Dilma tenha se iniciado através de um assalto a Petrobrás, que com a descoberta do pré-sal se tornara uma forte concorrente ás grandes empresas petrolíferas internacionais. Em 2013, Edward Snowden, ao divulgar alguns documentos secretos da Agência Nacional de Segurança dos Estados Unidos (NSA), mostrou que esse serviço espionava há algum tempo o trabalho da Petrobrás. Agora, o alvo principal na América do Sul é a Venezuela, que teve sua economia abalada pela queda fabricada nos preços internacionais do petróleo A mídia internacional (na Zero Hora existe um jornalista com uma obsessão quase doentia de falar mal da Venezuela), com o apoio de lideranças políticas golpistas internas, procuram derrubar um governo constitucional usando todas as armas possíveis. Apesar disso, com o apoio da população mais pobre, o Governo da Venezuela resiste e continua executando sua política de melhorias sociais no País. Embora isso não seja publicado na mídia golpista, o governo do Presidente Maduro aprovou para 2017 a aplicação de 73% do orçamento nacional, estimado em quase 850 milhões de dólares em projetos sociais, principalmente em educação e saúde. A médio prazo, as experiências com governos reformistas, no Brasil, Uruguai, Paraguai, Venezuela, Bolívia e Equador, nascidos a partir de inéditas mobilizações populares, estão condenadas a ser sepultadas pelas novas exigências do capital monopolista internacional, cada vez menos produtivo e mais financeiro. A longo prazo, a única meta pela qual vale a pena lutar é a busca de uma sociedade socialista, pois como diz Istvan Meszaros sobre o capitalismo no século XXI, a opção continua sendo a mesma citada por Rosa Luxemburgo, há quase 100 anos: socialismo ou barbárie.

17963,WATCH: Gunfire Rattles Tehran as Drone Buzzes Iranian Capital,"(AP) TEHRAN, Iran  —   Sustained gunfire rang out over central Tehran on Monday afternoon as   guns targeted what officials said was a drone flying over the Iranian capital. [Many residents ran to rooftops and craned their necks to see what was happening. Others sought shelter as bursts of machine gun fire echoed through the streets.  The   Tasnim news agency quoted Tehran Governor Isa Farhadi as saying that the gunfire targeted a drone near restricted airspace in the capital. It wasn’t clear who owned the drone, which he described as a quadcopter. That suggests it may have been operated by a local hobbyist or aerial photographer rather than a foreign government. The purpose of its flight also wasn’t clear. The drone escaped  —   apparently intact  —   as Gen. Alireza Elhami, deputy chief of Iran air defense headquarters, was quoted by the   Fars news agency as saying the drone flew out of the restricted airspace once it came under fire. This was not the first such recent incident. On December 23, residents of downtown Tehran awoke to the sound of   fire as the army shot down a state TV drone that officials said had flown too close to the residence of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Monday marked the   anniversary of the implementation of Iran’s landmark nuclear deal with world powers, which gave the Islamic Republic relief from crippling economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.",0
17964,The 21 Questions You’re Going to Need to Ask About Investment Fees - The New York Times,"So much   over such a simple proposition: When a financial professional gives you advice about the life savings in your retirement account, that person ought to act in your best interest. It took several years for this   fiduciary rule to gain approval  —   firms are supposed to begin following the new rules in April  —   thanks to pushback from people in the financial services industry. And then, in the course of a week, we’ve seen President Trump tell the Labor Department to study this uncontroversial (and already  ) proposition, which he wants to upend. A few days later came a big loss for industry players who challenged the legitimacy of the rule in Texas, where a federal judge ruled against them. But let’s put the focus back where it belongs: not on politics or the law, but on you. The best way to understand what the fiduciary debate is about  —   and to protect yourself  —   is to view this discussion through the lens of fees. Every time you do business with people in the financial services industry, ask them this: How much money are you making, and what are the different ways you are making it? If only there were a simple answer to this question all of the time. All of this fiduciary wrangling got started in large part because there has rarely been a simple answer in many parts of the industry. “The fiduciary rule ultimately comes down to the fact that some people are making a lot of money at the expense of other people who have no idea how much their adviser is getting paid,” said Lynn M. Dunston, who runs a financial planning firm in Denver, where the only fees he earns come directly from clients. The best (and by far, the funniest) explanation I’ve seen of what a fiduciary is and does comes from a video that a firm called HighTower Advisors posted on YouTube in 2012. There, they compare butchers and nutritionists. Butchers push meat, perhaps the best meat they have. Nutritionists, however, tell you what is best to eat, period, because they have your best overall health interests at heart and have no stake in how much meat you consume. When seeking advice on your life savings, presumably you would want to speak to the nutritionists and not the butchers. But the butchers of the financial world are in a pretty good spot right now. After all, we have just seen eight years of stock market gains. With an unpredictable new president in the White House, people have reason to be wary. So enter the annuity peddlers, and others touting safety, protections from downside risk, guarantees and the possibility of participating in future market gains, too. And wouldn’t you know it? The way these salespeople sold those products during the last downturn was a big part of what pushed the proponents of the fiduciary rule to act. You will be seeing these pitches soon enough, and when you do, there is a long list of questions you must ask. In fact, anytime anyone is trying to sell you an actively managed mutual fund, a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that you don’t understand or anything else even remotely confusing, hit them with each and every one of the following questions: How much money will you personally make in cash commission, now, if I select this product? And how much will you make later, in any sort of ongoing or trailing commission? Is there a bonus you are eligible for that comes as a result of your recruitment to this firm? Is it in jeopardy if you don’t make this sale? Are you earning more from selling me this product than you might from putting me in a similar product from a different company? Are you earning more than you might if you put me in a different vehicle from the same company? Is your company or the company that created this product running any contests that might lead to you getting to take a free trip if I buy this product? (For a fun virtual tour of the places your salesperson might go, see the two reports that Senator Elizabeth Warren has put out in the last couple of years.) And while we are discussing trips, do any of the companies that you work with offer “due diligence” trips? You know, the ones where you spend an hour learning about the products and 10 hours drinking and golfing? “My wife reads on Facebook that one of our mutual friends is down in Orlando at a fixed annuities conference,” said Patrick Rush, who sold annuities in a former life and is now a financial planner in Greensboro, N. C. “She’s like, ‘What is going on? How come you don’t win anything?’ ” Now, what about other forms of payment, say in points that you might redeem for merchandise? Mr. Dunston of Denver once sold annuities before he came upon what he describes as a better way to help clients (and his blog post on the journey is well worth a read). After a couple of big sales more than a decade ago, he had earned enough credits to exchange them for a diamond ring for his wife worth about $3, 500. The annuity provider, Allianz, told me that a thorough search of its records did not yield information that confirmed Mr. Dunston’s story, but Mr. Dunston said that it may have been a third party that ran the incentive program, and that he is certain he earned those points and that spiffy ring through Allianz. “You can see why advisers might be conflicted about offering something like this versus a   index fund,” he said. “But I really thought I was doing the right thing at the time. ” More questions! Do you get to eat lots of free food? Mr. Rush, the Greensboro planner, well remembers all of the     seminars he once attended at Ruth’s Chris, the steak house chain, courtesy of various financial services companies. How about hoops tickets in   parts of the country? “There were certainly people who could provide Carolina or Duke seats,” he said. “You knew who to call. They weren’t going to be putting you up in the nosebleed seats either. ” Then, there is some  . You will be offered all sorts of product features and extras, and you will need to ask the following questions: How much extra will I pay in fees (or how much might I sacrifice in returns or payouts) if I elect to receive a   bonus on my annuity? Or for a guaranteed minimum income or benefit if I elect to take my money in monthly payments starting at some later date? What if I want a death benefit for my heirs? Are there specific charges for the insurance component of the product? Are there any penalties for pulling my money out early? As for any subaccounts in my annuity, are there expense ratios or fees for the money there? A separate management fee? Trading fees? A   or other administrative fee? Please provide me an itemized list for any and all fees, thank you! Finally, does your firm stand to collect any fees that you yourself will not share in as part of your commission because they have favored one product or another or limited their platform to certain products and locked out others? There is no right answer to these questions, not exactly anyway. Some annuities can be useful (especially the simple fixed, immediate ones and similar products known as longevity insurance) and in some other cases you may get what you pay for in peace of mind. But many other annuities may cost 3. 5 percent annually when you add up all of the fees. For about   of that or even less in some cases, you can find a fiduciary adviser who will give you     advice on every aspect of your financial life and put you in solid (if boring, and simple) investments that cost a tiny fraction of what many annuities do. It’s anyone’s guess how much regulators will ultimately be looking out for you. All Jillian B. Rogers, a Labor Department spokeswoman, would say was that it is exploring options to delay the applicability date for the fiduciary rule. And she would not explain on the record why the department removed an explainer on the rule from its website recently, though an archived version is pretty easy to find. Whatever happens, however, so much will hinge on squishy terms like suitability, best interests, the reasonableness of fees, legal exceptions to any and all standards and whoever is adjudicating any disputes. Rather than get caught up in all of that, it’s probably best to protect yourself from the outset. And in an industry that makes a game of hiding lots and lots of fees every which way, the best possible response is to ask lots and lots of questions.",0

17966,Occupier David Fry released from jail: ‘I’m really free’,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — The last person to surrender in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge takeover was released from prison hours after being acquitted on federal conspiracy charges Thursday afternoon . 
David Fry was found not guilty of conspiring to impede workers from doing their jobs at the refuge through threats, intimidation or force. He was also acquitted of a firearms charge. 
The Ohio resident spoke to KOIN 6 News before stepping onto the streets of downtown Portland for the first time in 9 months. 
Fry said he was excited to reunite with family and friends to celebrate the victory, adding that his plight to end corruption is far from over.“It’s a wonderful feeling… to be acquitted by the highest authority in this country,” Fry said. “I definitely feel this was divine intervention playing in this.” 
“We’ve all got to work together and start making some changes because our governments worldwide aren’t for the people,” he said. “They’ve become the opposite.” 
He said guards at Multnomah County Jail treated him as if he were guilty, and that inmates are not often dealt with fairly or under the presumption of innocence. 
“I guess this is the greatest example of why you don’t treat people as guilty because they can be acquitted,” Fry said. 
Fry was one of the last 4 holdouts at the refuge and helped broadcast the final days of the standoff through YouTube livestreams. He allegedly threatened to commit suicide while on the phone with FBI crisis negotiators before he surrendered. 
Defense attorneys called his father, William Fry, to the witness stand to discuss his motives for joining the occupation. William said his son was “frustrated with corruption” and wanted to support Dwight and Steve Hammond, who he believed were falsely characterized as terrorists. 
Fry wanted to bring his computer equipment to Malheur, his father said, to broadcast what was going on and help people around the world understand the issue at hand.",0

It has been a devastating period for the Hillary Clinton campaign. First, the FBI re-opened the investigation into her e-mail scandal and now, Julian Assange has promised that what’s in the next batch of e-mails to be published to Wikileaks will lead to her arrest. 
Since the first week of October, there have been 21 batches released totaling 35,594 e-mails. According to a message on Twitter, there are more than 50,000 remaining. 
In a broadcast for Russia Today, a London reporter said, “Assange will be releasing more material in what he says will provide enough evidence to see Hillary Clinton arrested.” 
These will be the nail in Hillary Clinton’s coffin, she added. 
Assange assured Russia has no involvement in his e-mail hacking like Democrats are claiming. The DNC servers, he said, were “ripe for hacking” and “riddled with holes.”

17968,How to Heal Your Chakras and Increase Personal Development,"Leave a reply 
Seth M – The seven Chakras of the body are energy hubs and they hold great influence over you and your personality. They are what receive, internalize and diffuse the life energy that flows through us, and each one needs to be balanced; not under-active or over-active. 
Activating or obstructing our Chakras happens both consciously and subconsciously as a result of our thoughts and feelings and actions. Here are ways to heal your seven chakras: 
Crown Chakra; Spirit Energy – This chakra is found at the crown of your head and is associated with your sense of higher purpose, your consciousness and your vision. An obsession with material things is what blocks this Chakra. 
To stimulate this Chakra, one can meditate , pray or participate in religious activity, or sing with passion. 
Third-Eye Chakra; Integration Energy – The third-eye Chakra is found between your eyes and its energy manifests as intuition . It is also called Anja and is associated with the color indigo. This Chakra works with the left and right brain processes, bringing together the male and female sides of you. 
A busy life that lacks self-reflection is a major blocker of this Chakra’s energy. To stimulate it, try being still often, take walks, practice a creative activity, or clear out the excess and clutter that fills your work and life. 
Throat Chakra; Meaning Energy – The throat Chakra is called Visuddha, its color is blue and it can be found in your throat. As it is found in the throat, this Chakra is most closely associated with communication and expression . Beliefs, language and metaphors all stem from this Chakra. 
Disorganized thoughts and lack of focus will block this Chakra’s energies; to stimulate it, say what you are afraid to say, write down inner thoughts and reflections, express your thoughts through art, charts, or diagrams to visualize what you want to say, and talk to other people. 
Heart Chakra; Connection Energy – Anahata, or the Heart Chakra, is green and is found at the center of your chest. This Chakra is associated with kindness and love, and it is experienced as the connection one feels between others. 
Being alone or isolated will block this Chakra’s energy source . To stimulate it, spend more times with friends and family, connect with people, participate in discussion, and develop partnerships with others. 
Solar Plexus Chakra; Control Energy – This Chakra is yellow and is called Manipura. It is found in the stomach area and its energy manifests in moments of clarity, and is often associated with our sense of power, confidence, and self-control. 
Blockages of this Chakra are caused by lack of planning. To stimulate this Chakra, one must create order or structure, expose one’s self to more sunshine, and match our tasks to our energy levels . 
Naval Chakra; Activity Energy – Also known as Svadisthana energy, the Naval Chakra is orange and can be found in your lower abdomen. This Chakra is tied to our feelings and sexuality, and is associated with movement, doing, achievement and our creative side . 
Stagnation due to self-doubt or procrastination is a major blocker of this energy. To stimulate it, connect emotionally with others, practice doing things in steps, do yoga. 
Root Chakra; Existence Energy – The Root Chakra is our Base Chakra, or Muladhara. It’s found in the tailbone and its color is red. the Root Chakra is concerned mainly with one’s sense of security, survival and self-preservation. 
Negative self-talk and self-doubt are major barriers to this Chakra. This Chakra is highly important because if you are unable to deal with your self-doubts, your limit your access to all other six Chakras and their energies. 
To stimulate the Root Chakra, one must confront and overcome self-doubts, visualize tasks being completed and embrace the sense of achievement you will gain once you’ve accomplished them, and listen to what your body is saying when facing these challenges. 
Each of the seven Chakras are connected to one another and they influence every characteristic of our being. SF Source Dreamcatcher Reality Oct. 2016 Share this:",0
17969,Buzz Aldrin: We Were Ordered Away From The Moon,"It sounds like a science fiction script for an upcoming movie about NASA, Astronauts, and aliens on the moon. However, according to several reports, and alleged transcripts between the command center and Apollo astronauts on the moon, mankind encountered otherworldly technology upon setting foot on the lunar surface. 
Via AncientCode 
Interesting details about what astronauts may have encountered on the Moon comes from an interview by an unnamed Professor and Neil Armstrong at a NASA symposium:
Professor : What really happened out there with Apollo 11?
Armstrong : It was incredible … of course, we had always known there was a possibility … the fact is, we were warned off. There was never any questions then of a space station or a moon city.
Professor : How do you mean “warned off”?
Armstrong : I can’t go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology – Boy, where they big! … and menacing … No, there is no question of a space station.
Professor : But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?
Armstrong : Naturally – NASA was committed at that time, and couldn’t risk a panic on earth…. But it really was a quick scoop and back again. (Above Top Secret , p. 186)
Scroll Down For Video Below! Is it possible that Apollo astronauts actually encountered alien beings and UFOs while exploring the lunar surface? There are a lot of reports, interviews, and documents that suggest it’s possible. In fact, according to Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, a physicist and Professor of Mathematics at Moscow University:
“Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large, mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moon module. But his message was never heard by the public – because NASA censored it.” ( Above Top Secret, p. 384) According to numerous sources, Armstrong claimed that there was an alien presence on the moon, and astronauts were ORDERED away.
Reports indicate that Apollo astronauts stumbled across numerous ‘shops’ and structures on the moon which were obviously not man-made. Many UFOlogists claim that Buzz Aldrin even filmed the strange structures and all of the details were reported back to mission control, which deliberately ‘censored’ the information in order to prevent chaos and panic among the general population

 U.S. presidents possess almost unilateral power to drop bombs on other countries, says historian Thaddeus Russell, and that's why it's very good news that Trump is most libertarian when it comes to foreign policy.
Russell, who's the author of A Renegade History of the United States and is currently writing a book on foreign policy, says Trump's enmity with the neocons at National Review and The Weekly Standard is ""fantastic news for us and the world."" He points out that Trump advisor (and likely future cabinet member) Newt Gingrich gave a 2013 interview with The Washington Times expressing second thoughts about his neocon past.
Though Trump has pledged to go after ISIS, his general philosophy seems far preferable to Hillary's systematic and carefully thought-out Wilsonian foreign policy. ""I don't see a war with Russia and I don't see greater interventionism generally outside of [a] little pocket of the Middle East,"" says Russell.

17973,USA: The questions the people should be asking,"USA: The questions the people should be asking 06.11.2016 Given the dimension of the United States of America, given its economic power and given the fact that it is one of those nations that cannot help sticking its nose into other people's business, meddling and intruding where it was not invited, the forcoming election is of global importance and requires responsible voting. Here are some questions the people should be asking. Question 1: Has Hillary Clinton amassed a substantial or any part of her reported great wealth (some say hundreds of millions of dollars) while in public office? If so, how is that compatible with public service? Question 2: Is there a rumor that Hillary Clinton has used the Clinton Foundation to amass a fortune and if there is, to what extent is it truthful? The Clinton Foundation and foreign policy Question 3: There is an allegation that Hillary Clinton has used the Clinton Foundation to receive millions in payments from foreign states for access to contracts in return. This being the case, how ethical is it for a public figure to use a private foundation to conduct government policy, and obtain a fortune to boot? Is this what the USA's foreign policy ethics is about? Then why vote for her?   Question 4: Hillary Clinton laughed and sneered when she heard that Muammar al-Qathafi, the Leader of the Libyan Jamahariya, had been cruelly murdered by terrorists. Is it correct for the leader of a country's diplomacy to giggle and guffaw at the news of a terrorist murder? Backing terrorists Question 5: Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State at the time when the Libyan government was toppled in an illegal act by NATO forces using terrorists on their own lists of proscribed groups. Is this in line with the established law of the United States of America? If not, then what does the law of the United States of America have to say about the chief of the country's diplomacy using terrorists to conduct foreign policy? Question 6: Hillary Clinton was responsible for sending Libya, the country with the highest Human Development Index in the African Continent, back to the dark ages, crawling with terrorists and infested by Islamic State. If she was capable of that as Secretary of State, then what would she do as President and how competent is she for that role? Question 7: Hillary Clinton, as mastermind of the Libyan debacle, is ultimately responsible for the acts of the terrorists she unleashed in that country. Has she, have the citizens of the United States of America, any idea of what these terrorists did? Reader discretion advised, for those easily offended please scroll down to question 8. These terrorists sliced the breasts off women in the streets, these terrorists forced five-year-old girls to watch their parents being tortured and raped and murdered with their throats cut, and as their parents' throats were still spurting blood and gasping for breath, these five-year-old girls were themselves raped before and after being beheaded. Boys as young as six have been impaled on railings (metal rails thrust through their anus until they come out of the child's throat). You cannot unleash this sort of filth, then laugh and giggle and turn your back and walk away. Or can you if you are the US Secretary of State, and get voted in as President despite it all? Question 8: How long has Hillary Clinton been in or around Government? How long has Hillary Clinton been in or around the White House? What has she actually achieved? Can she rightfully claim she is the Queen of Change? Or the Queen of barefaced liars who feathered her nest at the expense of the hard-working people of the United States of America? Question 9: Is there a rumor that a lady was paid 500,000 dollars to come on stage and lie about Donald Trump having abused her? Was it not more than a rumor? Wasn't it proven that she was paid to come into the campaign and lie? When they go low, you go high.

17974,Biden Hints at U.S. Response to Russia for Cyberattacks - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Since the Obama administration formally accused Russia about a week ago of trying to interfere in the election, there has been intense speculation about whether President Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to conduct a retaliatory cyberstrike. The strongest hint so far has come from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who either revealed American plans for a strike or engaged in one of the better bits of psychological warfare in recent times. Taping an interview for NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mr. Biden was asked whether the United States was preparing to send a message to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Days before, the American intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security declared that the Russian leadership was responsible for attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the leaking of stolen emails. “We’re sending a message,” Mr. Biden told Chuck Todd, the show’s host. “We have the capacity to do it. ” “He’ll know it,” Mr. Biden added. “And it will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact. ” Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could “fundamentally alter the election,” Mr. Todd asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent. “Hope not,” Mr. Biden responded. His warning seems to suggest that Mr. Obama is prepared to order  —   or has already ordered  —   some kind of covert action after the stolen emails were published online. That would require what is known in the intelligence agencies as a finding  —   a presidential determination authorizing covert action. Such a finding would allow the United States to make use of its newly developed arsenal of cyberweapons, which are under the control of the military’s Cyber Command, the N. S. A. and, in some circumstances, the C. I. A. Mr. Biden’s statement does not exclude the possibility of a response outside the realm of cyberspace. But most of the other options under discussion in the White House involve actions that would be public, such as economic sanctions under a 2015 presidential order on responding to cyberattacks. Such sanctions have never been invoked, but are well suited to cases like the presumed effort to influence the election. Some experts, however, say they may be insufficient. James G. Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, wrote in Foreign Policy last week that the first step could be making America’s evidence against Russia public. “Revealing the names of the officials who authorized the cyberattacks against the United States would put Moscow in an extremely uncomfortable position,” wrote Mr. Stavridis, a former admiral who is now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “Ideally, the United States could reveal emails or conversations between Russian officials that demonstrated their intent to undermine the U. S. electoral process. ” But that would run counter to Mr. Biden’s “hope not” statement. Mr. Stavridis and others have advocated other steps, including knocking holes in the Kremlin’s wall of censorship so that opponents of Putin could begin to conspire with one another. “As a response to the Russian attacks on the U. S. democratic system, this would be both proportional and distinctive,” Mr. Stavridis wrote. It might also be deniable  —   a key to any covert action approved by the president. Many others have advocated using cybertechniques to expose Mr. Putin’s links to Russia’s oligarchs and reveal his financial holdings overseas, which are believed to be vast. But such steps would risk escalation, and advisers have warned Mr. Obama that the United States is more vulnerable than most nations. Mr. Putin initially denied any Russian involvement in the attacks. But in an interview several days ago, he said the important thing was not how emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign had been hacked, but what they said. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, went further. “We did not deny this,” he said of the hacking. But he added that the United States had offered no proof. A crucial question being debated in the White House is whether warnings like Mr. Biden’s will be enough to make Russia, or others, pull back in their hacking. The calculus behind the decision to formally accuse Russia was that the mere publication of the conclusion could temper the activity. If so, it may not have worked. WikiLeaks in the past few days has published thousands of emails stolen from the Gmail account of John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. While Mr. Podesta has blamed Russia for the attack, intelligence agencies say they have not formally reached that conclusion. There are only two known cases in which Mr. Obama has authorized an offensive cyberaction. One was the operation against Iran’s nuclear program,   Olympic Games. That operation was not detected by the Iranians for years, until an accidental release of the computer code made it obvious that its centrifuges were exploding because of a cyberattack. The other case has been action against the Islamic State, mostly to interfere with its communications or alter data in its systems. Those attacks were publicly announced by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and others, though no details were offered. The announcement seemed intended in part to cause Islamic State insurgents to question whether their internal communications were genuine.",0

17976,We’re All Going To Lose On November 8th: Get Prepped With This Post-Election Chaos Checklist (VIDEO),"in: Preparedness\Survival , US News Darned if we do and darned if we don’t. That basically sums up the current election cycle. I’d go so far as to say that everybody loses during this election, especially if the promised chaos erupts when the winner is announced. Regardless of which candidate “wins” the presidential election, I have a bad feeling about the aftermath. I think we could be on the cusp of the most widespread civil unrest since the Civil War. If you are interested in getting prepared for it but don’t want to read over all of the frightening possibilities, go here and sign up for a Prepping Crash Course that will help you be ready for impending chaos in a mere 24 hours. For those who are wondering how things might go down, let’s look at some scenarios. If Trump wins… There is so much anti-Trump wrath among Progressives that violence has already erupted at campaign rallies. Trump supporters had eggs and bottles thrown at them in San Jose , a police car was smashed and nearly 20 were arrested at a violent protest in Orange County, and a man was even arrested for trying to grab a police officer’s gun to assassinate Trump . And look at what Clintonites did to this homeless woman who was trying to protect Donald Trump’s star from being further defaced on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. YouTube Notice how many of these mob-minded cowards it took to terrorise one homeless woman…Classy, right? Now, think about how these people will react if Trump is somehow elected. If you have a sign in your yard, you will be a target for their rage. Got a Trump/Pence sticker on your car? Expect that it could be defaced. Even more recently, Penn State students were “triggered” by a pro-Trump rally and began tearing down signs, swearing at the pro-Trump kids, and disrupting their event. What’s more, it isn’t just Social Justice Warriors and Progressives folks would need to worry about. A top activist in the group, Black Lives Matter, took to Twitter to inform everyone exactly what would happen if Trump were to win the presidency. This was deleted but is archived here . The tweet was followed by this one, which is still u p… Don’t delude yourself. With a Trump victory, trouble is coming. And don’t think living in a small town keeps you safe. The population of Ferguson, Missouri is barely over 20,000 people – hardly a metropolis. If Clinton wins… With the newly intensified investigation into her corruptio n, it hardly seems possible that she could still win this election, but her supporters seem blind to the crimes she has committed. Instead of looking at the facts, they’re saying “First woman president YA !!!” With all of the collusion , it seems like the FBI is fighting a tough battle to see her indicted. There once was a day that this suspicion would be enough to keep the American people from voting for a person who is blatantly in it for she can personally gain. The Wikileaks email scandal continues, with new revelations about our government leading to possible criminal proceedings, impeachment and heaven only knows what else. As well, there’s a very, very good chance that the election will be rigged . Somehow, despite all that is going on, Clinton’s campaign is still planning her celebratory fireworks party , scheduled to start several hours before all the votes could even be counted. If this happens, Trump supporters will be enraged – and justifiably so. Joe Walsh, a former congressman, has already tweeted he’s “grabbing his musket.” And Walsh is not alone. Many Americans are sick and tired of the blatant, in-our-faces corruption. There is talk of revolution and even a quiet counter-coup going on behind the scenes. Others concur that unrest is coming. I’m not the only blogger out here in Bloggerland who thinks all hell will break loose regardless of who becomes presidents. Mike Adams of Natural News wrote , “My ANALYSIS of possible outcomes from the upcoming presidential election reveals that America only has a 5% chance of remaining peaceful after November 8. This does not mean the violence will occur on November 9th, but rather that events will be set into motion on that day which will lead to an escalation of violence (95% chance…) Check out his predictions of the possible scenarios . And from the more liberal side of the unrest coin, an essayist for Cracked.com still comes to a similar conclusion. “Over the last few weeks a growing number of people have started wondering, “Is it possible the United States is heading for a new civil war?”…Every time I wanted to dismiss those headlines I thought about my visit to Ukraine last year, to cover their ongoing civil war . The most common sentence I heard was, “It’s like a bad dream.” Up to the minute the shooting started, almost no one thought civil war was a serious possibility.” You need to get prepped. Immediately. What it all boils down to is that we need to be prepared. We need to be ready for any unrest that comes about as a direct result of the election – and I really believe that there will be some form of uprising against the result. I hope it will be nothing more than a few minor, isolated incidents, but I can’t get past the niggling feeling that all hell is just about to break loose. November 7 could be the last day of normalcy for quite some time. The governments of Germany and the Czech Republic have told their citizens to stock up on food, water and basic survival supplies in case of a national emergency. We need to be doing the same. If you would like to take a class to help you prepare for this, you can learn more here. If you don’t want to invest in a class, use this FREE handy checklist to make sure you’ll have everything you need. Post-Election Chaos Checklist Make sure everything is in order. While it’s unlikely that services like internet, electricity, and municipal water will be affected, it doesn’t hurt to be ready for that possibility. The key here is to make certain you don’t have to leave your home for the duration of the unrest, should it come your way. Check your pantry and fill any gaps in your food preps. Order emergency food buckets – if you order right away there is still time to get them before the election.",0

17978,Leaked Documents Reveal Expansive Soros Funding to Manipulate Federal Elections,"We Are Change 
By J. Christian Adams
Via PJ Media

Leaked funding documents reveal an effort by George Soros and his foundations to manipulate election laws and process rules ahead of the federal election far more expansively than has been previously reported.
The billionaire and convicted felon moved hundreds of millions of dollars into often-secret efforts to change election laws, fuel litigation to attack election integrity measures, push public narratives about voter fraud, and to integrate the political ground game of the left with efforts to scare racial minority groups about voting rights threats.
These Soros-funded efforts moved through dozens of 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) charities and involved the active compliance with civil rights groups, government officials, and purportedly non-partisan groups like the League of Women Voters.
The leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times . 
Conservatives and Republicans have no opposing effort or source of funds that represents even a small fraction in opposition to level of the Soros-led manipulation contained in the leaked documents.
The documents reveal that the Soros campaign fueled litigation attacking election integrity measures, such as citizenship verification and voter ID. It funded long-term efforts to fundamentally transform election administration — including the creation of databases that were marketed to state governments for use in voter verification. It propped up left-leaning media to attack reports of voter fraud, and conducted racially and ideologically targeted voter registration drives.
The racially targeted voter registration drives were executed at the same time Soros dollars were funding other public relations efforts to polarize racial minority groups by scaring them about the loss of voting rights and the dangers of police officers.
The Soros documents reveal hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into the effort to transform the legal and media environment touching on elections. One document notes that poverty-alleviation programs are being de-emphasized for this new effort. It states: “George Soros has authorized U.S. Programs to propose a budget of $320 million over two years, with the understanding that the annual budget for U.S. Programs will be $150 million beginning in 2013.”
The purpose of the expansion is clear:
The increase in Democracy and Power Fund budget will expand funding of non-partisan voter engagement to catalyze participation from African-American, Latino, immigrant, and youth communities in particular, and to ensure a fair and just redistricting process. The increase in the Transparency and Integrity Fund will expand support for election reform, judicial independence and journalism.
Below are some highlights of this expansive Soros-funded campaign to alter the legal environment and rules of American elections.

17979,Report: Almost Half of Germans Agree With Israel-Centric Anti-Semitism,"Modern   in Germany is increasingly being found to include criticism of the modern state of Israel in general and Jews in particular, according to a new report. [The Independent Expert Group on   published its findings in Germany at the end of last month. It found Jews are “increasingly concerned for their safety due to everyday experiences of  ” as the number surveyed who agreed with   statements rose from 28 per cent in 2014 to 40 per cent in 2016.  It added: “While the   majority does not see current manifestations of   as a relevant problem, Jews in Germany feel they are facing a growing threat  …     there is concern about   among Muslims, these days especially in refugee and migrant populations. ” German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) reports the   study has the support of politicians from across the political spectrum, observing that more needs to be done to fight modern forms of   in the country. The Expert Group said that while traditional forms of   had declined somewhat, modern   for example, criticism of Israel being transferred to Jews in general, remained “alarmingly popular”. About 200, 000 Jews live in Germany, Europe’s third largest community after Britain and France, up from only about 15, 000 who survivied after the end of the Nazi Third Reich. “Forty percent agree with   ” Green Party member of the Bundestag Volker Beck told DW. “That’s almost half of the society. It says a lot about the intellectual environment in which Jews have to live. ” “New forms of   have arisen, and unfortunately the end of the Holocaust and the Second World War didn’t mean the end of ” conservative MP Barbara Woltmann said. “It does worry me that around 20 percent latent   still exists within the populace. ” The parliamentary panel report said rising Jewish fears were partly due to “the growing importance of social media” which was “key to the spread of hate speech and   agitation”. The experts issued five “key demands” to fight  . They include appointing an   ombudsman, establishing a national data base for   crimes and providing   support for groups researching and trying to combat  . As Breitbart Jerusalem reported, in Germany at the end of 2016 there were 2, 083 reported cases of attacks on Jews, Jewish property, and hate speech in 2015, up from just 691 cases in 2014. Previous analysis of crime figures had put the number of   cases in 2015 at 1, 366, but closer analysis revealed that crimes such as the smashing of headstones in Jewish ceremonies, or starting fires at synagogues had been incorrectly classified as criminal damage or attempted arson in some states, with no mention made of the   nature of the crimes.

17980,"20 Spiritual Herbs for Activating Higher Consciousness, Awakening Intuition and Deep Healing","posted by Eddie F or centuries people have been looking into their teacups to find answers in the tea leaves. These brews and herbs have always held a spiritual energy . When you take time to make yourself a soothing cup of herbal tea, you are allowing yourself to go within. You soften your thoughts and begin to hear the voice of your intuition. The Art of Spiritual Tea Making In our current convenience-focused age, many just grab a tea bag and pop it into a cup of hot water. This instant tea is really just flavored water. If you want to gain all the spiritual benefits that a healing herbal infusion has to offer, you need to take some time in preparing it. Tea is best made in a closed vessel—either a teapot or a cup with a small saucer placed on top to serve as a lid. When you brew tea this way, you allow the beautiful aromatic qualities to recirculate back into the liquid. You know that uplifting fragrance emanating from peppermint tea? Well, that represents most of the spiritually healing herbal oils floating off into the atmosphere. If you brew it in a teapot or cup with a lid, the steam condenses back into the infusion. For most herbal teas and for maximum spiritual benefit to be had, you’ll want to brew it for at least five minutes in boiling water. You can allow your tea to brew longer and get an even more potent spiritually activating herbal infusion . A general rule is one teaspoon of herb per cup of water, plus one extra for the teapot. So if your teapot holds two cups of water, you would add three teaspoons of herb. Spiritual Properties of Various Herbs, Plants and Teas Calendula Calendula is a powerful spiritual herb that will bring healing as well as activate your innate healing abilities.

When you drink chamomile, you let down your guard and let in the healing love of God and your angels. Fennel Fennel tea (made from the seeds) can help reduce sugar cravings.

Add five to ten good quality saffron threads (parts of the pistil of a crocus) to a cup of boiling water.

How to Take Herbal Medicines As a sensitive and spiritual person, you may not need high doses of herbal supplements, as your body is receptive to these healing compounds and will immediately begin to utilize them. Where it may take others three to four weeks to observe a change, you might see improvements in just a matter of days. You understand that what you eat changes your entire energy. You’ve noticed that you can’t handle certain foods or drinks because they just don’t agree with your delicate body. So, before you dive into high doses of spiritual herbs , check in with your intuitive feelings. Herbal medicines come in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, teas, liquid extracts, and tinctures. Whichever form you choose, please ensure it’s sourced from a reliable company, sustainably harvested, and organic or wild-crafted. This will give you the best results, as well as the highest energy and spiritual activation. Any form of spiritual herb will have a healing influence, yet there is something especially powerful about a liquid. When you take a tincture, it brings through the energy and vibration of the spiritual plant. Add the appropriate dose to a small glass of water. The amount of water isn’t important as long as you drink the entirety. If you are on any other medications or have preexisting health concerns, please always check with your health-care practitioner before starting any herbal medicines. Elder (Sambucus nigra) Elder (Sambucus nigra) is available in two forms—the berry and the flower. Elderberry is an excellent antiviral. In this case, though, we are more interested in the elder flowers, as they help promote sweating. The elder tree has a long history connected to ancient mysticism. Even farmers would refer to the spirit of this tree as the “Elder Mother.” This spiritual herb has a powerful energy that awakens your intuition and opens your chakras . Elder flowers have a connection to the head and are excellent for people with constant colds, runny noses, or hay fever. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a warming herb that stimulates your circulation. As your blood spreads through the superficial layers of your skin, it clears the eccrine glands. The ginger carries with it the nutrition that’s available to your body. Think of it like a courier transporting your vitamins and minerals to the locations that need them most. Along with this nutrition, your energy also flows through the same path. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the blood and energy/vital force follow one another. So if your circulation is stimulated, so too is your energy, and therefore your intuition. Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) helps stimulate the eccrine glands and soothe an upset stomach. You may have noticed that when you have a cup of spiritually activating peppermint tea, your hands sometimes feel warmer. This doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does, it shows that the energy in your palm chakras has been awakened. Your hands are now more sensitive to energy, and you can use them as a natural divination tool. When you meet someone for the first time and shake hands, trust the impression that you receive. Peppermint tea will help you have more confidence in these intuitive messages . Heart-Healthy Herbs Herbal medicines have both physical and energetic properties. These heart-healthy spiritual herbs nourish and protect your physical heart, stimulate your heart chakra, and also heal you emotionally. Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is a legendary tonic spiritual herb that nourishes the heart. It may balance blood pressure, as well as help you better cope with stress. Astragalus is a wonderful regulator for the body. It corrects imbalances and helps you overcome any obstacles. Dan Shen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) Dan Shen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) is a spiritual herb that has a strong connection to the heart. It balances blood pressure and prevents your blood from becoming too thick. Dan Shen protects the heart and can reduce palpitations. This herb can be helpful when people have a fiery energy about them, seeming angry and aggressive. A red face that comes from anger or high blood pressure can be a sign that this herb is needed. Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) is one of my favorite heart-healing spiritual herbs. I use it for both the physical and emotional heart. On a physical level, it protects the heart muscle. It nourishes this precious organ, helping strengthen and regulate it. Emotionally and energetically, it soothes a broken heart. I’ve used it for healing grief; difficult relationships; and feelings of being taken advantage of by friends, family, or partners. Hawthorn has a gentle energy, like a comforting friend giving you support. Korean Ginseng (Panax ginseng) Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng) is a powerful, tonic spiritual herb that deserves a great deal of respect. It stimulates and awakens the whole body. In contrast to the way caffeine stimulates, Korean ginseng heals and restores. It nourishes the heart and clears feelings of debility. Korean ginseng allows you to cope with stressful situations in a healthy way, and has even shown an ability to increase mental alertness and memory. Taking a dose just before an exam can help you remember more information—an effect made even more powerful when you combine it with ginkgo. Source: by Doreen Virtue and Robert Reeves, N.D.

17981,Reliable AI Poll System Predicts That Trump Will Win In November,"Pinterest 
Despite the multiple attempts to throw Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump off his game and into the gauntlet, he has proved resilient and potentially victorious. 
The Clinton campaign has left no stone unturned in an attempt to destroy Trump and create distractions from her criminal activity. 
However, one of the most reliable formulas is predicting a Trump victory. 
According to the New York Post : 
A data-crunching artificial intelligence system that’s correctly predicted the last three US presidential elections is picking Donald Trump to be the next commander in chief. 
The AI system, called MogIA, crunches 20 million data points from sites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to spew out its predictions, CNBC reported. 
It shows that Trump has overtaken the social media engagement numbers of Barack Obama’s peak in 2008 — by 25 percent. 
And that’s important, because the candidate in each election who led in engagement data ended up winning the presidency, according to MogIA creator Sanjiv Rai, founder of an Indian startup company called Genic.ai 
Now, some of you may be raising an eyebrow to this “engagement data” since Trump is talked about a lot on social media–the good, the bad, and the ugly. 
How does the data sort out positive and negative comments? Trump supporters talking about Trump, versus Hillary supporters criticizing Trump? 
It turns out that doesn’t matter. 
This same system–relying on engagement data–also successfully predicted Trump’s win in the Republican primaries. 
Democratic presidential candidate should not get too comfortable in her alleged lead. 
Ultimately, Trump supporters and Trump haters are extreme. But, ultimately, it appears no news is bad news. 
As the founder of this artificial intelligence system stated, “If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since internet engagement began in full earnest,” Rai told CNBC. 
Hopefully, come November, anyone possessing a modicum of human intelligence will vote this artificial intelligence prediction into reality.",0
17982,What Is At Stake In The Election,"Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control American's Minds . 
I just heard an NPR presstitute declare that Texas, a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump's election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us--Hillary's win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement--the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn't they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? - Advertisement - 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn't even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. 
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump's lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. - Advertisement - 
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. 
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be ""the new Hitler"" and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia. 
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it? 
Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media.",0

17984,"Donald Trump Appears to Soften Stance on Immigration, but Not on Abortion - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump appeared to soften some of his   campaign positions on immigration on Sunday, but he also restated his pledge to roll back abortion rights and used Twitter to lash out at his critics, leaving open the possibility that he would continue using social media in the Oval Office and radically change the way presidents speak to Americans. In his first   television interview since his upset victory on Tuesday, Mr. Trump repeated his promise to name a Supreme Court justice who opposed abortion rights and would help overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized them, returning the issue to the states. Asked where that would leave women seeking abortions, Mr. Trump, on the CBS program “60 Minutes,” said, “Well, they’ll perhaps have to go  —   they’ll have to go to another state. ” On immigration, he said the wall that he has been promising to build on the nation’s southern border might end up being a fence in places. But he said his priority was to deport two million to three million immigrants he characterized as dangerous or as having criminal records, a change from his original position that he would deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. President Obama has deported more than two million undocumented immigrants during his time in office. Mr. Trump said that undocumented immigrants who are not criminals are “terrific people,” and that he would decide how to handle them after the border is secure. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, echoed the   saying on Sunday that there would be no deportation force, something Mr. Trump had promised to create early in his campaign. “That’s not what we’re focused on,” Mr. Ryan said on CNN’s “State of the Union. ” Mr. Trump also said he considered the Supreme Court decision last year that validated   marriages as settled, and that he was “fine with that. ” He endorsed popular aspects of President Obama’s health insurance law, including a provision that requires coverage of people with   medical conditions and one that allows young people to remain on their parents’ plans until the age of 26. But even as he appeared to inch toward the political center, Mr. Trump used a series of postings on Twitter to argue that The New York Times’s coverage of him has been “BAD” and “very poor and highly inaccurate. ” He falsely stated that The Times had issued an apology to readers, an apparent reference to a letter to readers from The Times’s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and its executive editor, Dean Baquet. The letter noted the unpredictable nature of the election and said The Times aimed to “rededicate” itself to “the fundamental mission of Times journalism. ” In the letter, The Times posed a series of what it called inevitable questions, including, “Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?” Mr. Trump also claimed that the newspaper had been losing thousands of subscribers over its campaign coverage. In a Twitter message in reply to Mr. Trump, The New York Times Company said it had seen a “surge” in new subscriptions since the election  —   four times the   rate. “We’re proud of our election coverage  we will continue to ‘hold power to account,’”  the company said. Mr. Trump, in another Twitter post, said The Times had falsely reported that he believed additional nations should acquire nuclear arms. However, in an interview in March with The Times, Mr. Trump, asked about the North Korean threat to its neighbors, said he thought the United States’ allies might need their own nuclear deterrent. “If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,” he said. Later, he added, “The bottom line is, I think that frankly, as long as North Korea’s there, I think that Japan having a capability is something that maybe is going to happen whether we like it or not. ” His posts on Twitter were a striking public display from a man who, after winning the election, had worked to project an air of seriousness and   first in a victory speech early Wednesday and then in an Oval Office meeting the next day with Mr. Obama, whom he called a “good man” for whom he had “great respect. ” But by Thursday evening, Mr. Trump was using Twitter to complain about demonstrations against his victory, saying they were being mounted by “professional protesters, incited by the media,” and branding them as “very unfair!” The social media sniping  —   unparalleled in the history of presidential communication  —   suggested that Mr. Trump plans to bring his confrontational style of speaking to Americans to the White House, working to undercut news outlets that do not comport with his views, silence his critics and elevate his own standing. On Sunday, he selected Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a site known for its nationalist, racially charged and   coverage, to be his chief strategist and senior counselor. It was only one indication of the extraordinary nature of the  ’s tactics and those of his inner circle. In the “60 Minutes” interview, Mr. Trump suggested he would not hold to the longstanding   tradition of presidents refraining from interfering in F. B. I. criminal matters, hinting that he would quiz the director, James B. Comey, about his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server before deciding whether to dismiss him. “I’m not sure,” Mr. Trump said when asked if he would seek Mr. Comey’s resignation. “I would have to see  —   he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did. ” In an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump did not rule out prosecuting Mrs. Clinton. On Sunday, his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, warned that Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the minority leader, could face legal action for having said that Mr. Trump’s election had “emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America. ” Mr. Trump has said he is proud of how he has used social media to create his own version of events and communicate it to his followers. He suggested in the “60 Minutes” interview that he is reluctant to surrender that platform when he takes the oath of office in January. “I’m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out,” Mr. Trump said of Twitter during the interview, adding that his millions of followers on various social media sites had given him “such power” that it helped him win the election. “When you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,” Mr. Trump added, “I have a method of fighting back. ” He said, however, that he would be “very restrained” in his Twitter posts should he continue to make them as president. Mr. Trump is a highly public scorekeeper of his own accolades and accomplishments, and his elevation to the highest office in the land has not changed his instinct to crow about the smallest details. During the interview, Mr. Trump boasted that since his election, he had built up his social media following by tens of thousands of people. “I’m picking up now  —   I think I picked up yesterday 100, 000 people,” Mr. Trump said. The interview, which also featured Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, and adult children, showed a side of the   that he did not display during the campaign  —   a man awed and somewhat intimidated by the significance of the office to which he had just laid claim. “I’ve done a lot of big things I’ve never done anything like this,” Mr. Trump said. “It is  —   it is so big, it is so  —   it’s so enormous, it’s so amazing. ” Mr. Trump said he had been inaccurately portrayed as “a little bit of a wild man” during the campaign, and he promised that he would be able to tamp down some of his more heated speech as president. But he suggested that he would still use such tactics to galvanize his supporters, just as he did during his bid for the White House. “Sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated,” he said. “I don’t want to be just a little nice monotone character. ”",0
17985,"In John Kerry’s Mideast Speech, a Clash of Policies and Personalities - The New York Times","JERUSALEM  —   Even before Secretary of State John Kerry issued his scathing critique of Israeli policies on Wednesday,   Donald J. Trump essentially told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ignore it. “Stay strong Israel,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “January 20th is fast approaching!” Mr. Netanyahu responded warmly. “  Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your   support for Israel!” he wrote, adding Israeli and American flag emojis. Mr. Kerry’s   Middle East speech brought together four giant personalities representing two radically divergent worldviews in one momentous clash. On one side was Mr. Kerry, venting years of frustration on behalf of President Obama and himself at what they consider Israeli intransigence. On the other were Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump, firing back at what they deemed a hypocritical betrayal of America’s closest friend in the Middle East. If Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry were playing for history, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump were playing for time. The departing administration intended for the speech to lay out a path to peace that they had tried to take, hoping to salvage some scrap of a legacy on the issue. The incoming administration and its Israeli ally were busy counting the days until the old team will be swept from the stage and a new   alignment redefines the politics of the region. Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry have painted Israel into a corner, providing ammunition to its critics and effectively isolating it on the world stage after a United Nations Security Council resolution last week criticizing Israeli settlements and the secretary’s sharp assessment on Wednesday. But in three weeks, Mr. Netanyahu expects unstinting support from Mr. Trump, who so far appears to be promising it. Amid the harsh exchanges was the increasing sense that the   solution to the   conflict favored by much of the world no longer seems plausible, at least for now. When Mr. Kerry outlined six principles for a final    agreement, he largely tracked longstanding American orthodoxy. But unlike when President Bill Clinton did something similar 16 years ago, it sounded more like a requiem than a plan. “The positions he lays out are well known to all of us,” said Michael Herzog, a member of the Israeli negotiating team during the latest round of failed talks, led by Mr. Kerry in 2014. “There were no major surprises. The question is, does it really matter?” Indeed, among the blaring, polarized responses to Mr. Kerry’s speech, the one conclusion that drew agreement across political lines was that the   solution may be all but buried. “This will go down in history as an eloquently delivered eulogy to the   formula, which is in itself a recipe for disaster,” said Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council, which represents Israeli settlers. “John Kerry just gave an eloquent eulogy for the   solution,” said Ali Abunimah, a   activist who helped found the Electronic Intifada, a website focused on the Palestinian side of the conflict. While Mr. Netanyahu still formally supports a   solution, few believe his heart is in it, and voices on the far sides of the conflict are increasingly talking about a   solution, albeit one conceived in starkly different ways. From his right flank, Mr. Netanyahu faces calls within his coalition to give up the   formula and instead annex parts of the West Bank. From the other side, some Palestinians now advocate a single state from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River in which everyone has an equal vote, knowing that Palestinians would ultimately outnumber Jewish citizens in such a country. The rift between Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may further polarize a debate that has divided the world for decades. With such a harsh assessment by the departing Obama administration, Israel has for the moment lost its staunchest defender in the international arena, and its critics may feel emboldened to press for more action against it in the form of sanctions, boycotts or legal cases. Conversely, the impending arrival of Mr. Trump and his unqualified support for Israel have already inspired the Israeli right to press for more aggressive policies that would move the country even further from compromise. After nearly eight years with Mr. Obama, Mr. Netanyahu for the first time may feel little or no American pressure to make concessions. The status quo in the meantime is an uneasy coexistence with no obvious resolution in the near term. Palestinians live under military occupation surrounded by miles of walls and fences. Israelis build more homes for themselves while their forces raid communities, control movement through checkpoints and respond to provocations with decisive force. Israelis live under the constant threat of terrorism, enduring sometimes daily assaults by attackers wielding knives or driving cars into crowds. The Palestinian authorities venerate such “martyrs” and compensate their families financially. It is against that backdrop that the struggle of the four major figures in the twilight of an expiring presidency has played out in recent days and weeks. Underlying it was a deep divide over who was to blame for the long impasse in this part of the world. Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry, while careful to call on the Palestinians to curb terrorism and incitement, seem to save most of their emotional energy for denouncing Mr. Netanyahu, who has come to grate on both of them. To the extent that the United States has presented itself as an honest broker in the conflict over the years, Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry are viewed by many in Jerusalem as tilted to the Palestinian cause, despite the $38 billion they pledged to Israel’s defense over the next 10 years. Mr. Netanyahu has reacted to the United Nations resolution and Mr. Kerry’s speech as if they were “a declaration of war,” a phrase he reportedly used before the Security Council vote last week in trying to persuade New Zealand to drop the measure. Mr. Trump, after initially saying he wanted to be a neutral figure in the   conflict, has thrown in his lot with Mr. Netanyahu, especially since the election, perhaps encouraging the prime minister to castigate the departing president and secretary. “Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders,” Mr. Netanyahu said after Mr. Kerry’s speech. Still, some of Mr. Netanyahu’s domestic critics said he had brought this on himself. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak wrote on Twitter that most of the world and Israel agreed with Mr. Kerry. “Bibi, on verge of messianic abyss, determined to go forward,” he added, using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname. Reactions to Mr. Kerry divided along similar lines, only in reverse. Miri Regev, a   minister in Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet, told an Israeli news outlet that Mr. Kerry’s speech “gives hope to the terror organizations to eliminate Israel step by step. ” She also challenged the secretary to propose “having Washington divided” as he proposes to divide Jerusalem. The final break between Mr. Kerry and Mr. Netanyahu  —   and their patrons, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump  —   came after years of conversations that never led to the accord the secretary sought. Mr. Kerry made a point of talking with Mr. Netanyahu often, more than was publicly known, hoping to build a relationship that would enable them to bridge their ideological differences. But Mr. Netanyahu never viewed it as in his interest, or in Israel’s, to go along with the American interloper. After all the stormy exchanges and recriminations, the remaining question is where Mr. Trump’s alliance with Mr. Netanyahu will lead. Mr. Trump fashions himself a deal maker, and this would be the ultimate deal. Having embraced one side of the conflict so avowedly, could he craft a mutually acceptable bargain where Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry failed? Would he deem it in his interest to try? And would Mr. Netanyahu want him to? As Mr. Trump put it, Jan. 20 is fast approaching.",0

17988,Steven Mnuchin Is Confirmed as Treasury Secretary - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Steven T. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film financier, to be Treasury secretary on Monday, putting in place a key lieutenant to President Trump who will help drive the administration’s plans to overhaul the tax code, renegotiate trade deals around the world and remake financial regulations. By a vote of 53 to 47, the Senate confirmed Mr. Mnuchin, who was Mr. Trump’s top campaign  . During a long debate over Mr. Mnuchin’s credentials, Democrats argued that his experience on Wall Street exemplified corporate malpractice that led to the 2008 financial crisis. The new Treasury secretary will have little time to celebrate. He will be under pressure to help finalize the Trump administration’s tax plan, accelerate the rollback regulations and raise the government’s borrowing limit. The administration has said it will release a comprehensive plan to rewrite the tax code in the coming weeks, and it will have to deal with the debt ceiling next month. While Mr. Mnuchin’s financial acumen has been praised by Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress, Democrats have argued forcefully that he is not up to the job. They have painted him as a symbol of everything that is wrong with corporate America. “He was part of the cadre of corporate raiders that brought our economy to its knees,” Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said on the Senate floor on Monday. There was also no shortage of  . Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, referred to Mr. Mnuchin at the “foreclosure king. ” Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, described him as “greedy” and “unethical” while arguing the case against him. “Whether illegally foreclosing on thousands of families, skirting the law with offshore tax havens or helping design tactics that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, Steve Mnuchin made a career  —   and millions of dollars  —   pioneering increasingly deceptive and predatory ways to rob hardworking Americans of their savings and homes,” Ms. Duckworth said. At a prickly confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee last month, Mr. Mnuchin was scolded by Democrats for failing to disclose nearly $100 million in assets and for not revealing his role as a director of an investment fund based in the Cayman Islands, a   tax haven. After the hearing, Democrats on the committee accused Mr. Mnuchin of lying for saying that OneWest Bank had not engaged in the controversial foreclosure practice of “ ” when he was its chief executive. The Democrats on the committee twice boycotted a vote on his confirmation, leading Republicans to breach protocol and push Mr. Mnuchin’s vote to the full Senate on their own. Just one Democrat, Senator of Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broke with his party and supported Mr. Mnuchin. In a sign of the backlash that Democrats will face for siding with any part of Mr. Trump’s agenda, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee warned that Mr. Manchin’s vote would not go unnoticed. “We will ensure that Joe Manchin hears from his West Virginia constituents who disapprove of his voting with Wall Street against working families,” the group said in a statement after the vote. For Republicans, the resistance was chalked up to political theater. On Monday, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, accused Democrats of making Mr. Mnuchin a political pawn and described their concerns as a stall tactic. “Under any objective standard, Mr. Mnuchin has ample experience, credentials and qualifications for this important position,” Mr. Hatch said. “My colleagues have done all they can under the rules  —   even to the point of casting aside some longstanding customs and traditions of the Senate  —   in order to delay his confirmation. ” While Mr. Mnuchin struggled to show fluency with some aspects of the job during his confirmation hearing, Republicans and Democrats generally agreed that he was well versed on economic issues. He also struck a more moderate tone than Mr. Trump on issues such as trade and dealing with China. And Mr. Mnuchin left some experts dumbfounded after suggesting that “there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class”  —   a promise that appears to be at odds with plans presented by Mr. Trump and House Republicans. Mr. Mnuchin was not the only member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet to be confirmed on Monday night. The Senate also voted in favor of David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. A holdover from the Obama administration, Dr. Shulkin is currently the department’s under secretary of health and was approved by a unanimous vote. Mr. Mnuchin was the latest member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet to edge through the confirmation process on a largely   vote. Last week, Tom Price was approved as secretary of health and human services and Betsy DeVos narrowly won confirmation to lead the Education Department. Things could become more complicated on Thursday, however, when Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s choice for labor secretary, faces a committee hearing. Several Republicans on the committee have declined to support Mr. Puzder, a   chain executive who critics say promotes policies that are harmful to workers.",0
17989,I Envy You,"By Israel Shamir on November 5, 2016 Israel Shamir — The Unz Review Nov 3, 2016 I envy you, American citizens. I do not care about your military might, nor for your supreme currency, the US dollar. I envy your chance to deal on 11/8 a decisive blow to the rule of the Masters of Discourse. Though the Masters control the entirety of world media, and they decide what people may think and say from Canada to Hong Kong, only you, American citizens, can defeat them. This is a great chance, a unique opportunity not to be missed. The Masters of Discourse can be defeated. They are not stronger than any ruler of past. Trump has a great quality making him fit for the task: he is impervious to labels and libels. He had been called everything in the book: anti-Semite, racist, women hater, you name it. And he still survived that flak. Such people are very rare. We know he is against the Masters because every newspaper is against him. I never saw a similar onslaught but once, in Russia in 1996. Then President Yeltsin, an old drunkard who had brought Russia to collapse, had to run for his second term. His popularity was next to zero. Two per cent of Russians intended to vote for him. And then the oligarchs turned on their propaganda machine. Yeltsin’s competitor Gennady Zyuganov, a mild church-going post-communist, had been presented like a Hitler of his days. All the Russian media of the day belonged to oligarchs, and all of it participated in the onslaught. Zyuganov surrendered. Perhaps he won the election, but he congratulated Yeltsin with his victory. It was said that he was threatened with assassination unless… Others say he was bribed. I do not exclude both explanations, but for sure the might of united media can crush a timid man. In the days of the Jewish Temple, there was a Magrepha, a wind instrument able to produce diverse and frightening sounds. There is no agreement among the scholars about what sort of thing it was. Whenever it sounded, people were scared. The media of our days is a new Magrepha. If all of its outputs are united, they produce a terrible roar. Yes, the onslaught of the media upon Trump had been exceedingly unfair, but he survived it. What is even more important, you survived it. It does not matter what the polls say: they say what the newspapers tell them to say. Even people answer the polls according to the media prognoses: they are shy of saying they would vote for a man who … But at the moment of actual vote, they do what they know is right for them. Not for transgenders, not for Muslim brokers, not even for single mothers, but for themselves. You have a very good chance to win, and to defeat the witch and her supporters. We learned that the British people voted for Brexit, though all the media said that proposal had no chance. But we also learned from Brexit, that nothing is over until it is over. The Masters of Discourse will try every trick to steal the elections, and only their fear of armed rising may finally force them to acknowledge their inevitable defeat. We know that in 2015, when Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, was afraid of losing the elections, he revealed that the American intelligence has some superior software which allows them to falsify the elections. Perhaps, but he won despite this magical software, despite Obama’s wrath. Even in Israel, that favorite son of the Masters, the Masters are hated. The New York Times is always speaking good about Israel, but still Israelis do not like the newspaper. Nobody likes them, nobody likes an old aunt who tries to tell us what we can say and what we can’t. If Netanyahu could win, Trump can win twice. After the first debate of Trump and Clinton, people said: She won! But we shall vote for him. This was a very encouraging sign. Indeed every woman worth its salt would win an argument with her husband or son-in-law, let alone a pretender. That is the way we are made. The story of sirens enforces the belief that if you listen to a woman, she will bewitch you. Sirens actually ate the bewitched sailors; our womenfolk do not go to such extremes, but they can cause us a lot of trouble. Trump seems to be almost pure of heart and deed, as even extremely prejudiced media could not find anything really incriminating about him but bragging about having his way with women. I shall not recount so many proven accusations against Hillary. All of that can be found in the emails revealed by Julian Assange and his great Wikileaks team. The media kept mum about it, but the secrets can’t be kept forever. There are many practical things Donald Trump will be able to fix. He can return industries home, he can return American GIs home from four ends of the world, he can improve lot of working men. But he surely will set all of us free from the annoying bondage of the Masters. Just for that reason, go and vote, for yourself and for millions of us who aren’t entitled to.

17990,The Winter of Our Discontent: Survival | Survival,"(Before It's News)
A new year coming up, a new administration being sworn in, and new threats emerging, so will this be a winter like no other? Ice storms, power outages, mass shootings, financial crisis’s, possible attacks by other countries and civil unrest all loom large in the new year.
The nation’s power grids, yes plural because there are three of them are in disrepair, and much of the grid system relies entirely on computer systems, which it seems, are hacked on a daily basis. Russia is stirring and making war noises, North Korea has failed to launch but they keep trying and they will get it right soon enough, and then there is Iran running their fingernails down the chalkboard trying to get our attention. Iran wants a war because it takes the focus off of just how badly treated their people are and it always ends up being about money and power, so why not start a war is their thinking.
All in the name of something are wars started, wars are profitable, and they cover up a lot of atrocities committed by all parties, the fog of war, and all that. This winter we may or may not be in a war much may depend on just how the new administration handles things, however.
You cast your vote and pray for the best, of course, there is much more you must do. You as an individual and as a family or even as a community must prepare, because you may have to go it alone for days, weeks, or even months if the grid is hacked and shut down, or if we are attacked or if a natural disaster strikes. The world is in turmoil and much of what happens is simply out of your control, what you can control, however, is how you prepare and react.
You have to be prepared to live without your local, state or federal governments help. No garbage pickup, no clean water piped in, no natural gas for heat or cooking, and no snowplows patrolling the streets. Police will prioritize so that recent break-in with no injuries goes to the bottom of the list. Firefighters may be responding to fires set by violent protesters and ambulance services may have to respond to a mass shooting or injuries caused by rioting. You, the average citizen may very well be on your own, on your own in the dark in some cases for a very long time, in the winter of our discontent.
The weather will have an influence on you, and it must be dealt with along with the other threats looming. It may be time that you grocery shop for two weeks instead of stopping every night or every other night to grab something quick. This way you stand a good chance of having a week to a 10-day supply of food on hand for emergencies.
We generally recommend several months, and in some cases, several years’ worth of food, but the prepping landscape is changing, and finances are the biggest factor. For most Americans, it is not realistic to have a 6-month supply of food on hand, and with that being the case, you will have to adjust your shopping habits and meal preparation habits, so you do have some food reserves on hand at all times. It may not be much but it may be enough to get past many local disasters. If you can afford to have a 6-month supply on hand do so, but for many this is financially out of reach.
The problem with stockpiling food, however, is that it will need to be prepared and many today simply do not have the time or skills to properly prepare a meal, but during a crisis is not the time to try and learn to cook.
There is more to being prepared than having a spare bedroom filled with dehydrated foods, lanterns, batteries, tents, and sleeping bags. You also need skills, such as cooking, fire starting, how to stay warm outside when the wind chill factor is well below zero and how to prepare fresh foods like wild game or fish, for example, without making the family sick.
We have written dozens of articles about the skills needed, and it is well worth your time to review a few. This article is more about reminding you that regardless of what may be going on in the world, the biggest threat to you is usually local. Snow storms, local power outages, broken water mains, which means no clean water unless you boil it, or you lose a few days of work because of a snowstorm, or you experience icy road conditions and end up in the ditch or down a ravine. Local threats and national and world threats all have to be dealt with, but you start with the most likely at the time.
The Simplest Of Things Matter The Most
Keep your vehicle fueled up can save your life. If you run off into the ditch almost on empty, you can’t stay warm. You need a winter survival kit as well. Warm clothing and shoes for walking in snow and wet conditions, blankets and food and water protected from freezing. You don’t have to run out and buy emergency blankets, use one or two from the house and toss a spare jacket in the back and those old snow boots you never wear around the house. The simple things matter.
Buy a box of protein bars , and a case of water. For less than 12 bucks, you have water and food for a few days. Toss in some matches, a flashlight, gloves, a small shovel and hat and you are almost there without breaking the bank. You know what you need, it is just a matter of taking the time to do it, and if you look around the house you will find you may not have to run out and buy anything because you already have what you need.
You, of course, have to focus on the big picture as well, the threats from abroad, nuclear war, armed invasions and a major grid collapse but it is likely you will meet a snowstorm or icy roads before the other threats manifest themselves. Of course, we never know for sure, but life is always about the most likely and what is the most realist way of living your life day-to-day.

17991,Limbaugh: Democratic Party ’Has Become the Largest Hate Group in This Country’ - Breitbart,"Tuesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh pointed out the mood of the Democratic Party, which he described as resentful and unhappy, and noted liberal comedians are “consumed by hatred. ”  This combination of negative emotions according to Limbaugh has made the Democratic Party “the largest hate group” in the country. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): Let me tell you something, folks. There is an inescapable observation and conclusion, and it is this. You have to look very hard  —   and you have to spend a long time looking  —   to find a genuinely happy or content   political person. Whether they’re an activist or not. If they’re engaged in any way, shape, manner, or form of politics, they’re not happy, no matter what. When they elected Obama, they got angrier. They got more enraged. After every success they have, nothing is ever enough. No amount much success ever makes them happy. Every success they have seems to tell them how little they’ve actually done and how much more there is and how deeply resentful of that they are. The bottom line is: You just don’t encounter happy, laughing liberals. Even their comedians are consumed by hatred. The Democrat Party’s become the largest hate group in this country. Even their comedians are angry and enraged, and that suffices as comedy. I think it’s one of the reasons why   comics have become primary sources of news for other   liberals. So there’s never any happiness, there never is any contentment. You don’t see any real laughter. You just see a constant level of rage  —   and I’m telling you, it isn’t healthy. Talk about sustainable? That cannot be sustained. A healthy mind and heart cannot be sustained by the degree of rage and hatred that we see in the American left today. You have to ask: Why don’t their successes make them happy? Look at what they’ve done in the area of marriage. They’ve totally upended it. They have succeeded in not just redefining a word that has stood for however many number of years  —   tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of years  —   that humans have been plodding and walking the earth. And even after they succeed with this, they get angry. They don’t ever seem satisfied. It’s the most amazing thing. And we’re all paying the price for it, this constant rage, this constant anger. They lose elections, and it is taken as one of the most outrageous things that could happen. (  DailyRushbo) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
17992,"With Koch Brothers Academy, Conservatives Settle In for Long War - The New York Times","ARLINGTON, Va.  —   The rise of Donald J. Trump, with his hostility toward free trade and vow to protect entitlements, is a sharp rebuke to the   principles long championed by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. But if the Koch brothers have lost the battle for conservative values in 2016, they are also quietly preparing for a long war. Their secret weapon is the Grassroots Leadership Academy: a training program dreamed up by the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, the political education arm of the Koch network, and intended to groom the next generation of conservative activists to shape the future of the Republican Party. Taking inspiration from icons of the left like Saul Alinsky, the   Frankfurt School, and even President Obama’s Organizing for Action, the academy offers classes like “Messaging to the Middle” (about reaching not just the conservative base but also persuadable voters) community organizing and how to wage a successful public protest, complete with costumes. The goal is not just to equip activists to compete with the left, but also to help rebuild the conservative movement in the wake of a Trump loss  —   or even a Trump victory. The Kochs will be key figures in any discussion about what direction the party takes after 2016, and they are determined to steer it toward their   vision. A band of trained volunteers focused on elections farther down the ballot could help raise their standing for 2018 and beyond. The network hopes that these activists will learn how to make a compelling, personal pitch to win over new converts to the cause, and that if volunteers are grounded in a strong philosophical understanding of   principles, they will be better prepared not only to explain their beliefs but also to ward off candidates, like Mr. Trump, who do not espouse their vision. “We want a cultural shift of people being able to know what they want and how to talk to the people in their communities, so that in the future, when there are political leaders that want to demagogue   issues, they do hit resistance,” said Levi Russell, the director of public affairs for Americans for Prosperity. After Americans for Prosperity spent more than $100 million during the 2012 election, yet failed to take back the White House or the Senate, the Koch network undertook a major   and overhaul. It is spending $3 million on the training initiative, which officially began in February 2015, and plans to expand it next year. The effort has taken on newfound urgency because Mr. Trump has shown that Republican voters will support a candidate who denounces trade agreements and rejects the   doctrine the Kochs have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to push. “This Republican nomination battle for president has demonstrated that no issue is ever fully won,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. “You must keep competing and explaining. For example, why free trade is better, why entitlement reform is necessary. ” The group has held training sessions in roughly three dozen states, and about 10, 000 people have attended an academy program. The academy offers three tiers: two   courses and, for those who have completed the first two levels, a final, intensive   training at Americans for Prosperity’s headquarters here, with hotel and travel expenses underwritten by the group. The first level introduces trainees to the principles of economic freedom and prepares them, for example, to lobby their representatives about a particular issue. The second level of training seeks to turn the attendees into community activists, the sorts of people who could recruit and mobilize others. The curriculum is likely to intensify criticism of the Kochs, whose fortune is based largely on oil and petroleum, from liberals who view the brothers’ political work as stemming largely from their financial interests. One of the sessions, called the “Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” teaches attendees to argue that “a turn away from fossil fuel use would ultimately be disastrous to humanity  —   especially the poorest of the poor. ” Slade O’Brien, vice president of the Grassroots Leadership Academy, said he had learned two big lessons from studying Democratic tactics. “It was incredibly   it was truly at the   level,” he said. “And they didn’t have to agree on everything to agree to work on something  —   that incremental victories matter, and they would work on those rather than swing for the fences and try to hit a home run. ” In Bethlehem, Pa. the second session of the   training program was held in a conference room over the beer and liquor section of a Wegmans grocery. Fifteen people munched on turkey wraps and miniature cannoli as they listened to Mary Conway, a Republican organizer who worked for Senator John McCain’s and Sarah Palin’s 2008 campaign, run briskly through a series of slides with labels like “The Left Is Highly Organized” and quotations from Mr. Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals. ” With the   intonation of a motivational speaker, Ms. Conway urged her students to focus on what makes a successful movement. “Successful or Unsuccessful,” read slides listing various movements, one of which was the civil rights fight of the 1950s and 1960s. “One thing the civil rights movement was very good at was capturing the new media,” Ms. Conway said. Several attendees were activists from local Tea Party groups. One was a political blogger. They offered their views on successful political movements  —   and, during a break, on the presidential race. It was a reminder that the network cannot always control who shows up. Charlie Knight, 70, a   electrician who supports Mr. Trump, said he had come to the training because he wanted to be around “  people. ” “There’s only one person that I could possibly support, because the other one’s nothing but a liar,” Mr. Knight said. Mr. O’Brien, the Grassroots vice president, said he hoped the program would pay dividends over the long term. “You can’t just show up at somebody’s door six weeks before an election and build a relationship with them,” he said. He added that Mr. Obama’s   wing was “magnificent at building up their volunteers and relationships over a period of time, and you have to give them credit. ” The leadership academy program still has some work to do. Though the Kochs have tried to make the conservative base more diverse, in a recent training session near Washington, the class of roughly two dozen was mostly older and white. While some of the budding activists seemed equipped to return home and wage a successful   campaign, others seemed generally befuddled and uncomfortable with even the basics of social media, like Twitter and digital video. At one point, a man briefly dozed off during a session on the legislative process. “The big question going forward is what are the programs that these people get plugged into once they’re ready to get involved in politics,” said Sasha Issenberg, the author of “Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,” a book the program’s leaders have consulted. “What the left has been very good about doing is taking enthusiastic activists, giving them training, but then plugging them into systems where their energy is well directed. ” Near the end of a Friday session in Arlington, the trainees divided into several teams. Each team had a designated “builder” whose goal was to recreate a small widget out of building blocks using only descriptions from teammates, relayed from one person to the next in what was, basically, a giant game of telephone. Some teams did better than others, but the description became increasingly garbled as it passed from person to person. The real point of the exercise, a moderator explained, was that “you constantly have to be working on communication skills if you want to be a   leader. ” But when he asked the group what the lesson was, someone shouted out a message perhaps even more aligned with the project’s stated aim: “Cut out the bureaucracy!” the attendee said, to laughter. “Yeah, cut out the middle man and just say it right to the builder,” the moderator conceded.",0
17993,"California Today: Airbnb, a Hometown Success (and Villain) - The New York Times","Good morning. This is the last day of our test of California Today, a daily update for our California readers. Thanks to everyone who told us what they want to see. We received more than 2, 500 emails. We’d still like to hear from you: CAtoday@nytimes. com All over California, communities are grappling with a shortage of affordable housing. Is Airbnb part of the problem? The company is increasingly at odds with local governments in the state. Los Angeles is considering major restrictions on   home rentals, and wants Airbnb to help police hosts who skirt the rules. Airbnb has resisted, accusing officials of overreaching. The city of Sacramento approved regulations in January. Anaheim just banned   rentals entirely. Residents had complained that Disneyland visitors had overrun their neighborhoods. Now, Airbnb is in a legal battle with its hometown, San Francisco, which has brought up wrenching questions about inequality, neighborhood change and the free market. Founded inside a San Francisco apartment, Airbnb is a major local success story. There are more Airbnb listings per capita in San Francisco than in any other United States city. The company has been celebrated there as a trailblazer in the   sharing economy. But Airbnb has also become a focal point for anger at the tech industry  —   even more so than the Google buses that bring workers to jobs in Silicon Valley.   rentals in San Francisco are being blamed, at least in part, for rising rents that are driving out longtime residents. Last year, Airbnb spent more than $8 million to defeat a ballot measure that would have limited rentals to no more than 75 nights a year. Last month, San Francisco supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance that would fine Airbnb $1, 000 per day for each host listed on its website who is not registered with the city. In suing to stop the law, Airbnb has emphasized its San Francisco roots. “This legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb,” the company said. We spoke to our San   reporter who has been covering Airbnb, Katie Benner, about why the company is such a flash point. “It’s this very visible sign of the problem,” she said. “Not just of gentrification, but of how wide the disparity is between people who have opportunities and people who don’t. ” • Gov.

[KQED] When questioned by reporters about the state budget, which he signed this week, Governor Brown responded with a parable, Aesop’s “The Ant and the Grasshopper. ” Aesop, an ancient Greek fabulist, “has some credibility,” Mr. Brown said. That was one of the governor’s less obscure literary references. Since returning to Sacramento in 2011 for a second stint as governor, he has quoted poets, religious scholars and biologists. He invoked the book of Genesis, Oliver Wendell Holmes, a king of Spain and “The Little Engine That Could” all in the same 2013 speech. “Over the mountain the little engine went  —   we are going to get over that mountain,” he said, making an analogy to California’s   rail plan after quoting the children’s book.

17994,"Prince Harry Denounces Media Coverage of His Girlfriend, Meghan Markle - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Prince Harry on Tuesday attacked the “racial undertones” of British news coverage and social media harassment of his new girlfriend, the American actress Meghan Markle. In an unusual statement, the prince, the    grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, said that a line had been crossed in the reporting of his relationship with Ms. Markle, 35, whose mother is black and whose father is white. “Some of this has been very public,” read the statement, issued in the name of the prince’s spokesman, Jason Knauf. “The smear on the front page of a national newspaper the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. ” The role and behavior of the news media are a particularly sensitive topic for Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William. Their mother, Diana, died in Paris in a 1997 car crash when pursued by paparazzi. Both princes, who were then 12 and 15, have said that their mother’s death made them wary of the news media, though the royal family has generally been skillful in getting favorable coverage and suppressing scandal. But internet competition and social media activity have accelerated and coarsened coverage of the prince’s relationship with a divorced, biracial woman who was already in the public eye as an actress. Since articles surfaced about Ms. Markle’s dating Prince Harry, the British tabloids have expressed surprise that a “brunette” would be his type and accused her of not being British enough for him. The Daily Mail ran an article headlined, “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton:   home of her mother revealed  —   so will he be dropping by for tea?” The article then wove together various racial stereotypes, lamenting Ms. Markle’s mother’s “ ” Los Angeles neighborhood, Crenshaw, and its “tatty   homes,” and listing crime statistics for the area. Newspapers have been digging up suggestive photographs of Ms. Markle and examining her past relationships, and some comments on their websites and on social media have been explicit and racist. The prince’s statement, which confirmed his   relationship with Ms. Markle, expressed fears for her safety and privacy. It noted that his office had regularly fought to keep defamatory articles out of the newspapers  —   which he said had offered large bribes to her  . The statement also condemned the way that the news media has invaded Ms. Markle’s privacy and harassed her mother. In one instance, a palace official said a photographer had chased an assistant to Ms. Markle through the garage of her home in Toronto. The photographer had to be physically removed and the police called, the official said. One article in the tabloid The Sun was about Ms. Markle’s appearing on Pornhub, an adult website, even though the “steamy scenes,” as the newspaper called them, were not pornography but taken from a television series she acts in, “Suits. ” The Sun also ran a headline above an interview with Ms. Markle’s estranged sister, saying, “Don’t fall for my little sis, Harry, she’d be the next Princess Pushy,” a reference to the unkind nickname for Princess Michael of Kent. One comment piece in last weekend’s Mail on Sunday, by Rachel Johnson, said of Ms. Markle: “Genetically, she is blessed. If there is issue from her alleged union with Prince Harry, the Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA. ” Ms. Markle described herself as biracial in an August 2015 interview with Elle magazine, saying, “My dad is Caucasian and my mom is  . I’m half black and half white. ” The essay also discussed some of the racism she has experienced as a result. Afua Hirsch, writing in The Guardian, said: “It’s a subtle point, easily missed. Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s apparent new love, is a ‘glamorous brunette,’ ‘a departure from Prince Harry’s usual type’ and ‘not in the society blonde style of previous girlfriends,’ according to The Daily Mail. I think what they are trying to say is that Markle, actor, global development ambassador and lifestyle blogger, is black. ” Even more scandalous to the tabloids, wrote Ms. Hirsch, is that Ms. Markle is older and divorced and played somewhat “raunchy scenes” in “Suits” and that “her mother is visibly black, with dreadlocks. ” Ms. Markle, who graduated from Northwestern University in 2003, married in 2011 and divorced two years later, a fact that has also been the source of attention from the news media. Prince Harry has criticized the news media before, but never in such an angry and formal fashion. He has gotten into public trouble in the past, with leaked photographs of parties in Las Vegas or wearing a Nazi costume. “Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her,” the statement said. “It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. ” “He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game,’” the statement continued. “He strongly disagrees. This is not a game  —   it is her life and his. ” Ms. Markle is best known for her role as Rachel Zane on the television legal drama “Suits,” and she played an F. B. I. agent in the   series “Fringe. ” She has also been involved in charitable work with nongovernmental organizations. Ms. Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada this year, traveling to Rwanda for its clean water campaign, and she has worked for gender equality and women’s empowerment.",0
17995,"Young Blacks Voice Skepticism on Hillary Clinton, Worrying Democrats - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   When a handful of liberal advocacy organizations convened a series of focus groups with young black voters last month, the assessments of Donald J. Trump were predictably unsparing. But when the participants were asked about Hillary Clinton, their appraisals were just as blunt and nearly as biting. “What am I supposed to do if I don’t like him and I don’t trust her?” a millennial black woman in Ohio asked. “Choose between being stabbed and being shot? No way!” “She was part of the whole problem that started sending blacks to jail,” a young black man, also from Ohio, observed about Mrs. Clinton. “He’s a racist, and she is a liar, so really what’s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?” another young black woman from Ohio said. Young   like all voters their age, are typically far harder to drive to the polls than   and older Americans. Yet with just over two months until Election Day, many Democrats are expressing alarm at the lack of enthusiasm, and in some cases outright resistance, some black millennials feel toward Mrs. Clinton. Their skepticism is rooted in a deep discomfort with the political establishment that they believe the    former first lady and secretary of state represents. They share a lingering mistrust of Mrs. Clinton and her husband over criminal justice issues. They are demanding more from politicians as part of a new, confrontational wave of black activism that has arisen in response to police killings of unarmed  . “We’re in the midst of a movement with a real sense of urgency,” explained Brittany Packnett, 31, a St.   leader in the push for police accountability. Mrs. Clinton is not yet connecting, she said, “because the conversation that younger black voters are having is no longer one about settling on a candidate who is better than the alternative. ” The question of just how many young   will show up to vote carries profound implications for this election. Mrs. Clinton is sure to dominate Mr. Trump among black voters, but her overwhelming margin could ultimately matter less than the total number of blacks who show up to vote. To replicate President Obama’s success in crucial states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, she cannot afford to let the percentage of the electorate that is black slip far below what it was in 2012. And while a modest   of black votes may not imperil Mrs. Clinton’s prospects, given Mr. Trump’s unpopularity among upscale white voters, it could undermine Democrats’ effort to capture control of the Senate and win other   elections. Mrs. Clinton’s difficulties with young   were laid bare in four focus groups conducted in Cleveland and Jacksonville, Fla. for a handful of progressive organizations spending millions on the election: the service employees union, a joint “super PAC” between organized labor and the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, and a progressive group called Project New America. The results were outlined in a   presentation by Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster, and shared with The New York Times by another party strategist who wanted to draw attention to Mrs. Clinton’s difficulties in hopes that the campaign would move more aggressively to address the matter. Word of the report has spread in the constellation of liberal operatives and advocacy groups in recent weeks, concerning officials who saw diminished black turnout hurt Democratic candidates in the last two midterm elections. Adding to the worries is a separate poll of   that Mr. Belcher conducted earlier in the summer indicating that Mrs. Clinton is lagging well behind Mr. Obama’s performance among young blacks in a handful of crucial states. In Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, 70 percent of   under 35 said they were backing Mrs. Clinton, 8 percent indicated support for Mr. Trump and 18 percent said they were backing another candidate or did not know whom they would support. In 2012, Mr. Obama won 92 percent of black voters under 45 nationally, according to exit polling. Over 25 percent of   are between 18 and 34, and 44 percent are older than 35, according to 2013 census data. “There is no Democratic majority without these voters,” Mr. Belcher said. “The danger is that if you don’t get these voters out, you’ve got the 2004 John Kerry electorate again. ” In Ohio, for example, blacks were 10 percent of the electorate in the 2004 presidential race. But when Mr. Obama ran for   in 2012, that number jumped to 15 percent. What frustrates many blacks under 40 is Mrs. Clinton’s overriding focus on Mr. Trump. “We already know what the deal is with Trump,” said Nathan Baskerville, a    North Carolina state representative. “Tell us what your plan is to make our life better. ” Such talk can be frustrating to Mrs. Clinton’s aides, who point out that her first speech of the campaign was on criminal justice and that she has laid out a series of proposals on the topic. “It is on us to make sure that that’s known,” said Addisu Demissie, Mrs. Clinton’s voter outreach and mobilization director, adding of young black activists, “We share their goals, we share their values and we want to make sure that’s reflected through our campaign. ” The focus groups and interviews with young black activists suggest many of them are not aware of Mrs. Clinton’s plans regarding police conduct, mass incarceration and structural racism broadly. Christopher Prudhome, 31, recounted a recurring conversation he has with other   as he travels around the country as the head of a nonpartisan group dedicated to registering young voters: They do not like either candidate. “Young people feel discouraged and apprehensive about the political process as is, and then they look at the two options in front of us,” said Mr. Prudhome, adding of Mrs. Clinton: “Nobody has seen an agenda for   millennials. I don’t think they believe she cares about them. ” Part of Mrs. Clinton’s problem, said Symone Sanders, a former top aide to Senator Bernie Sanders’s campaign, is that the candidate is overly cautious and is conducting an outdated style of black outreach. Ms. Sanders has begun taking matters into her own hands. She said she was working with other young activists to recruit black celebrities for a millennial mobilization tour through Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. “Black churches and an H. B. C. U. tour is just not going to cut it in 2016,” said Ms. Sanders, referring to historically black colleges and universities. “The Clinton campaign has to be willing to get out of what’s comfortable and get on the streets. ” Mr. Demissie said the Clinton campaign’s efforts were more expansive, pointing to voter registration efforts already underway in barbershops and salons as well as sneaker and video game stores. Mrs. Clinton has met with mothers of those who lost children at the hands of the police and has used the signature refrain that “black lives matter” in public remarks. But she and her husband also come from an earlier political tradition rooted in the Deep South, where black voters are primarily reached through the church and the threat of white conservative backlash is never far from mind. Today’s young   voters are less likely to be found in black churches and more likely to be found in schools, loosely organized activist groups and online, said Ms. Packnett, the St. Louis activist. And the leaders are more diverse. “It’s not just heterosexual men,” she noted. Not only are younger black activists reached in different ways, they also have far higher expectations on leaders, dismissing boilerplate pleas for racial equality and justice as insufficient. “Gone is the day of patience,” said Tony J. Payton Jr. 35, a former Pennsylvania state representative. “No longer should we accept systemic racism. ” Doubts about how aggressively Mrs. Clinton will move to combat racism are at the heart of black suspicion toward her. Some   said her 1996 reference to some young criminals as “” and the legislation that President Bill Clinton signed imposing stiff sentences on nonviolent offenders, have made today’s activists skeptical about her true intentions. “That stuff comes up unprompted,” Mr. Belcher said. Mr. Trump has turned to remarkably blunt language about blacks in recent weeks  —   portraying their communities as dystopian hellscapes and asking them, in courting their support, “What do you have to lose?” Some   allies of Mrs. Clinton believe he is serving as her most effective     lever. “He is literally saying something every day that is disrespectful to the black community,” said Michael Blake, a New York State assemblyman from the Bronx who worked on Mr. Obama’s campaigns and is close to many Clinton aides. Yet when   voters in the focus groups were shown campaign fliers and asked to rate them, there was no mistaking what was most effective. A pamphlet with a picture of Mr. Trump that read, “We have to beat the racists,” fell flat with young black audiences. Scoring much higher were a stark black and white handout showing the names of those killed at the hands of the police and another with images of mothers of the victims that said, “Their Children Can’t Vote, Will You?”",0
17996,US Election Calls Out Global Warming Hoax,"US Election Calls Out Global Warming Hoax November 09, 2016 US Election Calls Out Global Warming Hoax 
Donald Trump's election as U.S. president triggered fears that his view that global warming is a hoax might lead other nations to scale back ambitions under a landmark climate change deal, while renewable energy stocks fell on world markets. 
Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton cast a dark cloud over delegates attending a 200-nation meeting in Marrakesh being held from Nov. 7-18 to celebrate the start of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming last Friday. 
LISTEN MORE: RUSSIAN SCIENTIST SAYS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING AN ICE AGE RIGHT NOW 
Trump has threatened to tear up the Paris accord for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, worked out in two decades of tortuous negotiations by countries as diverse as China, Pacific islands and OPEC oil producers. 
Some delegates expressed concern that Trump, who in the past has dismissed climate change as a hoax, could cause other nations to reconsider their position on global warming. Trump has also said climate change was an invention by China and wants instead to promote jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry. 
""We will have a lot more hurdles,"" said Ian Fry, head of the delegation of Tuvalu, a Pacific island state which fears rising sea levels, adding Trump's victory could have a ""domino effect on other nations"". 
The Paris Agreement allows all nations to set national targets to slow climate change and some could scale those back. The Marrakesh talks are also meant to start writing a ""rule book"" to oversee the pact that might be less stringent without the United States. There are no sanctions for non-compliance. 
But many nations vowed to push ahead despite Trump with the sweeping plan to phase out net global greenhouse gas emissions between 2050 and 2100 by shifting from coal and oil to cleaner energies such as wind or solar power. 
""No change,"" Japan's delegation chief Shigeru Ushio told Reuters of Japan's policies. He noted that the agreement says it will formally take four years for any country to pull out of the agreement - the length of Trump's presidential term. 
On markets, Trump's victory drove down renewable energy stocks. Shares in Vestas <VWS.CO>, the world's biggest wind turbine maker, were down 6.2 percent in mid-morning, while German peer Nordex <NDXG.DE> traded 6.6 percent lower. 
""DARK, DARK DAY"" 
Many delegates expressed hopes Trump as president would accept mainstream scientific findings. A U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent likely that man-made emissions are the main cause of rising temperatures since 1950. 
Average global temperatures this year are set to be the hottest in records dating back to the 19th century, beating 2015. ""Even Donald Trump cannot do anything about the laws of physics,"" Laurence Tubiana, France's climate ambassador, said. 
She told Reuters she was betting ""all countries will stick to the Paris Agreement"" as rising temperatures were damaging the global economy with more heatwaves, floods and droughts. 
Campaigners for more action on climate change were shocked. The United States is the number two greenhouse gas emitter behind China. 
""This is a dark, dark day,"" said Jesse Bragg, of Corporate Accountability International. ""My heart is absolutely broken,"" said Becky Chung of SustainUS. 
Among statements about climate change, Trump asked in a January 2014 Tweet amid a cold snap: ""Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  ",0

17998,"Andy Murray, No. 1 and Newly Knighted, Still Has Room for More - The New York Times","MELBOURNE, Australia  —   “So Ivan, are you calling Andy ‘Sir’?” Ivan Lendl paused and then laughed, which would surely seem strange to those who know him only as Andy Murray’s   coach in the front row of the players’ box. “Definitely not,” Lendl said, chuckling some more before heading off down the crowded main hallway inside Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open. Clearly, not much has changed in the Murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the No. 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016. He is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers. Still Andy  —   not Sir Andy  —   to his peers and mentor in chief, Lendl. Still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft. Asked on Monday by the   interviewer John Fitzgerald how Murray’s wife, Kim, was handling the transition to Lady Kim, Murray said, “No more swearing during my matches, for anyone who saw that a few years ago. ” He was referring to Kim’s courtside language during his semifinal victory over Tomas Berdych at the 2015 Australian Open. Her tirade did not go unnoticed, and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read, “Parental advisory explicit content. ” Presumably, Lady Kim won’t be wearing that sort of thing in the players’ box from here on, either (or at least she wasn’t on Monday). “I haven’t found it distracting really,” Murray said of the knighthood. “I mean, I found out about it four or five weeks ago. Maybe if it happened a day or so, two days before the tournament. But I’ve had enough time to get my head around it. ” Just as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of No. 1, however long it lasts. I asked him on Monday, after his stuttering     (5)     victory over Illya Marchenko, if there had been any downside to No. 1, thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdens. “No,” he said. “It’s been great. I think because it’s taken me so long to get there, obviously I want to try to stay there. But also I feel like I’m mature enough now to handle it. Maybe if it happens when you’re very young, you might feel extra pressures. The responsibilities might feel a bit much, but I think because I’m much older and more mature, it’s been good. ” The conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top. “I hope not,” Murray said. But for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down, that is hardly true in Australia. He has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five. No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title. Others have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the   era, but won the title twice, too. Murray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals. “Look, it’s still a remarkable record, five Slam finals in Australia, and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzle,” said Roger Rasheed, the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without success. But Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne. Murray is   here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon. “Andy’s been so close,” Rasheed said. “What more does he have to do? Well, it’s not a matter of big changes. It’s just been a matter of points and the moments. ” It’s a matter of the opposition, too. The first of Murray’s Australian Open defeats in the final came against Roger Federer in 2010. The last four came against Djokovic in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. “Andy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his prime,” Rasheed said. “It’s a handful of points changing the way the match falls. Andy’s showing he’s in his prime now. He just needs to get there and roll the dice again. ” Murray’s timing may still not be quite right. He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by Djokovic in a   final in Doha, Qatar, to start this season. Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovic’s eagerness to restore the pecking order. But it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even one. He broke down in tears after losing to Federer in 2010. He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment. And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament. “Honestly, they’re totally positive,” said Murray, who plays    Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday. “I’ve had a lot of tough losses here, for sure. But I love it here. Played some great matches as well, but just haven’t managed to win the final. But, you know, I keep coming back to try. I’ll keep doing that until I’m done, but I still feel like I’ve got a few years left to try and do it. ” He is, by any measure, due for a change of fortune in Melbourne. And if you like your sports with foreshadowing, the only other top tennis player to receive a knighthood was Sir Norman Brookes, the Australian star of the early 20th century. Guess whose name has been given to the trophy awarded to the men’s champion at the Australian Open?",0
17999,Westchester County Reacts to Possible Indian Point Shutdown - The New York Times,"For years, antinuclear activists, concerned parents, local officials and others have worried about Indian Point, a   nuclear plant on the Hudson River in northern Westchester County that provides cheap energy and robust tax revenue, but also carries the risk of disaster. The news on Friday that the state had negotiated a deal that could shut down the plant within five years sent shock waves of jubilation, relief and anxiety through the suburbs north of New York City. On one side was an almost gleeful disbelief that what had seemed an insurmountable goal  —   ridding the county of nuclear power  —   would come to pass. Nada Khader, executive director of the Wespac Foundation, a nonprofit group in White Plains that advocates social justice, was told about the development by a reporter. “This is really amazing for Wespac, an organization whose many, many members have been working for decades to shut Indian Point,” she said. “All of us want to shift to safe energy. We absolutely welcome this news. ” But there were also misgivings about what the closing would mean for utility customers, Indian Point employees and the nearby schools that rely on the plant’s tax dollars. Officials in Westchester County said they were blindsided by the deal and were upset that they were not consulted. Robert P. Astorino, the county executive and a vocal supporter of Indian Point, which is in the village of Buchanan, said more than $4 million enters the county’s coffers every year from the plant, representing nearly 1 percent of the tax base. “No one from the governor’s office had the common courtesy to call the county affected by this,” Mr. Astorino, a Republican, said. “So we’re all trying to figure out what will happen in the future and the costs of this potential closure. There are enormous economic consequences to something like this. ” Perhaps no single entity will suffer the financial effects of the shutdown more than Hendrick Hudson schools, a district with 2, 400 students that draws from parts of a   towns and villages near the plant. The superintendent, Joseph E. Hochreiter, said taxes from the company that owns Indian Point, Entergy, made up   of the district’s $75. 8 million operating budget annually. “We’ve enjoyed some of the lowest property tax increases of any school district in Westchester County and that has made this a very appealing community to move to and stay in,” he said. “Entergy plays a major, major role in keeping taxes down. If they are not operating at the capacity that we’re accustomed to, we are going to have budget deficits. ” Converting Indian Point’s property to another use  —   whether residential or commercial  —   may not be possible, given the environmental history of the   site. Still, after years of   over the potential for a catastrophe, many residents said they would be happy to have a   county. Opponents of the plant had seized on the Sept. 11 terror attacks and, later, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan to galvanize support for shutting Indian Point. More recently, critics had focused on fighting a natural gas pipeline that was constructed on the plant’s land. Elected officials, residents and environmental activists have criticized the project, saying that a rupture could unleash a nuclear catastrophe. While Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has long called for the plant’s closing, few thought a decision to shut it down was imminent. Nancy Vann, a retired Wall Street lawyer who lives in Peekskill, has fought against Indian Point for years. She is president of Safe Energy Rights Group, which was formed in response to the natural gas pipeline. “I’m very, very happy about this,” she said, referring to news of the agreement. But like others, she was concerned about the plant’s spent fuel rods. Under the deal, they will be moved off site eventually. “Indian Point won’t be completely safe until the spent fuel rods are all put into hardened dry cask storage,” she said. “I just want people to realize that the fact that Indian Point is closing  —   and not immediately  —   doesn’t mean it will be safe right away. ” Michael B. Kaplowitz, chairman of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, listed other concerns  —   from the plant’s decommissioning costs and the fate of its 1, 000 employees, to the effects on the local area. While he is eager to see details of the deal, he said that on balance, shutting it made sense. “It’s a net societal gain because of the specter of terrorism,” he said. “The better the details are for the company, the worse it is for the rate payers and taxpayers. I’m hoping that given the leverage the state has that the tax payers and rate payers do better than the Entergy shareholders. ” “I can say,” he added, “that I’m encouraged that it looks like we are turning the page on a nuclear power plant that doesn’t belong 25 miles from New York City. ”",0
18000,AT&T-Time Warner Merger: Another Media Consolidation That Puts Profits Over Consumers,"Videos AT&T-Time Warner Merger: Another Media Consolidation That Puts Profits Over Consumers ‘The deals are driven by Wall Street’s insatiable desire for short-term growth at any cost,’ a media analyst at a consumer advocacy NGO wrote, warning about the risks of the deal. | November 2, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! 
MINNEAPOLIS — Media analysts warn that a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner is more likely to enhance corporate bottom lines and pad the pockets of Wall Street investors than benefit consumers. 
“Big mergers like this inevitably mean higher prices for real people, to pay down the money borrowed to finance these deals and compensate top executives,” said Matt Wood, policy director at Free Press, an NGO that protects net neutrality and online press freedom, in an Oct. 22 press release . 
The media first reported that AT&T was in “informal” talks to merge with Time Warner on Oct. 20 . By Oct. 24, AT&T announced that Time Warner had agreed to be bought out by the telecommunications giant for $85.4 billion. 
Currently, Time Warner represents one of a shrinking number of mass media conglomerates that increasingly control the vast majority of news available to Americans. AT&T is one of the world’s largest providers of mobile phone and landline services, and, as owner of DirecTV, a major player in the television marketplace as well. 
Corporate executives have promised that the merger could make more content available to consumers , offer new options for mobile viewing , and provide alternatives to traditional cable TV. Representatives of both companies have also tried to mollify concerns that the deal would violate antitrust laws, claiming it represents the “vertical integration” of two different markets , rather than a merger of competitors. 
Many media experts have expressed concern and skepticism about these claims, particularly in regard to the potential benefits to consumers. Wood suggested AT&T’s buyout of DirecTV, which was completed in July 2015 , should serve as a warning about the possible effects of this new, larger merger model. He warned: 
“The deals are driven by Wall Street’s insatiable desire for short-term growth at any cost. And just as AT&T’s recent purchase of DirecTV was quickly followed by price hikes, there’s every reason to expect this potential tie-up would cost internet users and TV viewers dearly too.” 
Kevin Kelleher , a reporter at Time magazine, weighed in on Oct. 24. He wrote that the deal “makes sense for media executives, less so for consumers,” as it’s unclear how bringing content creators and internet service providers together would actually benefit the end user. He continued: 
“For now, concerns over the deal seem to be outweighing the benefits, which could end up being negligible. For decades, the pipes that streamed digital content remained largely independent from the companies that provided the content. And no consumers complained.” 
Meanwhile, several senators have come out in opposition to the proposed merger, citing concerns about the ultimate implications for consumers, the role of Washington’s “revolving door” into the corporate world, and what this buyout could mean for the future of media consolidation. 
On Sunday, Al Franken , a former TV actor and senator representing Minnesota, told The New York Times’ media reporter Jim Rutenberg that the merger could increase prices and reduce the number of choices available to consumers. 
“When the company that controls the pipes, so to speak, owns this very, very large content provider, it can cause a whole bunch of different horribles for consumers,” Franken said. 
Elizabeth Warren , a senator from Massachusetts known for her consumer advocacy, objected to Christine Varney’s involvement in the deal. Varney, an antitrust lawyer who has been hired to oversee the AT&T and Time Warner merger, previously worked for the Obama administration investigating antitrust claims. On Monday, Warren told Fortune: 
“Americans have had it with regulators like Varney, who talk a good game about holding the bad guys accountable while counting down the days until they can collect a fat paycheck from the corporations they were supposed to regulate. The revolving door is out of control. If we want to hold corporate lawbreakers accountable, we can’t ask their friends to do it.” 
Bernie Sanders , the senator from Vermont and former 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, also objected to the deal in an open letter published Wednesday on Medium. In addition to echoing the concerns shared by others like Franken, he warned that the buyout could provoke future media mergers that would further consolidate an already limited market. 
“At a time when our telecommunications and media industries are already too concentrated, we should be focused on opening those markets to more competition, not less,” he wrote. 
In the case that the merger does go through, AT&T’s ties to the national security state may also give rise to serious privacy concerns. A day after the AT&T-Time Warner merger was officially announced, Kenneth Lipp, a reporter at The Daily Beast, revealed that AT&T is storing customer information and selling it for profit . That, of course, came more than three years after Edward Snowden leaked classified information which detailed the telecommunications giant’s close collaboration with the NSA to spy on millions of Americans. 
“Where you go, what you watch, text and share, with whom you speak, all your internet searches and preferences, all gathered and ‘vertically integrated,’ sold to police and perhaps, in the future, to any number of AT&T’s corporate customers,” Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman and her frequent collaborator, Denis Moynihan, wrote in an editorial published on Thursday . 
“We can’t know if Alexander Graham Bell envisioned this brave new digital world when he invented the telephone. But this is the future that is fast approaching, unless people rise up and stop this merger.” Be Sociable, Share!",0
18001,Mulvaney: Trump’s Willing to Sign a Government Spending Bill That Doesn’t Include Border Wall Money - Breitbart,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s primetime edition of “The Lead,” OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said that President Trump is willing to sign a government spending bill that doesn’t include money for a border wall, and “We just thought that it would be a good first step to get these things that everybody agrees on and take that idea of a government shutdown off the table. ”  Mulvaney was asked, “A source close to efforts to avoid a government shutdown tells CNN that the Republican proposal in the House will not include funding for President Trump’s border wall with Mexico. Is President Trump willing to sign a government spending bill that does not include that money?” He answered, “Yeah. Because I think the bill  —   at least the offer that we received from the Democrats  —   the last couple days  —   included a good bit of money for border security. The Democrats said they’d go to the mat and shut the government down over the border wall, the bricks and mortar. But there’s a lot of things we agree on, both parties do, in securing the border. And it allows the president to follow through on his promise to make that border more secure, stop people coming over, stop drugs from coming over. So, there’s things we can do, by way of maintenance and technology, gates, bridges, roads, that kind of stuff, that make a real difference in that southern border security. ” Mulvaney added, “We’re not backing down. Keep in mind, this is just  —   this bill is just for the last five months of this year.   …     The discussion for what to do in fiscal year ’18, which starts October 1st, that discussion actually starts as soon as this bill is signed. So, we’re going to continue these conversations. We just thought that it would be a good first step to get these things that everybody agrees on and take that idea of a government shutdown off the table. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
18002,Naomie Harris: A Chameleon on Screen and Off - The New York Times,"The British actress Naomie Harris, 40, might have splashed on the scene as the Bond girl Moneypenny, but these days she is banking on riskier roles. Her turn as a crack addict in the lauded “Moonlight” earned her supporting actress nods for the Critics’ Choice Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes, on Sunday. So, too, her red carpet style will keep you guessing. Friend to cutouts, splashy prints, allover sequins, tuxedos and plunging necklines, Ms. Harris seems determined to avoid being typecast. And the fashion establishment appears to love her chameleonic quality. She sat front row at Christian Dior and Michael Kors, and she attended the Met Gala with Burberry. Of course, Ms. Harris doesn’t accomplish her sartorial variety on her own. She has been working with Nola Singer, also a close friend, for the last five years. “She loves to experiment,” Ms. Singer said of their choices. “It’s not so serious. If I tell her someone is a new designer, she gets excited. She gets that this is a kind of freedom. That’s beautiful about her. ” Ms. Singer, who is based in Los Angeles, styled many of Ms. Harris’s looks over the past year, but the actress also worked with Micaela Erlanger, Lupita Nyong’o’s   for her “Collateral Beauty” press tour. With Ms. Singer, Ms. Harris has favored simple fitted silhouettes but often lets color do the talking. Witness a sequined goldenrod Ralph Lauren halterneck dress worn to the Hollywood Foreign Press   cocktail party in November. “Every actress was at that event, and she really stood out, not because she was trying but because of that color, and because it flattered her figure  —   her arms!  —   without showing too much skin,” Ms. Singer said. No   triceps dips were needed for the visual statement made by a Gucci silver metallic tuxedo at the Hollywood Film Awards the same month. Ms. Singer said the outfit, with its sharp tailoring and lion embroidered on the back, was a nod to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “It was about women being empowered,” she said. Though Ms. Harris knows her way around a pantsuit (see also a white Emanuel Ungaro option at Variety’s Women of Power Luncheon, and a white   Dolce  Gabbana number worn to the TimesTalks event for “Moonlight”) occasionally she likes to go retro. In the navy Carolina Herrera ball gown she wore (with Christian Louboutin flats) to the Governors Awards in November, she was having an Old Hollywood meets modern practicalities moment. Less successful are her quirky moments. An orange Gucci minidress with a frilly black neckline that she wore at the British Independent Film Awards and a brown print Rodarte with    white bust at the “Collateral Beauty” London premiere read   on her lithe frame. Ms. Erlanger’s choice for the “Collateral Beauty” New York premiere was more on point: a neon floral Rosie Assoulin dress that ended above the ankle with Dick   pumps. Sure it was December, but what’s a little   chill when an   campaign is at stake? More unexpected picks with Ms. Erlanger included an offbeat (perhaps dated?) Stella McCartney strapless black bodice with sheer skirt design for the Critics’ Choice Awards last month, and a winning gold sequined tunic and pants by Monse at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November. And if her predictability is in her unpredictability, Ms. Harris is throwing another wrench in for awards season. She is going back to Ms. Singer but adding the New York stylist Laura Jones, known for her work with Alicia Keys, to her team. It will be Ms. Harris’s first time working with Ms. Jones.",0
18003,Rutgers Professor Launches Effort to Oppose President Donald Trump’s ’Election Integrity’ Commission,"President Donald Trump’s announcement that he is launching a commission to investigate “election integrity” was only hours old before a politics professor at Rutgers University began organizing educators to “resist” the effort. [On Thursday, the White House announced that the president would sign an executive order creating the commission and charging it with reviewing the 2016 election to determine if there was any widespread vote fraud or vote suppression. The commission is to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the White House said.  “The Commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people’s confidence in the integrity of Federal elections,” a White House official reportedly told the Daily Caller. “This will include reviewing laws and activities that lead to improper registrations, improper voting, fraudulent registrations, fraudulent voting, and voting suppression. ” The commission would serve to fulfill another one of Trump’s campaign promises to root out voter fraud. Just after his election, for instance, Trump said he would launch a “major investigation” into illegal voting. I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and  …    .  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017,  even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017,  But the news of the new commission had barely been reported when a Rutgers political science professor began organizing her “resistance” to the effort to investigate voter fraud. Lorraine Carol Minnite, a professor of political science, as well as an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers   jumped to an educators listserve to enlist the participation of professors, teachers, and educrats across the country to oppose Trump’s commission. The message, also circulated by Rick Hasen, a leader in urging academics to oppose any election integrity projects, called on the education community to “resist participation” in the commission. If the President does indeed create a commission to study voter fraud and voter suppression in the American election system to be headed by the Vice Preisdent [sic] and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, I’m calling on scholars of election administration to resist participation of any kind in such an effort. We should expect a   Commission to find “evidence” of rampant voter fraud across the U. S. and to recommend proposals to amend the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act to require    to register and a national voter ID requirement, among other changes that will be damaging to voting rights and therefore, damaging to democracy. Not only did the Rutgers prof urge educators to turn their back on Trump’s commission, but she went on to propose they create their own working group to present alternate facts to Trump’s effort. I am proposing a Commission of scholars and voting rights advocates to gather information to inform the public. Such a commission (or a working group of some kind) does not need the participation of partisan luminaries or politicians for credibility. With the assault on democracy underway, the most important divide is not between Democrats and Republicans, it is between lies and the truth, and democracy and authoritarianism. Please email me if you would like to be involved in organizing a non (not  ) partisan commission on voter fraud and voter suppression to offer evidence, facts and analysis that the public will need to sort through what we can anticipate will come out of a   Commission. Minnite did not outline how this group might be “nonpartisan” when so few conservatives or even Republicans work in the field of education. Responding to Professor Minnite’s proposition, a spokesperson for the Public Interest Legal Foundation said, “The ink isn’t even on the paper yet and the #Resistance movement is already having fits. Why? Because the organized left is losing territory it, for generations, has lorded over with an almost perfect monopoly. Tinkering with election rules is a final safe harbor for a partisan entity that has lost on ideas and finds itself in the political wilderness. This is how the left acts when you play in their sandbox. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com",0
18004,EU Red Scare: Brussels Passes New Resolution to ‘Counter Russian Media Propaganda’,"
21st Century Wire says… 
If there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the EU’s super bureaucratic class, those doubts can finally be put to rest this week. It seems that Europe’s technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of ‘Euro Red Scare’ brainwashing. 
The new EU Resolution compares Russian media organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS (see full report below). The report also claims that Russian “ social media and internet trolls ” are somehow “ challenging democratic values .” The new anti-Russia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the ‘anti-Russia’ programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this ‘grave threat to democracy.’ A touch oxymoronic, isn’t it? 
EU Parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. Claiming that Europe is currently ‘at war with Russia’ is one thing, but the hysterical notion that “Russian propaganda” is somehow damaging the minds of Europeans is a whole new level of crazy. 
No wonder millions of Britons voted to leave the EU this past summer. 
The cold reality is that most of the ‘dangerous views and information’ aired on RT are by presenters, contributors and pundits — westerners , not Russians. The reason RT’s audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see RT’s reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the BBC, CNN and other establishment outlets. By spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. The age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. RT understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catch-up, albeit in vain.Sunset for Goebbels. Hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a Deep State star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge – obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it – that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. They are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. 
The faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions in place – much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis could disintegrate within a year – so this latest move by Brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as Europe’s NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup d’etat in the Ukraine , to NATO’s hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EU’s ‘migrant crisis’ debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the ‘ White Helmets’ in Syria – these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history – an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. 
We tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT International… 
. RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the EU to “respond to information warfare by Russia.” RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous “tools” of “hostile propaganda.” 
The EU Parliament’s resolution demonstrates “ political degradation ” in regard to the “ idea of democracy ” in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. 
Putin pointed out that while “ everyone tries to lecture ” Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, “ which is not the best way ” to deal with any issues. 
“ The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support one’s point of view should be presented ,” Putin said. 
Adding that he hopes the Western move to “ counter Russian propaganda ” won’t lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. 
In the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report ‘ EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties ’, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. 
Written by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to “ distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens .” 
The report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. 
At the same time, Russia is accused of “ information warfare ,” with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda “tools. ” 
The document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). 
The report also mentions some “ social media and internet trolls ” from Russia who are thought to “ challenge democratic values .” 
It called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of “ investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media .” It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO “ on strategic communication .” 
Sputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalists’ organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. 
“ The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EU’s own human rights and freedom of press norms,” reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. 
During the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was “ at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter ,” and that with an alleged “ aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .” ",0
18005,Repudiating the Media,"Q. If Trump wins can it be considered a repudiation of the national news mediocrity? A. I certainly hope so! 
The performance of the major news outlets this election cycle has been something to behold. It’s been the worst, most shallow undertaking I can remember. And I remember the treatment Goldwater got. 
I wrote here on Lew’s blog last week about the hysterical reaction Gloria Borger and others had to Trump’s unwillingness to promise to respect the election results in advance. 
They acted like panicked teenage girls in a horror movie. 
Pat Buchanan explains the media’s panic. “The establishment is terrified that it has lost the country,” he says. “The country no longer believes in its leadership.” 
About time! 
Now with the Comey development it won’t be long before Dems start talking about a rigged system. 
Another moment of equal media idiocracy: When the Clintonistas blamed Russia for spilling DNC emails that showed its secret collaboration with Hillary and against Bernie Sanders. 
Trump said “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing!” 
The line wasn’t well-delivered. But it was still funny. 
Even so, the joke was lost on the usual suspects. I watched CNN’s Jake Tapper’s visage grow dark as he expressed grave concern that Trump was inviting the Russians to interfere in our election. 
The whole thing brings to mind an old vaudeville comedy routine with, let’s say, Joe and Moe: Joe: I’m offended by the media’s alarmist reaction to Trump’s email joke. Moe: Are you offended as a Trump supporter? Joe: No, I’m offended as a person with a sense of humor! 11:09 am on October 29, 2016",0

18009,Three Underrated Alternative Energy Options You Can Find in Your Home,"
Sure, there are plenty of alternatives to fossil fuels: most people have heard of solar cells, wind and battery power, but there are other energy options as well. Some of them are a few years away from being viable in the US, but many of them could be excellent candidates if a little more research and funds are invested now. Here are three of the most familiar, yet underrated, energy options.
Cooking Oil There are reports of cooking oil being used as a fuel source as far back as 1896, and peanut oil was used to power diesel engines throughout the turn of the century. But there hasn’t been much of a desire to move further into the realm of using cooking oil for fuel ; the issue that makes vegetable oil a less popular or likely choice is largely availability. Though the US alone produces more than 2.5 billion pounds of grease through restaurants and other industries, there are some regions where the byproduct is simply not available. Shipping drives up the cost and makes other resources more attractive. However, for those who DO have a readily available supply (such as farmers or restaurant owners), cooking oil can provide up to 25% of the energy needed to run these establishments. An investment in a special generator up front can allow these businesses to turn their used oils into energy and also cut down the cost of oil disposal (which can cost upwards of $75 a month) in the process. Best of all, cooking oil is completely renewable and burns cleaner than fossil fuels.
Garbage Incineration, or the burning of garbage, has been around for centuries; however, the process is not as simple as merely torching trash and being done with it. Incineration produces pollutants such as dioxin and releases them into the air. One way around this issue is to create special waste-to-energy plants that control the release of hazardous air pollutants.
Estonia has facilities that meet these requirements and they recently made headlines when they imported 62,000 tons of garbage from other European nations for use in their power plant in Iru. Sweden also produces more than 60% of their energy using renewable resources (primarily a combination of wind power and waste-to-energy). Currently, the United States has 87 waste-to-energy plants that generate approximately 2,720 megawatts, or about 0.4 percent of total US power generation. In European countries there are more government incentives and business benefits to utilizing alternative energy resources, but in the US we’re still much more reliant on our traditional sources. We don’t yet have the infrastructure to make the strides that Estonia or Sweden have, but as these and other European countries continue to develop these methods, they can serve as a model for future areas of exploration.
Poop! Yes, that’s right: human and animal feces can be used as a source of energy. When processed through bioreactors that are equipped at removing the natural gas from waste, this method is efficient and (after initial startup costs) affordable.
The specialized bioreactors work by feeding solid human and animal waste into chambers full of bacteria. The bacteria eat any remaining nutrients in the waste and release natural gas that we can use as fuel. It’s also possible to convert solid waste into hydrogen and other gasses for various uses. Toyota’s Fukuoka plant in Japan has been experimenting with biogas-turned-hydrogen for fueling a new fleet of vehicles. Hydrogen vehicles are currently available in the United States as well, but they are expensive and the filling stations are rare at this point. Scientists at UCLA are hoping that “brown energy” continues to develop in the US because the benefits are so great and the source material is, ahem, endlessly available.

18011,Self-Driving Truck’s First Mission: A 120-Mile Beer Run,"New York Times – by Mike Isaac SAN FRANCISCO — The futurists of Silicon Valley may not have seen this one coming: The first commercial delivery made by a self-driving truck was 2,000 cases of Budweiser beer. On Tuesday, Otto , the Uber-owned self-driving vehicle operation, announced the completion of its first commercial delivery, having delivered its beer load from Fort Collins, Colo., to Colorado Springs, a roughly 120-mile trip on Interstate 25. In recent years, Uber has predicted a future in which you can ride in a self-driving car that will take you where you want to go, no driver necessary. But the idea that commercial trucking could be done by robot is a relatively new idea — and a potentially controversial one, given the possibility that robots could one day replace human drivers. “We think this technology is inching closer to commercial availability,” Lior Ron, co-founder of Otto, said in an interview. In August, Uber acquired Otto, a San Francisco start-up run by a number of veterans of Google’s long-running autonomous vehicle research. Though largely symbolic, the beer delivery marks the first commercial partnership for Otto, which was founded less than a year ago. Terms of the deal between Otto and Anheuser-Busch InBev , which owns the Budweiser brand, were not disclosed. “We’ve tested with trailers, of course, but there’s nothing like actually doing the real thing, end to end,” Mr. Ron said. The delivery was indicative of Uber’s larger ambitions to become an enormous transportation network, one in which the company is responsible for moving anything, like people, hot meals or cases of beer, around the globe, at all hours and as efficiently as possible. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, has said he envisions a future in which transportation will occur in different ways, using both manned and unmanned vehicles. Otto is a particularly large bet for Uber, which paid nearly $700 million for the start-up only a few months after the company started publicly discussing its self-driving-truck ambitions. Since backing down from its money-burning effort to dominate the Chinese ride-hailing market in August, Uber has invested more time and resources to focus on breaking into the trucking market. Annual trucking industry revenue topped $720 billion in 2015, according to American Trucking Association estimates. A good part of that total came from top brands that rely heavily on the trucking industry to transport their goods. Anheuser-Busch, for example, delivers more than a million truckloads of beer domestically every year. “We view self-driving trucks as the future, and we want to be a part of that,” said James Sembrot, senior director of logistics strategy at Anheuser-Busch. Though the delivery went smoothly, the two companies did not indicate whether there would be any further deals. For this initial delivery, Otto’s truck departed Anheuser-Busch’s facility in Loveland, Colo., in the early morning before reaching the interstate in Fort Collins. The truck drove through Denver — alongside regular passenger car traffic — and navigated to its destination in Colorado Springs without incident. Otto said a trained driver was in the cabin of the truck at all times to monitor the vehicle’s progress and take over if necessary. At no point was the driver required to intervene, the company said. Future expansion of the pilot program will allow Otto to test for more types of road and weather conditions, a major factor in autonomous vehicle route plotting.",0
18012,Fox News: Senior Obama Intelligence Official Unmasked Trump Associates - Breitbart,"Fox News correspondent Adam Housley reported Friday that a   and “very senior” former official in the intelligence community, not associated with the FBI, directed the unmasking of private Americans working for or with President Donald Trump’s presidential transition team. [“Unmasking is not unprecedented, but unmasking for political purposes   …     specifically of Trump transition team members   …     is highly suspect and questionable,” an intelligence source told Fox News. “Opposition by some in the intelligence agencies who were very connected to the Obama and Clinton teams was strong. After Trump was elected, they decided they were going to ruin his presidency by picking them off one by one. ” Housley said his sources inside the intelligence community reached out to him after mainstream media reports Thursday flagged two White House aides as the sources bringing information to Rep. Devin Nunes (R. ) the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.  Thursday’s mainstream media narrative was that Ezra   and Michael Ellis called Nunes to the White House grounds March 21, where they passed classified information to Nunes that confirmed Obama administration surveillance of the Trump camp. Then, March 22, Nunes went to the White House to present classified information to the president. This narrative and the Nunes    with the White House was ridiculed as an elaborate ruse or proof that Nunes was acting in a bizarre way. The Housley report is that Thursday’s narrative was not true —  and that   and Ellis were not sources at all rather the two men came to the aid of Nunes, who had other sources but needed to use a Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Facility (SCIF) that was not associated with the whistleblowers’ own agency. The sources told Fox News that surveillance of the Trump campaign began before Trump became the Republican presidential nominee July 19, and the surveillance had nothing to do with Russia, Housley said. Intelligence agencies are banned from collecting intelligence on Americans without permission from a judge, but in the course of authorized surveillance Americans are caught in the net. These names are supposed to be masked or disguised, so that their rights are preserved. What Fox News is reporting is that these names were either put in the clear or given flimsy masks, so that their identity was obvious. The sources also told Housley that Nunes learned about the surveillance and the unmasking in January, before Trump entered the White House, but members of the intelligence community have been uncooperative as the chairman searched for a SCIF, where he could conduct his own deep dive into their portent. Finally, he was able to secure use of the White House SCIF inside the Old Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds, but not in the “White House. ” Fox News investigative reporter Malia Zimmerman also worked on this report.",0
18013,Actor Mark Ruffalo Returns From Standing Rock To Call Out Obama’s Refusal To Stop Native American Land Theft -,"
By The Indigenous People 
Protests escalated in North Dakota as police moved in with armed vehicles and rubber bullets. Standing Rock youth also tried to deliver a letter to Hillary Clinton’s headquarters. Actor and activist Mark Ruffalo, who just returned from North Dakota, where he and Native Renewables founder Wahleah Johns presented Standing Rock Sioux tribal elders with mobile solar panels on trailers, bringing clean power to the protest encampment where the largest gathering of Native Americans in modern history is taking a stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline . 
“This pipeline is a black snake that traverses four states and 200 waterways with fracked Bakken oil ,” said Ruffalo, co-founder of The Solutions Project , which works to accelerate the transition to 100 percent clean and renewable energy. 
“We know from experience that pipelines leak , explode, pollute and poison land and water. But it doesn’t have to be that way.” 
The solar trailers will provide clean energy to power medical tents and other critical facilities for Native American protesters and their allies at the encampment. The trailers symbolize a healthy, equitable, prosperous energy future made possible by clean renewable energy. 
“Water is life,” said Johns, a Navajo leader. “By leading a transition to energy that is powered by the sun, the wind and water, we ensure a better future for all of our people and for future generations.” 
Johns’ company, Native Renewables, promotes low-cost clean energy solutions for Native American families throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on job creation and on benefiting the community as a whole. The trailers were built by members of the Navajo nation and were financed by Empowered by Light and Give Power. 
Research led by Stanford Prof. Mark Jacobson, another Solutions Project co-founder, shows that it would be technically possible and economically beneficial to transition to 100 percent clean renewable energy in each and every state across the country. In North Dakota , for example, wind and solar energy would be the primary sources of clean power and transitioning to 100 percent renewables would create 30,000 jobs. ",0

Pat McCrory’s office said late Wednesday that he had declared an emergency and had “initiated efforts” to deploy the National Guard and the state Highway Patrol. The shooting heightened the tension among the demonstrators and the police alike. City officials were quick to say the police had not fired any live rounds, but riot police personnel did fire repeated rounds of tear gas. The scene of the shooting and the largest demonstration of the evening happened along a crowded street in Charlotte’s city center, where the sound of gunfire mixed with the noise of people banging objects into vehicles. The gunshot victim lay motionless on the ground, his eyes open, as people surrounded him and blood pooled among their feet. He was taken into the nearby Omni Hotel, and a series of confrontations played out afterward as the police kept people from entering. There was sporadic looting. Twitter messages showed that the team store of the Charlotte Hornets of the N. B. A. had been broken into and gutted of merchandise. “We are working very hard to bring peace and calm back to our city,” Mayor Jennifer Roberts said on CNN. A spokesman for Ms. Roberts said she had requested and planned to review on Thursday a police dashboard video of the encounter with Keith L. Scott, the black man who was shot and killed here on Tuesday. But she said she would not make the video public. Around 10 p. m. the police ordered all civilians, including members of the news media, to leave parts of the Uptown neighborhood and threatened to arrest those who did not comply. When the crowd did not respond immediately, the authorities fired more tear gas within minutes. After that, it appeared that the crowd started to disperse, although some stragglers remained in the area. The unrest in Charlotte came after two other   deadly shootings in the last week. First came the shooting of a teenager in Columbus, Ohio, who had been brandishing a BB gun. Two days later, on Friday, was the shooting death in Tulsa, Okla. of a man who had his hands above his head before an officer opened fire. And then it was Charlotte, where Mr. Scott, 43, black like the other two, was shot by a police officer in a parking space marked “Visitor” outside an unremarkable apartment complex. On Wednesday that parking space was both a shooting site and a shrine, and Charlotte was a city on edge, the latest to play a role in what feels like a recurring, seemingly inescapable tape loop of American tragedy. “To see this happen multiple times  —   just time after time  —   it’s depressing, man,” said Tom Jackson, 25, who works with mentally disabled people. He didn’t know Mr. Scott but was drawn here nonetheless, one of many strangers and friends who came to pay their respects and make sense of their sorrow. In addition to the fatal attacks on police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas, it was another grim snapshot of America’s continuing crisis in black and blue, this moment amplified by presidential politics. And as usual, there was very little consensus on what went wrong and how to fix it. At a news conference on Wednesday, Kerr Putney, chief of the   police, said officers had found the gun that the police said Mr. Scott had brandished before an officer, who is also black, fatally shot him and were examining police video of the encounter that unfolded as Mr. Scott stepped out of a car. Family members of Mr. Scott have said that he was unarmed and was holding only a book. Chief Putney said Wednesday morning, “We did not find a book. ” The response of B. J. Murphy, an   activist here, could not have been more different: “Everybody in Charlotte should be on notice that black people, today, we’re tired of this,” he said, adding an epithet. “We’re tired of being killed and nobody saying nothing. We’re tired of our political leaders going along to get along they’re so weak, they don’t have no sympathy for our grief. And we want justice. ” All three shootings are under investigation, and are rife with questions. The police in Columbus said that the BB gun wielded by    Tyre King was built to look nearly identical to a Smith  Wesson Military  Police semiautomatic pistol. Mayor Andrew J. Ginther blamed the shooting, in part, on Americans’ “easy access to guns, whether they are firearms or replicas. ” In Tulsa, the police said investigators found the drug PCP in the shooting victim’s S. U. V. The drug is known to induce erratic behavior in some users. But Mr. Crump, who is representing the family of the victim, Terence Crutcher, said the discovery of the drug, if true, would not justify the deadly shooting. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Crutcher’s father, the Rev. Joey Crutcher, said his son had marched in protest of earlier police killings and had thought about how to protect himself during interactions with police officers. They had planned to go to a church event aimed at teaching people how behave around the police and avoid becoming another hashtag shared on social media by Black Lives Matter protesters. “I never thought this would happen to my family,” Mr. Crutcher said, adding that he had counseled his son all his life about how to behave around the police. “I said, ‘Whenever you’re stopped by a police and you’re in that situation, raise your hands up, always let them see your hands, let them see that you are not going for a gun.’ And that is what Terence was doing. I said, ‘Always put your hands on your car.’ I made that specific, ‘your car.’ And that’s what Terence was walking to do on his car so that they could see his hands. ” John Barnett, a civil rights activist in Charlotte, said during a raucous news conference near the site of the shooting that Mr. Scott had been waiting for his son to arrive home from school. “The truth of the matter is, he didn’t point that gun,” Mr. Barnett said. “Did he intend to really sit in a vehicle, waiting on his son to get home from school and then plot to shoot a cop if they pulled up on him?” Adding to an atmosphere loaded with suspicion and mistrust, residents of the apartment complex gave varying accounts of Mr. Scott’s death. Some differed from the police on which officer fired the shots, and others said that no one had tried to administer CPR for Mr. Scott as officials had said. Brentley Vinson, the officer who the police say shot Mr. Scott, is black, as is the police chief. “Since black lives do not matter for this city, then our black dollars should not matter,” said Mr. Murphy, the activist. “We’re watching a   lynching on social media, on television and it is affecting the psyche of black people. ” Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said Wednesday that the Justice Department “is aware of, and we are assessing, the incident that led to the death of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte. ” Responding to another police shooting, the state’s attorney in Baltimore County, Md. Scott D. Shellenberger, announced Wednesday that no charges would be filed against any of the officers involved in the Aug. 1 shooting death of Korryn Gaines or the shooting of her    son. In Charlotte, Rakeyia Scott, Mr. Scott’s wife, said on Wednesday the family was “devastated” by the shooting. She described her husband as “a loving husband, father, brother and friend” and called on protesters to remain peaceful. At a campaign rally in Orlando, Fla. Hillary Clinton spoke about the shootings here and in Tulsa. “There is still much we don’t know about what happened in both incidents, but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of   killed by police officers in these encounters,’’ she said. “It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable. We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Scott’s death. Every day police officers are serving with courage, honor and skill. ” Her Republican rival, Donald J. Trump, reacted on Twitter. “Hopefully the violence  unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end,” he wrote. “To those injured, get well soon. We need unity  leadership. ” Unity, thus far, has been in short supply. On Friday, Mr. Trump earned the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. But polls show that his support among   is negligible, even though he has singled them out in promising to solve the ills of poverty and violence that he has characterized as plaguing black neighborhoods. On Wednesday, Mr. Jackson, the man who came here to mourn, was not thinking about the current presidential candidates. The police, he said, “are out here killing people, and they don’t even know their backgrounds,” he said. “They could be killing the next president. ”",0
18015,Major Swing State Dem ADMITS Stunning Truth About Trump and The Polls,"You are here: Home / US / Major Swing State Dem ADMITS Stunning Truth About Trump and The Polls Major Swing State Dem ADMITS Stunning Truth About Trump and The Polls October 27, 2016 Pinterest 
Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a major swing state Democrat and Hillary Clinton ally, had quite a few commonsense sound bites during an interview with Philadelphia radio host Rich Zeoli, and one of the most notable was his comment about the “hidden Trump vote.” 
“I think there’s a hidden Donald Trump vote,” Rendell told Zeoli . “All this talk about it being over and now the real contest is the Senate is going to persuade a couple of Hillary Clinton voters and Democratic voters to say ‘Well, what do I have to stand on line for an hour [to vote] for? 
The media has pushed rigged polls and shown their massive bias in favor of Clinton — even Rendell had to admit that the media is biased: “The majority of the media’s against Donald Trump and favors Hillary Clinton.” 
Rendell discussed the possibility that the Clinton campaign/media’s strategy could backfire: “There a lot of things that are in motion that are favorable to Donald Trump. I wouldn’t say that it’s over then. The odds are that he’s going to lose, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it.” 
In a further discussion about Clinton voters staying home, Rendell told Zeoli: 
If you’re an African-American voter and you like Hillary — because you’ve always liked the Clintons — but, you know, it’s not Barack Obama, and you read that Hillary’s got Pennsylvania locked up — the [Philadelphia] Inquirer said that the Trump team had conceded Pennsylvania this morning — you read that and you say she’s going to win anyway. ‘What do I have to stand on line for an hour?’ If I were the Clinton team, I would be desperately worried about that type of talk. Desperately worried. 
The media bias has gotten so bad and so blatant that even a Democrat Clinton ally had to admit it. Rendell’s point about possible voter suppression was a very interesting take; however, there’s another more sinister reason why Clinton’s camp and the media (but I repeat myself) are doing this. 
The Democrat National Committee rigged the primary for Clinton. If there is something set in motion to steal the election for Clinton — and given the amount of evidence we have about voter fraud it’s likely — it’s imperative for the media to set up the narrative that Clinton is going to win in a landslide. 
If the media is able to sell the myth that Clinton has opened a huge lead over Donald Trump, they have a better chance of getting away with stealing an election with minor resistance from the public. 
We’ve heard for a while that there is a potential hidden Trump vote of people who won’t say that they’re voting for him because of the massive media bias, but plan to do so in the privacy of the voting booth. 
Hopefully that holds true and the vigorous support for Trump evidenced at his rallies is able to overcome the Democrats’ dirty tricks.",0
18016,"In Office Horror Movies, the Companies Operate in the Red - The New York Times","Talk about a wicked case of the Mondays. Almost anyone who has worked in an office has felt beaten down by the job at some point, whether it’s by an annoying   a demanding boss or monotonous daily tasks. It’s enough to make some people crack. Films like “Office Space” and shows like “The Office” turned the pitfalls of office culture into comedy. But what does it look like when that desire to smack a colleague silly is taken to darker places? You get the subgenre of office horror, in which bodies pile up alongside the copy machine. The latest entries include “The Belko Experiment” (March 17) and the forthcoming “Mayhem,” about the most hellish days at the office you can imagine. Here’s a look at these, and other, office nightmares. DIRECTOR Greg McLean PLOT It starts just like any other day at Belko Industries, a Bogotá, Colombia, nonprofit that has American employees. But then a voice on the intercom tells employees they must kill a certain number of their   or more will die. Steel doors lock everyone in, touching off a “Hunger Games”      scenario. The movie includes several familiar types  —   the budding couple the slacker the stern boss the annoying,      —   and pits them against one another in a grisly death match. GRUESOME BREAK FROM ROUTINE One especially unlucky employee is bludgeoned with a tape dispenser. DIRECTOR Joe Lynch PLOT In this film, which made its premiere at the South by Southwest film festival this month, a nasty virus is going around, one that attacks the id and makes people act out their most basic instincts.

GRUESOME BREAK FROM ROUTINE After the analyst and a client get access to the tool closet, they use hammers, wrenches, a fire extinguisher and a nail gun in a showdown with employees. DIRECTOR Brian James O’Connell PLOT Sometimes your boss really is out to get you. In this 2015   workers at a telemarketing company get a new sales manager who’s a corporate vampire  —   literally. Soon after he arrives, some employees start acting strange and their complexions begin to pale. It’s up to two overlooked telemarketers and a security guard to bring an end to their boss and the havoc he is wreaking. GRUESOME BREAK FROM ROUTINE During a visit to the supply closet, the guys break the handles off brooms, pull the blade off a paper cutter and get to work. DIRECTOR Cindy Sherman PLOT In this 1997 thriller from the artist and photographer Cindy Sherman, office life is more appealing than the alternative for one lonely woman. Because of budget cuts, Dorine (Carol Kane) a proofreader at a magazine, is forced to work from home, which depresses her further. But when she accidentally electrocutes a   on a visit to the office, she becomes energized and ends up going on a murder spree, killing more colleagues and others.

18017,‘Leave’ Takes the Lead as Britain Awaits Outcome of E.U. Referendum - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Supporters of a British exit from the European Union opened up a substantial lead over advocates of staying in the bloc as the nation tallied the votes early Friday on one of its most momentous decisions in generations. With more than half of towns and cities reporting, the   Leave campaign was leading by more than 700, 000 votes out of more than 24 million that had been counted, an advantage of 51. 6 percent to 48. 4 percent over the Remain campaign, according to the BBC. “Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the U. K. Independence Party, one of the primary forces behind the push for a referendum on leaving the European Union, told cheering supporters just after 4 a. m. denouncing the “lies, corruption and deceit” that he said elites in both major parties  —   Conservative and Labour  —   had peddled. The vote was still too close to call, and Remain supporters were not giving up. But as Thursday night turned to Friday morning, the results were consistently giving hope to the Leave campaign while inducing deep worry among supporters of staying in Europe, starting with Prime Minister David Cameron. The early results startled the financial markets, which gyrated wildly after initially banking on a victory for the Remain campaign. At one point the value of the pound plummeted to $1. 36 from $1. 50, the sharpest   drop on record. Officials were busily counting some 33. 6 million ballots cast Thursday by an estimated 72 percent of eligible voters at the conclusion of a campaign that amounted to a fierce debate over sovereignty, national identity, immigration and trade. The Leave campaign did better than anticipated in areas it had expected to win, particularly in northeast England, and picked up Swansea, a Welsh city it had not expected to win. The Remain campaign performed well in the inner London boroughs of Wandsworth, Lambeth, Hammersmith and Fulham, but it barely carried Newcastle upon Tyne, a university town it had expected to dominate. Proponents of staying in the European Union started the night in a confident mood, especially after Mr. Farage suggested that he was not optimistic about victory. The first indication that the outcome might be closer than some of the late polling suggested came from one of the first sizable areas to report, as the Leave campaign did even better than expected in Sunderland, a   community in the northeast. Voting lasted from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m. though some particularly crowded poll sites stayed open longer to accommodate voters still in line to cast their ballots. Two other   opinion surveys also gave the Remain camp an edge, but given the failure of most British pollsters to foresee the Conservative Party’s victory in last year’s general elections, many analysts were putting little trust in surveys. “Neither a comfortable Remain victory nor a comfortable Leave victory can be ruled out,” Stephen Fisher, an elections expert who teaches at Oxford, wrote on Thursday morning, after noting that polling averages gave Remain a very slight lead. About half of voters were thought to have walked to the polls, though many others drove and a few even rode horses. Strong rains in parts of the capital and southeast England complicated voting floods forced the borough of Kingston upon Thames in southwest London to move two polling sites. By the Thursday evening rush, rains had caused delays on several subway lines and brought foot traffic at Waterloo, the capital’s busiest train station, to a standstill. Many Britons posted photos of themselves accompanied by their dogs and cats, prompting internet memes. Until the polls closed, news organizations were  prohibited from reporting accounts of how people voted, but in interviews, Britons expressed their concerns and anxieties in more general terms. In the deprived town of Oldham, near Manchester, a traditional stronghold of the Labour Party, Lisa Kirk, 43, said she and her family had been swayed by the U. K. Independence Party, which opposes Britain’s membership in the European Union, and expressed disenchantment with British leaders. “They’re just letting all the foreigners in, and there is nothing left in the system for us,” she said. In the   spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, in the picturesque Kent countryside, Michael Selway, 54, expressed worry about the future of European integration. “This project was set up by people who had fantastic intentions  —   no more war  —   and now it might all come to a crashing end,” he said. Older voters are seen as being particularly disenchanted with the European Union, and younger voters more attracted to the possibility of studying and working on the Continent. But there were many exceptions. Helen Lickerman, 67, said there was a general tendency to move away from European integration. “Never mind the ins and outs of the economy,” she said at an interview at St. Giles Cripplegate Church in the Barbican, a residential and arts complex in the City of London, the capital’s financial district. “There’s a general feeling of being part of a community, and the history, the past wars, is something we don’t want anymore. ” Near Paddington Station just north of Hyde Park, Yamini Mathur, a    Londoner, said that voters had been more confused than enlightened by the blizzard of claims and counterclaims made during a series of debates. “We do not have all the answers, we do not have all the information, but I guess we will just have to go with all the information we have,” she said. The two officially designated campaigns  —   Vote Leave and Stronger In  —   continued to fire away on Twitter, in messages that reflected the sharply negative turn the debate has taken in a country where civility and decorum have been distinctive characteristics of the political culture. Vote Leave told its followers on Twitter: “Today’s referendum is about democracy. If you cherish it and it matters to you at all, then please #VoteLeave and #TakeBackControl. ” The campaign has relentlessly attacked the European Union as an unaccountable and faceless bureaucracy that is subsidized by Britain and offers little more than onerous directives in return, while forcing high levels of migrants onto Britain through its insistence on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. The Stronger In campaign has at times struggled to make a positive case for the   bloc, instead focusing on the economic hit that Britain  —   the bloc’s   economy, after Germany  —   would sustain if it lost access to a common market of more than 500 million people. Even enthusiasts acknowledge that the European Union, with its cumbersome governance, is hard to love, though they say it has helped to unite a Continent that nearly destroyed itself in two world wars. With the stumping over, politicians were left with little to do but vote. Three leaders of the Remain campaign  —   Mr. Cameron, whose Conservative Party is bitterly divided over the European Union, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, and Mayor Sadiq Khan of London  —   all voted in the capital. So did Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who has arguably been the most prominent face of the Leave campaign, and Michael Gove, the justice secretary.  Mr. Farage cast his ballot in Kent, in southeast England. It was only the third nationwide referendum in British history. In the first, in 1975, Britons affirmed their membership in the European Economic Community, a forerunner to the European Union, which they joined in 1973. In the second, in 2011, voters rejected a change to the system by which members of Parliament are elected.",0
18018,11 Photos that Show the Human Rights Failures of Obama’s Cuba Policy - Breitbart,"As President Donald Trump prepares to unveil his administration’s diplomatic policy towards Cuba, expected to repeal reforms that had made it easier for Americans to give money to the repressive Castro regime, corporations and lobbyists that have benefitted from Obama’s “normalization” have gone into attack mode. [The hotel monolith Mariott’s chief executive is personally demanding Trump not enact   rights policies that could jeopardize the company’s bottom line. The New York Times, which published the lies that made it possible for Fidel Castro to become the island’s dictator, laments that “the United States Congress, businesses and other interested groups,” including the Cuban government, may not be pleased by the changes (this is, the Times posits, a bad thing).  The foreboding tone of American liberal media coverage surrounding the potential repeal of Obama’s 2014 “normalization” effort demands selective memory of the Obama era’s effect on the Cuban people to take seriously. His policies may have prompted optimism among the CEOs of companies like AirBNB and Carnival Cruises. But Cuban dissidents report skyrocketing rates of arbitrary arrests and an   disregard for human rights in a country that already held one of the world’s worst records on the matter before 2014. Below, eleven images that capture the suffering of the Cuban people following President Obama’s call for bilateral ties with the Castro regime, and the callous disregard the White House showed towards these consequences as they became impossible to ignore. February 2015: President Obama announced he would   friendly ties with the Castro regime in December 2014. Two months later, the regime challenged the call for treating dissidents with respect by not only beating and arresting members of the Ladies in White  —   a dissident group whose sole act of protest is silently attending Catholic Mass on Sundays dressed in white and holding the photos of political prisoners  —   but tarring one of their members, Digna Rodríguez Ibañez. Photo via Twitter.  September 2015: In a move meant to signal to the international community that they could ease the pressure on the Castro regime, Cuba invited Pope Francis to tour the city of Havana and the eastern regional capital of Santiago de Cuba. The government did not use the occasion of the pontiff’s presence on the island to cease repressing dissidents, however. Zaqueo Báez, a member of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) approached the papal convoy in Havana and shouted “freedom!” within earshot of the Pope. He was beaten in front of the pope and whisked away into a police vehicle. Pope Francis later denied knowledge of the incident, though video proved he was feet away as Báez was beaten. The photo below shows Báez being taken away from Pope Francis. AP   Espinosa,  December 2015:      Francisco Morales had traveled to his home country every Christmas for the past decade to set up a Christmas display for the children of his Havana neighborhood without incident. After President Obama announced his “normalization” measures, however, Morales was arrested for setting up animated characters like Santa Claus and Mickey Mouse on the roof of his family home. Cuba is an atheist state that has persecuted and tortured Christians since the 1960s and only allowed leftist Liberation Theologists and Jesuit Catholics to operate unperturbed on the island in recent years. Evangelical Christians, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and   Adventists are especially subject to arrest and other state abuse.  @CubanetNoticias,  January 2016: Cuban dissidents from a number of prominent groups on the island regularly suffer actos de repudio, “acts of rejection,” in which the government sends angry mobs to their homes to intimidate and insult them. In a particularly brazen rejection of international human rights norms, one acto de repudio featured a bonfire made up of copies of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Marti Noticias. March 2016: President Obama’s trip to Cuba triggered some of the Cuban government’s most aggressive abuses against dissidents. Below, the mass arrests of dozens of Ladies in White, grabbed by the clothes and hair and beaten into submission, shortly before the president’s arrival. Adalberto    Images,  March 2016: The oppression was not limited to Ladies in White. One Cuban dissident succeeded in using the occasion of President Obama’s visit to protest live on American television. Yasser Rivero Boní, the son of a Lady in White who has lost most of his vision following beatings by Castro police, ran onto the set of ESPN and interrupted Bob Ley’s live broadcast to call for freedom on the island. Within seconds, a sqaud of   Cuban police apprehended and whisked him away.  .  March 2016: President Obama was not the only   visitor to the island this month. The Rolling Stones, a British band that Fidel Castro had banned from the island for their “imperialist” music, played a “historic” concert for those in the government’s good graces that month. Naturally, this irked Cuba’s punk rock community, and in particular the band Porno para Ricardo, who writes punk music against the regime. In protest, they played a “concert” titled “Public Scandal,” in which they stood in silence, holding their instruments, for the duration of a concert. Porno Para Ricardo social media,  March 2016: President Obama completed his itinerary in Cuba, delivering a speech in which he quoted poet José Martí, stopping for   under the image of Castro butcher Ernesto “Che” Guevara at the Plaza of the Revolution, and attending a baseball game with Raúl Castro. In the below image, the president does “the wave” with the Cuban dictator. White   Souza,  August 2016: Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas is an   pacifist human rights activists. In the below photo, he was conducting his 23rd hunger strike against the Castro regime. In this one, he also refused water. The below photo shows friendly trying to carry him to a local hospital after he had lost mobility. Cuban hospitals rejected Fariñas before ultimately taking him in as a patient, responding to international pressure. elblogdegeronimo. wordpress. com via Cubanet,  May 2017: The Cuban dissident Daniel Llorente, who does not belong to any dissident groups, is carried away from the streets of Havana after receiving a beating from the   Cuban police in the photo. Llorente interrupted the Castro’s May Day parade  —   an international celebration of communism  —   by running in front of the parade waving an American flag. Llorente became an active dissident following the “normalization” announcement, using his American flag to welcome Carnival Cruises to Havana, where Cuban agents berated and insulted him.

18019,Disobey or Die,"  28, 2016 | Politics , Science   The problem we have to solve is, as Howard Zinn told us, not too much civil disobedience, but too much civil obedience.

B ack in the winter of 1982, Air Florida flight 90 took off from National Airport. The first officer noticed dangerous readings on some instruments and pointed them out to the captain. The captain told him he was wrong, and he accepted the captain’s authority. He did nothing. Thirty seconds later the plane crashed into the 14th Street Bridge. Everyone on board died except for four passengers rescued out of the icy river. 
During the latter decades of the 20th and first part of the 21st century, millions and millions of first officers on spaceship earth noticed that climate and nuclear dangers loomed. But every authoritative captain in sight, from elected officials to CEOs to media pundits, said “Don’t be a fool. I’ve got this.” And millions upon millions sat back and mumbled “Oh, all right, if you’re sure.” 
The people pushing through the vote this week at the United Nations to create a treaty next year banning nuclear weapons are engaged in necessary disobedience to mainstream authority and acceptance. The people putting their bodies in the way of a pipeline in North Dakota are disobeying immoral orders. 
Ira Chaleff’s book, Intelligent Disobedience , re-examines the lessons of the Milgram and Stanford prison experiments, and other more recent demonstrations of the severe dangers of uncritical obedience. Chaleff highlights some techniques that can facilitate intelligent refusals to obey. 
When Milgram put the actor pretending to be given electric shocks in the same room, visible to the person ordered to shock him, obedience dropped by 40 percent. This suggests we need fewer trips to Disney World and more to Hiroshima, fewer student exchanges to England and more to Russia and Iran, fewer summer jobs at the local swimming pool and more at the nearest climate-impacted site in need of assistance. 
Milgram also got obedience to drop by 20 percent by removing the authority figure from sight and having him deliver his orders by telephone. This does not suggest demonizing or antagonizing authority figures, but rather distancing and diminishing them. We need to metaphorically bring them down to size, and we need to physically and otherwise get away from them. Throw out your television to get their faces out of your living room. Read the news online as needed. Practice kneeling during the national anthem; it’ll give you a whole new outlook in which hearing a civilian refer to “our commander in chief” sounds frighteningly out of place. 
Milgram reduced obedience by 100% by having a second authority figure contradict the first one. As long as people are going to practice subservient obedience, we need to identify and recruit and broadcast all apparent authority figures who contradict the destructive orders of the mainstream authorities. Who counts as an authority figure may vary from person to person, but we don’t have to choose. The more the murkier! 
We also need to lead by example. Even when Milgram’s lone authority figure ordered shocks, if the subject of the experiment saw someone else refuse to obey, then 90% of the time he or she would also refuse. This is a huge opening for us. But it does not mean that we can create a little Eco village and thereby save the world. It does mean that doing that will help. But we need examples of people challenging the entire system that deals weapons and subsidizes fossil fuels. And we need lots of examples so that everyone watching can see someone who looks like them engaged in constructive disobedience. 
In warfare, militaries condition people to obey immoral orders through, among other things, a number of distancing techniques. It’s easy to murder someone far away or unseen. It’s easier to order someone else to do it. It’s easier to be part of a group doing it together. It’s easier to think of it as defending someone else rather than simply committing murder. We have to reverse all of this distancing. We have to put the victims and potential victims of war and of climate chaos right up close to the vision of as many people as possible. We have to create unavoidable responsibility. The bill in the British parliament that would allow people to choose whether to pay war taxes is one possible approach. We have to make those engaged in ordinary, typical muddling through understand that as long as they fail to take radical action they are engaged in the slow but massive taking of human life. 
We should replace the pledge of allegiance with the Nuremberg principles and the Hippocratic oath. The problem we have to solve is, as Howard Zinn told us, not too much civil disobedience, but too much civil obedience.

18020,MILO: Women Who Have Abortions Become Suicidal And Crazy - Breitbart,"Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO listed the negative health effects that come from having an abortion during his talk at Cal Poly State University on Tuesday, including an increase in suicidal tendencies and mood disorders.[  “#ShoutYourAbortion and movements like it seek to normalize abortion, but in fact it is very bad for women’s health,” claimed MILO. “You know, the women feminism claims to care about. ” “In 2010, the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry published a study based on a sample of 3, 000 women in the United States. The findings of the effects of abortion are startling,” he continued. “59 percent increased risk for suicidal thoughts. 61 percent increased risk for mood disorders. 61 percent increased risk for social anxiety disorders. 261 percent increased risk for alcohol abuse. 280 percent increased risk for any substance use disorder. ” “If the cause of this mental anguish were anything besides abortion, women would be marching   against it, and Madonna would be threatening to blow the White House up over it,” MILO concluded. “Abortion is clearly so bad for women’s mental health that it falls second only to Islam, and maybe the fact that I’m gay. ” Written from prepared remarks.",0
18021,"A ‘Water Bomb’ of a Storm Kills 21 in Macedonia’s Capital, Skopje - The New York Times","SKOPJE, Macedonia  —   A freakishly violent rainstorm that Macedonia’s top weather official called a “water bomb” ravaged Skopje during the weekend, collapsing streets, inundating vehicles and drowning trapped motorists and homeowners, most of them caught by surprise. At least 21 people were killed and 77 injured in what officials described on Sunday as the worst flooding disaster in a   to hit Skopje, the Macedonian capital and a city of more than a   people in the central part of the Balkan Peninsula. Officials said the death toll could rise because many people were still missing after the storm, which hit with shocking ferocity on Saturday night. The police, army units and firefighters rescued more than 1, 000 people from the raging water that flooded streets, buildings, houses, clinics and schools. Traffic in much of the city was paralyzed. The Gazi Baba area, in the eastern part of Skopje, was particularly hard hit, with hundreds of homes losing power. Underpasses throughout the city became instant lakes, completely submerging vehicles. The National Hydrometeorological Service said it had issued a warning about an impending storm earlier on Saturday, but the intensity of the storm was a shock. “The clouds seem to have stopped immediately and dropped the water on this very small part of Skopje, in what can be described only as a water bomb,” Oliver Romevski, the director of the service, said Sunday. “We are all shaken from this phenomenon and from what it has caused. ” Koce Trajanovski, Skopje’s mayor, who announced financial aid for the families of the dead, said many victims had been caught off guard because the rain started so rapidly on Saturday evening. “Most of the casualties were people returning home from work or travel,” he said. Mr. Romevski said the storm had dumped nearly four inches of rain on the Gazi Baba area, while other parts of Skopje received far less. Heavy rain was also reported in the western Macedonia city of Tetovo. Volunteers established a center in central Skopje on Sunday to accept donations for victims, who needed food, drinking water and hygiene supplies. The government was expected to declare a state of emergency later. But many local residents accused the municipal authorities of an utter lack of preparedness. Mayor Trajanovski rejected the criticism, saying that the storm was a natural catastrophe and that no system could handle such volumes of rainfall in such a short period. Nikola Todorov, the minister of health, said the last such flooding that Skopje residents could recall was in 1962, when more than 5, 000 houses were flooded. Showers and thunderstorms were forecast to hit Skopje again on Sunday evening, and many feared they would exacerbate the crisis. “We don’t expect showers with the same intensity as those from yesterday,” the National Hydrometeorological Service said in a statement. “But we already have quite saturated soil,” it said, and in such situations, “even smaller rainfalls can cause problems. ”",0
18022,2 Credit-Reporting Agencies Must Pay $23 Million for Deceptive Practices - The New York Times,"The nation’s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the   agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23. 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them. The watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine, the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes, they will obtain customers’ consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. “Credit scores are central to a consumer’s financial life, and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,” Richard Cordray, the bureau’s director, said in a statement. Neither TransUnion, which is based in Chicago, nor Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman, David Blumberg, and an Equifax spokeswoman, Ines Gutzmer, said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015, under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general, the   agencies agreed to improve how they fixed mistakes and addressed disputes.",0
18023,E3 Hands-On with ’Agents of Mayhem’: ’Saints Row’ Follow-Up Feels Criminally Underwhelming - Breitbart,"Volition stakes its Seoul on the success of this   successor to the world of Saints Row, but Agents of Mayhem doesn’t leave a great first impression. [Agents of Mayhem takes place in a   Row future, though it’s unclear just how much influence that the purple gangsters of developer Volition’s previous   crime series have had on the “MAYHEM”  . Still, their membership includes both Pierce and the   (and presumably resurrected) Johnny Gat from previous Saints games, so we aren’t straying too far from Volition’s ongoing universe of sandbox mayhem.   After the viral success of Saints Row 4‘s   hijinks, the development team has decided to double down on slapstick anarchy. Agents of Mayhem offers at least ten different playable characters, each with their own skills, strengths, weaknesses, and upgrade paths. Choosing the right three for a given mission, which you can then switch between playing as on the fly, into a futuristic parody of Seoul will be crucial to success. Mission difficulty is extremely scalable, allowing you to balance risk versus reward before you’ve pulled the trigger. On the ground, swapping between said squadmates is instantaneous and allows for powerful combinations of both active and passive abilities. It’s more than choosing the right weapon for the job  —   knowing who is better at disrupting shields, who can punch through armor, and who has a penchant for computer hacking is an important part of deciding who hits the streets. Vehicle gameplay doesn’t look especially impressive or robust, but it remains present. Whether or not it’s worth the time to slip into one of the many vehicles on the streets of Seoul remains to be seen, but Saints Row 4 rendered automotive transportation utterly pointless with its   hijinks so there may not be much reason for concern. Agents of Mayhem recalls nothing so much as an especially crude Saturday morning cartoon, with easily as many   as bullets. Volition’s recent games have always had a sense of humor that can be hit or miss, but the humor is (mostly) endearing. Agents of Mayhem doesn’t stick with me as much as past efforts in the demo I played, but I could see myself growing attached to members of the crew given time. Unfortunately, the game’s promise seems to have stalled after the concept stage. When I sat down to actually play, I found a game that felt like the leftover missions from an   title, with none of the freedom that implies. Though my team was aesthetically different, playing each of them was an exercise in holding down the trigger until the bloated life bars of faceless enemies depleted, and I moved to the next checkpoint. There were hints of progression  —   you can collect vehicles, experience, and shards. But the vehicles felt pointless, and I didn’t have enough time with the game to stretch my legs with some of the advancement. Switching between characters has all the gravity of weapon swapping. On one hand, it wasn’t cumbersome. On the other, it just didn’t seem to matter very much. The game’s visuals were similarly uninspired. Everything is just a little too smooth. Character models are simple, stiffly animated, and overly shiny, making the game feel more like an HD remake of a   title than the heir apparent to a beloved franchise. The animated cutscenes felt more like a storyboard   for real cinematics than something to ship with a finished title. As an ardent fan of the Saints Row franchise, Agents of Mayhem felt criminally underwhelming. Given some time in the open world, with a wider variety of team members and the opportunity to play with the character advancement system, my opinion could change. For now, however, all it did was make me wish for a true successor to the absurdly creative GTA knockoff that inspired it.",0

[Speaking at the Orange County GOP’s annual Flag Day fundraiser on Saturday, Nunes  —   who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  —   sounded off on the importance of receiving support from Republican donors in the region, which is seen as critical in the fight against the Golden State’s Democratic stronghold.  “It is so critical for us to win here and keep winning here,” Nunes, who was the event’s keynote speaker, said, according to the Los Angeles Times. A   Republican California enclave, Orange County is now at risk of turning blue. The 2016 presidential election was the first since 1936 that the county went to a Democrat, Hillary Clinton. In February, the Democrats launched an assault on 20 Republicans whose seats are seen as being at risk during the 2018 midterm elections. Four of those seats are wholly or partially in Orange County, and belong to :Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Ed Royce (  ) Rep. Darrell Issa (  ) Rep. Mimi Walters (  ) and Rep.

18027,NATO Announces Largest Troop Deployments Against Russia Since Cold War      :," NATO Announces Largest Troop Deployments Against Russia Since Cold War By Alex Lantier
November 09, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" WSWS "" - NATO will place hundreds of thousands of troops on alert for military action against Russia in the coming months, top NATO officials told the Times of London on Monday.
The US-led military alliance is planning to speed up the mobilization of forces numbering in the tens of thousands and, ultimately, hundreds of thousands and millions that are to be mobilized against Russia. Beyond its existing 5,000-strong emergency response force, NATO is tripling its incumbent response force to 40,000 and putting hundreds of thousands of troops on higher alert levels.
The Times wrote, Sir Adam West, Britains outgoing permanent representative to NATO, said he thought that the goal was to speed up the response time of up to 300,000 military personnel to about two months. At present a force of this size could take up to 180 days to deploy.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, We are addressing what we call the follow-on forces. There are a large number of people in the armed forces of NATO allies. We are looking into how more of them can be ready on a shorter notice. According to the Times , Stoltenberg explained that NATO is looking broadly at methods for improving the readiness of many of the alliance's three million soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.
The target of these deployments, the largest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union by the Stalinist bureaucracy and the end of the Cold War a quarter century ago, is Russia.
We have seen a more assertive Russia implementing a substantial military build-up of many years, tripling defence spending since 2000 in real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising their forces and using military force against neighbours, Stoltenberg said. We have also seen Russia using propaganda in Europe among NATO allies and that is exactly the reason why NATO is responding. We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War.
These statements show how NATO planning for a horrific war against Russia has continued behind the backs of the people throughout the US presidential election campaign. Military deployments and war preparations by the Pentagon and the general staffs of the various European countries are set to go ahead, moreover, whatever the outcome of the election in the United States and those slated for 2017 in the European NATO countries.
Stoltenberg's vague attack on Russian propaganda in Europe is an allusion to the instinctive opposition to war that exists in the European and international working class and popular distrust of the anti-Russian propaganda promoted by NATO officials like Stoltenberg and West.
Last year, a Pew poll found broad international opposition to NATO participation in a conventional war against Russia in Eastern Europe, even in a scenario that assumes Russia started the conflict. Under these hypothetical conditions, 58 percent of Germans, 53 percent of French people, and 51 percent of Italians opposed any military action against Russia. Opposition to war in the poll would doubtless have been higher had pollsters mentioned that NATO's decision to attack Russian forces in Eastern Europe could lead to nuclear war.
This opposition is rooted in deep disaffection with the imperialist Middle East wars of the post-Soviet period and the memory of two world wars in Europe in the 20th century. The arguments Stoltenberg presented against it are politically fraudulent.
The primary threat of military aggression and war in Europe comes not from Russia, but from the NATO countries. Over the past 25 years, the imperialist powers of NATO have bombed and invaded countries in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Within Europe, they bombed Serbia and Kosovo in the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, pushed NATOs borders hundreds of miles to the East, and backed a violent, fascist-led putsch to topple a pro-Russian government in Ukraine in 2014.
The aggressive character of NATO policy emerged once again last Friday, when NBC News reported that US cyber warfare units had hacked key Russian electricity, Internet and military networks. These are now vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons should the US deem it necessary, NBC stated.
Russian officials denounced the activities highlighted in the report and the Obama White House's silence on the matter. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, If no official reaction from the American administration follows, it would mean state cyber terrorism exists in the US. If the threats of the attack, which were published by the US media, are carried out, Moscow would be justified in charging Washington.
The geo-strategically disastrous consequences of the Stalinist bureaucracy's dissolution of the Soviet Union and restoration of capitalism in Eastern Europe are ever more apparent. With NATO troops or proxy forces stationed in a geographic belt extending from the Baltic republics to Poland, Ukraine and Romaniaeither a short distance from or on Russia's bordersNATO is now poised for a major war against Russia that could escalate into a nuclear conflagration.
An examination of Stoltenbergs remarks shows that NATOs plans are not defensive preparations to counter a sudden conventional invasion of Europe by the Russian army. In such a scenario, Russian tank columns would overrun the few thousand or tens of thousands of troops in NATOs various emergency response forces, depriving the broader ranks of NATO follow-up forces the 60 to 180 days they need to mobilize.
Rather, the plan for mobilizing successive layers of follow-on forces is intended to allow NATO to threaten Russia in a crisis situation by gradually bringing to bear more and more of its collective military strength, which, although split between 28 member states, outweighs that of Russia. Russia's population of 145 million is far smaller than that of the NATO countries, at 906 million.
The aggressive character of NATOs agenda is illustrated by a report issued last month by the CIA-linked Rand Corporation think tank on the military situation in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The small military forces NATO has posted in the Baltic republics, Rand wrote, are inviting a devastating war, rather than deterring it. They calculated that Russian forces, if they actually invaded, could overrun these countries in approximately 60 hours.
On this basis, the think tank called for launching a vast NATO military build-up in the Baltic republics, virtually at the gates of St. Petersburg. It wrote that it would take a force of about seven brigades, including three heavy armored brigadesadequately supported by air power, land-based fires, and other enablers on the ground and ready to fight at the onset of hostilities to prevent the rapid overrun of the Baltic states. This would cost the NATO countries $2.7 billion each year.
As the NATO countries intensify their threats against Russia, there are increasingly bitter conflicts among the NATO imperialist powers themselves. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi bluntly opposed new sanctions on Russia as called for by Washington at last month's European Union summit in Brussels, and there are deepening tensions between Germany and the United States as officials in Berlin and Paris call for an independent EU military.
Prospects of increased US-led military provocations against Russia are sharpening tensions within Europe. In an article titled Whether Clinton or Trump wins, for Germany things will get uncomfortable, German news magazine Der Spiegel warned of the long-term implications of an aggressive US-led policy against Russia, which it assumed would continue regardless which of the two candidates secured the White House.
The magazine wrote, The motto will be: If you want (nuclear) US protection from Putin, you must either pay us more money or re-arm yourself.

18028,Actions by Congress on Opioids Haven’t Included Limiting Them - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Ed White has had a devilish time getting his painkiller prescription filled for intense back pain since a federal crackdown on opioid sales battened down the pharmacy shelves at the Walgreens near his home in Port Richey, Fla. Across the state in Fort Lauderdale, Maureen Kielian just put her son into a residential treatment facility to try to break his   opioid addiction. To suggest that the federal authorities have been too aggressive amid an opioid epidemic killing 29, 000 people a year is absurd, she said. Faced with these competing stories, Congress has whipsawed between ensuring access to narcotic painkillers for people like Mr. White and addressing the addiction epidemic linked to those drugs, one that has become the leading cause of injury death, surpassing motor vehicle fatalities in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For now, Washington appears ready to allow opioid prescriptions to remain widely accessible, a victory for pharmacies, drug makers and, lawmakers say, consumers  —   and instead focus on the treatment of addiction, not its source. The House and the Senate passed bills this spring that would, among other things, bolster prescription drug monitoring and treatment and   programs fund drug disposal efforts and assist states that want to expand the availability of the drug naloxone, which helps reverse overdoses. Even though their differences have yet to be worked out, lawmakers in both chambers are trumpeting those actions, banking on them to bolster their   prospects. More quietly, Congress passed and President Obama signed a very different measure last month that curtailed Drug Enforcement Administration powers to pursue pharmacies and wholesalers that the agency believes have contributed to the epidemic. Mr. White, 67, said the law was crucial. “The crackdown by the D. E. A. has gone too far,” he said. Advocates of a stronger response are incredulous. “I’m shocked that Congress and the president would constrain D. E. A. from taking on corporate drug dealers in the midst of the worst addiction epidemic in U. S. history,” said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and an addiction specialist. “This law allows opioid distributors to reap enormous profits and operate with impunity at the public’s expense. ” Congress’s actions have sought to balance the conflicting demands of   chain pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens and drug distribution companies like Cardinal Health and McKesson with the victims of an epidemic that has ravaged some of the poorest parts of the country  —   but also some of the most politically sensitive, like Ohio and New Hampshire. Chain pharmacies and drug distributors say their businesses have been disrupted and profits hurt by D. E. A. investigators who have ordered immediate closures of pharmacies deemed regional destinations for addicts seeking a fix. “The D. E. A. has employed the same    tactics to take down international drug cartels and other criminals as it does to combat prescription drug abuse,” said John Gray, the president of the Healthcare Distribution Management Association, a trade organization for drug wholesalers. But past and present agency officials complain that they were steamrollered by a powerful lobby. “Under this law, the bad actors simply have to promise to be good, and we won’t take them to court to punish them for what they’ve already done,” said Joseph T. Rannazzisi, who retired in October after 11 years of directing the D. E. A. ’s office of diversion control. “It’s obvious that industry had a very strong hand in crafting this bill. ” To its sponsors, the new law is an uncontroversial clarification of when the right to distribute controlled substances can be suspended or revoked, a matter separate from the opioid addiction fight. It also establishes a process for federal agencies to go through in many cases before distribution centers can be shut down, giving them 30 days to rectify issues as they crop up in an attempt to reduce disruptions to patients. Written by Representatives Tom Marino, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, it passed the House in April by unanimous consent, a month after the Senate approved its version without objection. The Senate measure was equally bipartisan, drafted by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a conservative Republican from Utah, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a liberal Democrat from Rhode Island. “The D. E. A. has a big job,” Mr. Welch said. “I’d like to see them not having to waste their time on protocol issues with distribution centers, because that’s not where the problem exists. ” In a statement, Mr. Marino said, “Until now, clear comprehensive legislation that protected patients’ right to access necessary medication while stopping those who might abuse such drugs did not exist. ” For all the   over a recent rash of opioid abuse bills  —   the House passed 18 measures last week after the Senate’s comprehensive version in March  —   Congress has yet to send a treatment measure to the president. And lawmakers are steeling themselves for the real fight: how to pay for it. The issue has become a surprisingly potent one, with some vulnerable Senate Republicans running for   on their efforts to fight addiction and siding with Democrats in their chamber over House Republicans to make their point. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a sponsor of the Senate bill, said his version was superior to the House’s in two areas: addiction prevention and new sources of funding that do not siphon money from other programs. And because many opioid addicts begin with prescription drugs, he said, Congress needs to approve some restrictions on who can write and fill prescriptions. The “one doctor, one pharmacy” provision in the Senate bill would cut down on doctor shopping and could counter any ill effects of curbing the D. E. A. ’s enforcement power. “That’s really narrowing your choices to people who know you, know what you need,” he said. Trying to strike a balance between access for the needy and restrictions to prevent abuse has bedeviled the fight against the opioid crisis since its beginnings. But as the annual death toll from the epidemic soared, those calling for greater restrictions seemed to have gained the upper hand, with new guidelines from the C. D. C. and greater restrictions on popular narcotics finalized by the Food and Drug Administration. The one law that has been enacted, called Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2016, gives those arguing for greater access to these medications an unlikely lift. “It’s a significant blow to D. E. A. ’s enforcement authority, and that doesn’t make any sense to us,” said Carmen Catizone, the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. As the lead agency in prosecuting a drug war that liberal and conservative politicians see as flawed, the D. E. A. has lost clout. The agency’s growing efforts to combat opioid abuse have also meant clashes with the powerful lobbies of drug makers and pharmacists. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Rannassizi became a symbol of the D. E. A. ’s recalcitrance, particularly after he suggested that lawmakers would be “supporting criminals” if they passed the measure. “This offends me immensely,” Mr. Marino, a former prosecutor, responded to Mr. Rannassizi at a 2014 hearing on an earlier version of the legislation. By passing the law, “Congress is sending the D. E. A. a message,” Mr. Marino said to the agency’s administrator, Michele M. Leonhart. “You should take a serious look at your regulatory culture and seek collaboration with legitimate companies that want to do the right thing. ”",0
18029,Bags of Cocaine Worth $56 Million Are Found at Coca-Cola Factory in France - The New York Times,"Uncovering a   operation with a French connection, workers at a   factory in southern France this week found a huge cache of cocaine worth approximately $56 million in a shipment of orange juice concentrate, according to news reports. The factory, which is in the town of Signes, near the Mediterranean coast, produces concentrates for various drinks. A spokesman for   France said that employees notified the police and that the authorities had started an investigation, The Associated Press reported. The drug was hidden in bags among a delivery of orange juice concentrate and amounted to 370 kilograms, making it one of the largest such discoveries on French soil, the BBC reported.

18030,Clinton Suggested US Should Rig a Foreign Election — But Don't Expect the Media to Care - Danielle Ryan,"Citizen journalism with a punch Clinton Suggested US Should Rig a Foreign Election — But Don't Expect the Media to Care Originally appeared at RT 
Hillary Clinton has spent a disproportionate amount of time lately complaining — without evidence — about “the Russians” interfering with the US election. But it turns out that interfering in foreign elections is totally fine if you’re the United States. 
Clinton has used this notion of Russian interference as a non-stop talking point throughout her campaign. Any and all scandals she has faced have been blamed on Moscow, and she has used alleged Russian involvement as a convenient distraction. Her supporters have enthusiastically adopted the talking point. In light of the FBI’s decision to reopen the investigation into her use of a private email server, one congressman actually suggested that Russia may be behind the FBI’s decision. Yes, Russia has now infiltrated the FBI, which is working with Vladimir Putin to elect Trump and destroy Hillary. It’s all a massive conspiracy. 
So, you would think given her apparent distaste for other countries supposedly meddling in the American electoral process, that Clinton wouldn’t have been caught on tape suggesting very candidly to a group of journalists that the US should have rigged a foreign election. 
But she was. The tape is from a 2006 meeting Clinton held with the editorial board of the Jewish Press when she was running for re-election as senator for New York. Here is the quote in full, so there can be no accusations of taking it out of context: 
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake — and if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” 
That’s right. Clinton suggested the US should have made sure the outcome of a Palestinian election went in its favor. She was referring to the 2006 election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council, which saw the US-favored Fatah lose to Hamas (45 seats to 74 seats). 
This is one of those stories that will be largely ignored or played down by the American media, which favor Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, and see it as their duty to get her elected. If Trump had made the same remarks, we would never hear the end of it. No doubt, some will try to water down the comment and imply that Clinton didn’t really mean what she said. But there is frankly no other way to interpret her words. This is Hillary Clinton casually suggesting that the US should have rigged a foreign election in its favor. 
How else can you “determine” the outcome of an election before it happens? How else can you be “sure” who is going to win in advance? All the polling data in the world could end up being wrong — so unless you do something unsavory to fully ensure the outcome, then there’s no way you can be “sure” of anything. But don’t hold your breath waiting for journalists to push Clinton on what exactly she had in mind when she said the US should have done “something” about it. 
Eli Chomsky, the journalist that released the tape, told the Observer that in the 2006 meeting with Clinton, he was surprised that “anyone could support the idea — offered by a national political leader, no less — that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” Chomsky’s bosses at the Jewish Press at the time felt the comments were not “newsworthy,” and so they weren’t published. In reality, he admitted, they simply didn’t want to offend Clinton should they need her “down the road.” Convinced it was in fact newsworthy, Chomsky held on to the tape for 10 years. 
Clinton’s casual suggestion to influence an election in the US’ favor takes on more significance in light of the revelations that her campaign was working with the ‘neutral’ Democratic National Committee (DNC) to ensure she won the presidential nomination over Bernie Sanders. 
Strangely enough, as the Observer also noted, in answering a question about the US talking to its enemies, the Clinton of 2006 sounded more like the Donald Trump of 2016. Asked if it was “worth talking to Syria,” she said that she didn’t see how it could hurt to talk to your adversaries, citing the fact that the US and the Soviet Union never stopped talking to each other. She continued: “But if you say, ‘they’re evil, we’re good, [and] we’re never dealing with them,’ I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them…” 
This is particularly odd because Clinton in recent years has been one of the biggest cheerleaders of the ‘Russia is evil and America is good’ ideology. But again, don’t expect Clinton to be questioned rigorously on any of this. American journalists only have 10 days left to get her elected. They’re not going to bother worrying about irrelevancies like the fact that she’s evidently totally fine with foreign election rigging. 
You really couldn’t make this stuff up. Clinton spends months pretending to be outraged over Russia interfering in the US election (with no solid evidence), and then audio emerges of her unequivocally suggesting Washington should have rigged a Palestinian election. The level of hypocrisy and irony here is hard to fathom. 
No doubt, one person who will enthusiastically pick the story up is Clinton’s opponent Donald Trump, who has been suggesting for months that she will somehow manage to rig the presidential election against him. 
Clinton herself will probably find a way to pin the release of the tape on the Russians.",0
18031,2 of a Farmer’s 3 Children Overdosed. What of the Third — and the Land? - The New York Times,"BLANCHESTER, Ohio  —   A life of farming taught Roger Winemiller plenty about harsh twists of fate: hailstorms and drought, ragweed infestations and jittery crop prices. He hadn’t bargained on heroin. Then, in March 2016, Mr. Winemiller’s daughter, Heather Himes, 31, died of an opioid overdose at the family farmhouse, inside a   bathroom overlooking fields of corn and soybeans. Mr. Winemiller was the one who unlocked the bathroom door and found her slumped over, a syringe by her side. Nine months later, Mr. Winemiller’s older son, Eugene, 37, who once drove trucks and tractors on the family’s   farm, overdosed at his mother’s home. Family members and medics had been able to revive him after earlier overdoses. Not this one. Overdoses are churning through agricultural pockets of America like a plow through soil, tearing at rural communities and posing a new threat to the generational ties of families like the Winemillers. Farm bureaus’ attention to seed, fertilizer and subsidies has been diverted to discussions of overdoses.   heroin support groups are popping up in rural towns where clinics and drug treatment centers are an hour’s drive away, and broaching public conversations about addiction and death that   neighbors and even some families of the dead would prefer to keep out of view. And at the end of a long gravel driveway, Mr. Winemiller, 60, has been thinking about the uncertain seasons ahead. His last surviving son, Roger T. Winemiller, 35, spent years using prescription pain pills, heroin and methamphetamines, and was jailed for a year on drug charges. He is now in treatment and living with his father. The son dreams of taking over the farm someday. The father is wary. “Would I like to have one of my kids working the farm, side by side, carrying my load when I can’t?” Mr. Winemiller said. “Yes. But I’m a realist. ” Mr. Winemiller and a cousin inherited the farm in 1993 when an uncle died, and they own and run the business together. His surviving son has not used drugs for two months and says he is committed to recovery. But Mr. Winemiller says his first priority is “to keep the land intact. ” He worries about what could happen to the business if he turned over his share of the farm and his son relapsed  —   or worse  —   a year or a decade down the line. He also keeps a pouch of   nasal spray in the living room now, just in case. The Winemillers live on the eastern edge of Clermont County, about an hour east of Cincinnati, where a suburban quilt of bedroom towns, office parks and small industry thins into woods and farmland, mostly for corn and soybeans. Apple orchards and pumpkin farms  —   now closed for the season  —   are tucked among clusters of small churches, small businesses and even smaller   brick houses. Every so often, the roads wind past the gates of a big new mansion or   subdivision being built in the woods. Jobs have returned to the area since the recession, and manufacturing businesses are popping up along the freeway that circles Cincinnati. The county’s unemployment rate is only 4. 1 percent, and every morning, the   lanes of skinny country roads are packed with people heading to work. But the economic resilience has done little to insulate the area from a cascade of cheap heroin and synthetic opiates like fentanyl and carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer, which have sent overdose rates soaring across much of the country, but especially in rural areas like this one. Drug overdoses here have nearly tripled since 1999, and the state as a whole has been ravaged. In Ohio, 2, 106 people died of opioid overdoses in 2014, more than in any other state, according to an analysis of the most recent federal data by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In rural Wayne Township, where the Winemillers and about 4, 900 other people live, the local fire department answered 18 overdose calls last year. Firefighters answered three in one week this winter, and said the spikes and lulls in their overdose calls gave them a feel for when particularly noxious batches of drugs were brought out to the countryside from Cincinnati or Dayton. They get overdose calls for people living inside the Edenton Rural School, a shuttered brick schoolhouse where officers have cleared away signs of meth production and found the flotsam of drug use on the floors. “I don’t think we’re winning the battle,” said David Moulden, the fire chief. “It gives you a hopelessness. ” Mr. Moulden is a good friend of Mr. Winemiller’s and responded to the 911 calls last March, then again last December, when Heather and Eugene died of overdoses. He was also on the call 10 days before Eugene’s death, when medics revived him using a dose of naloxone, which blocks the brain’s opiate receptors. “Sooner or later, you know they’re going to be found too late,” Mr. Moulden said. It was a rainy Wednesday, 9 a. m. Time for the   drive to take the younger Roger to the probation office, then a   more to take him to his drug treatment clinic. The men sank into the leather seats of Mr. Winemiller’s Chevy Tahoe and skimmed along the wet roads. The younger Roger’s driver’s license had been revoked, so this was now the routine. And, experts say, it is part of what makes addiction treatment so complicated in rural areas: Counseling centers and doctors who can prescribe   medications are often an hour’s drive away, in communities with little public transportation. “Even if you realize you’ve got a problem and are interested in seeking treatment, the treatment centers have not been there, the professionals have not been there,” said Tom Vilsack, the Agriculture Department secretary under President Barack Obama. Last year, he led an administration effort to grapple with rural opioid use. “You don’t have access to A. A. meetings seven days a week,” he said. “You’re lucky if you’ve got one a week, or you’ve got to drive 25 miles to get to one. ” Spring was coming, and Mr. Winemiller would soon be receiving the seeds for the year’s soybean crop. His days were looser now, but soon he would be leaving the house at 5 or 6 a. m. and returning at 11 p. m. “Once I get busy in the field, I ain’t going to have time for this stuff,” he said. “Hopefully I get my license back,” the younger Mr. Winemiller said. “If not, I’ll have to find a way up there. ” He added, a bit ruefully, “Set you up for failure. ” The younger Mr. Winemiller said that being back in the farmhouse had helped save his life by yanking him away from old patterns and temptations. He started working on the farm when he was 12, driving tractors even though his father had to attach pieces of wood to the pedals so his legs would reach. “I want to get back to it. That’s the whole idea,” he said. “It’s in my blood. It’s the family name. I’ve done enough to disgrace our name. I want to do everything I can to mend it. ” Death has pulled the men closer, but at home, arguments erupt over whether each understands what the other is going through. The son says he is grieving just as much as his father. The father says he is in recovery just as much as his son. Quietly, apart from his son, Mr. Winemiller worries about leaving him alone in the farmhouse when his   days in the fields resume. “I hate to say this, but because of his past, I don’t trust him,” he said. They pulled into the Clinton County Adult Probation offices for the son’s   drug test, then set out again for the drive to a new treatment center where he gets counseling and doses of buprenorphine, which can help addicts stay off opioids by keeping them from experiencing cravings and withdrawal. The son was starting to feel anxious and queasy. He cracked open the car window. “I’m going to get carsick,” he said. “I’ve got to take my medicine soon. ” He slipped one of the tiny strips into his mouth. Better. Their conversation curled like a river as they drove. Mr. Winemiller was concerned about the low prices of crops like soybeans and corn. His son talked about an intervention the two of them had staged just down the road a few nights earlier  —   talking about their own losses and the younger Roger’s treatment  —   after a    neighbor overdosed at his family’s home. The younger man pointed at the red sign of a budget motel: “I used to buy drugs there. ” He said he had bought from dealers who drove out to the countryside for a day and set up “trap houses” in trailers or apartments where they would sell to all comers. He and his father talked about motorbikes, weather and politics. The elder Mr. Winemiller, who was among the 68 percent of voters in the county who supported Donald J. Trump for president, was rankled by scenes of political protest on the news. He saw only disorder and lawlessness. “There are too many people who are too wrapped up in their lives. All they want to do is go out, bitch and complain,” he said. “My view on Donald Trump, he’s what this country needed years ago: someone that’s  . ” He likes the toughness. After his son and daughter died, he began meeting with sheriffs and politicians at forums dedicated to the opioid crisis, urging harsher penalties, such as manslaughter charges for people who sell fatal hits of opioids. As they drove, from the probation office to McDonald’s for breakfast, from Blanchester to Wilmington to Xenia, the men talked less about the past and the grief that shadows their days. The three siblings grew up in the countryside and went straight to work after high school. Each had yearslong drug problems, cycling through stretches of using and sobriety. The younger Mr. Winemiller said he and Eugene had been best friends who shared everything, drug habits included. They drank and smoked pot in high school and used methamphetamines, painkillers after operations and injuries, and ultimately heroin. “We all partied together,” he said. The older Mr. Winemiller said his daughter’s drug use was rooted in anxieties, stresses and an academic and social tailspin that began in high school. She had been in recovery for about three years when she began to use again early last year, he said. She came to stay at the farmhouse on March 26, a day after three acquaintances of hers were arrested on heroin charges at a motel in the nearby town of Hillsboro. He said he went to the garage to get her a Coke, she excused herself to the bathroom, and he was overcome by a terrible dread when he sat back down in the living room. “I knocked on the door, and there was no answer,” he said. At her funeral, the younger Mr. Winemiller said, the two brothers stood by the coffin, “telling each other how we had to make it for our parents. ” Paul Casteel, the senior minister at the Blanchester Church of Christ, conducted the services at Eugene Winemiller’s funeral. The next day, he led another funeral for another man who had died of an overdose. People live here because they like knowing their neighbors and raising their children close to extended families, Mr. Casteel said. But heroin has turned that   closeness on its head. “When somebody ends up into drugs, you’re going to know them,” he said. “You know everybody. To be honest, I wanted to stay out of it, just concentrate on the church. But we just kept getting hit. ” By early afternoon, the father and son, done with their appointments, climbed into the Tahoe and headed home down State Route 380. They smoked and listened to contemporary country play softly on the radio, and made plans for their next trip to the probation office in two days’ time.",0
18032,Iran’s Zarif to hold talks with Russia’s Lavrov on Syria in Moscow,"Politics Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (Photo by AP) 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will pay an official one-day visit to Russia for talks on the Syrian crisis. 
Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Wednesday that the top diplomat is due in Moscow on Friday. 
He said that Zarif is scheduled to attend a trilateral meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem on regional developments, including the conflict in Syria. 
According to Qassemi, Zarif will also hold a separate meeting with Lavrov to discuss Tehran-Moscow relations. 
Meanwhile, Russia's RIA news agency, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry, reported that Zarif and Lavrov will also discuss the situation in Iraq. 
Muallem's scheduled visit on Friday had earlier been announced by the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
Iran and Russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in Syria. Moscow and Tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the war-hit country, stressing that only the Syrians are entitled to decide their own fate. 
Iran has been providing military advisory assistance to the Syrian government in its campaign against terrorism. 
Russia has also been carrying out airstrikes against terrorists' positions in Syria since September last year at the official request of the Damascus government. 
Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Over 400,000 people have so far been killed in the conflict, according to estimates by UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura . 
In neighboring Iraq, the Arab country’s army is also pressing ahead with a massive operation aimed at recapturing Mosul from Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who captured the strategic city in June 2014. 
The army has been liberating more areas aroundMosul, with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command announcing that counter-terrorism units were only two kilometers away from the city. Loading ...",0
18033,How to Stay Comfortable on a Long Flight - The New York Times,"There’s nothing like a   flight to get you over a fear of flying. At least that was the case for me after my first trip to South Africa to visit the family of the woman who eventually became my wife. At 28, I was still pretty new to flying, and spending the better part of an entire day trapped in an airborne steel tube was just what I needed to stop worrying and learn to love the miracle of air travel. O. K. the truth is, I still don’t love to fly. But after that first marathon ride from New York to Johannesburg, which is among the longest   flights in existence, my focus has at least shifted from how to survive to how to make the long haul as painless as possible. The simplest way to guarantee a decent meal and some legroom is to upgrade to first class, but if you don’t have the luxury of spending a few hundred extra for premium seats, all is not lost. “Most air carriers configure their   economy cabins with slightly more legroom and added amenities,” said  Patrick Smith, a pilot who is author of “Cockpit Confidential: Everything You Need to Know About Air Travel. ” These amenities typically include free access to entertainment consoles, meals and alcoholic beverages. In other words, airlines are not completely evil, and are less likely to    you during   flights. That also applies to legroom. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of leg space available in economy class during my first long haul to South Africa. But this does vary by airline. South African Airways has roomier seats (by one to two inches) on its nonstop flight from New York to Johannesburg than any other airline that flies between those two cities, according to Routehappy. com, a useful site that allows you to compare amenities before booking. Consider Seatguru. com when trying to find the most comfortable seat. But these freebies and a little extra legroom will get you only so far. A smartly packed   bag is essential. “A big mistake is expecting the flight attendants to take care of everything for you,” said Kara Mulder, a flight attendant who chronicles her   experiences on her blog, The Flight Attendant Life.  Ms. Mulder recommends taking your own water, a sweatshirt and socks to keep you warm (I never fly without my hoodie) and some of your favorite healthy snacks. “Don’t just eat the free food the flight attendants serve because it’s there,” Ms. Mulder said. “Your body will respond differently to different foods when at altitude. ” Dry oatmeal and dried fruit are favorites of Ms. Mulder. I’ve found trail mix and protein and granola bars to be safe and sustainable options. I’ve also learned not to be shy. If you napped your way through mealtime or did not pack enough water, take a walk to where the flight attendants are and ask for what you need. You still have 13 hours to go. Nothing puts a damper on a vacation like a blood clot in the knee. Studies have found that   travel increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, and that height is an additional risk factor, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s still a rare condition, but the C. D. C. recommends “ambulation,” which is a fancy word for walking and thigh exercises, and suggests aisle seats for those who are particularly tall. Even if you’re not concerned about a blood clot, walking and stretching will make you less miserable in general, and there is plenty you can do without even leaving your seat. How about a little yoga at 39, 000 feet? “When it comes to a physical release, the yoga exercises help right away,” said Kajuan Douglas, a yoga instructor in New York City. “ You feel the physical stretch, and it’s like you have just awakened from sleep. ” You do not have to be a yogi to benefit from these stretches. The simplest ones can bring instant satisfaction. For beginners, Mr. Douglas recommends the “Locust Bind” stretch, which involves interlacing your fingers behind your back and drawing your shoulder blades toward each other, and “seated twisting,” placing your hand on your opposite knee or thigh and twisting from the upper back. It may seem hard to do when the toddler behind you is kicking your seat or your neighbor is snoring. “To help overcome these difficulties, I bring more awareness to my breath or add a simple mantra,” Mr. Douglas said. “Simply recite ‘inhale let, exhale go’ ” mentally as you breathe. ” If there is a silver lining to having 16 hours to kill, it’s that you can at least get something accomplished like work or reading that novel you’ve yet to make a dent in. But it’s not as easy as it sounds, especially if you do not plan ahead. You may be distracted by turbulence or the drink cart rolling by, and that first gin and tonic leads to another. Before you know it, you’re poking at the entertainment console and pondering which Adam Sandler movie you haven’t already seen 10 times. “I’m an author and blogger who writes about air travel,” Mr. Smith said, “but I find it almost impossible to get anything done, even with my subject matter all around me. ” Compartmentalizing your time is the way to go, and can make the flight feel much shorter. “Devote blocks of time to certain tasks,” Mr. Smith said. “Pick out a couple of movies to watch that’s three or four hours right there. Spend a couple of hours reading, then a couple of hours napping if you can, and so on. ” If you are intent on getting work done, you could try something like the Pomodoro Technique, which divides work into   intervals and separates them by short breaks. “I can be on a   flight and not watch one movie from the plane’s   entertainment system sometimes, simply because I planned out my tasks and airplane relax time so well,” Ms. Mulder said. “Those are good flights. ” That still feels like an oxymoron to folks like me but less so these days.",0
18034,Israel Says It Will Rein In ‘Footprint’ of West Bank Settlements - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   A day after approving the construction of a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years, Israel announced a new, if ambiguous, settlement policy on Friday “out of consideration for the positions of President Trump” and, it said, to enable progress in the peace process with Palestinians. Israel said it was taking steps to “significantly rein in the footprint” of the settlements, allowing construction within all its existing settlements in the occupied West Bank but limiting, “wherever possible,” their expansion into new territory. How the new policy might translate on the ground was largely left open to interpretation. The Palestinians, like most of the rest of the world, oppose any Israeli construction in the occupied territories. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinians’ chief negotiator, furiously rejected the Israeli settlement policy. “All Israeli settlements are illegal,’’ he said, “and we are not going to accept any formula that aims at legitimizing the presence of Israeli colonies on occupied Palestinian land. ” Mr. Trump has called for curbs in settlement construction as part of an ambitious push to revive   talks to end the   conflict. In an interview published in February in the Hebrew edition of Israel Hayom, a newspaper considered supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump said he wanted Israel “to act reasonably,” after a series of Israeli moves to approve thousands of housing units for new settlers. “There is limited remaining territory,” Mr. Trump added. “Every time you take land for a settlement, less territory remains. ” Days later, during a meeting between the two leaders at the White House, Mr. Trump made a public request to hold off on settlements. But on Friday, the White House gave no signal that it was troubled by Israel’s latest settlement move. At a White House briefing on Friday, officials said they did not want to discuss the settlement question and did not anticipate that it would be a focal point of discussions over the next week. That was despite the fact that on Friday the administration was preparing for separate visits by President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt and King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House next week  —   both leaders of countries often affected by tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. While Mr. Sisi has not yet made Israeli policy toward the Palestinians a major concern, King Abdullah faces a more delicate domestic situation where assertive Israeli actions often generate protests. Worried about a public backlash, King Abdullah raced to Washington shortly after Mr. Trump took office to buttonhole the new president at a prayer breakfast and implore him not to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, as he had promised on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump has obliged and delayed any embassy move while he reconsiders the matter. Since then, Jerusalem and Washington have negotiated to try to reach an understanding on slowing or curbing settlement construction. During the Obama administration, Israel’s settlement activity was the source of constant friction. Secretary of State John Kerry harshly rebuked Israel in December while vigorously defending a United States decision to abstain from a United Nations vote condemning Israel on the settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. But Israel’s latest policy announcement was likely to have been coordinated with the White House. Since the February meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, American and Israeli officials have been working to reach a more formal understanding on slowing or curbing settlement construction. And there appears to be some understanding that Mr. Netanyahu would be allowed to fulfill his earlier promise to compensate 40 families evicted from the illegal hilltop outpost of Amona by building them a new community. Mr. Netanyahu has been walking a fine line between the new Trump administration, with which he wants to remain on good terms, and the right wing of his governing coalition, which has been pressuring him to increase construction and, in particular, to reject any freeze on building in certain areas. The   ministers were silent on Friday. The Yesha Council, the umbrella body representing the roughly 400, 000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, expressed cautious optimism but, reflecting the ambiguity of the new policy, said it would be monitoring the Israeli government closely to see if new building plans came to fruition. Most of the world considers Israeli settlement activity in the territories captured from Jordan in 1967 to be a violation of international law. Israel considers the territories disputed and says the fate of the settlements must be decided in peace talks. Most informal peace plans have envisaged border adjustments that would allow Israel to retain some of the major settlement blocs, especially those close to the 1967 boundaries, under any permanent agreement with the Palestinians, in return for land swaps. The new policy announced on Friday made no explicit distinction between the blocs and the outlying settlements, in deference to the settlement advocates. It said that Israel would continue construction, where possible, within already developed areas of the settlements, and where that was not possible, would build adjacent to the last line of construction. In cases where legal, security or topographical constraints made those scenarios impossible, new construction would be kept as close as possible to the existing   areas. The boundaries of jurisdiction of some of the settlements are expansive, extending well beyond the   areas. The new policy seems aimed at preventing the construction of new neighborhoods far away from existing buildings, long a settler tactic aimed at controlling larger swaths of West Bank land. But the new Israeli formula left the government much room for maneuver. While it might limit the territorial expansion of the settlements, it could also encourage an increase in the settler population by, for example, filling in available spaces with   construction and by building more homes closer to existing amenities. “When you build neighborhoods adjacent to the   area it encourages people to come,” said Shaul Arieli, an Israeli expert on political geography who prepared maps for past negotiations with the Palestinians and supports a   solution. “They become part of the settlement and have access to its services. ” More settlers outside the settlement blocs would clearly make any eventual Israeli evacuation more difficult. But Mr. Arieli said that for supporters of the   solution there were also advantages in the new policy, especially if new construction was mostly concentrated within the blocs, making them denser rather than spreading over a larger geographical area. “The question,” he said, “is where they will build. ” Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy group that opposes and monitors settlement construction, said the definition of “inside a settlement” could be quite flexible in the eyes of the settlers and the Israeli government, with “settlers looking to exploit the loopholes” in order to expand. “It is this argument over lines,” the group said in a statement, “that has led past U. S. administrations into the trap of seemingly endless and irresolvable negotiations over how to decide what it means to build ‘inside’ settlements. ” Under the pretense of restraint, and while trying to fool the international community, it said, the “Israeli government has drafted a policy that will allow it to continue and expand settlements without any limitations. ”",0
18035,Hunting ‘Turr’ in Newfoundland’s Frigid Waters - The New York Times,"BONAVISTA, Newfoundland  —   Shannon Mouland steadied himself in an aluminum boat, shotgun raised, as a   murre skittered above the   waters of the North Atlantic. Boom! And the bird cartwheeled into the sea. It’s “turr” season on The Rock, as this massive inkblot of an island is affectionately known. Turr is the local name for the murre, which looks something like a diminutive, flying penguin, and men in boats are blasting away at it in the only legal,   hunt of migratory seabirds in North America. The pastime harks back to the days when Newfoundlanders supplemented meager winter diets with fresh meat on the wing, eating everything from clownish puffins to the great northern gannet. Conservation efforts gradually put most of the island’s estimated 350 seabird species off limits. But the taste for turr was so entrenched that allowing the hunt to continue became a precondition for Newfoundland to join Canada in 1949. “Our fathers would come back with the boats piled high with turr,” Mr. Mouland recalled, gripping a green rope to steady himself as the boat hammered over the steely waves. Here along Newfoundland’s treeless,   coast, hardy men (and some women) rise before dawn and motor their boats out into the open sea in search of the birds that come to feed on small forage fish. They are remarkable animals, spending most of their lives on the ocean and visiting land only to pack tightly together on the rocky cliffs of northeastern Canada and Greenland for a few months each summer while the females lay their one speckled blue egg. The eggs are pointed on one end so that they roll like a top in a tight circle, preventing them from falling off cliff ledges and into the sea. The murres’ short wings act as flippers underwater, allowing them to swim nimbly and swiftly in search of fish. They are the   flying birds in the world, capable of plummeting as deep as 600 feet in little more than a minute. But those wings make them less agile in the air and slow to take off from the water, leaving them an easy target for hunters. “Turr!” Mr. Mouland shouted, pointing to his left, and Jerry Hussey, clad in a forest green slicker and matching overalls, swung the boat toward a small    bird bobbing in the waves 100 feet away. Boom, again. Mr. Mouland picked the bird out of the water and whacked its head against the gunwale to ensure that it was dead. Before long, a plastic bin in the boat was lined with the birds, their snowy white breasts and sleek   heads flecked with blood. The Canadian Wildlife Service estimates that about 100, 000 murres are killed in the hunt each year. But the common murre population in Canada has increased over the past 15 years, while the   murre population remains stable. There are millions more murres elsewhere, making the genus one of the Artic’s most abundant seabirds. But as the hunt intensifies, many people are beginning to ask whether the annual cull needs better regulation. “Just because we don’t have evidence of the population decreasing doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have strong conservation rules,” said Bill Montevecchi, an ornithologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. He supports the hunt but believes existing rules should be enforced more seriously. In the old days, men hunted murres in rowboats with   shotguns, sending their dogs into the frigid water to fetch the fallen prey. Now, many hunters have   boats that cut through sea ice, and   outboard engines that can move boats faster than the birds. While regulations prohibit guns from being loaded with more than three shells at a time, most hunters these days use   or semiautomatic shotguns that can fire those rounds in seconds. The murre hunt has a long tradition in Newfoundland, where seabirds, from great auks to eiders, provided sailors with   protein after the long voyage from Europe. Eating seabirds and seals later sustained coastal populations through Newfoundland’s long, frozen winters. Murres and eiders were the most available sources of winter protein until the 1960s, when electricity and refrigeration changed eating habits. Before then, some families consumed as many as 400 birds a year. When Newfoundland became a province, it fell under the Migratory Bird Treaty between the United States and Canada, which would have outlawed the hunt if the two countries had not agreed to let it continue. The treaty was finally amended in the 1990s to specifically grant Newfoundland residents the right to hunt murres. Under the treaty, hunters must buy permits, and Canada’s environmental protection agency carved Newfoundland into four zones with progressively later murre hunting seasons that run from September to March. The regulations set a   limit on what each hunter can kill in a day, and a   limit on how many a hunter can possess at one time. But enforcement is lax, and abuses are common. Discarded carcasses reported around Newfoundland suggest that some hunters are killing more than the law allows or than they can consume. The most   hunters now follow the season from zone to zone with their boats on trailers. It is not uncommon for there to be more than 100 boats chasing murres off Newfoundland’s narrow bays, the boom of shotguns ricocheting over the water. Newfoundlanders are well aware of the dangers of overexploitation. A mariner, Sir Richard Whitbourne, wrote in 1622 that great auks, a flightless relative of the murre, were found in “infinite abundance” along the Newfoundland coast. But by the   century, the birds had been clubbed to extinction, their feathers used to stuff mattresses. The less numerous Labrador duck and Eskimo curlew suffered the same fate. Some people worry that murres may become vulnerable as global warming and overfishing deplete their food supply. Hundreds of thousands of murres died of apparent starvation in the northeastern Pacific Ocean earlier this year, the largest recorded   of the species. Some murre colonies in Greenland, where hunters are allowed to target nesting birds, were wiped out decades ago and show no signs of recovering. Without stricter regulations to prevent overhunting, critics warn, a sudden environmental shock could send Newfoundland’s murre population plummeting. That frustrates Mr. Mouland and his friends, who say they are already fenced in by too many rules. They cannot, for example, catch two species of fish in one boat, even if they have a license for each. “There’s food in your front yard, but you’re not allowed to take it,” Mr. Hussey said. Still, there is a sense of resignation that more rules are coming. “The law’s going to get stricter,” muttered Darren Abbot, painstakingly plucking pinfeathers from one of the dead birds in Mr. Mouland’s work shed. “They claim turrs are getting a little bit scarce. ” Mike Fleming, preparing a bowl of stuffing, responded with an expletive. “Some years they don’t migrate this way, but this year is a phenomenal year,” he said, his hands mixing   bread, chopped onions and a sprinkling of savory, Newfoundland’s most popular herb. The men fell into a spirited discussion about bureaucrats who make rules from offices far away without having ever spent time on the ocean. “They don’t like any hunt, but they like their Kentucky fried,” Mr. Fleming said, adding that he thought it was more humane for a murre to live its life in the wild and be shot than for a chicken to live its life in a tiny cage and be slaughtered. Mr. Hussey said his family ate what he had killed or caught five nights a week. Murre is on the table once or twice a month. As the men bantered among themselves, the conversation became increasingly unintelligible to an outsider: Newfoundland’s rural accent is a thick stew of Irish and West Country English inflection, with a dash of Gaelic and French, that has bubbled together during a couple of hundred years of isolation. Mr. Mouland put the birds in the oven, and the men turned to filleting the day’s catch of cod. Though the stuffed birds weigh only about two pounds each, they take two or three hours of roasting before they are tender. One local joke is that you put a turr and a rock into a pot, and when the rock is soft, you know the turr is done. Eventually, Mr. Mouland appeared back in the shed with the “scoff o’ turr,” as a meal of the bird is called here. The men dug in unceremoniously, slicing and forking and salting big bites until there was little left of two birds but bones and a bit of gravy. The meat is dark and oily and has a fishy aftertaste that divides fans from foes along fairly stark lines. But the rich protein is full of vitamin E and   fatty acids concentrated from the birds’ steady diet of fish. It’s no wonder that it became a principal part of the winter regimen. Mr. Fleming recounted an old joke about a man who complains that the turr is tough. The retort: “It’d be a lot tougher if there was nothing to eat!”",0
18036,3 Who Studied Unusual States of Matter Win Nobel Prize in Physics - The New York Times,"Three physicists born in Britain but now working in the United States were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states, including superconductors, superfluids and thin magnetic films. David J. Thouless of the University of Washington was awarded half of the prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $930, 000, while F. Duncan M. Haldane of Princeton University and J. Michael Kosterlitz of Brown University shared the other half. The scientists relied on advanced mathematical models to study “theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter,” in the words of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Their studies may have major applications in electronics, materials science and computing. In an email, Michael S. Turner, a physicist at the University of Chicago, described the work as “truly transformational, with   consequences both practical and fundamental. ” The three laureates sought to understand matter that is so cold or so thin that weird quantum effects overpower the random atomic jostling that dominates ordinary existence. Superconductivity, in which all electrical resistance vanishes in matter, is one example of such an effect. Dr. Thouless and Dr. Kosterlitz worked together at the University of Birmingham in the 1970s to investigate what happens when   films of matter shift from one exotic phase, like superconductivity, to another. The key to their success was something called topology, a branch of mathematics focused on the fundamental shapes of things. At the Nobel news conference in Stockholm, Thors Hans Hansson, a member of the Nobel physics committee, tried to illustrate topology by holding up a cinnamon bun, a bagel and a pretzel. To a topologist, he said, the only difference between them is the number of holes, as opposed to the characteristics an average person might notice, like saltiness or sweetness. There is no such thing as half a hole, the topologist would note, and the number of holes only changes stepwise in integers. Likewise, the macroscopic properties of exotic matter change in stepwise “quantum leaps” if the materials involved are thin or small enough that their behavior is determined by the strange rules that govern the behavior of atoms. An example is the quantum Hall effect, in which the electrical resistance of a thin film changes in stepwise fashion. In 1983, Dr. Thouless was able to link these changes mathematically to the   Chern numbers  —   after the mathematician   Chern  —   that characterize topological shapes. Dr. Haldane used a similar technique to analyze the properties of chains of atoms so skinny that they could be considered   threads. Someday, they may be the basis of a new kind of computer. In the last decade, this work has led to the development of materials called topological insulators, which conduct electricity on their surfaces but not inside. “They have ignited a firestorm of research, and although applications are still yet to come, I believe it’s only a matter of time before their research leads to advances as unimaginable to us now as lasers and computer chips were a hundred years ago,” said Laura H. Greene,   of the American Physical Society. Dr. Thouless, 82, was born in Bearsden, Scotland, was an undergraduate at Cambridge University and received a Ph. D. in 1958 from Cornell. From 1965 to 1978, he taught mathematical physics at the University of Birmingham in England, where he collaborated with Dr. Kosterlitz. In 1980, he joined the University of Washington in Seattle, where he is now an emeritus professor. Dr. Haldane, 65, was born in London. He received his Ph. D. from Cambridge, where he was also an undergraduate, in 1978. He worked at the Institut   in Grenoble, France the University of Southern California Bell Laboratories and the University of California, San Diego, before joining the Princeton faculty in 1990. Dr. Kosterlitz, 73, was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and received his doctorate in   physics from Oxford University in 1969. He has worked at the University of Birmingham the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Turin, Italy and Cornell, Princeton, Bell Laboratories and Harvard. “I was very surprised and very gratified,” Dr. Haldane, whom the Nobel committee reached by phone Tuesday morning, told reporters at the news conference in Stockholm. “The work was a long time ago, but it’s only now that a lot of tremendous new discoveries are based on this original work and have extended it. ” Dr. Kosterlitz told The Associated Press that he had gotten the news while heading to lunch in Helsinki, Finland, where he is a visiting professor at Aalto University. “I’m a little bit dazzled,” he said. “I’m still trying to take it in. ” He said that he was in his 20s when he began studying   materials and that his “complete ignorance” was an advantage in challenging the established science. “I didn’t have any preconceived ideas,” he said. “I was young and stupid enough to take it on. ” Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for “ . ” Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald were named   last year for discovering that the enigmatic subatomic particles known as neutrinos have mass. Four more will be awarded in the coming days: ■ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be announced on Wednesday in Sweden. Read about last year’s winners, Tomas Lindahl, Paul L. Modrich and Aziz Sancar. ■ The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Norway.

18037,We Need a Miracle on 34th Street - The New York Times,"It was the week before Thanksgiving when Dante Ferretti had his first holiday nightmare. Waking in a panic in his bed at the Lowell hotel, the   Italian production designer and art director was certain his latest project would miss its deadline. “I dreamed the windows were empty,” Mr. Ferretti said on a recent morning, concern still creasing his brow. He was referring to the   Christmas window displays he’d been commissioned to create for the Madison Avenue flagship of the Italian luxury shoemaker Tod’s. “At 5 o’clock in the morning, I was going to run over to the store in my bathrobe,” Mr. Ferretti said. “Then I thought to myself, ‘Maybe is better if I make a phone call first.’ ” Happily, an assistant on the other end of the line assured Mr. Ferretti that the period dummy boards he had designed in the shapes of aerialists, contortionists, lion tamers and other tanbark performers  —   but no clowns: “I hate clowns” —   were up and ready, well in advance of the V. I. P. opening and the expected holiday hordes. “But then, I said to myself, ‘I hope is enough,’ ” said Mr. Ferretti, a genial neurotic whose list of collaborators includes Federico Fellini, Franco Zeffirelli, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Tim Burton. “I hope is good. I hope people don’t go to other stores to find the shoes. ” Data from a surprisingly robust Black Friday weekend suggests that shoppers did in fact go to Tod’s to find the shoes. What is more, they did not do all of their shopping online. True, 44 percent of consumers surveyed across the country said they had taken to the internet for their early Christmas purchases, while 40 percent shopped in stores, according to the National Retail Federation. Yet while    retailers have come to play more of what Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst with the NPD Group, calls a “supporting role” in the landscape of peak holiday season, a longing appears to persist for social dimensions of consuming and for something more fulfilling than a series of solitary    transactions on a   device. In that urge to participate in something collective can be found a reassuring counterpoint to a nightmare many retailers have awakened to in recent holiday seasons, one portending their own demise. Despite low unemployment levels, buoyant consumer confidence and, by many measures, a robust economy, analysts increasingly suggest a future is not far off when people will do nearly all their shopping online, visiting    retailers mainly for comparison pricing and to partake of shopping spectacle. Even at that, a cold   calculus has diminished the efforts many retailers put into creating entertainment for holiday shoppers. Of the scores of seasonal window displays once gracing the city’s great retailing corridors, only a few sturdy stalwarts remain. To walk Fifth Avenue north from 34th Street to Central Park this season is to discover a startling paucity of merchants making more than a token nod to the holidays in their window displays. Never mind elves or Santa or Rudolph the   Reindeer. Barely a snowflake is to be found at   retailers like Zara, the North Face, Urban Outfitters, Uniqlo, Fossil, Tommy Bahama, Oakley, Guess, Desigual, Sephora or HM. This stark absence underscores both a shift in consumer patterns and the precious anachronism of what few holiday windows remain. Extravagant, giddy, gaudy, mechanized,   politically pointed or merely kitsch, the windows staged each year by Lord  Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Barneys New York, Tiffany  Company and Bloomingdale’s have long been among New York’s treasures. “They’re a great gift to the city,” said Sheryll Bellman, the author of “Through the Shopping Glass: A Century of New York Christmas Windows. ” “  is still one of the great free things you can do in New York and one of the few you can participate in without being judged,” Ms. Bellman added of a tradition said to have been pioneered locally by Macy’s as early as the 1870s. Whether an average consumer would actually be brave enough to cross the threshold of department stores selling stuff like a $3, 500 Sylvie bag from Gucci or $800 suede Alexander Wang Tia pumps, any pedestrian can press nose to windowpane. And on peak days, as many as half a million people have been counted making their way past the holiday windows at Saks Fifth Avenue. “It’s theater without tickets,” Ms. Bellman said. A similar point was made over a century ago by L. Frank Baum, who in 1900  —   the same year “The Wizard of Oz” came out  —   published a   volume titled “The Art of Decorating Dry Goods Windows and Interiors. ” It represented the accumulated   lore acquired across the years by the onetime proprietor of Baum’s Bazaar in Aberdeen, S. D. And in some ways as startling as the   technological innovations Baum advocated in creating “illusion windows”  —   incandescent globes, revolving stairs or a bust of a “Vanishing Lady” that periodically dropped below a pedestal, only to reappear in 10 minutes wearing a new hat  —   is how many similar effects are still in use. Consider the “Land of 1000 Delights” that Saks Fifth Avenue unveiled on Nov. 21 (and is   on its website). Framed by nearly 13, 000 feet of linear garland outlining the facade of the blockwide Fifth Avenue flagship is a series of six windows in which whimsical, and symbolically charged, characters from “The Nutcracker Suite” disport themselves amid landscapes composed of whirling, spinning cookies and candies tinted in   hues. Bruno Bettelheim, the psychologist, might have had a field day with scenes of Clara battling and “whipping” an army of marshmallow mice or of a pair of harlequin gingerbread “crumbs” dancing out from beneath the folds of the parted skirt of Mother Ginger. “Last year, the theme was icy white, and we decided to go in the completely opposite direction,” said Mark Briggs, the creative force behind the windows and an executive vice president at Hudson’s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord  Taylor, on a recent    tour of the Saks windows. Reached by way of doors concealed from view on the store’s main sales floor, the windows were, at less than four feet, surprisingly shallow for all their weird allusive depths. It is perhaps not remarkable that psychology plays a role in the creation of holiday windows. As if by unspoken agreement, windows at almost every one of the major department stores this season featured themes of nature both innocent and imperiled. At Lord  Taylor, a sidewalk bower of illuminated greenery acts as an enchanted tunnel. Through it, pedestrians are conducted past five windows portraying bunnies seen from a bird’  vantage as they   on a forest pond a mother owl nestling three newly hatched owlets with bobble heads a bear buried in a snowbank a gaggle of dancing geese and a brace of foxes slumbering in an underground den as aboveground raccoons attempt to awaken them. At Bloomingdale’s, a group of visual artists commissioned to create individual chandeliers on the general theme of “light” came up with sculptural fixtures evoking the moon, the stars, a human face in neon and a sprightly octopus with light bulbs at the tips of its tentacles. “There used to be so much more holiday display around, but now it’s down to the five or so big department stores,” said Jack Hruska, executive vice president for creative services at Bloomingdale’s. “I’ve been here 25 years, and in my experience, our desire is not to sell merchandise so much as to be part of the New York experience. ” New York being the frenetic city it is, communicating the “New York experience”  —   whatever that may be  —   demands of most window designers that they put their holiday message across efficiently enough to be understood on the run. “We tried some complex things and realized we were asking people to stand too long in the cold,” Mr. Hruska said. Given that sidewalks on Lexington Avenue, where Bloomingdale’s stands, are narrower than those on Fifth, a retail consultant had to be called in to devise a solution for pileups caused when frenzied holiday shoppers barreled into those who paused at the windows to gawp. “He advised us to put up planters with trees” in order for people to step out of the flow and avoid what the consultant termed “butt rush,” Mr. Hruska said. “And that worked. ” Butt rush, alas, is hardly the challenge confronting the artists responsible for the gemlike miniature dioramas installed in the windows at Tiffany  Company. Pedestrians attempting to pass through the maze of Jersey barriers (now slipcovered in Tiffany blue) outside the jeweler’s neighbor, Trump Tower, are routinely stopped for bag searches at guarded checkpoints by officials charged with protecting the   home of the  . It is no worry, either, outside Barneys New York on Madison Avenue, where the Love Peace Joy Project brought together artists like Nick Cave, Ebony G. Patterson and Rob Pruitt, the design collective Studio Job, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone of Comedy Central’s “South Park. ” Barneys gave them individual windows in which to riff  —   brilliantly in each case  —   on qualities that in the current climate seem in short supply. And happily, there is nothing to impede the pedestrian throngs that stand transfixed outside the Fifth Avenue windows of Bergdorf Goodman, where, as it has for decades, the specialty retailer has again installed a series of window displays as creatively unhindered as they are opulent. David Hoey, the senior director for visual presentation  —   aided by a roster of over 100 craftspeople drawn from the ranks of the city’s freelancers  —   has once again produced a suite of windows that would do L. Frank Baum proud. “They let the kite out with us creatively,” Mr. Hoey recently said, without exaggeration, of the   Neiman Marcus Group, which owns the specialty retailer. No one who experienced them will soon forget the baroque marvels Mr. Hoey and his cohort have conjured over the last two decades, windows filled with such things as Victorian fainting couches, albino peacocks, hundreds of specially commissioned needlepoint portraits of literary figures, scores of ventriloquist dummies, transistor radios, Snoopy figures, vintage toasters and anything and everything material that might, as he said, “spoil your senses. ” Like many of the other holiday windows in town, Bergdorf’s this season have a Mother Nature theme, as observed perhaps on an   road trip titled “Destination Extraordinary. ” Delirious remakes of natural history museum dioramas, Mr. Hoey’s   windows recreate jungle, desert and lagoon, and pack them with more details than it is possible to take in at any one time. Even in a   culture, as Linda Fargo, the senior vice president of Bergdorf Goodman recently noted, there are still few delights that can compare with what she termed “  eye candy six inches away from you behind a plate of glass. ”",0
18038,Report: TMZ Staffers Slam Harvey Levin’s ’Gross’ Ties to Trump,"A    meeting last week between President Donald Trump and TMZ founder Harvey Levin made several staffers at the celebrity gossip site “uncountable,” The Wrap reports.

18039,"Comment on To Fight Racism, Oregon College Devotes an Entire Month to ‘Whiteness’-Shaming by That Fart You Cupped & Smelled","Home / Be The Change / To Fight Racism, Oregon College Devotes an Entire Month to ‘Whiteness’-Shaming To Fight Racism, Oregon College Devotes an Entire Month to ‘Whiteness’-Shaming Matt Agorist January 18, 2016 153 Comments 
Portland, OR — The Cascade Campus Diversity Council at Portland Community College has just declared April to be one of the most unprecedented “educational projects” ever conceived —“White ness History Month.” 
According to PCC , “Whiteness History Month: Context, Consequences, and Change is a multidisciplinary, district-wide, educational project examining race and racism through an exploration of the construction of whiteness, its origins, and heritage.” 
In the opposite manner of “Black History Month,” Whiteness History Month will not be celebrating the contributions made throughout history by people with white skin, but rather shaming them. 
“White ness History Month, unlike heritage months, is not a celebratory endeavor, it is an effort to change our campus climate,” the College points out on its website. 
Peter Fricke, writing for Campus Reform, explains, 
According to a sub-page defining the term (adapted from a definition developed by the University of Calgary ), whiteness “does not simply refer to skin color[,] but [to] an ideology based on beliefs, values, behaviors, habits, and attitudes, which result in the unequal distribution of power and privilege based on skin color.” 
Not only does the concept of whiteness allow those who are “socially deemed white” to accrue benefits, the page asserts, but those benefits “are accrued at the expense of people of color, namely in how people of color are systemically and prejudicially denied equal access to those material benefits.” 
The ideology of whiteness, it continues, dates back to “at least the seventeenth century, [when] ‘white’ appeared as a legal term and social designator determining social and political rights,” a concept that eventually grew to include “thousands” of “special privileges and protections” for white citizens. 
While there is no question that racism is alive and well in the United States today, attempting to solve the problem by creating a climate of ‘race shaming’ is like trying to put out a fire by throwing matches into it. 
It is a statistical fact that black people are incarcerated at a higher rate, face heavier consequences for the same charges as their white counterparts, and are killed by police at a higher rate than whites. 
As Ron Paul pointed out in the 2012 presidential debate, 
“True racism in this country is in the judicial system. The percentage of people who use drugs are about the same with blacks and whites. And yet the blacks are arrested way disproportionately. They’re prosecuted and imprisoned way disproportionately, they get the death penalty way disproportionately. How many times have you seen a white rich person get the electric chair or get, you know, execution? If we truly want to be concerned about racism, you ought to look at a few of those issues and look at the drug laws, which are being so unfairly enforced.” 
However, shaming your neighbor who has nothing to do with these things, simply because their skin color is white, will solve nothing. It will only serve to fuel the flames of the bigot class by stoking the divide even further. 
Instead of teaching students to strive for greatness, no matter what, this “project” teaches them to be victims. Instead of focusing on the issue of the state’s role in perpetuating the racist ideology of a few people in positions of power, PCC is attempting to lay blame to an entire group of people — because of the varying levels of melatonin in their skin. 
Racism is an immense part of the problem, but it is important that we point out that it is only part of the problem. The other part of this problem is the color blue, and the violent unaccountable leviathan that it represents in America today. 
A racist idiot without a badge and uniform is simply a racist idiot, add the power of the state and that racist idiot lays waste to civil rights, initiates violence, and extorts the populace; and it’s called ‘justice.’ 
While the intentions of those behind “Whiteness History Month” are likely noble, they would do well to remember the famous words spoken by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
“I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” 
Until we stop dwelling on the superficial qualities of our fellow humans, racism isn’t going anywhere — regardless of misdirected campaigns of shame.

18041,"Veterans Day is typical .01% rogue state inversion to ‘honor’ duped military ‘serving’ forever lie-started illegal Wars of Aggression. Truly thank Veterans by demanding arrests of US ‘leaders’ who treasoned them to attack, invade, occupy victims of Empire","This condition is only possible with criminally complicit corporate media to “cover” these crimes, and “banking” system to create what is used for money to purchase minions and enrich a .01% psychopathic parasite class. 
Please verify the above linked objective and independently verifiable facts. 
Some highlights from this article to truly honor US veterans by demanding arrests of the .01% lying “leaders” who ordered them to attack, invade, and occupy victim target nations of the US rogue state empire: 
“No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of all, however tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security against the risks of deception and evasion.” ~ President Kennedy , June 10, 1963 
I was inspired to write this essay by the following comment from an otherwise intelligent person: 
“Therefore, while I can say it strongly appears U.S. wars are in violation of the treaties and therefore likely illegal, there is no way for myself to make that a legally binding finding and attach legal demands based upon it. I can make stuff up, but that won’t go over very well.” 
From similar comments over time, I’ve made perhaps ten requests for this person to summarize war law in a sentence or two. So far, I’ve received only dodges avoiding this easy and essential citizen responsibility. This said, this isn’t the only individual who can’t summarize war law, and see that it’s meant to be as clear as: “stop sign” law for driving, a baseball rule, like the strike zone, a chore for one’s child at home, like taking out the trash. 
Let’s look at these three examples compared to this comment, then review war law to see that its violation by US .01% “leaders” is as outrageous as one can imagine, not even close to legal, started on lies known to be false as they were told, and requiring immediate arrests to stop an obvious crime war-murdering millions, harming billions, and looting trillions. 
To give you the punch line now for clarity of what war law states , and without disagreement our colleagues and I are aware of from anyone who points to the law with explanation: 
Unless a nation can justify its military use as self-defense from armed attack from a nation’s government that is “instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation,” all other acts of war are unlawful. The legal definition of “self-defense” ends when the attack terminates. In general legal definition , no party is allowed use of force under the justification of “self-defense” if the law can be applied for redress and remedy. 
This is the same as if you’re walking down the street: nobody can attack you unless, and only unless, you attack first or are an imminent threat (pulling a knife and raving, etc.). And if you are attacked, once law enforcement takes the case any attack on your part is the crime of retribution fully prosecuted against you. Example 1: Stop sign law: 
In general, law is meant to be crystal-clear so as to help produce a desired result. Traffic law is meant to make driving as safe and efficient as possible, with California stop sign law as a perfect example: 
“An 8-sided red STOP sign indicates that you must make a full “STOP” whenever you see this sign. Stop at the white limit line (a wide white line painted on the street) or before entering the crosswalk. If a limit line or crosswalk is not painted on the street, stop before entering the intersection. Check traffic in all directions before proceeding.” 
There’s more that could be said about this law, but this is enough as we all have personal experience of what this law means. 
Now imagine this scenario: 
In your residential neighborhood with a 25 mph speed limit, you have a stop sign one house away. Your child attends the elementary school down the street, and you know that children have been hit by cars on this street. One day you observe at 7 AM a red Toyota truck speed through that stop sign ~40 mph, and at 5 PM he speeds through the other way. As you watch, horrified this has happened twice, you see your next-door neighbor has also observed this. You walk over: 
You: Did you see that?! I saw that same truck do that this morning; just blow by that stop sign, and speeding! 
Neighbor: Yeah. I’ve seen it the last three weekdays, morning and evening. Same truck, same driver, same speed, never even slows down. 
You: Have you called the police? Let’s stop this! 
Neighbor: While I can say it strongly appears this driver is in violation of the law and therefore likely illegal, there is no way for myself to make that a legally binding finding and attach legal demands based upon it. I can make stuff up, but that won’t go over very well. 
You: Are you joking? 
Neighbor: No. I take neighborhood safely seriously. Because he’s seen me, he threw this note at me yesterday. Well, it was attached to a brick that missed me and went through my windshield. But anyway, this is what the note says: 
“My driving is legal because: I have white decals on my vehicle , and have extra driving privileges. My wife is pregnant. Emergencies change everything. I must use emergency “enhanced driving techniques.” It’s pretty well confirmed you’re in communication with Al-Qaeda terrorists, so I’m acting in legal self-defense before you attack again.” 
You: Dude. 
Neighbor: What? While I can say it strongly appears this driver is in violation of the law and therefore likely illegal, there is no way for myself to make that a legally binding finding and attach legal demands based upon it. I can make stuff up, but that won’t go over very well. 
You: Ok, let’s look. First: his truck doesn’t have those white stickers, plus it’s irrelevant for speeding through a stop sign. Second: if he drives like this every day AND both ways that has nothing to do with a pregnant wife. And the last one, seriously, are you going to take that shit that you’re the cause of his speeding because you’re some evil terrorist?! 
** 
I could go on, but you get the points about this neighbor within the limits of an analogy: No demonstrated understanding of this law. Need of greater voice for responsible citizenship. Example 2: baseball’s strike zone 
Scenario: You attend your son’s high school baseball game with about 100 other adults and students in your team’s stands. Your same neighbor is at the game with you, with his son at bat. The pitcher delivers a pitch ten feet over everyone’s head to the backstop. The umpire calls, “Strike one!” You, in shock, attempt to ask your neighbor if you heard correctly. As you begin talking, the pitcher’s second pitch is tossed to their team’s manager in the dugout: 
Umpire: Strike two! 
You: This game is rigged! 
Neighbor: While I can say it strongly appears those pitches are outside the strike zone and therefore likely balls, there is no way for myself to make that a binding finding and attach demands based upon it. I can make stuff up, but that won’t go over very well. 
You: Dude! The first one was over everyone’s heads by 10 feet! The second is a joke! 
(as we talk, the pitcher delivers the third pitch: rolling it to the third baseman and smirking at the “umpire” calling, “Strike three!”) 
Neighbor: (loudly encouraging to son) Next time, next time, son! You’ll have to swing at one of those to have a chance! 
** 
Let’s do some analysis: Again, your neighbor shows no understanding of the law. Your neighbor is at risk of being a sucker to whatever consequences might come from such ignorance. 
Of course, because Americans take sports law s seriously (and here ), many of the 100 fans would be on the field to stop the game after the second pitch, and would never ever ever ever allow a game they cared about to be destroyed by Orwellian “umpires.” Example 3: taking out the trash 
Scenario: Your son has a chore to take out the trash before he goes to bed each night. One morning before school, you notice the trash wasn’t taken out last night. Your son comes downstairs. 
You: Son, you didn’t take out the trash last night. 
Son: C’mon Dad: while you can say it strongly appears the trash is in violation of the agreement and therefore likely illegal, there is no way for you to make that a binding finding and attach demands based upon it. You can make stuff up, but that won’t go over very well. 
You: (blinking twice, indicating with body language that your son now has your full attention) 
Son: (recognizing this bullshit isn’t working, clears his throat) Besides, taking the trash out is a relative term. If it’s out , then relative to that location, inside the house is outside of that domain. If the trash is in , it’s already outside the domain of out ! 
(placing his hand in mock sincerity upon my shoulder) Dad, America needs clear laws and enforceable laws, not the arbitrary stop you’re making of my morning in lawless arbitrary demand. It’s up to our household legislation to plug loopholes; it’s the duty of the family to understand what needs to be done and demand it. 
Fair laws, clear laws, enforceable laws. 
Don’t be a preening weenie, Dad. 
You: You’re joking, right? 
Son: Not at all. I take household responsibilities very seriously. Very seriously. 
You: (pursing lips and nodding) Anything else you’d like to add to your explanation? 
Son: Yes. The rule states that the trash go out before I “go to bed.” I never went to bed last night. I had a “temporary emergency bailout of consciousness” distinct from “going to bed.” So, technically, I won’t be in violation until I actually “go to bed.” And this state of emergency might need to be continued indefinitely. Oh, and I still stand on my point that given the ambiguity of the rule with in and out , neither one of us can determine any violation of law. 
You: Son, laws are meant to be clear; this one is. Your first excuse has to destroy known and agreed terms of in and out to pretend the law is unclear. Your second excuse again destroys a definition of an essential part of the law, then, as the first excuse, attempts to bullshit your way to willfully destroy clear law. This bullshit includes rhetoric of caring about responsibility, a need for clear laws, and justice. 
The law is simple: (pointing to trash) That is inside the house. It needs to go outside to the trash container (pointing) every night. Nobody is confused by this. 
How did you get this wild idea? 
Son: (snapping out of his experiment with psychopathy): My baseball teammate and neighbor uses it on his dad all the time. He says it works. Thanks for not being played, Dad. That’s the type of man I want to be! War law is as clear as our three examples: 
War law is just as easy to understand as “stop sign law,” and far easier than most sports laws, such as when a football punt is or is not legal, or baseball’s “infield fly” rule. Because everyday people care enough to know traffic law and sports rules , the idea of knowing war law can be accomplished by refreshing what you’ve already learned by reading this article (and confirming its accuracy as needed). 
War law, as we’re about to document and prove, is clear and helpful for the outcome of denying military armed attack as a foreign policy. This is an outcome 95%+ of humanity agree is desirable, especially after all our families’ awful sacrifices through two world wars. 
Conversely, war-mongers for empire will do their best to be silent about war law, lie that it’s so unclear that any dictatorial claim of “self-defense” is valid, and take every evasive maneuver imaginable for the public (especially military and law enforcement) to never understand war law and/or never recognize how US wars are Orwellian unlawful. 
Again: what war law states , and without disagreement our colleagues and I are aware of from anyone who points to the law with explanation: 
Unless a nation can justify its military use as self-defense from armed attack from a nation’s government that is “instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation,” all other acts of war are unlawful. The legal definition of “self-defense” ends when the attack terminates. In general legal definition , no party is allowed use of force under the justification of “self-defense” if the law can be applied for redress and remedy. 
That’s the letter of the law. The intent is soooo strongly worded in both relevant treaties, as you’ll see, and is simply to end the scourge of wars chosen by governments as foreign policy (in historical context of empires looting the world for resources: natural and human). 
Our condition today is of OBVIOUSLY unlawful Wars of Aggression (and started with lies known to false as they were told ), as the facts to follow clearly demonstrate for anyone caring to look and apply basic high school-level of education already learned. 
Importantly, Left and Right “leaders” and corporate media , including Clinton and Trump, will never ever ever ever ever remind us that war is illegal, with current wars in Orwellian opposition. 
The appropriate “vote” of We the People for this presidential election is “No” for more illegal war, and “Yes” to stop the wars and arrest those who orchestrated them. Without public demand, these illegal wars will only continue. 
The following is from my paper for the 2015 Claremont Colleges’ conference, Seizing an Alternative Toward an Ecological Civilization reframed for our three specific points in this essay. Importantly, colleagues and I working on this topic are unaware of any refutation that the US wars are illegal. That is, we’ve never encountered anyone in person or in writing who points to the law and argues: “War law means (a, b, c), so the US wars are legal because (d, e, f).” If any reader has found any such argument, please share it with me. Accurately and confidently know the law 
Unlawful Wars of Aggression: The US/UK/Israel “official story” is that current wars are lawful because they are “self-defense.” The Emperor’s New Clothes fact here is that “self-defense” means something quite narrow and specific in war law, and US/UK/Israel armed attacks on so many nations in current and past wars are not even close to the definition of “self-defense.” 
Addressing three nations and several wars again seems ambitious for one academic paper, and again, these are all simple variations of one method: Ignore war law. Lie to blame the victim and claim “self-defense.” “Officials” and corporate media never state the Emperor’s New Clothes simple and obvious facts of war law and war lies. 
Proving unlawful wars with massive deception is easier when the scope is broadened to see the same elements in three cases. 
Importantly, a nation can use military, police, and civilians in self-defense from any attack upon the nation. This is similar to the legal definition of “self-defense” for you or I walking down the street: we cannot attack anyone unless either under attack or imminent threat. And, if under attack, we can use any reasonable force in self-defense, including lethal. 
Two world wars begat two treaties to end nations’ armed attacks forever. They are crystal-clear in content and context: Kellogg-Briand Pact ( General treaty for renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy as official title) United Nations Charter . 
Both are listed in the US State Department’s annual publication, Treaties in Force (2013 edition pages 466 and 493). 
Article Six of the US Constitution defines a treaty as US “supreme Law of the Land;” meaning that US policy may only complement an active treaty, and never violate it. 
This is important because all of us with Oaths to the US Constitution are sworn to honorably refuse all unlawful war orders; military officers are sworn to arrest those who issue them. Indeed, we suffer criminal dishonor if we obey orders for armed attack when they are not “self-defense,” and family dishonor to so easily reject the legal victory won from all our families’ sacrifices through two world wars. 
Treaty 1. Kellogg-Briand: General treaty for renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy : 
The legal term renounce means to surrender access; that is, to remove that which is renounced as lawful option. This active treaty (page 466 “Renunciation of War”), usually referenced as the Kellogg-Briand Pact , states: 
“ ARTICLE I 
The High Contracting Parties solemly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another. 
ARTICLE II 
The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.” 
So, in the most clear framing of a rule as possible, the first two parts of the treaty state “never war” and “always peace” to resolve conflicts. 
Treaty 2. United Nations Charter: 
It’s helpful to understand what the UN is not. The only area of legal authority of the UN is security/use of force; all other areas are advise for individual nation’s legislature’s consideration. The UN is not global government. It is a global agreement to end wars of choice outside of a very narrow legal definition of national self-defense against another nation’s armed attack. 
The preamble of the United Nations includes to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war… to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used…” 
The UN purpose includes: “To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace…” 
Article 2: 
3. All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered. 
4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. 
5. All Members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter… 
Article 24 : In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations, its Members confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. 
Article 25: The Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter. 
Article 33 : The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice. The Security Council shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means. 
Article 37: Should the parties to a dispute of the nature referred to in Article 33 fail to settle it by the means indicated in that Article, they shall refer it to the Security Council. 
Article 39: The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security. 
Article 40: In order to prevent an aggravation of the situation, the Security Council may, before making the recommendations or deciding upon the measures provided for in Article 39, call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable. 
Article 51: Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. 
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the judicial branch of the UN. Their definition of “armed attack” is by a nation’s government. Because the leadership of the CIA and FBI both reported that they had no evidence the Afghan government had any role in the 9/11 terrorism, the US is unable to claim Article 51 protection for military action in Afghanistan (or Iraq , Syria , Ukraine , Iran [ here , here , here ], Russia , or claims about ISIS or Khorasans ). The legal classification of what happened on 9/11 is an act of terrorism, a criminal act, not an armed attack by another nation’s government. 
The US use of force oversees could be a legal application of Article 51 if, and only if, the US could meet the burden of proof of an imminent threat that was not being responded to by the Security Council. To date, the US has not made such an argument. 
American Daniel Webster helped create the legal definition of national self-defense in the Caroline Affair as “necessity of that self-defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.” The US attack on Afghanistan came nearly a month after the 9/11 terrorism. Article 51 only allows self-defense until the Security Council takes action; which they did in two Resolutions beginning the day after 9/11 ( 1368 and 1373 ) claiming jurisdiction in the matter. 
In conclusion, unless a nation can justify its military use as self-defense from armed attack from a nation’s government that is “instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation,” all other acts of war are unlawful. The legal definition of “self-defense” ends when the attack terminates. In general legal definition , no party is allowed use of force under the justification of “self-defense” if the law can be applied for redress and remedy. 
Another area to clarify is the US 1973 War Powers Act (WPA). The authorization by Congress for US presidential discretion for military action in Afghanistan and Iraq references WPA. This act, in response to the Vietnam War, reframes the Founders’ intent of keeping the power of war in the hands of Congress. It also expressly limits the president to act within US treaty obligations; the principle treaty of use of war being the UN Charter. 
This means that presidential authority as commander-in-chief must always remain within the limitations of the UN Charter to be lawful orders. It’s not enough for Congress to authorize use of force; that force must always and only be within the narrow legal definition of self-defense clearly explained in the UN Charter. Of course, we can anticipate that if a government wanted to engage in unlawful war today, they would construct their propaganda to sell the war as “defensive.” The future of humanity to be safe from the scourge of war is therefore dependent upon our collective ability to discern lawful defensive wars from unlawful Wars of Aggression covered in BS – Emperor’s New Clothes claims of self-defense. 
The most decorated US Marine general in his day warned all Americans of this fact of lie-started wars, and W. Bush’s Senior Advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff, Karl Rove, chided Pulitzer-winning journalist, Ron Suskind, that government will continue with such actions to “create our own reality” no matter what anyone else might say. 
The first round of US current wars, the attack of Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, continues this history as a deliberate act of unlawful war, not defense that was “instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.” The burden of proof the US would have to provide is imminent threat of another attack in order to justify self-defense. US Ambassador to the UN, John Negroponte, in his letter to the UN Security Council invoking Article 51 for the attack upon Afghanistan mentions only “ongoing threat;” which does not satisfy this burden of proof. 
Article 51 requires self-defensive war coming from an attack by a nation’s government, which the CIA and FBI refute in the case of the Afghan government with the terrorism on 9/11. Self-defense ends when the attack ends. The US war began four weeks after 9/11 ended; making the US war one of choice and not defense. Article 51 ends self-defense claims when the UN Security Council acts. Resolution 1373 provides clear language of international cooperation and justice under the law, with no authorization of force. 
This evidence doesn’t require the light of the UN Charter’s spirit of its laws, but I’ll add it: humanity rejected war as a policy option and requires nations to cooperate for justice under that law. The US has instead embraced and still embraces war with its outcomes of death, misery, poverty, and fear expressly against the wishes of humanity and the majority of Americans. These acts are clearly unlawful and should be refused and stopped by all men and women in military, government and law enforcement. 
Some war liars argue that UN Security Council Resolution 687 from 1991 authorizes resumption of force from the previous Gulf War. This resolution declared a formal cease-fire; which means exactly what it says: stop the use of force. The resolution was declared by UNSC and held in their jurisdiction; that is, no individual nation has authority to supersede UNSC’s power to continue or change the status of the cease-fire. The idea that the US and/or UK can authorize use of force under a UNSC cease-fire is as criminal as your neighbor shooting one of your family members and claiming that because police have authority to shoot dangerous people he can do it. 
The categories of crime for armed attacks outside US treaty limits of law are: Wars of Aggression (the worst crime a nation can commit), Treason for lying to US military, ordering unlawful attack and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of US military deaths. 
All 27 UK Foreign Affairs Department attorneys concluded Iraq war is unlawful: I wrote in 2010 : 
“All the lawyers in the UK’s Foreign Affairs Department concluded the US/UK invasion of Iraq was an unlawful War of Aggression. Their expert advice is the most qualified to make that legal determination; all 27 of them were in agreement . This powerful judgment of unlawful war follows the Dutch government’s recent unanimous report and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan’s clear statements . 
“This stunning information was disclosed at the UK Chilcot inquiry by the testimony of Foreign Affairs leading legal advisor, Sir Michael Wood , who added that the reply from Prime Minister Tony Blair’s office to his legal department’s professional work was chastisement for putting their unanimous legal opinion in writing. 
“ Sir Michael testified that Foreign Secretary Jack Straw preferred to take the legal position that the laws governing war were vague and open to broad interpretation: “He took the view that I was being very dogmatic and that international law was pretty vague and that he wasn’t used to people taking such a firm position.” 
“UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith testified he “changed his mind” against the unanimous legal opinion of all 27 of the Foreign Office attorneys to agree with the US legal argument that UN Security Council Resolution 1441 authorized use of force at the discretion of any nation’s choice . This testimony is also criminally damning: arguing that an individual nation has the right to choose war violates the purpose, letter and spirit of the UN Charter, as well as violates 1441 that reaffirms jurisdiction of the Security Council in governance of the issue. This Orwellian argument contradicts the express purpose of the Charter to prevent individual nations from engaging in wars. 
“Moreover, the US and UK “legal argument” is in further Orwellian opposition to their UN Ambassadors’ statements when 1441 was passed that this did not authorize any use of force: 
“ John Negroponte , US Ambassador to the UN: 
[T]his resolution contains no “hidden triggers” and no “automaticity” with respect to the use of force. If there is a further Iraqi breach, reported to the Council by UNMOVIC, the IAEA or a Member State, the matter will return to the Council for discussions as required in paragraph 12. 
“ Sir Jeremy Greenstock , UK Ambassador to the UN: 
We heard loud and clear during the negotiations the concerns about “automaticity” and “hidden triggers” — the concern that on a decision so crucial we should not rush into military action; that on a decision so crucial any Iraqi violations should be discussed by the Council. Let me be equally clear in response… There is no “automaticity” in this resolution. If there is a further Iraqi breach of its disarmament obligations, the matter will return to the Council for discussion as required in paragraph 12. 
“The Chilcot inquiry was initiated from public outrage against UK participation in the Iraq War, with public opinion having to engage a second time to force hearings to become public rather than closed and secret. The hearings were not authorized to consider criminal charges, which is the next battle for UK public opinion.” 
The UN Charter is the principle law to end wars; designed by the US to produce that result. That said, West Point Grads Against the War have further legal arguments of all the violations of war from US attack and invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, including further analysis of the UN Charter and expert supporting testimony. Another resource for documentation and analysis is David Swanson’s War is a Crime . Ironically, Americans would never allow a favorite sport such as baseball or football to be similarly destroyed by such Emperor’s New Clothes lies to those rules/laws. 
Lawful war analysis: Negroponte’s letter invokes a legal Charter Article of self-defense in contrast with the loss of over 3,000 lives on 9/11. The letter portends legal evidence of al-Qaeda’s “central role” in the attacks and claims military response is appropriate because of al-Qaeda’s ongoing threat and continued training of terrorists. This reasoning argues for a reinterpretation of self-defense to include pre-emptive attack while lying in omission that such an argument is tacit agreement of current action being outside the law. 
The US Army’s official law handbook provides an excellent historical and legal summary of when wars are lawful self-defense and unlawful War of Aggression in a seven-page Chapter One. 
Importantly, after accurately defining “self-defense” in war, the JAG authors/attorneys explicitly state on page 6 that war is illegal unless a nation is under attack from another nation’s government, or can provide evidence of imminent threat of such attack : 
“Anticipatory self-defense, whether labeled anticipatory or preemptive, must be distinguished from preventive self-defense. Preventive self-defense—employed to counter non-imminent threats—is illegal under international law .” 
However, despite the US Army’s law handbook’s accurate disclosure of the legal meaning of “self-defense” in war, they then ignore this meaning to claim “self-defense” as a lawful reason for US wars without further explanation ( details here ). 
President George Washington’s Farewell Address, the culmination of his 45 years of political experience, warned of the primary threat to America as “the impostures of pretended patriotism” from people within our own government who would destroy Constitutional limits in order to obtain tyrannical power: 
“All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency.” 
Young Abraham Lincoln wrote eloquently to defend the US Constitution from unlawful tyrants within our own government . In Congress, he spoke powerfully and truthfully that the President’s claims for armed attack and invasion of a foreign country were lies . Although war-mongers slurred Lincoln’s name at the time, history proved him correct in asserting the President of the US was a war-mongering liar: 
“I carefully examined the President’s messages, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point. The result of this examination was to make the impression, that taking for true, all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would have gone farther with his proof, if it had not been for the small matter, that the truth would not permit him… Now I propose to try to show, that the whole of this, — issue and evidence — is, from beginning to end, the sheerest deception.” 
Lincoln also wrote that “pre-emptive” wars were lies, and “ war at pleasure .” 
Those of us working to end these illegal Wars of Aggression have found zero refutations of our documentation that address war law. All we’ve ever found are denial and unsubstantiated claims of “self-defense” while having to lie about the legal limits in that term. 
Note: other sections of that paper may be useful that just as clearly demonstrate Israel’s illegal war on Gaza, criminally complicit corporate media to “cover” these crimes, all “reasons” for these wars were known to be false as they were told, and the fundamental fraud of creating what is used for money as debt. Demand arrests of Left and Right .01% US “leaders” because the wars are not even close to lawful 
Therefore, We the People have an obvious solution: lawful arrests of .01% “leaders” for the most egregious crimes centering in war and lies to start them. 
This is a 1st Amendment responsibility to maintain our constitutional republic under law rather than what we’ve become with war: “leaders” dictating/saying what we can do completely removed from limitations of the law. Left and Right .01% “leaders” completely violate the rules, and only from public ignorance with corporate media propaganda. 
The categories of crime include: Wars of Aggression (the worst crime a nation can commit). Likely treason for lying to US military, ordering unlawful attack and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of US military deaths. Crimes Against Humanity for ongoing intentional policy of poverty that’s killed over 400 million human beings just since 1995 (~75% children; more deaths than from all wars in Earth’s recorded history). Looting trillions , such as the Department of “Defense” claiming to have “lost” $6.5 trillion. 
US military, law enforcement, responsible citizens, and all with Oaths to support and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, face an endgame choice: Demand arrests , with those with lawful authority to enact it. An arrest is the lawful action to stop apparent crimes , with the most serious crimes documented here meaning the most serious need for arrests. Watch the US escalate its rogue state crimes that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. 
How military and law enforcement choose to honor their Oaths in creative adaptation to the rogue state is up to them. We the People can help with our educated voices in this Emperor’s New Clothes environment whereby these crimes only persist from public ignorance. 
In just 90 seconds , former US Marine Ken O’Keefe powerfully states how you may choose to voice “very obvious solutions”: arrest the criminal leaders (video starts at 20:51, then finishes this episode of Cross Talk ): 
Our condition requiring YOUR voice is what Benjamin Franklin predicted would be the eventual outcome of the United States. On September 18, 1787, just after signing the US Constitution, Ben met with members of the press. He was asked what kind of government America would have. Franklin warned: “A republic, if you can keep it.” In his speech to the Constitutional Convention, Franklin admonished: 
“This [U.S. Constitution] is likely to be administered for a course of years and then end in despotism… when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government, being incapable of any other.” – The Quotable Founding Fathers , pg. 39. 
These warnings extend to all social science teachers of the present: 
“As educators in the field of history–social science, we want our students to… understand the value, the importance, and the fragility of democratic institutions. We want them to realize that only a small fraction of the world’s population (now or in the past) has been fortunate enough to live under a democratic form of government.” – History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools , pgs. 2, 7-8 
Do you have the intellectual integrity and moral courage to at least act with the honesty of a child to speak the Emperor’s New Clothes truth? Remember, I’m just asking you to use your voice in a democratic republic to ask US military and various law enforcement to honor their Oaths and do the job we pay them for: protect and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There is no greater enemy than those committing treason to war-murder US military by lying them into invasive illegal Wars of Aggression. 
The converse argument is that US military and law enforcement should not enforce our most important laws, especially not those that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. Of course, this argument is Orwellian. Cause a lawful end to the dictatorial US rogue state 
In conclusion, this essay has reminded you of what you already know: laws are meant to be simple and helpful, what you’ve suspected about the wars is demonstrated as true with a few clear facts, and that your voice is essential if we are to maintain our republic from devolving into dictatorship (literally being dictated/told what the rules are rather than knowing them ourselves). 
To remind you of other history that demonstrates this has been an ongoing problem of what is most accurately described as a rogue state : a “top ten” list of state crimes supporting today’s arrests in a constitutional republic: Introduction to define ‘rogue state’ as perfect match with US illegal Wars of Aggression, Crimes Against Humanity, dictatorial government The US violated ~600 treaties with Native Americans to steal Native American land. A treaty is signed by a US President, approved by 2/3 vote of the US Senate, and under Article VI of the US Constitution becomes US “supreme Law.” These ongoing “in your face” violations of “supreme Law” became the precedent to typical hypocritical and unlawful US policies of the present. US President Polk lied to Congress (with their approval) to initiate War of Aggression on Mexico . The result was the US illegally stealing 40% of Mexico in 1848. Congress opposed Abraham Lincoln’s crystal-clear explanation as a member of Congress that the Adams-Onís Treaty placed the so-called “border dispute” 400 miles within land forever promised to Mexico and forever promised as outside any US claim.",0
18042,Retired 4 Star General Blasts Trump For Not Supporting US Troops,"A retired four-star general called out Donald Trump as unfit to be president because he has failed to support US troops. 
In a conference call with reporters, Gen. John Allen (Ret.) said: Trump’s remarks are not only uninformed…but it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops. And I took great exception to this. However he feels personally about this operation, he should be encouraging our efforts publicly, rather than disparaging them. 
…. 
While [Trump] appears not to understand basic military activities, it’s not clear to me that he’s interested in learning them, either. Because there are a number of experts, who I think…would advise him otherwise. But he seems to be confident in his knowledge. And that knowledge, I think, reveals a lot about what he doesn’t know. 
…. 
This kind of rhetoric; this kind of disrespect for our military leadership; this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day – it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief. 
Military experts, like Gen. Allen, feel compelled to criticize the Republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief. 
Thanks to Donald Trump, the Republican Party has become the party that doesn’t support the troops. 
Republicans have gone from “real America” to un-American in record time. 
If a presidential nominee doesn’t respect the men and women who risk their lives for the country, then he definitely won’t respect the needs of hard working Americans. 
With each word that comes out of his mouth, Trump continues to show America the real face of the Republican Party.",0

18044,Hillary and the Ghosts of Watergate,"Posted on November 1, 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith 
The parallels between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon are not legal–they are political: specifically, how can a leader crippled by scandal and cover-ups govern? 
In even blunter terms: how can a crippled politico deliver the goods to the special interests who bet their cash and political capital on the politico’s ability to deliver favors? 
Among the many ghosts of Watergate, one specter especially haunts Hillary: once the special interests and party stalwarts who defended you through every scandal and every cover-up–month after month and year after year, on the promise that you would deliver the goods upon ascending to the presidency–realize you are too damaged to deliver anything of value to anyone, why would they continue supporting you? 
Once a politico has to declare “I am not a crook” based on legalese rather than a moral foundation, that politico’s ability to lead has vanished. Hillary and her supporters rely entirely on legalese parsing of wrong-doing rather than on a self-explanatory, basic moral foundation of right and wrong. 
Declaring “I am not a crook” because the wrongdoing escapes prosecution is the same as declaring “I am above the law.” If the foundation of one’s ability to lead is a reliance on legal parsing and allies in the Department of Justice squashing investigations while handing out immunity like candy on Halloween, the political capital required to lead no longer exists. 
Ultimately, the President leads by moral suasion. Even the political act of delivering the goods to the special interests that funded your campaign and your wealth must be backed by the moral authority of personal integrity and a morally grounded appeal to the common good. 
A politician who has effectively zero personal integrity is only as viable as his/her ability to deliver favors to the few (i.e. special interests) over the objections of the many. A reliance on cold-blooded horse-trading only works if the leader has enough political capital to arm-twist everyone into granting favors to allies and special interests. 
But this political capital rests on moral suasion and support earned not by issuing promises but by leading the nation through thorny thickets to solutions that work for the many, not just the few. 
Once the ability to lead has been lost, special interests can forget about getting favors. And once they realize their politico is a liability rather than an asset, self-preservation requires abandoning the liability as quickly as possible. 
It’s nothing personal, it’s just business. Anyone who thinks Hillary has the personal integrity to build sufficient political capital to lead is delusional. Anyone who believes Hillary has the moral foundation to deliver the goods to the myriad special interests that have funded her campaign and her personal wealth is equally delusional. 
Are Goldman Sachs et al. delusional? If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds.",0
18045,’Sessions Resigning’ Narrative Gets Another Blow with White House Vow of Confidence - Breitbart,"CNN’s Jim Acosta tweeted Thursday that Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dispelled rumors of a rift between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump. [President has confidence in Sessions, Sarah Sanders tells reporters.  —   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,   Sanders said she had a conversation with POTUS last night about Sessions.  —   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,  Sanders’s statement to Acosta and other reporters came after days of mainstream media promotion of rumors from unnamed White House sources that the Attorney General and the President have been at loggerheads and that Sessions had even offered his resignation. Acosta noted the over 48 hours that passed between the report and Sanders’s rebuke, the first official White House refutation of the idea that Sessions might be on his way out for having criticized the president. The Daily Caller’s Alex Pfeiffer, however, reported Wednesday that multiple sources close to the Attorney General found the insinuation of his demise ridiculous. “He’s not going anywhere,” one official who spoke with Sessions in the aftermath of the reports told the Caller. Much of the media speculation was based on Trump’s supposed disagreement with the Justice Department on litigation strategy in the upcoming Supreme Court appeal on the validity of the President’s executive order travel ban for six Muslim majority countries. The President made tweets defending the original ban over what he called the “ ” second version, which was drafted with closer supervision from Attorney General Sessions’s Justice Department. Sessions, however, has been a prime media target within the administration since before he was even confirmed as Attorney General in contentious hearings that saw Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) make   attacks on   Sessions that saw her reprimanded. The campaign against Sessions, from both Democratic elected officials and the   activist establishment, has only intensified since administration blood entered the water with National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s ouster. In March, Senate Democrats renewed their calls for Sessions to resign over his inaccurate statements about meeting with Russian officials in the course of his official business as a U. S. Senator. The drums beating for resignation were quickly joined by the Democratic National Committee and George Soros’s leftist agitation vehicle Moveon. org. This week’s rumors of resignation began after a relative lull in the pressure from the left on Sessions. His central role in enforcing President Trump’s agenda on immigration and crime, however, continue to make him a focal point of leftist ire.",0
18046,Trump Inches Toward Naming Domestic Cabinet Members - The New York Times,"Earlier Today: The New York Times had an exclusive interview with Donald Trump. See how it unfolded on our  .    Donald J. Trump is moving toward choosing his domestic policy team, suggesting that the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson could be his housing secretary and speaking at length to a Democrat, Michelle Rhee, about education. Meantime,  Mr. Trump suggests that his    will bring peace to the Middle East and seems to reverse tack on climate change.  Through his spokesman, Ben Carson has said he does not have the experience to run a major federal agency, yet there he was, cozying up to be the next secretary of housing and urban development. What a neurosurgeon knows about housing policy is not clear, but Mr. Carson is clearly in the running. “Well, you know our inner cities are in terrible shape, and they definitely need some real attention,” he told Fox News on Tuesday. “You know, there have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been” done. The housing post was “one of the offers that’s on the table,” Mr. Carson confirmed. Another name surfacing for a domestic cabinet post? It’s former Representative Harold Ford Jr. a moderate Democrat, as possible transportation secretary. Why Mr. Ford? He is a frequent guest on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” and the   Joe Scarborough has the  ’s ear. Michelle Rhee, a Democrat who has been willing to ruffle feathers on education, didn’t exactly take herself out of the running to be Mr. Trump’s education secretary, but she did push back at critics who do not approve of her visits to Trump Tower. Mr. Trump, as it turns out, didn’t care all that much about Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. But there are consequences. When his senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, announced that the incoming administration would not pursue the investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s private email server, the response from the right was swift. “Broken Promise,” blared Breitbart, the conservative website that promoted Mr. Trump’s candidacy and gave him the mastermind of his campaign, Stephen K. Bannon. The conservative provocateur Ann Coulter was no more subtle. Judicial Watch, the conservative legal organization that has doggedly pursued Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, also chimed in: Ms. Conway said Tuesday that it was now Mr. Trump’s intention to move beyond the issues of the campaign and focus on the task of running the country instead. “If Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that’s a good thing,” Ms. Conway said on the MSNBC’s “Morning Joe. ” Of course, the attorney general is supposed to be independent, but things may not work the usual way with President Trump. “I think when the   who’s also the head of your party, tells you before he’s even inaugurated that he doesn’t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone and content” to fellow Republicans, Ms. Conway said. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is expected to serve somewhere in the new administration, told the news media at Trump Tower that the   was making a tough call. “Look, there’s a tradition in American politics that after you win an election, you sort of put things behind you,” Mr. Giuliani said. “And if that’s the decision he reached, that’s perfectly consistent with sort of a historical pattern of things come up, you say a lot of things, even some bad things might happen, and then you can sort of put it behind you in order to unite the nation. So if he made that decision, I would be supportive of it. I’d also be supportive of continuing the investigation. ” But Mr. Trump has lofty ambitions. James Mattis, a former Marine Corps general, is no fan of waterboarding, which could present problems if he becomes secretary of defense. Why? Because the   is a really big fan. As recently as Monday night,   Trump said in a video that he would scuttle President Obama’s energy and environmental regulations  —   put in place to fight climate change  —   to unleash coal and hydraulic fracturing. Yet in his meeting Tuesday with Times reporters and editors, he seemed to soften on climate change, which he used to call a hoax. But: Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, took to Medium to make the case that Democrats need not panic, but they do need to get back to work. On the one hand, she noted: On the other, with Republican gains in state legislatures, the party is working off a structural disadvantage. She explained: As a candidate, Mr. Trump proposed ramping up surveillance of mosques and a moratorium on Muslim immigration, compelling to a surge in American Muslims registering to vote. Surprisingly, a lot of them actually voted for Mr. Trump. According to an exit poll of 2, 000 Muslim voters conducted by the Council on   Relations, or CAIR, 13 percent backed Mr. Trump, while 74 percent supported Mrs. Clinton. That is nearly twice as much support as Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, received from Muslim voters four years ago. Robert McCaw, a spokesman for CAIR, said Mr. Trump’s strength with Muslims was somewhat surprising, but that about 15 percent of Muslims do identify themselves as Republicans and that Mrs. Clinton did little direct outreach to Muslims. “There were aspects of Trump’s candidacy that either appealed to them or it was a vote against Hillary Clinton,” Mr. McCaw said. “It might not necessarily have been as much a vote of confidence for Trump as an expression of no confidence in Clinton. ” The votes may have been significant, since Mr. Trump won Michigan  —   which has one of the largest Arab populations in the country  —   by barely more than 11, 000 votes. Some Muslims of Syrian descent voted for Mr. Trump, believing he would support President Bashar   of Syria. More broadly, there may have been a   split in the rust belt, where Shiites more generally favored Mr. Trump. David Fahrenthold of The Washington Post continues his dogged pursuit of the Trump Foundation, reporting Tuesday that the  ’s charitable organization has apparently admitted that it violated the legal prohibition against “ . ” That prohibition prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their charity’s money to help themselves, their businesses, or their families. The news came in a tax filing for 2015 that was posted on the nonprofit tracking service Guidestar on Monday  —   less than two weeks after Election Day. Mr. Trump famously told the world and Mrs. Clinton during a presidential debate that he would appoint a special prosecutor if elected with the express purpose of putting his political opponent in jail. There may be a practical reason the new president would pull back. The latest tally shows Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump in the popular vote by 1, 754, 204 votes. Pursuing her might not prove very popular. Her leadership is being challenged. The complaints about an aging slate of commanders are growing louder. So Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, 76, the House minority leader, has issued a plan. In a letter to House Democrats on Tuesday night, she promised to create No. 2 posts on each House committee to be filled by a Democrat with four terms or less in the House. When the post of assistant Democratic leader (now filled by Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, who is also 76) is vacant, it will be filled via an election with a member who has served three terms or less. (The No. 2 House Democrat, Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, is 77.) Other offers were made along with a vow to fight any effort by the Republican leadership and Mr. Trump to privatize the Veterans Affairs hospitals and add private insurance vouchers to compete with    Medicare.",0
18047,Justin Moore: Impossible to ’Rationalize’ with Gun Control Crowd,"In an interview this week with Town Hall, country music star Justin Moore described attempting to engage with gun control advocates as a “misguided” attempt “to rationalize with irrational people. ”[“Misguided’ is the perfect word. I think ‘misinformed’ is another,” he told the outlet.  According to Town Hall, Moore explained that he sees gun control as a “cop out” by weak politicians as a way for them to blame the gun instead of the criminal who uses the gun for ill. Moore said: Mental health is the real problem. If it wasn’t guns, it would be knives, etc. To blame it on the tool being used, in my opinion, is ignorant. They want to put a   over a gaping wound in my opinion. You’re trying to rationalize with irrational people. It’s impossible. The problem isn’t the NRA, we’re not the ones out there doing extreme things. These comments square perfectly with Moore’s new song “Guns. ” The lyrics of the second verse and chorus provide a clear expression of his view of Second Amendment rights: If there ever was a time we need ’em, I’d say it be today. When we’re letting them terrorists watch cable TVAnd walk out of Guantanamo Bay. I just try to do the right thing and raise my family in this land.

EXPRESS Around 680 troops from 32 NATO states and partner countries – including Israel and Ukraine – have been carrying out drills in Montenegro since Monday. Joint exercises codenamed Crna Gora 2016 are taking places until November 4 testing Western allies responses to a number of disaster scenarios, including floods and chemical spills. At the same time, a few miles over the border in Serbia 150 paratroopers from Russian Airborne Troops will be conducting drills from November 2 for two weeks. The exercises will see hundreds of heavily-armed and battle-ready Russian and NATO troops placed within a few hundreds miles of each. Montenegro’s Deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said: “This is an opportunity to work with NATO during the four-day exercise to determine our capacity and the capabilities of our response to natural disasters, as well as to recognise our weaknesses and eliminate them in time. “Montenegro has demonstrated the ability as a future member of NATO, not only through organising this exercise, but also bearing its burden. “Montenegro has demonstrated the ability to not only willing to accept but also help realise partnership goals.” Slavic Brotherhood 2016 will involve Russian troops and Serbian and Belarusian forces. Fifty soldiers from the Russian Military Transport Aviation will take part along with combat vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and drones. Aleksandr Grushko, Russia’s NATO Representative, said of the latest drills: “NATO’s efforts have been changing the very essence of the military security in the regions which are adjacent to the Russian border.

18051,Video: How To Build A Simple Water Purifier That Turns Dirty Water And Even Salt Water Into Clean Fresh Pure Water,"Share on Facebook You've got to hand it to this guy for such an ingenious, yet simple design. The how-to example in the video below is made from approximately 12 feet of copper tubing plus a few fittings (the stainless steel tube option is shown too). Follow the instructions in the video below to learn how to build it yourself. If a torch isn't something you have in your tool kit you can find “push on” fittings from a hardware store that you won't need to solder. NOTE: It is absolutely imperative if you do choose to solder your device, that you use lead-free solder. Prior to 1986, solder in the U.S. contained an alarmingly high content of lead. Chances are, if you live in a house built before the 1980's your tap water is contaminated with the neurotoxin lead due to leeching solder on your water pipes. All the more reason to filter your water with a device like this! Lead solder was the industry standard after all. Watch below: We don't have a water problem.

18052,"World Proud Of Its Calm, Measured Response To Trump Victory","0 Add Comment 
IN THE immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s shock win in the US presidential election, there were fears many people would become lost in grief, voicing their anger and sadness in all directions in a bid to vent their sense of profound fear and apprehension now that a person who has repeatedly uttered reprehensible beliefs occupies the most powerful position in the world. 
However, this proved not to be the case as WWN found out when it talked with numerous people in America and around the world, who exemplified the pride the human race now had in itself after being able to greet the horrific news in a calm and measured way. 
“It is when we’re faced with adversity, when hate shows it now owns the map, that we must forge a new path together to the brighter future we all want, but that future will be after a nuclear winter obviously,” a sobbing wreck of a man and a proud American, Philip Henry shared with WWN, as he polished his shotgun and thought about taking a walk alone to his shed out back. 
“The election clearly divided people, but it is time for the people to come together. Love trumps hate. A rising tide lifts all boats,” New Yorker Sarah Klein shared as she boarded a small sail boat, unsure of where she was going, “I have no idea how to sail but I’ll live like Kevin Costner in Waterworld if I have to,” she added. 
Many people echoed the sentiments of Hillary Clinton’s concession speech in which the Democrat urged everyone to work with Donald Trump and give the man who called Mexicans rapists and murderers and called for a ban on Muslims the benefit of the doubt. 
“Trump Tower doesn’t look all that structurally sound, we’re talking what? A few sticks of dynamite and the whole thing comes down. Just asking for a friend, obviously,” shared another New Yorker we spoke to. 
It is believed the number of people placing their children in pods and launching them into space in the hope they reach a more tranquil planet with a brighter future elsewhere are still in the minority. 
The rational and reasoned response was also experienced outside of America where, although people acknowledged the fact they’ve heard every word uttered from the president elect, they suspect everything will be fine. 
“Sure, what difference does it make, be grand I’m sure,” shared Dubliner Rebecca Kelly, fresh from pulling out all of her hair in a panic, and disconnecting her TV, radio and internet for at least four years.

18053,How Behavioral Economics Can Produce Better Health Care - The New York Times,"Consider the following. I’m a physician at the end of more than a decade of training. I’ve dissected cadavers in anatomy lab. I’ve pored over tomes on the physiology of disease. I’ve treated thousands of patients with ailments as varied as hemorrhoids and cancer. And yet the way I care for patients often has less to do with the medical science I’ve spent my career absorbing than with habits, environmental cues and other subtle nudges that I think little about. I’ll sometimes prescribe a particular brand of medication not because it has proved to be better, but because it happens to be the default option in my hospital’s electronic ordering system. I’m more likely to wash my hands  —   an activity so essential for safe medical care that it’s arguably malpractice not to do so  —   if a poster outside your room prompts me to think of your health instead of mine. I’ll more readily change my practice if I’m shown data that my colleagues do something differently than if I’m shown data that a treatment does or doesn’t work. These confessions can be explained by the field of behavioral economics, which holds that human   departs frequently, significantly and predictably from what would be expected if we acted in purely “rational” ways. People don’t always make decisions  —   even hugely important ones about physical or financial    —   based on careful calculations of risks and benefits. Rather, our behavior is powerfully influenced by our emotions, identity and environment, as well as by how options are presented to us. People overwhelmingly tend to stick with default options when given a choice (organ donation rates are over 90 percent in countries where citizens need to override a default and opt out of donation compared with 4 to 27 percent where they much choose to opt in). People are more sensitive to losses than commensurate gains (losing $100 feels twice as bad as winning $100 feels good). We tend to overvalue the present (most of us prefer one free coffee now to two free coffees next week). And more choice isn’t always good (people are less likely to buy a product if they’re given dozens of options instead of just a few). We in the medical community have only recently started to explore how behavioral economics can improve health. As with any hot field, there’s always the possibility of hype. But these insights might be particularly valuable in health care because medical   is permeated with uncertainty, complexity and emotion  —   all of which make it hard to weigh our options. A leader of this movement is Dr. Kevin Volpp, a physician at the University of Pennsylvania and founding director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics. He designs randomized trials around some of health care’s most important challenges: nudging doctors to provide   care ensuring patients take their medications and helping consumers choose better health plans. “There’s starting to be a broad recognition that   environments in health care could better reflect how doctors and patients actually make decisions,” he said. Dr. Volpp, whose work is used by both the public and private sector, recently collaborated with CVS Caremark to test which financial incentives are most effective for getting employees to quit smoking. Employees were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first was “usual care,” in which they received educational materials and free smoking cessation aids. The second was a reward program: Employees could receive up to $800 over six months if they quit. The third was a deposit program, in which smokers initially forked over $150 of their money, but if they quit, they got their deposit back along with a $650 bonus. Compared with the usual care group, employees in both incentive groups were substantially more likely to be   at six months. But the nature of the incentives mattered. Those offered the reward program were far more likely to accept the challenge than those offered the deposit program. But the deposit program was twice as effective at getting people to quit  —   and five times as effective as just pamphlets and Nicorette gum. Parting with your own money is painful. But it is effective. That’s also a lesson in   research on getting people to lose weight and exercise more. One recent study gave incentives to patients by entering them into lotteries or into deposit contracts for meeting weight loss goals. Those in the lottery group were eligible for a daily lottery prize with frequent small payouts and occasional large rewards  —   but only if they clocked in at or below their weight loss goal. People in the deposit group invested their own money (generally a few dollars a day) which was then matched by researchers. They’d get their money back  —   and then some  —   if they met their goal at the end of the month. At four months, both incentive groups had lost more than three times as much weight as the control group (about 14 pounds versus four pounds) but the deposit group lost slightly more than the lottery group. A similar study found that patients were more likely to walk 7, 000 steps a day if they were given an upfront payment  —   part of which had to be returned each day that they didn’t meet their exercise goal  —   compared with lotteries, rewards or   encouragement. Other work has highlighted the power of defaults  —   which in health care can have    consequences. And perhaps nowhere is doctors’ default tendency more apparent than in our bias toward aggressive    care that favors quantity over quality of life. With this in mind, researchers studied whether the type of    care patients choose is influenced by how we present the options. Terminally ill patients were randomly assigned to complete one of three advance directives: The first group received a form with the   approach preselected the second had the aggressive care box checked the third had both options left blank. Patients were free to override the default and select any option they preferred. Nearly 80 percent of patients in the comfort default group chose comfort, while only 43 percent in the aggressive care default group did. (  percent of patients without an embedded default opted for comfort.) It seems, then, that even critically important decisions about how we want to live our final days are affected by what comes   on the menu we’re given. Health insurers are also betting that behavioral economics can improve quality and lower costs. Blue Cross Blue Shield (B. C. B. S.) of Massachusetts is using a variety of behavioral economics concepts to pay its doctors  —   including peer comparisons and bonus payments for continuous improvement instead of absolute thresholds. In Hawaii, B. C. B. S. is experimenting with joint incentives for doctors and patients to meet diabetes care goals.   are jumping into the nudge game, too. The     Wellth, for example, has developed an app to reward patients for taking their medications. Nearly a third of prescriptions in the United States are never filled, and about half of all patients don’t take their medications as prescribed  —   even after   illnesses like heart attacks. Every year, medication nonadherence causes 125, 000 deaths and costs the health system up to $289 billion. Wellth thinks it can help patients manage themselves. “We want to give them immediate, tangible rewards for healthy behavior,” said Matthew Loper, the company’s C. E. O. and  . “But ultimately, we’re in the business of habit formation. We want behaviors to stick. ” Say a patient is discharged from the hospital after a heart attack. She downloads the Wellth app, and the company deposits $150 into her account, which she gets to keep if she takes all her medications for three months. Every morning, Wellth sends her a reminder to take her pills. If she snaps a selfie while taking her medicine, she keeps the money. If she forgets, she gets additional notifications over the course of the day, and maybe a text or two. If she misses the day’s assignment altogether, she loses $2. If she misses several days in a row, she loses $2 for each day and gets a phone call in addition. A more complete view of human behavior seems necessary for more effective medicine. Health is fundamentally the product of myriad daily decisions made by doctors and patients, and by uncovering what truly motivates us, we may be able to nudge one another toward wiser decisions and healthier lives.",0
18054,Trump Administration Is Said to Be Working to Loosen Counterterrorism Rules - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump administration is exploring how to dismantle or bypass   constraints intended to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks, commando raids and other counterterrorism missions outside conventional war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. Already, President Trump has granted a Pentagon request to declare parts of three provinces of Yemen to be an “area of active hostilities” where looser battlefield rules apply. That opened the door to a Special Operations raid in late January in which several civilians were killed, as well as to the   series of American airstrikes targeting   Qaeda militants, starting nearly two weeks ago, the officials said. Mr. Trump is also expected to sign off soon on a similar Pentagon proposal to designate parts of Somalia to be another such   zone for 180 days, removing constraints on airstrikes and raids targeting people suspected of being militants with the   group the Shabab, they said. Inside the White House, the temporary suspension of the limits for parts of Yemen and Somalia is seen as a test run while the government considers whether to more broadly rescind or relax the   rules, said the officials, who described the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity. The move to open the throttle on using military force  —   and accept a greater risk of civilian casualties  —   in troubled parts of the Muslim world comes as the Trump administration is also trying to significantly increase military spending and cut foreign aid and State Department budgets. The proposal to cut     budgets, however, is meeting with stiff resistance from some senior Republicans on Capitol Hill, as well as from top   and retired generals and admirals, who fear perpetual conflicts if the root causes of instability and terrorism are not addressed. “Any budget we pass that guts the State Department’s budget, you will never win this war,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said during a hearing last week. Referring to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, he added, “As a matter of fact, ISIL will be celebrating. ” In a sign of mounting concern over the government’s policy review, more than three dozen members of America’s national security establishment have urged Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to maintain the thrust of the   principles for counterterrorism missions, saying strict standards should be maintained for using force outside traditional war zones. The former officials, in a letter sent on Sunday to Mr. Mattis, warned that “even small numbers of unintentional civilian deaths or injuries  —   whether or not legally permitted  —   can cause significant strategic setbacks,” increasing violence from militant groups or prompting partners and allies to reduce collaboration with the United States. Indeed, immediately after the Special Operations raid on Jan. 29, Yemeni officials suspended further commando missions, pending an assessment of what went wrong, although they later backtracked. The letter’s 37 signatories included John E. McLaughlin, who was the acting C. I. A. director for President George W. Bush Lisa O. Monaco, President Barack Obama’s Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser and Matthew G. Olsen, who served as a national security official in the Bush Justice Department and as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center in the Obama administration. The White House did not respond to a request for an interview about this article. Mr. Obama imposed the   rules in May 2013 as part of an effort to recalibrate counterterrorism operations after he had overseen a steep increase in military and C. I. A. drone strikes in places like Yemen and tribal Pakistan. Critics, including inside the government, worried that the strikes were causing too many civilian casualties, driving terrorist recruitment and undermining support among local partners in the regions. In response, the Obama administration developed the rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance. Under those rules, cabinet officials generally must agree in   deliberations that a proposed target away from a traditional war zone poses a threat to Americans. That is intended to limit strikes targeting generic groups of suspected   foot soldiers. And there must be “near certainty” that no civilians will be killed. By contrast, in a standard war zone, military commanders can approve a strike without interagency review in Washington, and some civilian casualties are acceptable under the laws of war, as long as they are deemed necessary and proportionate to a legitimate military objective. Military operators have chafed under the 2013 rules, but the Obama administration saw them as a signature accomplishment in the era of drones and   war on terrorism. In his last year in office, Mr. Obama issued an executive order requiring the government to disclose annually its official estimate of civilian and combatant deaths from counterterrorism airstrikes away from war zones. Still, in its final year in power, the Obama administration declared the area around Surt, Libya, to be an “area of active hostilities. ” It then started a sustained campaign of 495 airstrikes targeting Islamic State militias there. Mr. Obama revoked the Surt declaration hours before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. The Obama administration also permitted the Defense Department to carry out an escalated campaign of airstrikes last year in Somalia that the United States Africa Command started without going through the process laid out by the 2013 rules. Instead, those airstrikes were justified under an expansive theory of collective   to protect African Union and Somali forces being trained and advised by the United States. Against that backdrop, officials said, both the Central Command, which oversees military activity in Yemen, and Africa Command, which oversees it in Somalia, had already been developing proposals by   to ask for parts of Yemen and Somalia to be declared   zones, officials said. They submitted those to the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s “J5” directorate, which handles strategic plans and policy. As a result, the Pentagon was in a position to swiftly bring the ideas forward to Mr. Trump, whose inauguration raised expectations that the White House would be more permissive. The officials said that Mr. Mattis signed   memos to Mr. Trump asking for each authority, backed by about five pages of supporting material, within days of Mr. Trump’s becoming president in January. Several officials said Mr. Trump signed off on making parts of Yemen an   zone at the same dinner with Mr. Mattis five days after his inauguration where he approved the   raid on a Qaeda compound in Yemen. At the time, they said, the expectation was that the Somalia proposal would be swiftly signed, too, and that the larger 2013 rules could be jettisoned swiftly. On Jan. 28, Mr. Trump signed a presidential national security memorandum directing the military to give him a plan within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State. It said the plan should include “recommended changes to any United States rules of engagement and other United States policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force,” a veiled reference to rescinding the 2013 limits on airstrikes. But the momentum for rapid change broke, the officials said, after the Yemen raid, which resulted in numerous civilian deaths, including of children the death of a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 and the wounding of three others and the loss of a $75 million aircraft. As a result, Mr. Trump’s national security advisers  —   first Michael T. Flynn, who has since resigned, and now Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster  —   have slowed the review process down while letting operations in Yemen, and soon Somalia, play out as test runs, the officials said.",0
18055,Newt Gingrich goes berserk when Fox News Megyn Kelly referred to Trump as a sexual predator,"License DMCA 
In an explosive interview, Newt Gingrich became completely unhinged, verbally attacking Fox News' Megyn Kelly for referring to Trump as a sexual predator. Throughout the interview, Newt Gingrich seemed to live in an alternate state of reality. He continued to discount polls that show Trump losing badly. He refused to acknowledge that all the tossup states are moving towards Clinton. 
The interview was already contentious when a couple of words from Megyn Kelly turned it explosive. (Video here .) 
""You want to know why Trump has had a rough time?"" Newt Gingrich asked. 
""If Trump is a sexual predator,"" Megyn Kelly said. ""That is ..."" - Advertisement - 
""He is not a sexual predator,"" Newt Gingrich shouted. 
""That's your opinion,"" Kelly said. ""I am not taking a position on it."" 
""You could not defend that statement,"" an unhinged Gingrich shouted. ""Now I am sick and tired of people like you, using language that's inflammatory, that's not true."" 
""Excuse me Mr. Speaker,"" Kelly interjected. ""You have no idea whether it is true or not. What we know is that at least ..."" 
""Neither do you,"" Gingrich shouted. - Advertisement - 
""That's right,"" Kelly replied. ""And I am not taking a position on it unlike you. So what I said is incorrect?"" 
""Yes you are,"" Gingrich replied. ""When you use the words you took a position. And that is very unfair of you Megyn. I think that is exactly the bias people are upset by."" 
""I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,"" Kelly replied. ""What I said is if -- no, no, no, -- let me make my point and then I will give you the floor. What I said is if Trump is a sexual predator, then it is a big story. And what we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will. That's what we saw. Then we saw ten women come forward after he denied actually doing it at the debate to say that was untrue. 'He did it to me. He did it to me.' We saw reporters. We saw people who had worked with him; people from Apprentice and so on and so forth. He denies it all, which is his right. We don't know what the truth is. My point to you is, as a media story we don't get to say the ten women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir."" 
Gingrich then went into full spin mode. He attempted to characterize the media as biased for covering more about the growing Trump sexual predator scandal than Clinton speeches to banks, a false equivalency. He then unleashed his anger and abuse again.",0

British naturalists are concerned by a survey which suggests that nearly 80% of British mammals are, in fact, computer generated for John Lewis adverts. ‘It does explain some, rather odd, behaviour,’ said Chris Packham. ‘And also why London Zoo ordered those giant 4k screens last year – I did wonder why the badger enclosure offered me the chance to place a bet and the Nigerian antelope told me he could give me $37,000,000 if I gave him my bank details’.

18057,Strange People Who Shifted to Other Dimensions,"Mysterious Universe 
Do other realities brush up against our own? Are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some thin, untraceable veil separating us? The idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not new, yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the now? Are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to see? I have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at Mysterious Universe before , and here I will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions real, but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked away, whether intentional or not. 
In the September, 1956 issue of Fate Magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in 1934. According to the report, in the fall of that year a woman by the name of Miriam Golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her fiancee in Chicago. The elevator was crowded, and when Miriam made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one. That was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at all, but rather an expansive train station. 
The enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered activity, with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air. There seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before. The confused Miriam made her way to an information booth to ask where she was, but found that the woman working there completely ignored her, as if she weren’t there at all. Perplexed, Miriam followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street outside, and she emerged out into a mild, sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than fall, in a place that was most certainly not Chicago. 
She wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her. At some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even there, and Miriam approached him wondering what was going on. The boy was able to actually see and respond to her, and looked in her direction, the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this strange, surreal place. As she approached, the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to Miriam, smiled slightly and purportedly saying: “I guess they let you off at the wrong stop, too.” 
The two lost people walked together down the street in confusion, the whole time completely ignored by those around them, and the boy told Miriam of what had happened to him. He claimed that he had been playing tennis in Lincoln, Nebraska, in the United States, and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes. When he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train terminal, which had turned out to be the exact same station into which Miriam had enigmatically entered from the elevator. 
The two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to water, and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary. To Miriam’s astonishment, one of the women was oddly her fiancee’s sister. The women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to Miriam and her companion. This encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the sandbar, which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach. Yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the waves, he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration. It was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air. 
Miriam closed her eyes in exasperation, disappointment, and exhaustion, and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space. After some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in Chicago, which seemed to be in the process of closing for the night, suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours. Disoriented, Miriam looked around for her fiancee but could not find him and decided to head back to his home. When she arrived, her fiancee was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home. Bizarrely, the fiancee’s sister, whom Miriam had seen on the mysterious sandbar earlier, claimed that she had seen Miriam in town and had even called out to her, but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her. Where did Miriam go during that time? Why should she see her fiancee’s sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in town, all while they could not reach across to communicate? Were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever understand? It is a mystery. 
Another strange article in the April, 1959 issue of Fate Magazine tells of the weird experience of a Frances E. Peterson of Keokuk, Iowa, who in 1935 was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to Missouri. On the way they noticed what looked like a quaint, scenic detour in the area of St. Patrick and they whimsically took it, driving along the rustic, quiet scenery until they reached the rim of an expansive valley. In addition to the picturesque scenery was the rather odd sight of several women in old-fashioned sun bonnets and long skirts and aprons busily pulling water from a well into simple wooden buckets and carrying them off on wooden poles balanced across their shoulders. There were men here as well, who all had beards and wore similarly old-fashioned clothes such as smocks and large black hats, and who were tending flocks of sheep and goats or collecting firewood. Enamored with the quaint, charming scene, they later asked locals what the settlement was, yet were told that no such place had ever existed. Convinced that it did indeed exist, Peterson and her husband returned to the area several times afterwards, but could find no sign of the valley they had seen or its unusual inhabitants, suggesting that either the family or the place they had visited had been temporarily transported over some little understood thin spot between realities. 
In another similarly strange road story from 1962, a Mr. R. W. Balcom and his wife were driving to Lake Tahoe from their home in Live Oak, California. The couple stopped at a quaint restaurant nestled away off of Highway 50 a few miles from Placerville. They had never noticed the restaurant there before in all of their years of traveling along the same route, even though it seemed from its weathered, rustic look to have been there for years, and they decided to stop there for a bite to eat. The food was described as being surprisingly good and the service was cordial and friendly, so they decided that they would visit again. On their return trip from Lake Tahoe they attempted to seek out the charming little restaurant to eat there again, but when they arrived at the location it was reportedly gone as if it had never been there at all. Perplexed, the couple supposedly spent three more weekends traveling through the area in an effort to find the restaurant that they were convinced was there, but never found it again. Did Balcom and his wife travel to a parallel universe for lunch? No one knows. 
An intriguing case of a mysterious doorway to another dimension and perhaps even through time itself occurred in 1956, when a treasure hunter by the name of Ron Quinn ventured with his brother Chuck and some friends into the remote and rugged mountains of Southeastern Arizona looking for mysterious lost Spanish treasures and gold mines. The case begins with high strangeness and only gets more bizarre as it goes on. Three weeks into their adventure, the treasure hunters set up camp one night, and that evening they were surprised to see two large balls of bluish green light floating about in the darkened, starry sky. The bewildered campers determined that these were not flares of any kind, nor any sort of known aircraft. The weird balls of light hovered about for several minutes before vanishing behind some mountain peaks. The next evening, the same phenomenon was witnessed again. When they mentioned the strange lights to a local cowboy named Louie Romero, he informed them that the unexplained lights were a recurring phenomenon in the area, and had been seen as far back as 1939. The group would spot the strange lights several more times over the course of their excursion. Ron and Chuck Quinn 
At one point during their travels, the group passed by what looked like a stone archway, which stood out as something of an anomaly upon the landscape, looking decidedly out of place, yet they didn’t think much of it until later, when they spoke to a Native local named John, who claimed that the archway had long been surrounded by strange stories and rumors that anyone who entered the doorway never came out, and that objects thrown in would not emerge from the other side, earning the structure the name “Doorway of the Gods.” There were also stories of the archway shimmering, and of strange figures lurking around it dressed in old fashioned clothing that did not seem to be ghosts, as they disturbed the gravel where they stepped and cast shadows, yet they would suddenly vanish. There were also tales of camps near the archway that had been mysteriously abandoned and of prospectors who had never returned from the area. John relayed his own tale of strangeness concerning the archway, claiming that one dark and stormy day he had visited it and peered through it to see that, although the scenery was the same, the sky was oddly clear and blue on the other side. When he looked around the edge of the doorway, the clouds were once again dark and thick, hanging menacingly over the scene, and the bizarre sight with its contrasting views frightened him. 
Enthralled with these odd stories, Quinn and his group went back through the perilous rocky terrain to find the mysterious archway and investigate it. They managed to locate the strange looking structure once again, and upon closer inspection it proved to be surrounded with an unusually large deposit of geodes, some of which were broken open with their interiors glittering in the sun. The archway itself was measured as being around 7 feet high and 5 feet wide, with columns of andesite 15 inches diameter and it stood beside a steep, rocky slope. After checking it out, the team went to work testing out the weird stories by throwing various rocks through the opening, but the rocks all mundanely fell to the ground on the other side and there was no sign of anything remotely mysterious whatsoever. Increasingly skeptical, some of the members of the team boldly put their arms through without incident, although no one was willing to try stepping all the way through. After around an hour of this, they departed no closer to understanding the supposed mystery of this location. However, a weird series of events would unfold in the coming days that would make them think that something strange was going on. Chuck Quinn with some of the geodes from the site 
One day as they were checking out the portal yet again and collect some of the geodes, Roy and another member of the team, Walt, noticed that the stone portal seemed to be shimmering as if simmering in intense heat, even though it was a cold January day. The odd shimmering allegedly lasted a few minutes, during which time both men claimed that they could feel a building pressure within their ears, before the shimmering and the weird physical sensation slowly ebbed away. The inexplicable event spooked both of them, especially Roy, who vowed never to go anywhere near the archway again. On another occasion, the group came across another group of three treasure hunters who claimed that they had also camped out near the mysterious stone portal. The group claimed that that evening their camp had been hit by what sounded like rain hitting their tents, even though it was a clear night. Looking out of their tents, they were met with the sight of small, reddish brown pebbles around the size of a pea falling in great numbers from above. The pebbles were found to be warm to the touch and there was no explanation for where they came from. They had seemed to be made of some king of iron ore. 
All of these escalating odd occurrences would point to something decidedly strange going on at the archway, but the most bizarre incident would happen years after the expedition was over. Four years after that fateful treasure hunt, on October 14, 1973, Chuck Quinn was compelled to make a personal trip to the site of the stone portal that had eluded their understanding, and arrived at the canyon that led up to the slopes that would lead up to the site. Chuck went about climbing up the steep, rocky slopes towards the archway, stopping for a breather about halfway up the harrowing climb. It was here as he looked out west over the majestic scenery all around him that he noticed that there was a canyon that should not have been there. Baffled, he made his way back down the slope to enter from the east, and it was here that he realized that in fact he was in the same canyon he had been in before, only he had somehow been transported 250 yards down the canyon he had hiked along, and to another slope that was facing south rather than west. The strange event convinced him that indeed there was something strange going on here, and hastily left the scene. Was this some sort of doorway to another dimension or merely tall tales? 
One wonders if perhaps some of the more bizarre vanishings and reappearances of people also have some form of interdimensional shift at their core. At about 7:00 P.M. on August 15, 1960, 6-year-old Kathy Cramer, of Wood’s Hole, Massachusetts simply vanished from her room in her home. Her parents had checked on her when she was sleeping one minute, and the next she was gone without a trace. When authorities arrived the house was searched top to bottom, and no signs of forced entry or a struggle could be found. Cathy’s bed seemed to be in a peaceful state, with no sign of being disturbed in any kind of confrontation. The window to the room was also closed and showed no signs of anyone coming in or going out that way. 
An intensive search was immediately launched, composed of hundreds of people including police, firemen, volunteers, airmen from nearby Otis Air Force Base, and bloodhounds, as well as the Coast Guard scouring the nearby coast, yet absolutely no evidence of the missing girl could be found anywhere. She had simply vanished off the face of the earth. Then later, at 3AM on that same evening, Cathy’s very worried parents went into to her room to be startled by the sight of their missing daughter sleeping peacefully in her bed as if she had never been gone. When she was asked about where she had been, the girl gave the cryptic response of “I’m not telling.” What in the world happened to this little girl? How could a 6-year-old disappear from her bed, elude an intensive search by various professionals, and then reappear fast asleep exactly where she had vanished? Is this also perhaps an example of someone crossing through the veil between realities to pass temporarily into some parallel world or dimension? The only person who knows the answer to that is Cathy Cramer herself, and she’s not telling. 
So are any of these accounts somehow anchored in any way to reality as we know it? Are these the realm of the lost mind untethered, spinning fantastical tales either out of hallucination, insanity, or an irrational attempt to make sense of distorted perceptions? Can this all simply be explained away somehow or is there a genuine phenomenon hinting at forces of the universe we have yet to comprehend buried within these disparate accounts? Are we perhaps just one of many alternate realities stacked upon one another and which between slips, shifting and travel are possible? The answers are elusive, and we may continue to pour over and debate them forever. However as long as there is the probability and possibility of worlds beyond our own there will always be those who look out into our universe, or perhaps inward, to seek to try to grasp just what this all might mean. In the meantime, cases like this will remain a tantalizing peek into what just may be out there beyond our grasp to conceive of it.",0
18058,EXCLUSIVE - Islamic State Supporters Celebrate London Terror: Allah Will Reward You for Running over Infidels,"Writing in an encrypted chat room, Islamic State sympathizers and militants hailed Saturday’s deadly attacks in London and typically called for more such carnage throughout Europe and the West. [Breitbart Jerusalem obtained access to correspondence posted in a closed chat group that utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service. The group serves as an internal Twitter of sorts for IS jihadists and sympathizers, and has been used in the past to issue IS communications.  No group has claimed responsibility for the terrorist massacre in London yet in which seven people were murdered and dozens more were injured near the London Bridge and Borough Market. The attack was carried out mere hours after an   news service had posted a message on Telegram calling for supporters to “gain benefit from Ramadan” and “kill the civilians of the Crusaders. Run over them by vehicles. ” The Telegram messages following the attack  —   as obtained by Breitbart Jerusalem  —   were full of similar incitement. IS member Abi Abdullah Almasri (the Egyptian) wrote, “Thanks to Allah, thank you, thanks to Allah, Allah is great, thanks to Allah from faith that he will make his promise reality and give victory (to the faithful). Allah will bless the lions. Allah will bless the lone wolves. Allah will reward you as long as you run over and stab these infidels in the depths of their countries. Put fear into their eyes, increase your hits, increase your attacks, don’t let them feel secure in their countries. ” Another Telegram account under the name of “The Chechen Syrian” wrote in the group: “We wait impatiently for such news. We wait for the official media of the Caliphate to bring us more such tidings on the actions of these lone wolves in the infidel countries as they turn these countries into military bases and sow fear among them with the help of Allah. “The infidels don’t feel safe despite having the newest planes, missiles and guns. A number of lone wolves have turned the centers of their lives into a hell that’s burning them. Our brothers have sworn to turn Europe into a military base. May Allah bless your graves, you lone wolves. ” Abou Alfarouq Omar then wrote, “Thank Allah before and after. Sheikh Osama (Bin Laden) may Allah receive him as a martyr, said: ‘You won’t be safe as long as the children of Muslims and the faithful don’t live in safety.’ These were the just and sincere words from the mouth of a leader who was convinced that Allah will grant us victory. Today our brothers are realizing his (bin Laden’s) will with minimum resources and knives and are turning the infidel and atheist countries fighting against the religion of Allah and the Muslims into a huge destruction, with the help of Allah. ” Abou Qatada Almosuly wrote, “Whoever thought that the killing of Muslims in Raqqa and Mosul would pass without punishment was deluding himself. These infidels must pay a heavy price, even if those who committed the attack in London aren’t from the Caliphate, then as lone wolves. “We will exact further cost not with knives and   but with bombs and explosives and the moment will come when our suicide attackers disappear in the cities of Europe. Our children and our families won’t be alone in paying the price and their blood won’t be the only blood spilled. All the planes and warships won’t prevent the infidel countries from paying the price. You will find we have strength that you haven’t met yet and you will see more attacks that will continue as long as you continue to bomb the Muslims and the faithful. ” The New York Times reported on the timeline of Saturday’s London attack: • In the attack, the men drove a vehicle onto the sidewalk on London Bridge, striking several pedestrians, around 10 p. m. local time, according to London’s Metropolitan Police Service. • The police said the vehicle left London Bridge and drove to nearby Borough Market, where the suspects got out and began stabbing people, including an   British Transport Police officer who was responding to the scene at London Bridge. The police said he received serious but not   injuries. • The police said they shot and killed the three male suspects in Borough Market within eight minutes of receiving the first reports of an incident on London Bridge.

18059,"‘Chairman Cash’ – John Podesta is Paid $7,000 a Month by Foundation Run by Banker With Ties to Financial Crisis","at 9:45 am Leave a comment 
Last Friday, I published a post titled, John Podesta’s Sister-in-Law Lobbied For Raytheon While Hillary Was Secretary of State , which understandably got totally buried in the madness surrounding the latest FBI news. Here’s the first paragraph of that post: 
The Podesta family seems particularly adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public. Earlier this year, I highlighted how John Podesta’s brother Tony was paid $140,000 per month by the medieval monarchy of Saudi Arabia. After all, who cares about women’s rights when the pay is good? 
Indeed, it’s not just relatives of Podesta who know how to rake in the cash. John is no slouch either, as Politico explained in an article published earlier today. 
Here are a few excerpts: 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, last year signed a $7,000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Clinton donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse, hacked emails show. 
In February of last year, as Podesta was working to lay the groundwork for Clinton’s soon-to-launch campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he signed the contract with the Sandler Foundation, which was started by Herb Sandler and his late wife Marion Sandler. 
The contract — a copy of which was included in emails illegally obtained from Podesta’s Gmail account and disseminated Monday by WikiLeaks — is still active, according to Herb Sandler, who said that it calls for Podesta to provide advice on grant-making and other foundation functions. 
It’s unusual for the full-time chairman of a general-election presidential campaign to maintain an active side deal with a major donor to that campaign — let alone to raise money from that donor for the campaign. 
The WikiLeaks cache shows that Podesta provided Sandler with philanthropic advice and assortments of cheeses and pastas as gifts on the holidays, while Sandler offered all manner of political observations and once tried to get Podesta to arrange for former President Bill Clinton to write a blurb for a book written by one of Sandler’s friends. 
Lobster risotto? 
But Sandler brushed aside any concerns about potential conflicts of interest. 
“I have never asked for anything of any political person — zero requests ever,” Sandler said. “If they’re responsive, it’s because they regard me as thoughtful, and a major contributor to Democratic causes,” Sandler said, adding that Podesta “knows that he doesn’t get bullshit from me. He knows I have no hidden agenda. He knows that my values are similar to his and that we care about people and not the billionaires, even though I ended up by some crazy thing to be one.” 
Neither Podesta nor the Clinton campaign responded to questions about the contract. 
Herb Sandler’s Clinton-related giving picked up last December after a visit from Podesta. 
The campaign’s finance director Dennis Cheng responded “ Great!! ,” calling Podesta “#ChairmanCash.” 
“Chairman cash.” A new meme has just been born. 
The very next day, Sandler gave $1.5 million to Priorities USA Action, to which he has now given a total of $3 million, FEC records show. 
The family’s fortune comes from the savings and loan institution that Herb and Marion Sandler ran for decades, a bank that became World Savings. It would end up making boatloads of cash from a type of adjustable rate mortgage that other lenders would later adopt, securitize and sell in a way that some have blamed for contributing to the housing bubble that burst in 2008. Not long before the burst and subsequent recession, the Sandlers sold the bank for $25.5 billion to Wachovia, earning $2.6 billion off the sale and donating most of their net worth to their foundation. Wachovia was later acquired by Wells Fargo. 
The Sandlers met Podesta when they helped seed the Center for American Progress, the think tank he started in 2003 as a sort of Democratic administration in exile during George W. Bush’s presidency. Tax filings show that the Sandler Foundation has donated more than $37 million over the years to CAP, which worked to support President Barack Obama’s administration but has always been seen as more aligned with Clinton. 
Center for American Progress…where have we heard that before? Oh yeah, in last week’s post, Dennis Kucinich’s Extraordinary Warning on D.C.’s Think Tank Warmongers , we learned: The self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed, and estimates America’s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on “mission accomplished.” CAP, according to a report in The Nation, has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria. 
Remember peasants, war is ok if “liberals” do it. Now back to Politico … 
The WikiLeaks emails reveal that Podesta and his team at the Center for American Progress discussed how to push back on scrutiny of the Sandlers related to the 2008 housing collapse. That included an October 2008 “Saturday Night Live” sketch in which an actor playing Herb Sandler thanked members of Congress “for helping block congressional oversight of our corrupt activity.” 
Podesta wrote to his colleagues that he’d talked to Herb Sandler, and “they are obviosly [sic] upset. Weird that snl should pick them out.” 
After doing some research, a subordinate replied that “it appears default rates on their stuff was high (herb says not more so than others) and the losses were key to almsot wachovia failure — athough herb emphasizes that they were only one of the institutions problems.” 
Sandler told POLITICO that any suggestion that his bank’s products contributed to the collapse were “a bunch of bullshit,” pointing out that their bank used a risk-averse approach to their loans, which had among the lowest default rate in the industry. 
But Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center, a conservative nonprofit that monitors the giving of major liberal donors including Sandler, argued that Podesta’s newly revealed contractual relationship with Sandler stood in stark contrast to Clinton’s efforts to cast herself as tough on the financial industry. 
“This is another instance where the Clinton campaign has been revealed to have surprising links to some of the most dubious parts of the finance industry,” Walter said. 
The Sandlers’ philanthropy increasingly has focused on fighting financial inequality and the role of big money in politics — a subject about which Herb Sandler and Podesta emailed frequently, according to WikiLeaks. 
Interesting considering he is big money in politics, and seems to have no problem endlessly cheerleading the chosen candidate of America’s oligarchs. 
Sandler explained to POLITICO that during the process of working to launch the center, he realized “we had been picking his brain ad nauseum” for years without paying Podesta as a consultant — a scenario Sandler called “very unfair.” That led to the consulting contract, which Sandler cast as “a ripoff” for Podesta. “I’d pay a lot more for that advice,” Sandler said, calling Podesta “one the most intelligent, decent, thoughtful human beings I’d ever met.” 
In March, as Clinton’s Democratic primary campaign against Bernie Sanders grew increasingly bitter, Sandler emailed Podesta just to check up. 
“How are you?” Sandler wrote . “MIss you.” 
Call me crazy, but if he was really so focused on solving income inequality why wasn’t he supporting Bernie Sanders?

18061,Tebow’s 2nd Act Has South Carolina Giving Him the 1st-Class Treatment - The New York Times,"COLUMBIA, S. C.  —   In the autumn of 2007, Tim Tebow came to this town to deliver a crushing blow. Then the Florida Gators’ dynamic quarterback, Tebow cemented his destiny as that year’s Heisman Trophy winner by accounting for seven touchdowns against the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. Sitting in the stands in   Stadium that day, and watching glumly, was the Honorable Stephen K. Benjamin, who at that point was still three years away from being elected mayor here. At the end of Tebow’s display, Benjamin remembered having one thought: He was glad that Tebow was leaving town and hoped he was gone for good. Now, a decade later, Mayor Benjamin is thrilled to welcome Tebow back. “We are so glad he is finally on our side,” Benjamin said. “It’s a heck of a story. ” Tebow departed Columbia 10 years ago as an enemy in shoulder pads. But this past Thursday, he returned as a hero with a bat, bringing his remarkable, and sometimes polarizing, appeal to a town  —   and a region  —   ready to embrace him. In his very first   for the Columbia Fireflies, the Mets’ Class A affiliate in the South Atlantic League, Tebow added another chapter to his enduring story by blasting a home run, delighting the 10, 000 fans who had come to watch him, many of them wearing Tebow jerseys in all sorts of colors. On Sunday, Tebow hit his second home run in only four games, all of them wins for Columbia. Jeff Reed, 56, a lawn care specialist from nearby Blythewood, was in the crowd for Tebow’s first homer run on opening night. Reed had actually been a fan of Tebow the football player despite living in a rival Southeastern Conference city. When Reed’s wife went to Denver a few years back, she returned with a No. 15 shirt that Tebow wore when he played quarterback for the N. F. L. ’s Broncos. And for Tebow’s first game with the Fireflies, Reed wore it to the ballpark. “As soon as we heard he would be playing here, we bought tickets,” he said. So have fans from around the South Atlantic League, which includes teams from the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky and West Virginia, places where college football is king and where Tebow is revered for his gridiron prowess, his persona and, for many, his Christian faith. His baseball abilities are another matter. Still, Jason Freier, the owner of the Fireflies, said the team had been hoping for months  —   ever since the Mets signed Tebow last September on what almost seemed to be a whim  —   that he would be assigned to Columbia. In the end, Freier got his wish. Actually, Columbia was a logical place for Tebow, 29, to begin his professional baseball career. The South Atlantic League is a fairly low rung on the minor league ladder, making it a less challenging environment for an athlete who had been away from the sport for 12 years. But even if it made perfect sense for Tebow to start here, the Fireflies took nothing for granted. Over the past few months, they have been in constant communication with the Mets  —   in part at the urging of Benjamin, who said he pestered the Fireflies’ team president, John Katz, nonstop to prod the Mets. Freier said even fellow owners around the league were asking when the decision would be made official. They, too, were eager to start marketing their Tebow ticket packages for the dates when the Fireflies would visit their towns. Now, that marketing is in full force. “They tell me they have been selling well,” Freier said of the league’s other owners. “As soon as the announcement was made last month, about   friends in the business called and told me: ‘You won the lottery. It’s a marketing bonanza.’ It is as unique a set of circumstances as you will find. ” Freier, who owns two other minor league clubs, said that before Tebow arrived here, he and members of his staff researched the   set of circumstances: Michael Jordan’s foray into minor league baseball in 1994 for the Class AA Birmingham Barons. They read articles about that chapter of Jordan’s life, watched an ESPN documentary and spoke to people who were in Birmingham at the time. With that as preparation, they then welcomed Tebow to Columbia  —   the capital of South Carolina, with a population exceeding 130, 000  —   and got ready for the whirlwind he seems likely to stir up, some of it financial. “Does anybody think he is a legitimate baseball prospect?” said Robert Boland, the director of Ohio University’s   program. “Probably not. But Tebow will likely have an enormous effect on ticket and merchandise sales in a very powerful way. ” Normally, minor league teams market a   experience rather than individual players, because those players often spend no more than one season at a given minor league stop. Tebow, as is often the case, is the exception. However long he is in Columbia, he is almost certain to be the focus. The Fireflies’ souvenir shop sells   with only one player’s name on them  —   Tebow’s. Freier said that in 11 years owning three teams, he has seen such treatment extended to just one other minor leaguer. In that instance, a player named Josh Van Meter had been a star at Norwell High School in Indiana, and when he joined Freier’s Fort Wayne TinCaps, Freier made up shirts with the hometown hero’s name. Tebow, of course, is in a far different category. Freier said that when it became clear Tebow would be joining the Fireflies, national media executives told him that Tebow was second only to Tiger Woods over the past few decades when it came to measuring the appeal of an athlete in terms of online page views, clicks and overall video content. On a micro level, local businesses are hoping Tebow’s arrival radiates all the way to their cash registers. Scott Hall owns the Bone In BBQ food truck that parks outside the Fireflies’ stadium. While not a devout sports fan, he knew enough to compute Tebow’s potential impact on his business. “At first I was like, ‘Wait, isn’t this the wrong sport? ’” Hall said. “But we’re really excited he’s here. We want to get him out here and get a ton of barbecue in him. ” For Hall and others, the hope is that Tebow can thread the needle of being good enough to stay in the Fireflies’ lineup but not so good that the Mets quickly promote him. And despite his home run Thursday, a quick rise in the Mets’ system for Tebow seems unlikely. In his first two games, Tebow went two for 10 with four strikeouts as the Augusta Greenjackets quickly figured him out at the plate. In front of a little over 5, 000 people on Friday, Augusta even intentionally walked the bases loaded to have a lefty pitcher face the   Tebow, and he popped out to end that inning. By then, most of the two dozen members of the news media that had assembled for Tebow’s debut on Thursday were gone, leaving behind a famous athlete looking to settle into a    normal baseball routine while figuring out if he has what it takes to somehow make it all the way to the major leagues. That verdict may take a while, but not that long. “This is the ultimate    business,” Freier said. Clay Rapada, a former major league pitcher and the Augusta pitching coach, said he could see that Tebow had a plan when he got into the batter’s box. But Tebow’s development must be accelerated into a shorter time frame than the typical Class A player. “He hit a mistake,” Rapada said of the home run. Still, he noted, “that’s what the big boys in the major leagues get paid a lot of money to do. ” Tebow, who endured intense scrutiny playing in places like Gainesville in Florida or big cities throughout the N. F. L. knows that people are watching him again but shrugs off the pressure now back on his enormous shoulders. “All of my sports experiences helped me for a moment like this,” he said. “They all help. ” And after Thursday’s home run, and a     victory by the Fireflies, Tebow gave a rousing speech to a roomful of coaches and teammates. One of them was Dash Winningham, a    first baseman who is the Fireflies’ real   star. He grew up in Ocala, Fla. a short drive from Gainesville. When Winningham was a boy, Tebow was his favorite football player. “Where I come from, Tim Tebow is like a god,” Winningham said. “But he is really just one of the guys. A little older, maybe, but totally down to earth. Looking around during pregame introductions, it was pretty surreal to think that all of a sudden, we’re teammates. ” As part of those   ceremonies on Thursday, Benjamin threw out the first pitch, then went to the home dugout to shake hands with the man who made his Saturdays so miserable a decade ago. But now, Benjamin sees Tebow as a real attraction for his city, and maybe for the sport Tebow is trying to master. At least that was the prevailing feeling after Thursday’s game. “When you think about what he represents,” Benjamin said, “even in a Class A minor league system, he may in fact be the new face of baseball. ” That would seem to be an overstatement, but even a small dose of Tebowmania can have that effect.",0
18062,Adult Baptisms Skyrocket Due To Migrant Conversions,"The number of adult baptisms in the Austrian Catholic church has more than doubled over the last year. The church claims the rise is due to a huge influx of migrants from Afghanistan and Iran converting to Christianity. [The Archdiocese of Vienna has announced that 254 men and women were selected for baptism after completing the rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA) taking part in a baptism ceremony conducted by Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schönborn Die Presse reports.  The group of converts had to wait a year to be prepared for baptism  —   a recent move by the church due to the number of requests by Muslim asylum seekers for conversion. The baptism ceremony was not opened to the public due to the fears of many of the converts that they could face retaliation from other Muslims or even attacks against their family, particularly those who come from Iran. Cardinal Schönborn declared the day a celebration for the church, saying it was a  “a great and moving day for the Church of Vienna. ” “That they want to follow Christ and live in his fellowship is also a call to us  —   which we have the happiness and privilege of growing up in faith from childhood, but may have forgotten how precious this is,” he added. Schönborn, who many see as a likely successor to Pope Francis, has made headlines several times in recent months. In September he said that many Muslims actively sought to conquer Europe for Islam. Three months later he slammed European politicians and their migrant policies, saying the migrant crisis had gone too far and that it was better to help migrants where they lived. He added that he was shocked by the sheer number of migrants who have come to Europe in recent years. The conservative Cardinal has also been at odds with many European leaders in regards to U. S. President Donald Trump. In early January he compared Trump to former president Ronald Reagan saying, “Many also shook their heads when Ronald Reagan was elected: ‘For God’s sake, an actor from California!’ But Reagan was certainly one of the best presidents the U. S. ever had. So you should not be too quick to judge. ” The trend of conversions is also seen in neighbouring Germany, but some are sceptical of the motives of those converting. Two Syrian migrants living in Lebanon even admitted that they had converted because it gave them a better chance of claiming asylum in Europe.

18063,They Want Trump to Make the G.O.P. a Workers’ Party - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   By riding his appeal among   whites to the top of the Republican Party, Donald J. Trump has emboldened conservative thinkers to press their party of business and the privileged to reshape its economic canon to more directly benefit poorer workers it has often taken for granted. The policy prescriptions of these   reform conservatives, or “reformocons,” would not only break with some longtime Republican orthodoxy  —   disavowing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, for example  —   they would also counter more recent stances by Mr. Trump on trade and immigration. And because of a lack of policy specifics in Mr. Trump’s   campaign, reform conservatives see an opening through which to push their prescriptions. “What it means to be a conservative is up for grabs,” said Reihan Salam, the executive editor of the conservative National Review. Whether Mr. Trump prevails or the party is left to rebuild from defeat, these conservatives in think tanks, advocacy groups and the news media  —   and a few in political office  —   will be pressing for a new agenda: to update the   playbook with an eye to   voters without a college education who form the Republican base. Ronald Reagan’s notions that policies that benefit the rich and big business lift all incomes now appear outmoded in an era of rising wealth inequality and stagnant wages. The challenge to the party could be every bit as contentious as Mr. Trump’s ascent has been. Beyond conservative think tanks and activist circles, the new breed of conservatives has not made significant inroads among House Republicans, for instance. And even these Republicans do not agree on everything. But some common ideas suggest their proposed road map for the party: • Reject additional tax cuts for those making more than $250, 000 a year, but expand breaks for   and   workers through tax credits for children, the   tax credit or a new wage subsidy using tax dollars to bring low wages toward the local median level. • Promote the benefits of global trade agreements, but help displaced workers. • Rule out fully privatizing Social Security and Medicare, and reassure workers they will be exempt from  . • Acknowledge that universal health care is here to stay, but push for   changes. • Disavow mass deportations and promote the economic benefits of legalizing longtime workers who are in the country illegally, but reduce the legal entry of   immigrants. “What we have going on right now, and Trump’s position in the Republican Party, makes this recalibration that much more important, that much more urgent,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. “Some within the party,” he added, “have been all too willing to wear the label of the Republican Party as being the party of Wall Street, or the party of the top 1 percent. ” Although most of them oppose Mr. Trump’s candidacy  —   Mr. Salam called him “an overwhelmingly noxious and negative force”  —   these conservatives do credit him with engaging   voters and dealing them into the economic conversation. “The biggest thing that Trump offers these voters is finally somebody paying attention,” said Henry Olsen, a scholar at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. “Imagine that they’re the wallflowers at the high school dance and they’re sitting off, ignored by everybody. Suddenly, the football hero comes up and says, ‘Come dance with me.’ That’s intoxicating. ” Led by younger conservatives, the push for new approaches began in the past decade, as big spending and military interventions by the Bush administration and a   Congress vexed many in the party. Capturing the ferment was a 2008 book, “Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream,” by Mr. Salam and Ross Douthat, who is now a columnist for The New York Times. “The Trump phenomenon has really opened things up  —   people are more inclined to listen, elites within the party are more inclined to listen,” said Mr. Salam, who, with Mr. Douthat, recently updated their book’s theme in an opinion article in The Times. The authors wrote in their   that Mr. Trump’s white   supporters were “clearly voting against a party leadership that pays them lip service while ignoring their concerns”  —   a revulsion that will not disappear even if Mr. Trump does. Proponents of a new conservative agenda have critics in both parties. Democrats dismiss their ideas as repackaging a familiar   agenda. Some Republicans and conservative media figures like Rush Limbaugh condemn their cause as a return of moderate Republicanism or a capitulation to liberalism. Michael A. Needham, the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, said reform conservatives and Tea   organizations like his are allies in their desire to rewrite a “stale” economic agenda tilted to Republican donors. But he acknowledged differences in tactics and substance. His group and its allies favor conflict, like government shutdowns, for instance. And they still want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes for everyone. Yet conservative agitators were mostly talking among themselves until Mr. Trump toppled the party establishment, along the way flouting longstanding party dogma on taxes, trade and immigration. Democrats have long charged that   white Americans who vote heavily Republican do so against their economic interests. A new poll for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News had Hillary Clinton ahead over all but trailing Mr. Trump by 13 percentage points among whites without a college education and by 21 points among men in that group. Past polls had her even further behind with those   voters, however. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last week that the Democratic Party bore some responsibility. While its policies may be geared toward workers, he said, “The Democratic Party over all hasn’t spoken enough to those voters”  —   the “ordinary people busting their necks. ” It was an echo of the Republican   now playing out. For all of Mr. Trump’s outreach to   whites, Robert VerBruggen, the managing editor of The American Conservative, said the party platform that emerged from the Republican convention was further evidence of the gap between the party’s support from white   workers and its agenda that all but ignores them. “The breakdown of the working class was neglected,” he wrote in his magazine. “There seems to have been little discussion of the economic anxieties of working families, the safety net or the drug epidemic sweeping rural America. ” “Instead,” Mr. VerBruggen wrote, “their focus on the bottom half of the economic spectrum seems to have been limited to a debate about the purchase of unhealthy snacks with food stamps. ” Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the former domestic policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, even suggested that Republicans look for ways to harness labor unions for constructive   relationships. He also predicted more openness among conservatives to raising taxes when justified. “It’s hard to imagine the Grover Norquist tax pledge having the salience it once did,” Mr. Cass said, referring to the longstanding   vow that most Republican candidates take. “That model of ‘no tax increases, ever, under any circumstances’ I think is probably on its way out or gone. ” Mr. Norquist scoffed at the suggestion. “The pledge came out in ’86,” he said. “Every six months from then somebody has said, ‘Oh, the pledge won’t hold.’ ” It is, he added, “nonnegotiable. ”",0

18066,Brazil Suspends Sales of Tear Gas to Venezuela amid Increasing Police Violence - Breitbart,"The Brazilian government has suspended sales of tear gas to Venezuela amid increasing police violence, Reuters has reported. [In a move that will further isolate Venezuela’s socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro, Brazil’s Defense Ministry and Ministry of Foreign Relations reached the decision to halt sales after appeals from the country’s opposition.  On Friday, the Brazilian Defense Ministry confirmed it had canceled a shipment of gas canisters in April intended for the Venezuelan military, produced by the   weaponry company Condor Tecnologias   although it did not provide a reason for the decision. Condor has since confirmed it still has two ongoing contracts with the Venezuelan military but would not discuss their status. The company, which has previously received criticism for arming the militaries of Turkey and Bahrain, claimed that it did not consider the political leanings of their customers and warned that blocking their exports could “have dramatic consequences, since there may be no alternative for security forces other than using firearms. ” However, sources close to the decision told Reuters that “the (Brazilian) government decided to accept the opposition’s request because there’s a massacre in Venezuela,” while another government official said that the exporting of any other crowd control equipment would also be suspended. “(Brazil) did absolutely the correct thing in denying permission for the shipment,” said opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who still serves as the governor of Miranda. “We’re working on the others, the only (holdout) seems to be China. ” Meanwhile, opposition politician Jorge Millán also celebrated the decision, confirming that leaders had made multiple requests to stop Brazil providing “tools for repression. ” “We discovered that there were advanced negotiations for the purchase of material in Brazil and made a specific complaint,” Millán told O Globo. The decision comes amidst increasing police and military violence across Venezuela, as   protesters ratchet up the size and scale of their demonstrations calling for an election and as Maduro seeks to tighten his grip on power by rewriting the countries constitution. On Monday, Latin American leaders met for a summit in Cancun, Mexico, to discuss the escalating crisis, although they have yet to reach a consensus on the next steps to take. So far, an estimated 90 protesters have been killed since daily protests began in late March, as police use water cannons, rubber bullets, and smoke bombs to contain protesters. Images from inside the country have shown increasing police brutality. Last week, a    boy was “run over and tortured” by an armored vehicle driven by the Venezuelan National Guard in the city of Mérida. An audio recording obtained by the Miami Herald revealed a military general suggesting that police should start using sniper rifles to contain the protests. As many as eight Latin American countries have now signed a letter condemning an “excessive use of force by Venezuelan authorities against civilians who are protesting government measures that affect democratic stability and cause the loss of human life. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com.",0
18067,"Muslims Start Chanting Allah On Plane, Flight Attendant Quickly Shuts Them Up","Muslims Start Chanting Allah On Plane, Flight Attendant Quickly Shuts Them Up Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
A Muslim couple has accused Delta Airlines of Islamophobia after their behavior forced a flight attendant to take action after they decided to parade their religious entitlement on a flight to the United States. 
According to reports, the two had boarded the plane when they started chanting “Allah” repeatedly. When a flight attendant noticed what they were doing he sprang into action and stopped them dead in their tracks. 
The couple has since taken issue with Delta, claiming that they had been ‘racially profiled,’ which is tough to do considering Islam is not a race but rather a religion. 
The couple in question, Faisal and Nazia Ali, claim to be victims of religious discrimination after they had to be removed for “suspicious activity” on an airplane. Most people would probably find being the only two people on the plane that were hiding their phones as the steward passes, sweating, and repeating the word “Allah” on an international flight to the united states from Paris a little suspicious. 
That’s exactly the type of behavior that this couple was exhibiting when the flight attendant had to take action and do so quickly, reports The Independent. 
After the flight attendant noticed this odd behavior he chose to act, taking the safety of the passengers and the crew above any sort of reprimand he might receive for being a ‘racist’ or a bigot. 
He told them to get up grab their things and get off of the plane. That’s when one of the Delta employees said that the pilot had made the final call because their behavior had made the rest of the passengers feel uncomfortable. 
The couple then went through an interrogation process before they were determined to not be a threat and sent home on the next flight and then offered a full refund. Of course this wasn’t enough for this entitled couple. The couple took this so-called ‘offense’ and contacted the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which by the way has ties to terror organizations.

18068,Can U.S. Elections Really Be Stolen? Yes      : Information Clearing House - ICH,". Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his governments repeated affronts to the White House.
In the past weeks alone, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last years nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact, which bolstered Hitler; and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the ethnic cleansing of Jews.
American president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic partys candidate to succeed Mr Obama in Novembers election.
In reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.
In fact, Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn  if Congresss assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.
The deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollars depreciation against the shekel.
A bigger blow still is the White Houses demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.
Nonetheless, Washingtons renewed military largesse  in the face of almost continual insults  inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as too big.
Since the 1973 war, Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid, with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s, Washington paid half of Israels military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill, despite Israels economic success.
But the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed, ­Israel has been a US aircraft carrier in the Middle East, acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.
Almost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraqs and Syrias nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.
In addition, Israels US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry, the countrys most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.
The first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December  their various components produced in 46 US states  will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.
Israel is also a front-line laboratory, as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend, that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.
The US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome  which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation  it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber­warfare, such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Irans civilian nuclear programme.
But the clearest message from Israels new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.
Some believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace.
Hopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.
If Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.
Mr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal  he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.

18069,Ex-State Staffer Who Advocated Spying On Trump Boasted ’Getting Winks From Inside’ Obama Admin,"Evelyn Farkas, a former top Obama administration official, has denied that she had access to inside information when she made remarks as a contributor to MSNBC last month that seemed to acknowledge efforts by members of the Obama administration to collect intelligence on Donald Trump and members of his 2016 presidential campaign. [However, the news media has largely failed to note that on February 16, about two weeks prior to her statements on MSNBC, Farkas revealed in an interview that she was “getting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here”  —   referring to Trump officials’ alleged ties to Russia.  She stated that she was “first made aware of all this stuff” during the summer.  On March 2, Farkas stated on MSNBC that she told former Obama administration colleagues to collect intelligence on Trump and campaign officials. “I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,” stated Farkas. She continued: Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy   …     that the Trump folks  —   if they found out how we knew what we knew about their   …     the Trump staff dealing with Russians  —   that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence. After her remarks resurfaced and were subsequently used by the White House to bolster the charge that Trump was under illicit surveillance during the campaign, Farkas gave interviews denying that she had any inside information when she made those comments to MSNBC. She told the Daily Caller last week that she had no access to any intelligence. “I had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn’t in government anymore and didn’t have access to any,” she said. Speaking to the Washington Post, Farkas denied being a source of any leaks. The Post reported: Farkas, in an interview with The Post, said she “didn’t give anybody anything except advice,” was not a source for any stories and had nothing to leak. Noting that she left government in October 2015, she said, “I was just watching like anybody else, like a regular spectator” as initial reports of Russia contacts began to surface after the election. However, on February 16, Farkas told Ezra Klein at Vox. com that she was “getting winks and hints from inside” about alleged Russia ties.  The interview was also highlighted by the Gateway Pundit blog. Farkas was asked by Klein about her “level of alarm after the resignation of Michael Flynn,” who stepped down in February as Trump’s national security adviser. Regarding her “level of alarm,” Farkas replied: It’s lower than it’s been since the summer, when I was first made aware of all this stuff. I’m like, finally, everybody else sees it! Seriously. The reason I was so upset last summer was that I was getting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here. I was agitated because I knew the Clinton campaign and the world didn’t know. But I didn’t think it would happen this fast. I didn’t think Flynn would survive a year, but I thought it would be most of the year. The fact that Flynn is gone is constructive from the perspective of US foreign policy. He was getting it wrong on combating terrorism and Russia. So I feel relieved that he will not be whispering his policy prescriptions in the president’s ear. On the bigger issue, the intelligence community, the bureaucracy, patriotic Americans, and some members of Congress are making it impossible for the White House to sweep whatever they are trying to hide under the rug. And the White House is clearly trying to hide something, or the president would have said, on day one, that he would support the investigations that began under his predecessor. This past week, Breitbart News first reported that at a conference last October, held two weeks before the presidential election, Farkas predicted that if Trump won the presidency he would “be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government. ” Breitbart News also first reported that at the same conference, Farkas warned that more must be done to counter the forces of nationalism and populism that have been entering the mainstream with the rise of Trump and nationalist movements across Europe. Farkas currently serves as a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression. The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. the U. S. State Department and NATO ACT. Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Farkas serves on the Atlantic Council alongside Dmitri Alperovitch,   of CrowdStrike, the   company utilized by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. Last month, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency never had direct access to the DNC’s servers to confirm the hacking. “Well, we never got direct access to the machines themselves,” he stated. “The DNC in the spring of 2016 hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system. ” National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers also stated the NSA never asked for access to the DNC hardware: “The NSA didn’t ask for access. That’s not in our job. ”  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

18070,"Israel Buries 4 Soldiers, but the Mourning Is Marred by Discord - The New York Times","JERUSALEM  —   One loved horse riding another was the oldest of four sisters a third had fought to enlist in the army despite medical problems that allowed him to defer the draft. The fourth was the 300th graduate of her Haifa high school to have died while serving as a soldier. Israel buried its latest terrorism victims on Monday, the day after they were run down by a Palestinian man in a truck, enveloping them in the country’s familiar outpouring of love for its service members. But this time, the usually unifying ritual was marred by discord. Israelis called it the “Azaria effect,” referring to Sgt. Elor Azaria, the soldier who was convicted last week of manslaughter for shooting a wounded and incapacitated Palestinian assailant in the head. Video from the scene of Sunday’s attack showed dozens of armed soldiers fleeing from the truck instead of trying to shoot the driver. Some Israelis who had complained that the army’s high command failed to back up Sergeant Azaria asserted that the soldiers had fallen short because they were afraid of being put on trial. The military, security experts and soldiers at the scene quickly rejected that notion. “Those who ran from the scene were not concerned about Azaria, but about their own ” said Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert in national security and public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. Still, the argument  —   unfolding in full volume on Israeli news sites, social media and broadcast channels  —   reflected the disruptive influence the Azaria affair has had on the army and its central place in Israeli society. In this small,   country where most Jewish    are drafted into years of service, the military has long been a rare reserve of respect and consensus. Yet the same sentiment that leads Israeli Jews to treat soldiers as “everybody’s children” has also led many to call for a pardon for Sergeant Azaria, creating tension between the people and the commanders of their army. “The motherly protection of soldiers sometimes overcomes your basic value system,” Mr. Ben Meir said, adding that the instinct to protect soldiers was not particular to Israel. The soldiers targeted by the Palestinian truck driver on Sunday were in officer training programs, and most were not preparing for combat roles. Many were in the educational corps or training for administrative jobs on the home front. On a routine educational tour of Jerusalem, they were caught   as they disembarked from buses at a popular observation spot with panoramic views of Old City. The truck driver plowed into one group, then reversed and came back to claim more victims. A tour guide who shot at the truck with his pistol complained on television that the soldiers were better equipped with   but had hesitated to shoot. Noam Kedar, one of the soldiers at the scene, denounced those who passed instant judgment. “Please stop your   psychoanalysis,” she wrote in an impassioned Facebook post. “It has nothing to do with Elor Azaria,” she added. “It’s unrelated. Let none of you dare compare a semitrailer going at 100 km per hour with a disarmed terrorist who is lying down, already neutralized. ” The military’s preliminary findings were that two soldiers had fired at the driver it remained unclear on Monday whether he had been killed by them or by civilians who opened fire. The defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said that any attempt to link Sunday’s events to the Azaria verdict had no basis. One squad commander at the scene said she had instructed her forces to run for cover after determining that enough soldiers were already running toward the truck. There were also concerns, according to officers in the field, that too many people shooting could cause a “friendly fire” accident. The four soldiers who were killed, all promoted posthumously, were identified as Lt. Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim, near Tel Aviv Second Lt. Erez Orbach, 20, from Alon Shvut, in the West Bank Lt. Shir Hajaj, 22, from Ma’ale Adumim in the West Bank and Second Lt. Shira Tzur, 20, from Haifa. “These are our children,” Herzl Hajaj, Shir Hajaj’s father, told the Israeli news media Sunday after hearing of his daughter’s death. “We send them to the army we know they might not return. ” The Azaria case, regarding a shooting in the West Bank city of Hebron last March that was caught on video, unleashed its own kind of friendly fire and fury. As a military judge read the verdict last week in a Tel Aviv military compound, hundreds of protesters demonstrated outside. Bolstered by some of the most extreme   elements of Israeli society, like La Familia fan club of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team and the   Lahava organization, the crowd scuffled with the police. Among their chants were threats against Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, the military chief of staff, a post normally among the most revered and popular among Israeli Jews. General Eisenkot had drawn criticism for saying in a speech a day before the Azaria verdict that an    in the army was not “everybody’s child,” but a soldier and a fighter with a mission. “Gadi, Gadi, beware, Rabin is looking for a friend,” the protesters sang, referring to Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel who was assassinated in 1995 by a   Jewish extremist. The three judges who formed the military tribunal were placed under guard. The backlash was not long in coming, and was equally charged. The popular Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper gathered half a dozen former chiefs of staff and photographed them for Sunday’s front page, with the headline: “Behind you, Gadi. ” Days earlier, an army reservist who is well known to Israelis  —   as are many war heroes  —   captured national attention with a plea for unity after the Azaria verdict. The reservist, Capt. Ziv Shilon, who lost one arm in an explosion along the Gaza border and was severely injured in the other arm, wrote in an emotional Facebook post: “Yes, I, who never cried in the hardest moments that I do not wish on anybody, sat today and simply cried. ” “I cried,” he wrote, “over the hands that I left in Gaza and I asked myself perhaps for the first time in my life, was it worth fighting for a nation that hates itself?” Mr. Shilon announced plans to sit in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square  —   named for the prime minister who was slain there in 1995  —   on Saturday night with a huge placard calling to bring back solidarity and mutual respect, even if he had to sit there alone. Instead, he was joined by thousands. Micah Goodman, an   Jewish philosopher, said that the Israelis’ “automatic identification” with soldiers sometimes led to “irrational” results. That was the common thread, he said, between the cries for a pardon for Sergeant Azaria and the contentious decision in 2011 to trade more than 1, 000 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom had been convicted of deadly terrorist acts against Israelis, for one Israeli soldier who was being held captive in Gaza. “Having that soft spot for soldiers is part of the Israeli solidarity, and it is part of what is really unique about Israel,” Mr. Goodman said. “The weakness of Israel is also part of the power of Israel. ”",0

18072,Killer Mike Proves Real Leaders are Truth-Tellers by Saying What Most People Won’t,"Killer Mike Proves Real Leaders are Truth-Tellers by Saying What Most People Won’t Nov 21, 2016 0 0 
Politics in America has devolved into a contest of personalities, where policy, history, and reality are rejected in favor of style, skin color, gender and celebrity factor. This is unsurprising, though, in a nation that has for generations been weened on television and state indoctrination. We’ve been trained to look to politicians for leadership, but the real heroes and change makers in our world are the fearless truth-tellers who work to free our minds and inspire us to greatness by setting an example with their words and deeds. 
As we stare down the barrel of a critically divided society under the thumb of an all-powerful government and police state, righteous voices of non-partisan, no-bullshit truth who apply logic, common sense, and critical-thinking in defense of community and humanity are needed now more than ever. One such example is hip-hop artist, civic leader, social activist, and entrepreneur Michael Render, aka Killer Mike . His articulation of the problems we all face, accompanied with real ideas for meaningful action, make for an excellent reminder of what true leadership can look like. 
He’s done a ton of interviews in recent years, and although he mentions being a conservative, even advocating for the 2nd Amendment in response to public shootings, he played a big role in Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic nomination in an effort to help educate and awaken black voters. Consider the following clips of Killer Mike speaking on a number of today’s critical issues. 
Firstly, he talks to TMZ about the importance of participating in local elections and in using your vote to hold political parties accountable, while helping to see through the phony logic of voting for the lesser of two evils. 
“Scaring me with the boogie man is not going to work as effectively as giving my community something that helps.” ~Killer Mike 
In his song, ‘ Reagan, ‘ he rails against Obama, along with all the other authoritarian presidents we’ve had, as a member of an organization of war and profit, saying what so many Obama supporters are afraid to acknowledge. 
“Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor Just an employee of the country’s real masters Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters If you don’t believe the theory, then argue with this logic Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby Same as in Iraq, and Afghanistan And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor If I say any more they might be at my door” 
~Killer Mike, Reagan 
As a leader in the black community, he is keenly aware of the affects of racism and police brutality today, but rather than advocating for protests or riots as an expression of justifiable anger, he breaks down how black people can overcome systemic corruption and racism by using the one weapon that is most effective in a capitalist culture: money. 
Furthermore, on the Bill Maher show on HBO , he goes into relationship between politicians and police, pointing out how politicians themselves use police as pawns. Final Thoughts 
The President of the United States of America is the figurehead of an authoritarian and corporatized organization that masquerades as benevolent, but POTUS is a puppet, not a leader. As Americans go at each other’s throats over about the election, it may serve us well to remember that individuals are the true leaders in our community and in our world. 
“My criteria is probably Libertarian views, where you just let the free market reign, you let people do what they want to, and the government takes care of protecting us from foreign interests and one another.” ~ Killer Mike

18073,New Questions Arise Over Sumner Redstone’s Competency After He Alters Trust - The New York Times,"The mental competency of the ailing    media mogul Sumner M. Redstone is, once again, at the center of a bitter dispute. Viacom and its chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, fired back with everything they had on Saturday, attempting to discredit a sudden move by Mr. Redstone to change succession plans for his $40 billion media empire. Not only did Mr. Dauman and two Viacom directors raise questions related to Mr. Redstone’s competency, but they also declared that Mr. Redstone had been manipulated and used by his daughter. The renewed scrutiny over Mr. Redstone’s capacity came less than two weeks after a California judge dismissed a case on a similar issue without ruling on whether Mr. Redstone was mentally competent. It was sparked by an unexpected development on Friday, in a family and corporate tale that becomes messier by the week. Mr. Redstone ousted Mr. Dauman from the trust that will control his companies when he dies or is declared incompetent. He did so after expressing dissatisfaction with the performance of Viacom, according to a lawyer working on behalf of Mr. Redstone. Mr. Dauman was also removed from the board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls both Viacom and CBS. Also ousted from both positions was George Abrams, a   representative of Mr. Redstone, a Viacom director for 29 years and an ally of Mr. Dauman. The development set off a new round in a   battle pitting Mr. Dauman, Mr. Redstone’s longtime confidant, against Shari Redstone, Mr. Redstone’s once ostracized, recently reconciled daughter. Ms. Redstone has publicly opposed Mr. Dauman’s leadership at Viacom, and his removal from the trust is a significant victory in her effort to shape the future of her father’s companies. Ms. Redstone is vice chairman of Viacom and CBS and is one of seven members on the trust. But in biting language on Saturday, Viacom executives and directors joined forces to depict the ousting of Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams as a shameful attempt by Ms. Redstone to influence her father and gain control of his companies. They also portrayed Mr. Redstone as being in such failing health as to be unable to make such a decision. Carl Folta, a spokesman for Viacom, said in a statement that Mr. Redstone had been unduly influenced by his daughter “to accomplish her   goal, which Mr. Redstone has always opposed, of gaining control of National Amusements and Viacom. ” Mr. Folta said the move to oust Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams was “completely inconsistent with his long expressed wishes and intent, and extremely disruptive and damaging to Viacom and all of its shareholders. ” For his part, Mr. Abrams said, “The Sumner Redstone I knew would never have taken this action. ” And Frederic V. Salerno, Viacom’s lead independent director, raised questions about Mr. Redstone’s competence, saying the board decided last week to eliminate Mr. Redstone’s compensation “based upon his recent complete lack of communication with the Viacom board and management team and his silence during recent board meetings, as well as recent public disclosures raising concerns about his health. ” In a statement on Saturday, Ms. Redstone said, “I fully support my father’s decisions and respect his authority to make them. ” Removing Mr. Dauman from the trust has raised the question of whether Mr. Redstone, or the trust after he dies, will move to oust Mr. Dauman as a director and as chief executive of Viacom. The company, the owner of the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studios, has suffered a 40 percent decline in its stock price over the last year and has reported persistent weak results. “Is Philippe Dauman dead man walking now?” asked Richard Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG Research. Referring to Mr. Redstone, he said, “If he is competent enough to change the trust, he is competent enough to use his voting power to change management. ” Whether Mr. Dauman will pursue legal action is not clear. During the public sparring on Saturday, two questions persisted. Did Mr. Redstone have the capacity to eject Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams from their positions? And to what extent was Ms. Redstone involved? Mr. Redstone, who has not been seen publicly since his 92nd birthday party last May, will turn 93 on Friday. While he continues to control Viacom and CBS, much about his condition has been shrouded in mystery beyond the fact that he has suffered minor strokes and has a severe speech impediment. The transcript of videotaped testimony presented during the trial showed a fiery, if somewhat feeble man who responded to some basic questions but could not answer others, such as his birth name. If Mr. Redstone lacked the capacity to make corporate decisions, as Mr. Dauman asserted, analysts said that would raise questions about whether Mr. Redstone’s control should already have passed to the trust. Yet until Friday, neither Mr. Dauman nor Mr. Abrams, nor other directors of Viacom or CBS, publicly claimed that Mr. Redstone lacked mental capacity. In a declaration six months ago for the civil suit challenging Mr. Redstone’s mental capacity, Mr. Dauman described his boss as “engaged, attentive and as opinionated as ever. ” Mr. Redstone’s lawyers, in a statement issued Friday, sought to use Mr. Dauman’s own words against him. Citing his remarks, Michael C. Tu, a partner at the law firm Orrick, Herrington  Sutcliffe, said “that is exactly the Sumner Redstone who made these decisions. ” In his statement on behalf of Mr. Redstone, Mr. Tu said his client took “decisive and lawful action” to remove Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams from their positions after he had “expressed his concerns regarding Viacom’s performance to Messrs. Abrams and Dauman, both Viacom directors, and received no response from them. ” Mr. Folta of Viacom said that there had been no communication from Mr. Redstone and that the only contact came through “written communication on Tuesday from Mr. Tu, a lawyer previously unknown until this week to anyone associated with Sumner other than Shari Redstone. ” Mr. Folta added that during a Viacom board meeting on Tuesday evening and all day Wednesday, “not a sound was heard from Sumner, who was connected by phone,” and that Ms. Redstone, also connected by phone, “did not raise a single concern during the board session on any topic. ” Mr. Redstone engaged the new law firm after the suit challenging his capacity was dismissed on May 9. “Sumner had concerns related, as everybody knows, to the potential sale of Paramount and with respect to other corporate matters,” said Robert N. Klieger, a partner of the law firm Hueston Hennigan who represented Mr. Redstone during the suit over his competency. “I recommended to Sumner that he engage corporate counsel to represent him on those matters and helped facilitate getting Orrick on board to represent him. ” Mr. Folta and Mr. Salerno said that Ms. Redstone had denied Viacom directors access to her father. Dr. Brian Crowley, a psychiatrist in Washington who has frequently testified in civil and criminal trials at what he called the “intersection of psychiatry and law,” said there were two related issues in the situation: mental competency and “undue influence. ” “There is no rigid definition of civil competence,” he said. “Does he have the mental capacity to know what he’s doing? Does he have the ability to exercise judgment and free will?” While Mr. Redstone is a vulnerable person and may be subject to undue influence, not all influence is undue, Dr. Crowley said. “Have they used their influence to in effect meet their own needs, rather than to help him make his own decision?” he asked.",0
18074,Coahuila: How a Border State Government Covered up a Massacre,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   Four years have passed since state authorities claimed to begin investigating how gunmen with Los Zetas cartel were able to kidnap, murder, and exterminate hundreds of victims from rural communities in this border state between 2011 and 2013. The case became one big cover up. [In early 2016, Breitbart Texas reported on how Los Zetas used ovens and   drums to incinerate hundreds of victims from the northern part of the state. The massacre began in 2011 in Allende, Coahuila, but continued for two years throughout the region and in this city. It continued without any state authority making an effort to stop it while local news outlets were muffled. Years later, government officials confirmed that approximately 150 victims were incinerated inside the state prison in Piedras Negras.   At the time, the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office was run by Jesus Torres Chaires, an individual who was singled out in U. S. Court testimony as having received money from Los Zetas. The allegations against Torres Chaires were made by Rodrigo Humberto Uribe Tapia during a   federal trial of a top Zeta associate in Texas. The testimony pointed to Los Zetas giving millions to the state attorney general who in turn would give some of that money to the former Governor Humberto Moreira. As Breitbart Texas reported, Moreira is just one of various Mexican governors who were linked in U. S courts to Los Zetas. Court documents published by this outlet reveal that the U. S. government considered the entire structure of the Coahuila government to be a surrogate of Los Zetas cartel.  In an interview with Mexico’s Vanguardia, Torres Chaires claimed that the allegations about him taking money from Los Zetas were lies and he was trying to move on from the events of the massacre in Allende, which he described as things that just happened.  At the time of the massacre and in the years after, the top lawmen in the northern region of Coahuila were Santos Vasquez Estrada and Patricia Rivera Barrera, each during their respective term held the position of PGJE Delegate in Pedras Negras and oversaw most of the rural communities where Los Zetas carried out their massacres. Individuals interviewed by Breitbart Texas revealed that neither of the two officials made any effort to investigate, identify, or target any of the real individuals behind the massacres or the masterminds behind the current drug traffickers in the area. Since the massacre, authorities have publicized the charging of various   Zeta bosses however, the real actors behind the various massacres in the state have escaped scrutiny.  While Vasquez left the PGJE and is currently a criminal defense attorney, Rivera Barrera continues to work at the agency. Breitbart Texas was able to confirm that Rivera Barrera lost her top post in the PGJE after she traveled to Mexico City to take an integrity test commonly called “examen de confianza”  —   she failed. Local news outlets erroneously reported that Rivera Barrera had been fired from her job in early 2016.  Rather than being fired from her post by current Coahuila Attorney General Homero Ramos Gloria, Rivera Barrera was simply moved to oversee a PGJE archive warehouse where she continues to collect a director’s salary.  While Rivera Barrera failed the integrity tests required by her agency, during her term as the delegate she was able to establish close relations with various U. S. law enforcement agencies and often traveled to Eagle Pass, Texas, and other U. S. cities to interact with her counterparts.  Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “J. M. Martinez” from Piedras Negras, Coahuila.",0
18075,Agency’s Green Card Errors Said to Be Worse Than First Thought - The New York Times,"United States Citizenship and Immigration Services sent green cards to people that contained incorrect information or were duplicates, or mailed them to the wrong addresses, according to a report released on Monday by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General. The immigration agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, told auditors that it had received more than 200, 000 reports of cards that were not being delivered to approved applicants. The report also found that more than 2, 400 immigrants who were approved for   conditional resident status were instead given cards that were good for 10 years. The report was a   to a March review that found the agency had possibly sent hundreds of green cards to the wrong addresses. The latest report said the problem was far worse than originally believed. In the last three years, it said, the immigration agency produced at least 19, 000 cards that included incorrect information or were issued in duplicate. Homeland Security auditors said the immigration agency had instituted several methods for addressing problems with erroneous or duplicate green cards. “However, these methods  —   manual intervention, production controls and system enhancements  —   have not proven adequate to ensure quality across the volume of cards produced and issued each year,” auditors wrote. León Rodriguez, director of the immigration service, said in a statement that it was taking steps to address the problems raised in the report, but added that some of the findings “were overstated. ” “Although the report correctly points out instances in which there were errors with the data on a card or duplicate cards issued, U. S. C. I. S. did not issue green cards to any individuals who were not eligible to receive them,” he said. “It is therefore imprecise, and potentially misleading, for the O. I. G. to indicate that U. S. C. I. S. ‘inappropriately issued’ green cards. ” The report released on Monday came after an inquiry in September that found the immigration agency had used incomplete fingerprint records to grant citizenship to hundreds of people who were to have been deported. That inquiry, also from the Office of Inspector General, found that nearly 900 people had been granted citizenship because neither Homeland Security nor F. B. I. databases contained all of the fingerprint records of people who had previously been designated for deportation. Nearly 150, 000 older fingerprint records were not digitized or simply not included in Homeland Security’s databases when they were being developed, the report said. In other cases, fingerprints that immigration officials had taken during the deportation process were not forwarded to the F. B. I. The immigration agency is supposed to check the fingerprints of applicants for citizenship against a number of databases to make sure that the applicants do not have criminal records or pose a threat. But because the fingerprint databases are incomplete, the report found, the agency had no way of knowing if the individuals were y who they said they were. As naturalized citizens, these individuals retain many of the rights and privileges of American citizenship, including serving in law enforcement, obtaining a security clearance and sponsoring the entry of other foreigners into the United States, the report said.",0
18076,Homeland Security Secretary: Expect ‘A Lot More’ Manchester-style Attacks - Breitbart,"Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Thursday that his “expectation” is that there will be more attacks like the one in Manchester, England earlier this week where a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a concert venue. [“As horrible as Manchester was, my expectation is we’re going to see a lot more of that type of attack,” Kelly told the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security at a hearing focused on President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 federal budget.  But in his prepared remarks, Kelly warned that suicide bombers aren’t the only threat facing the United States and the West: The threat to aviation security remains high, and criminals and terrorists continue to target airlines and airports. We must continue to improve how we screen the belongings of travelers and cargo. We are in the business of protecting lives, and improved screening technologies coupled with additional Transportation Security Administration [TSA) Officers working security functions at the checkpoints, will help us deter, detect, disrupt, and prevent threats to aviation security. DHS continues to prioritize explosives screening, threat assessments, and detection capabilities, and the President’s Budget includes $77. 0 million for research and development in this area. Kelly also talked about border security, including money in the budget for wall construction along the southern border. “Border security is a high priority and involves protecting 7, 000 miles of land border, approximately 95, 000 miles of shoreline, and 328 ports of entry along with staffing numerous locations abroad,” Kelly said. Kelly said Trump is requesting “$1. 6 billion for 32 miles of new border wall construction, 28 miles of levee wall along the Rio Grande, where apprehensions are the highest along the Southwest Border, and 14 miles of new border wall system that will replace existing secondary fence in the San Diego Sector, where a border wall system will deny access to drug trafficking organizations. ”",0
18077,"The Long, Lonely Fall of a Heisman Trophy Winner - The New York Times","BOULDER, Colo.  —   Through the darkness, Rashaan Salaam drove his   Suzuki sedan. He was, as usual, alone. For months, friends said, Salaam had been a recluse who left his rented condo in a Denver suburb only occasionally, to buy groceries and, even more rarely, for a solitary morning walk. Now and then he went to a bar for drinks and a steak, sitting by himself. But on this Monday night, Dec. 5, Salaam, a former football standout, was headed for the site of his greatest triumph. From his home, it was eight miles to the University of Colorado in Boulder, where Salaam was a running back who won the Heisman Trophy in 1994. On the final dash of his last game at Folsom Field here that year, Salaam roared 67 yards for a touchdown, collapsing in the end zone and spurring his teammates to hoist him onto their shoulders as fans waved “2000” signs he had become just the fourth college player to exceed 2, 000 rushing yards in a season. Now, on an unseasonably warm December night, he drove past the stadium and cut through the heart of the idyllic Colorado campus, where, he often said, he still felt most comfortable. Less than two miles from where he had scored his   touchdown, he pulled into the tiny parking area of Eben G. Fine Park, bordering the burbling Boulder Creek. Around 8 p. m. a few hours after the voting closed for the 2016 Heisman and five days before the 22nd anniversary of Salaam’s trophy win, a young man walking in the park saw a body lying beside an idling sedan. Salaam. A revolver lay nearby. Salaam’s death at the age of 42 is being investigated as a likely suicide. Autopsy results are expected in about a month. But in the days since the death, as friends, relatives and associates puzzle over the circumstances, they cannot help but wonder if the Heisman and its attendant expectations of fame had undercut his life instead of elevating it. “Rashaan came back to Boulder a few years ago to revive himself,” said Francisco Lujan, one of Salaam’s close friends and a business associate. “He was trying to find a way to find himself. He returned to where the memories were good. ” T . J. Cunningham, a Colorado teammate who had stayed in touch with Salaam until a few months ago, said he believed Salaam’s football career, which sputtered after he left college largely because of injuries, always weighed on him. “Rashaan was 20 years old when he won the Heisman Trophy,” Cunningham said. “To achieve the epitome of success at 20, but then you can’t get to that point again  —   what did that do to Rashaan?” That may be an insoluble question. For people who knew him, the prospect that he took his own life is hard to reconcile with someone best known for an infectious smile that brightened a room when he entered it. As Cunningham said: “He was a happy guy. I can still see him at Christmas last year, at my house teaching my    how to hit a baseball. But, you know, Rashaan struggled with some things. ” Many of his friends believed he suffered from depression and mood swings, typical signs of the brain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C. T. E. that has afflicted scores of players. The disease is linked to repeated hits to the head and diagnosed posthumously, but it is unclear if Salaam’s family members have donated his brain to be tested. The Salaam family declined to be interviewed for this article, and multiple phone messages and email messages left for relatives drew no response. Salaam’s brother, Jabali Alaji, told USA Today shortly after Rashaan’s funeral on Dec. 9 that if Salaam’s brain were examined: “I would guarantee they’d find it. I would guarantee it. ” But several of Salaam’s friends who spoke with family members said they were told Salaam’s brain would not be tested. Though injured often, Salaam had no known history of repeated concussions or head trauma. But as Cunningham said: “Rashaan had a lot of collisions. He wasn’t a fake and juke guy he ran right through you. “C. T. E.? He showed all the symptoms,” Cunningham said, “and C. T. E. probably added to that. ” Whatever the cause, it was obvious to people around him that Salaam was dealing with mental health problems. He routinely retreated to his condo and stayed there. Phone calls and texts from friends went unreturned for days or weeks, especially since October. Salaam spent Thanksgiving by himself, a   neighbor said, in his small, plain   condo next to a playground and a municipal wastewater plant in Superior, Colo. “He was always in his condo,” said the neighbor, Deanna Ardrey. “He would sit there by himself every day. You knew there was something off. ” Riley Robert Hawkins, a school social worker and behavioral therapist who had been a partner with Salaam in a charitable foundation since 2011, talked to him about whether he should seek treatment for depression. “You could tell he was fighting some things,” Hawkins said. “Anxiety and depression, that’s bipolar. It was always there to some degree. “Like many of us,” he said, “I think he thought he had a handle on things. ” Maurice Henriques, another Colorado teammate who had remained close with Salaam, said it was impossible to pinpoint what ailed him. “For the family’s sake, you’d love for there to be an explanation,” he said. “But it’s probably a cocktail of things  —   depression, some C. T. E. and Rashaan still trying to deal with the transition from football. “How,” he added, “do you   yourself?” When he was first handed the Heisman in 1994, Salaam had no idea how much the   trophy would complicate the rest of his life. Going forward, it distorted the perception of his career. Salaam had a spectacular N. F. L. rookie season with the Chicago Bears but faded markedly thereafter, lasting for only four seasons. After that, he more and more kept his distance from the trophy, whose renowned pose is a stiff arm. “He felt people viewed him as a failure,” said David Plati, an associate athletic director at Colorado and a friend of Salaam’s for nearly a  . “He was frustrated with his N. F. L. career. That’s the burden the Heisman carries. He felt pressure that he had to go do something in the pros as good or greater than what he did in college. “He felt that people were looking at him, thinking that he let them down. ” Still, the Heisman loomed large. Everybody wanted to see it and touch it. Salaam wanted to stand apart from it. “He wasn’t a huge fan of the trophy itself,” Lujan said. “When he was making an appearance, people would always ask if he could bring the Heisman Trophy to the engagement. He’d turn them down. He didn’t like carrying the trophy around. It made him feel like the only reason anyone wanted to see him was because he had a Heisman Trophy. ” Once, visiting Salaam at his home, a friend saw the trophy being used as a doorstop. For the majority of the last 22 years, Salaam’s mother kept the trophy at the family home in San Diego. Salaam was conflicted about the trophy from the start he declined to do several major interviews the year he won it. “That’s the thing. Deep down Rashaan didn’t care about the trophy and never did because he didn’t like being singled out,” Plati said. “Rashaan wanted to be just one of the guys,” Plati said. “But he knew his offensive linemen wanted him to win the Heisman. He understood it was important for the university and the football program. ” Salaam is Colorado’s only Heisman winner and eventually got into the experience of winning it, even enjoying the week in New York for the ceremony. At the time, it seemed like a     thing  —   not a lifetime designation permanently attached to his name. He had won the trophy in his junior year and entered the 1995 N. F. L. draft. Yet he was perturbed, even insulted, when he was the fifth running back taken in the first round. But Salaam had proved others wrong in his career before. With his mother urging him on, he had left his hometown, San Diego, and traveled by bus two hours daily to attend La Jolla Country Day, a private school where he excelled academically and on the football team. But La Jolla played   football, and Salaam was barely noticed by college recruiters. His La Jolla coach mounted a campaign to promote him, and soon Colorado took him on. He was, however, on the third string as a college freshman. Though he was a sturdy    and weighed in at 220 pounds, there were doubts about whether he had the speed to compete at the highest level of college ball. He made progress as a sophomore, and by his spectacular junior season at Colorado had more than vanquished his critics. And yet, N. F. L. evaluators still had reservations, which is how Salaam fell to the draft’s 21st pick. As a rookie, Salaam rushed for 1, 074 yards and 10 touchdowns, becoming the youngest N. F. L. player to rush for more than 1, 000 yards. But a series of leg injuries limited his playing time and effectiveness in the next two seasons, his last with the Bears. In 1999, he carried the football once for 2 yards for the hapless   Cleveland Browns. He was also briefly with two other N. F. L. teams but never got on the field. In 2001, Salaam played for the Memphis Maniax of the   X. F. L. At 28, he regrouped and spent nearly a year getting in top shape because the San Francisco 49ers had invited him to training camp. Around that time in 2003, in an interview with ESPN, Salaam decided to open up about his marijuana use while with the Bears. He said he was too young to handle the money and success of his early N. F. L. career and blamed an undisciplined lifestyle for hampering his development as a professional. Salaam later said he had hoped the interview would show a newfound maturity, since he was admitting to a mistake and describing a new, robust work ethic. But the reaction to the interview, and to Salaam, was decidedly negative. He was cut by the 49ers toward the end of training camp. After a   flirtation with the Canadian Football League, his football career was over. Salaam said in interviews years ago that he had invested much of his nearly $4 million N. F. L. payday with a San Diego brokerage firm. Shortly after retiring from football, Salaam began spending months in China, where he started a mixed martial arts business. None of his friends were sure how or why he made a connection with China, but there he promoted championship events and shuttled between his native California and Beijing. By the beginning of this decade, he sold the   venture and returned to San Diego. There, Salaam lived quietly, and mostly, anonymously. A   “bachelor for life,” Salaam never married, although his friends said they had met his various girlfriends over the years. About five years ago, Salaam decided to return to the Boulder area in what was viewed as an attempt to regain his footing in a familiar place. He began working with Lujan, a coach at a local high school, who had a   company that did testing for N. F. L. and C. F. L. scouting combines. Salaam was paid $2, 500 or more for public appearances and helped with the testing. He appeared financially secure. While he did not live extravagantly  —   rent at his condo this year was about $1, 500 a month  —   he never seemed in need of funds. A 2011 newspaper account reported that Salaam sold ornate rings he had received for winning the Heisman Trophy for roughly $9, 000. Salaam said that the rings were sold, without his knowledge, by a family member. “Rashaan’s primary goal when he came here was to start a foundation to help   youth,” said Lujan, who eventually put Salaam in touch with Hawkins, the school social worker, who years earlier had founded the SPIN Foundation  —   Supporting People in Need. Together, Hawkins and Salaam planned events, camps, clinics and appearances, and they devised programs to benefit underprivileged children. Salaam became a fixture at Jefferson High School in Edgewater, Colo. where Hawkins has worked for 15 years. Salaam regularly spoke with classes and worked with students individually and in groups. For four days in April 2015, for example, the foundation brought about 30 Jefferson students and staff members to the ski slopes of Aspen for a trip that was called a “Ski for the Heisman” program. “Rashaan was like a family member to Jefferson students,” said Oscar Lopez, a senior at the high school who participated in the trip. “He was like a big brother and he was always encouraging us to better ourselves. He talked about the mistakes he made and how he kept going. His big message was to stay positive. ” Lopez, who is a wrestler and football player, said Salaam once cautioned him about taking care of his body in athletics. “He told me if I was hurt, to protect myself and stay off the field,” Lopez said. “He had injuries and went back out there. He said, ‘Don’t do that, let it heal. ’” Lujan said the cost of the Aspen trip was $25, 000. At Jefferson High, students who had laughed on the Aspen slopes with Salaam and been buoyed by his enthusiasm for their future prospects were thunderstruck by his death. “I broke down because he was always here for us,” said Janessa Kiome, a senior at Jefferson. “And that night, no one was there for him. ” Hawkins and others have been counseling the Jefferson students. Seated in his school office last week, Hawkins sighed and said: “Rashaan was trying to save lives, but he had trouble saving his own life. There are things we can explain and things that we can’t explain. ” It had been hard to get to know Salaam well, as he was introverted by nature and something of a loner, especially in the last few months. He was a semiregular at C. B.  Potts, a bar and restaurant about a mile from his condo in Superior. He usually came in around 10 on Sunday nights, well past the dinner rush. He was always alone, and he would sit in a section of the bar unoccupied by other patrons, ordering a steak and two or three vodka drinks known as Moscow Mules. “He was always nice to everyone,” said Chris Rosa, a bartender there who works Sunday nights. “But more than a few times, we’d be talking and he’d say he was mad that injuries and bad luck messed up his N. F. L. career. He said things spiraled out of control and he wished things had been different. ” Rosa said he had not seen him in the last couple of months. Neither had his friends or the people he worked with, like Lujan and Hawkins. “Everyone has the same story,” Lujan said. “We’ve asked each other, ‘When did you last hear from him?’ And everyone answers, ‘About a month or six weeks ago. ’” Salaam’s neighbor Deanna Ardrey was among the few who saw him regularly during this period. She had met Salaam a few months earlier when she moved in with her boyfriend. She learned only by accident that Salaam had played football, then Googled him and was dumbfounded to discover his celebrity. “We talked about football, but he was more likely to talk about other things, like astronomy,” Ardrey said. “He was always pointing out planets to us in the sky. ” On sunny days, Salaam kept his front door open and Ardrey would hear music playing. In the fall and winter, Salaam’s television would be tuned to football games. “We would hear him watching games all night and yelling at the TV,” Ardrey said. “But I mean, he was always there by himself. Every day, every night. His car was always in the driveway. ” In the days before his death, Ardrey noticed something unusual: His car was frequently gone at night. “In the last few days, I’ve been thinking: How many times did he go to that park thinking he might  —   and then changed his mind?” Ardrey wondered last week. On the morning of Dec. 5, Ardrey saw her neighbor as she got in her car and waved at him. He waved back and smiled. Much later, he drove away from the condo, leaving a light on in the living room.",0
18078,President Obama Weighs His Economic Legacy - The New York Times,"Two months ago, across an   table in a factory in Jacksonville, Fla. President Barack Obama was talking to me about the problem of political capital. His efforts to rebuild the U. S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were being hit from left, right and center. And yet, by his own assessment, those efforts were vastly underappreciated. “I actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,” he said. “By that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history. ” It was a notably grand claim, especially given the tenor in which presidential candidates of both parties had taken to criticizing the state of the American economy  —   “Many are still barely getting by,” Hillary Clinton said, while Donald Trump said that “we’re a   nation. ” Asked if he was frustrated by all the criticism, Obama insisted that he wasn’t, at least not personally. “It has frustrated me only insofar as it has shaped the political debate,” he said. “We were moving so fast early on that we couldn’t take victory laps. We couldn’t explain everything we were doing. I mean, one day we’re saving the banks the next day we’re saving the auto industry the next day we’re trying to see whether we can have some impact on the housing market. ” The result, he said, was that he lacked the political capital to do more. As his presidency nears its end, this has become an increasingly common refrain from Obama, who, despite his prodigious skills as an orator, has come to seem more confident about his achievements than about his ability to promote them. “I mean, the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken to the swing voter,” he said, “then we might have maintained a majority in the House or the Senate. ” The president had come to this factory, built by Saft America for the manufacture of       batteries, for a kind of belated victory lap. One of Obama’s first major acts as president was to sign the American Recovery and Re investment Act, and some of the money in that bill went to Saft. Now batteries were rolling off the line, and Obama had stopped by to shine the national spotlight on how far we had come since the financial crisis. But the president did seem frustrated. As he tried to sum up his economic legacy in Florida, our discussion stretched to twice as long as planned, seemingly to the consternation of the Secret Service. When we got back on Air Force One, he sent an aide to ask if we could continue the conversation when I joined him again, he looked as if he’d been stewing over something. He quickly returned to the topic of public perception. “If you ask the average person on the streets, ‘Have deficits gone down or up under Obama?’ probably 70 percent would say they’ve gone up,” Obama said, with some justifiable exasperation  —   the deficit has in fact declined (by roughly  ) since he took office, and polls do show that a large majority of Americans believe the opposite. Obama is animated by a sense that, looking at the world around him, the U. S. economy is in much better shape than the public appreciates, especially when measured against the depths of the financial crisis and the possibility  —   now rarely even considered  —   that things could have been much, much worse. Over a series of conversations in the Oval Office, on Air Force One and in Florida, Obama analyzed, sometimes with startling frankness, nearly every element of his economic agenda since he came into office. His economy has certainly come further than most people recognize. The private sector has added jobs for 73 consecutive months  —   some 14. 4 million new jobs in all  —   the longest period of sustained job growth on record. Unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent the year Obama took office, the highest it had been since 1983, under Ronald Reagan, is now 5 percent, lower than when Reagan left office. The budget deficit has fallen by roughly $1 trillion during his two terms. And overall U. S. economic growth has significantly outpaced that of every other advanced nation. Gene Sperling, the former director of the National Economic Council who spent hours inside the Oval Office debating and devising the president’s economic strategy, told me, “If we were back in early 2009  —   when we were coming to work every morning with clenched stomachs, with the economy losing 800, 000 jobs a month and the Dow under 7, 000  —   and someone said that by your last year in office, unemployment would be 5 percent, the deficit would be under 3 percent, AIG would have turned a profit and we made all our money back on the banks, that would’ve been beyond anybody’s wildest expectations. ” There are, of course, many reasons so few Americans seem to be celebrating. “How people feel about the economy,” Obama told me, giving one part of his own theory, is influenced by “what they hear. ” He went on: “And if you have a political party  —   in this case, the Republicans  —   that denies any progress and is constantly channeling to their base, which is sizable, say, 40 percent of the population, that things are terrible all the time, then people will start absorbing that. ” But as Obama also acknowledged, the public anger about the economy is not without empirical basis. A large swath of the nation has dropped out of the labor force completely, and the reality for the average American family is that its household income is $4, 000 less than it was when Bill Clinton left office. Economic inequality, meanwhile, has only grown worse, with the top 1 percent of American households taking in more than half of the recent gains in income growth. “Millions and millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they cannot find themselves in it to save their lives,” Clinton himself said of Obama’s economy in March, while on the campaign trail for his wife. “People are upset, frankly they’re   they’re disoriented, because they don’t see themselves in that picture. ” It is this disconnect that haunts Obama. He has, by his own lights, managed the recovery as well as any president ever could, with results that in many cases exceeded his own best hopes. But despite the gains of the past seven years, many Americans have been left behind. Something has changed, and as he prepares to leave office, Obama seems to understand that his economic legacy might be judged not just by what he has done, but by how the results compare to a bygone era of   opportunity, one that perhaps no president, faced with the sweeping changes transforming the global economy, could ever bring back. The economic meltdown that would define every aspect of Obama’s economy came to a head well before he became president, of course, and so did the legislation that would be the basis for everything that came after. In September 2008  —   as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and AIG, the world’s biggest insurance company, accepted a federal bailout  —   Senator John McCain of Arizona, in what was widely viewed as a political move, suspended his presidential campaign and called on Obama to rush back to Washington for a bipartisan meeting at the White House. Obama recalled the moment: “I still remember Bush calling me and saying, ‘Look, I doubt this is going to be particularly useful, but I felt obliged to say yes, and I hope you can come. ’’u2009” The next day Obama found himself in the Cabinet Room just down the hall from the Oval Office, along with McCain and congressional leaders from both parties. Henry M. Paulson Jr. the Treasury secretary, was developing a bank bailout by which the Treasury would buy up to $700 billion in shaky   securities  —   “troubled assets”  —   a plan that eventually became the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. He needed votes, and Republicans weren’t going for it. Nobody wanted to be seen as a friend of the banks. “We’re sitting around a table, McCain is on one side, I’m on the other, Bernanke and Paulson and President Bush,” Obama recalled. “Paulson says, ‘If we don’t take action now, we could go into a free fall.’ And given how bad the politics were, it was still very tempting for Nancy and Harry”  —   that is, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid  —   “to let the Republicans do what they needed to do. ” Many within Bush’s own party were supporting an alternative bill that was focused on   asset insurance and tax cuts. But Obama, convinced that anything short of a major bailout could lead to economic catastrophe, said Democrats should back Paulson’s plan. They did. It was a rare moment of bipartisanship, with   political consequences. To Obama, this was a necessary alliance with Wall Street and a Republican president. To many others, it looked like a sweetheart deal for the same people who created the mess some critics wondered why he was not equally quick to help aggrieved homeowners through an aggressive   or forgiveness program. “The whole thing about financial crises is the tools that work are the ones that will make you look like you’re in bed with the banks,” said Timothy Geithner, an architect of TARP whom Obama made his Treasury secretary. The strange   relationship with Wall Street made the next part of Obama’s program extremely complicated. When Obama took office, he turned immediately to trying to pass a stimulus package. If TARP was meant to keep the economy out of free fall, the stimulus was meant to help it get back into good shape. The crucial questions was: How much money was needed? Many argue today that Obama’s $800 billion plan, the one that eventually became law, was not enough. With a bigger boost, the economy would have recovered much more quickly and years of needless suffering could have been allayed. In truth, of course, the political headwinds against stimulus were extraordinary. Republicans dismissed it as an irresponsible shopping spree that would leave the country in even greater debt. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader in the House, physically threw the bill on the ground, arguing that it was “nothing more than spending, spending and more spending. ” But Democrats, led by the “deficit hawk” wing of the party, also fought against anything too ambitious, and Obama, still in the first month of his presidency, was left in the position of negotiating with his own party, such that he was just barely able to get the $800 billion on a straight   vote. At first, the results of the stimulus were just as feeble as a stalwart Keynesian might predict. The economy needed a big injection, but it got only a   one, so it continued to falter. A January 2009 report from the president’s Council of Economic Advisers projected that the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent. Instead, it climbed to 10 percent in 2009 and only fell back below 8 percent in 2012, leading to criticism that the stimulus was ineffective. Obama’s critics regularly trot out the talking point that Obama’s economy is “the worst recovery since World War II. ” Judged solely by the growth of gross domestic product, that is accurate. But Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and   of “This Time Is Different,” a   history of financial crises, scoffed when I mentioned the “worst recovery” epithet. “Well, have we had a systemic financial crisis since World War II?” he asked rhetorically. “I mean this was like nothing we’ve experienced since World War II. The 1982 Volcker recession was nothing compared to this, and so you have to look at the nature of the shock. ” Obama, though, was unable or unwilling to rhetorically underscore the severity of the crisis as it unfolded, so perhaps what should have been seen as successes were seen as failures. “It was a delicate balance throughout 2009 and 2010 to be straight with the American people about the depths of the problem, how close we were to disaster, without scaring the heck out of them,” Obama said. Beyond the messaging challenge, Obama faced a practical bind as well: Just as he was trying to reinflate the economy, he was also being forced to cut government jobs, under pressure from Republicans who contended that government bloat and the cost of it could create our next financial crisis. Call it an  . “This is the first recovery where you actually saw the government work force decline, and that created this massive fiscal drag throughout the recovery,” Obama said. Despite all this, over the course of his presidency, Obama has actually been able to oversee a much larger stimulus than has been typically reported. If you add up all of his administration’s classic stimulus measures, including the many tax breaks the administration extended, you get $1. 4 trillion, a figure that is nearly twice the original figure. The   then, was counteracted by a stealth stimulus. “Progressives don’t fully appreciate the degree to which the 2011 budget deal not only averted a potential default but actually limited the potential damage of a newly emboldened Congress in imposing austerity on a   recovery,” Obama said. “And by me winning in 2012 and getting the Bush tax cuts for the upper 2 percent repealed, we ended up getting a grand bargain. It’s just we got it sequentially instead of all at once. ” When I asked Barney Frank about how history will judge the recovery, he was simultaneously rueful and amused. As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Frank was one of the major legislative architects of Obama’s economic program. “You get no credit for disaster averted or damage minimized,” Frank said. By way of illustration, he described a bumper sticker that a friend made him in 2010, with a slogan that could have worked just as well for Obama: “Things would have sucked worse without me. ” Frank, with a halfhearted laugh, added, “That’s not a very salable message. ” Often in our conversations, the president expressed a surprising degree of identification with America’s business leaders. “If I hadn’t gone into politics and public service,” Obama told me, “the challenges of creating a business and growing a business and making it work would probably be the thing that was most interesting to me. ” His showy embrace of capitalism was especially notable given his fractious relationship with Wall Street and the business community for much of his first term. In December 2009, Obama was not reluctant to chastise bankers. “I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of   bankers on Wall Street,” he told Steve Kroft on “60 Minutes. ” “The people on Wall Street still don’t get it. They don’t get it. They’re still puzzled, ‘Why is it that people are mad at the banks? ’’u2009” Given the national mood at the time, Obama’s words shouldn’t have come as a surprise to the business leaders. But the financial sector had buoyed Obama’s campaign, giving him $16 million in political support, nearly twice what McCain received from it, and some executives responded to his new populism in emotional terms. “It’s a war,” Stephen Schwarzman, a   of Blackstone Group, the giant   firm, said of Obama in 2010 and his effort to close a tax loophole that benefited the industry. “It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. ” (Schwarzman later apologized.) Others seemed more concerned with the language itself. In 2011, Leon Cooperman, a billionaire   manager, wrote a public letter to Obama, saying: “The divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf, at this point as much visceral as philosophical, between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them. It is a gulf that is at once counterproductive and freighted with dangerous historical precedents. ” When I asked him about these reactions, Obama laughed. The criticism he leveled at Wall Street “was extraordinarily mild,” he said, but “it hurt their feelings. I would have some of them say to me, ‘You know, my son came home and asked me, ‘Am I a fat cat? ’’u2009” He laughed again. Obama’s rhetoric does seem mild, at least compared with the withering contempt of, say, Franklin Roosevelt, who, laying out the objectives for the second stage of the New Deal in 1936, said that reckless bankers and speculators are “unanimous in their hate for me  —   and I welcome their hatred. ” Obama, to the contrary, seems to find their hatred irritating. “One of the constants that I’ve had to deal with over the last few years is folks on Wall Street complaining even as the stock market went from in the 6, 000s to 16, 000 or 17, 000,” he said. “They’d be constantly complaining about our economic policies. That’s not rooted in anything they’re experiencing it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes. ” Wall Street’s biggest fight with Obama was over the   Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which Obama signed into law in the summer of 2010. The legislation, which runs to 2, 223 pages, limited Wall Street’s riskiest trading schemes, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and created a system to wind down failing banks without   bailouts and break up banks that don’t comply. Like the stimulus,   has been seen as both going too far and not far enough. Some economists have suggested that the reform package, combined with the Federal Reserve’s efforts to force the banks to hold more capital, most likely slowed lending and potentially economic growth in the short term. The new rules may have been sensible in the aftermath of the crisis, but they did take an economic toll. “Growth requires access to capital to finance investments in plant, equipment, technology, and workers,” said Douglas   a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now runs American Action Forum, a   research group. “  made capital scarcer and more expensive at a time when the weak economy desperately needed a boost to growth. ”   estimated in 2015 that the regulations would shave $895 billion off gross domestic product over the next decade. Obama sees the legislation in more complicated terms. He said that he liked the film “The Big Short”  —   a vivid portrayal of the 2008 crisis with a special emphasis on the avarice of its main architects  —   but not its ending. It suggests, wrongly, he said, that nothing has changed on Wall Street. The financial sector “is bigger, absorbs more resources and maybe most importantly, more talent than I would like to see. I would like folks who are really good at math to be going into engineering and the sciences more than they’re going into trying to build algorithms to beat the market and to work arbitrage,” he said. “But there is no doubt that the financial system is substantially more stable,” he said. “It is true that we have not dismantled the financial system, and in that sense, Bernie Sanders’s critique is correct”  —   a reference to the Vermont senator and presidential aspirant who regularly calls to break up America’s biggest banks. “But one of the things that I’ve consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is not an abstraction. It’s not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences. ” The Saft America plant, a giant    mass of concrete, is a modern marvel: its roof covered in row upon row of solar panels, embodying the renewable future that the batteries manufactured within are meant to sustain. (The main customer for the batteries was originally meant to be   manufacturers, but the company is now selling mostly to utilities who want to store solar and wind energy.) Obama spoke from a makeshift stage set up at the center of the factory floor, an American flag and a Saft logo perfectly positioned behind him to catch the sight lines of the photographers. “The reason I’m here today is because Saft is telling a story about the amazing work that people all across this country have done to bring America back from one of the worst financial crises in our history,” Obama said, surveying the crowd. He added: “Anybody who says we are not absolutely better off today than we were just seven years ago, they’re not leveling with you. They’re not telling the truth. ” The story Obama told was one of American ingenuity and growth since the financial crisis. Unemployment in Florida peaked at 11. 2 percent in 2009, higher than the national average, and the state was a center for home foreclosures. Saft America was an example not of the government’s effort just to reduce unemployment right now, which it has, but also to spur investment in the   green technologies, like   batteries, that will help the economy expand for decades to come. In a way, though, the plant was inadvertently telling a more complicated story, about globalization and the changing nature of commerce. Saft America is a unit of Saft Groupe, a French company with holdings around the world. Sales of   batteries have been considerably slower than anticipated, and the factory has yet to turn a profit. The French parent doesn’t expect profitability for another two or three years and has already written down part of its investment on the factory. Here was a factory built, in part, with U. S. government dollars for the benefit of the local and national economy. Yet the factory, its technology and its patents are all owned by a foreign corporation. Its French chief executive is almost completely detached from the community here in Jacksonville he did not even attend Obama’s speech. And the factory’s profits, to the extent they ever come, may very well be sent abroad instead of being reinvested here. The factory visit might also tell a more complicated story about the presidency. It has always been the case that voters credit or, more often, blame the president for the nation’s economic performance. But it is also the case that the president generally has considerably less sway to move the economy than even he might like to acknowledge. And as the economy continues to disperse, that sway may be diminishing further. A president has less power than ever, in either a   power ( ) or   (cultural) sense, over American chief executives, let alone over the chief executives of multinationals based in France or China or other places where many U. S. employers make their headquarters. In the assembly room after the speech, Obama acknowledged as much. “When you’re talking about inversions,” Obama said, referring to the practice whereby American companies effectively move overseas, “or you’re talking about C. E. O. perks or the gap between what the   worker is making compared to what the C. E. O. is making, all those things used to be constrained by the fact that you live in the city, you’re going to church in that city, your kids might be going to the same school as the guy who is working on the assembly line because public schools actually were invested in,” Obama said. “And all those constraining factors have been greatly reduced or, in some cases, eliminated entirely. And that contributes to the trends toward inequality. That contributes to, I think, a divergence between how the people who run these companies and economic elites think about their responsibilities and the policies that they promote with political leaders. And that’s had, I think, a damaging effect on the economy overall. ” Leaning forward in his chair, Obama described the profound structural shifts in the economy over the past two decades that voters often don’t appreciate or acknowledge. “If you are a   worker, you saw manufacturing head out to China,” he said. “You’re in a town, the plant closes. But  —   in part because of the housing bubble  —   a whole bunch of   manufacturing workers could suddenly shift into construction. ” The underlying economic decay was covered up by cheap credit, as homeowners made up for the shortfall in wage growth with   second mortgages and unprecedented loads of   debt. And that “meant that people felt pretty good in terms of their purchasing power even though their underlying situations hadn’t improved appreciably,” Obama said. Then the bubble bursts, “and suddenly they get washed away. ” Those construction jobs have returned slowly, and many of those manufacturing jobs never came back at all. “They’d be much worse off had we not taken the steps that we took,” Obama said. “But they have a sense that it’s a little more of a struggle for them than it might have been for their parents or for their grandparents. ” Obama considered the problem from a political perspective. “In some ways,” he said, “engaging in those hard changes that we need to make to create a more nimble, dynamic economy doesn’t yield immediate benefits and can seem like a distraction or an effort to undermine a bygone era that doesn’t exist. And that then feeds, both on the left and the right, a temptation to say, ‘If we could just go back to an era in which our borders were closed,’ or ‘If we could just go back to a time when everybody had a   plan,’ or ‘We could just go back to a time when there wasn’t any immigrant that was taking my job, things would be O. K.’’u2009” He didn’t mention Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders by name, but the implications were obvious. Perhaps the biggest economic shift during Obama’s presidency came from a piece of legislation that wasn’t sold as such. On March 21, 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. It was Obama’s boldest piece of legislation and the one that will most likely define him. It has been largely viewed as a social program, a way to provide health insurance to tens of millions of uncovered citizens. But the bill, which affected not just insurance companies but doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, also had an immediate and growing impact on the economy as a whole. The health care industry accounts for 17. 5 percent of the U. S. gross domestic product, and health care spending accounts for 8 percent of the average household budget. Of course, the largest economic challenge most Americans ever confront comes in the form of a sudden health crisis. “In the long term,” Sperling told me, “the Affordable Care Act will actually be seen as one of the great economic accomplishments, not just health care, economic. Because it actually is closing a key part of the insecurity gap. ” In closing that gap, though, Obama has been confronted with a knotty economic and political paradox. The legislation was designed to slow the growth of health care costs, even as it extended coverage. Slowing the growth of an industry that accounts for nearly a fifth of the U. S. economy is inevitably going to mean slowing the growth of the economy as a whole. The legislation was also designed to exert a more subtle economic influence. For most of the postwar era, most Americans received health insurance from their employers, in the form of benefits. If they quit their jobs or were fired, they could lose those benefits, and if they had a   condition, they could have a hard time getting them back, even if they got a new job with good benefits elsewhere. That meant they would be much less likely to leave a job, and that meant employers could be a little less worried about raising wages, because they had a somewhat captive work force. In the age of the gig economy, more portable insurance could transform the way we work and potentially have a real effect on wages in some sectors. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that the Affordable Care Act would “reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1. 5 percent to 2. 0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024”  —   a seemingly disastrous outcome for the economy. But, the director of the office, Doug Elmendorf, later wrote, “The reason for the reduction in the supply of labor is that the provisions of the A. C. A. reduce the incentive to work for certain subsets of the population. ” In other words, a lot of people worked because they had to, in order to keep their insurance. Now they could quit, even if they were sick a positive development for them, but with a perverse effect on the economy. And for all of that, Americans do not yet seem to be feeling the benefits of the new program, in part because the benefits remain uncertain. “If your health care premiums go up by 6 percent, you’re still irritated,” Obama said, “even though the trend lines have been those premiums are going up 15 percent. ” Republicans were unanimously opposed to the bill, and Obama could pass only so much major legislation before the congressional election that many expected to flip House control from the Democrats to the Republicans, as it indeed did. That meant that he had to choose the A. C. A. over any number of other   agenda items, including another stimulus, perhaps in the form of a massive infrastructure bill, which would have given the economy an unambiguous boost. “If you went back a few years, you might say, ‘Well, he should’ve focused even more on pushing through a bigger fiscal stimulus, which he could have if he wasn’t going for the Affordable Care Act,” Rogoff said. “That was a   he made, and it cost him. ” Obama knows it. “The fact of the matter is, is that our failure in 2012, 2013, 2014, to initiate a massive infrastructure project  —   it was the perfect time to do it low interest rates, construction industry is still on its heels, massive need  —   the fact that we failed to do that, for example, cost us time,” Obama said. “It meant that there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery. ” After 2010, all that was available to Obama was executive action: The ascendant G. O. P. made anything else nearly impossible. So the president turned more and more to regulatory rule changes and executive orders. He raised the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10. 10 he overhauled immigration policy to protect some illegal immigrants from deportation (the Supreme Court just heard a case to overrule the action) he signed an order calling on government agencies with oversight of industry to find ways to make them more competitive, like pressing cable companies to let customers use cable boxes made by rivals. But without Congress, the big legislative moves, the ones that would really change history, seemed past. “I can probably tick off three or four   things we could have done where we’d be growing a percentage or two faster each year,” Obama said. “We could have brought down the unemployment rate lower, faster. We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did. And those things keep me up at night sometimes. ” When the president’s motorcade left Saft to head back to Air Force One, I noticed something unusual: The plant’s parking lot was extremely small. It dawned on me that Obama’s tour of the factory, filled with photo ops and handshakes, had included very little interaction with workers. Instead, he was shown machine after machine, mostly operated by computers. At one point, he was introduced to   a robot named after the Pixar film that takes battery components from a tray. No employees necessary. This giant mecca of innovation, a physical marvel that if built several decades ago would have easily employed a few thousand people, employs only 300. It was a scene that underscored a challenge facing the U. S. economy and one that may be the driving factor behind greater inequality: We’re not only losing jobs to overseas competition, we’re losing them to technology. Obama noted the robots, too. “We just saw here those robots were pretty impressive, but also pointed to the direction the economy is going,” he said. He clearly recognizes the problem  —   he said he spends a lot of time thinking about it  —   but he also knows the solutions will come only when he is long out of office. Many citizens, he said, back on Air Force One, “have to worry about retraining at some point in their careers, because they can’t anticipate being in one place for 30 years. The occupational mix in the economy places greater demands on people because it’s changing more rapidly. And all of this makes people feel that they don’t know what’s around the corner. ” For whatever sense of “uncertainty” business leaders lament, this may be a much more profound sense of uncertainty. “It’s one of the reasons that I pursued the   Partnership,” he said, bringing up the   pact that, uniquely, has divided both parties, “not because I’m not aware of all the failures of some past trade agreements and the disruptions to our economy that occurred as a consequence of globalization, but rather my assessment that most trends are irreversible given the nature of global supply chains, and so we better be out there shaping the rules in ways that allow for higher labor standards overseas, or try to export our environmental standards overseas so that we have more of a level playing field. ” Whether a president can truly improve, or damage, an economy remains an open question. The greatest economic power might in fact remain in the hands of the Federal Reserve. Economists credit the Fed’s policy of keeping interest rates at historic lows with helping to pump up the economy and bring unemployment down. At the same time, the Fed has been blamed for widening inequality, swelling the price of real estate and corporate profits, even as savers and retirees dependent on   assets have suffered. That can cut either way in terms of a president’s economic legacy. Critics of Obama, including the new House speaker, Paul Ryan, credit Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and Janet Yellen, the current chairwoman, for whatever recovery we’ve had since the crisis, contending it happened in spite of the president. “I think the Federal Reserve has done more,” Ryan said at a January news conference. Frank, for his part, almost jumped through the phone when I mentioned that argument during an interview. “And Bernanke and Yellen were appointed by whom? Neither Bernanke or Yellen would have been able to do what they were doing without his full backing. ” Ultimately, however, Obama said the lessons of his time in office are being misunderstood in the election campaigns. “If you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don’t simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy,” Obama said. “Slashing taxes particularly for those at the very top, dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 percent or 7 percent growth, and claiming that they’ll do all this while balancing the budget. Nobody would even, with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics, think that any of those things are plausible. ” He continued: “If we can’t puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that’s been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in   policy  —   if we can’t describe that effectively, then we’re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes. ”",0
18079,NASA's gateway to deep space,"NASA’s gateway to deep space page: 1 www.abovetopsecret.com... Now, it sems that NASA is making good on his promise and is moving forward with the plan by establishing a Deep-Space Habitat near the Moon to test out systems for people who would live in orbit or travel long distances in Space; a gateway to deep space NASA plans to address its problem by parking a “deep space” habitat in a location near the Moon, which astronauts could visit and use to become acclimated to life beyond low-Earth orbit. President Obama mentioned deep space habitats earlier this month, when he reiterated his call for NASA to send humans to Mars. “I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space,” Obama said. This wasn’t really a new announcement, as NASA has been working on the habitat program for a couple of years. Nevertheless, before the president's mention, this NextSTEP program had received surprisingly little attention given its significance—it might be the most important contract NASA awards for next decade. As Obama said, NASA has embarked upon a ""Journey to Mars."" While the plan may change to include lunar landings as a stepping stone to Mars, the space agency does intend to try and venture back into deep space for the first time since the Apollo program. Whatever destination it chooses, NASA's ambitions will begin with the deep space habitat, because it is an affordable first step, costing hundreds of millions or a few billion dollars initially, instead of multiple billions needed for a full-blown expedition to the Moon's surface, Mars or elsewhere in deep space. ""This is the right next step,"" Simon said. ""We need to understand how to live in deep space, how to live off of our planet."" The first habitat launched in the 2020s won’t be exactly the same as the vehicle NASA eventually sends to Mars. Rather, it will serve as a prototype to help the space agency understand the capabilities, technologies, and systems needed for astronauts to survive for long periods in deep space. Some of those systems can be tested on the ground or the existing space station, but others can only be tested further from Earth. This venture is part of the Next step program initiated by NASA: www.nasa.gov... NextSTEP is a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the Proving Ground around and beyond cislunar space—the space near Earth that extends just beyond the moon. So far, NASA has partnered with 6 companies in this effort: Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and NanoRacks. This is great, ATS! I am very excited at this news, even with all of the morbidity we have in the world today; I'm still excited for the future..! This is an ambitious plan..can US aerospace companies pull this off alone, or should this be more of a global effort? What does ATS think?",0

18081,How Come Washington’s Humanitarian Concerns Always Result in Population Control,"by Jean Perier , via New Eastern Outlook 
Alleged humanitarian efforts have always been a rather important aspect of the state propaganda campaign carried out by the White House and its media. We’ve seen Washington using its proxy NGOs to fight against the alleged “humanitarian crimes” of the Syrian government, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and other states that Washington has declared its enemies. 
This large-scale campaign that is said to be driven by “common human values” has been supported by a number of modern American oligarchs. 
Among those “humanitarian champions” one may find the founder of Microsoft and one of the richest businessmen in the world, Bill Gates.

18083,Donald Trump Keeps Distance in G.O.P. Platform Fight on Gay Rights - The New York Times,"CLEVELAND  —     marriage and transgender rights are emerging as points of serious strain between social conservatives and moderates who are trying to shape the Republican platform, reviving a festering cultural dispute as thousands of party activists and delegates prepare for their convention. Caught in the middle is Donald J. Trump, who claims “tremendous support, tremendous friendship” from gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people, and has gone further than most party figures to embrace them. Gays, in fact, are one of the few minority groups Mr. Trump has not singled out for criticism. But as the presumptive Republican nominee, he is also trying to assuage doubts about the convictions of his conservatism. The uncomfortable dynamic Mr. Trump has created for himself is perhaps best illustrated by his own calendar. He huddled last month at a Manhattan hotel with hundreds of religious conservatives, many of them  —   like James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council  —   outspoken opponents of new legal protections for gay and transgender people. A few days later, he took what an aide described as a friendly and supportive call from Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic decathlete who came out as transgender last year. One of the most contentious issues confronting delegates when they meet on Monday to debate the platform will be whether to adopt a provision defending state laws that try to prevent transgender people from using the public restroom of their choice. At times Mr. Trump has criticized those laws. And he has said Ms. Jenner can use whatever bathroom she prefers at his properties. But he has also promised not to interfere with the platform, which serves as the party’s official declaration of principles. Even as Mr. Trump keeps his distance from the debate, other Republicans who share his more accepting view of gay and transgender issues are working aggressively to tone down some of the platform’s language. The existing platform, adopted in 2012, is replete with disapproval of homosexuality. It calls court decisions favoring   marriage “an assault on the foundations of our society” and accuses the Obama administration of trying to impose “the homosexual rights agenda” on foreign countries. Paul E. Singer, a billionaire Republican who has financed gay rights battles across the country, is now funding an effort to write into the platform language more inclusive of gays, lesbians and transgender people. The goal of his group, the American Unity Fund, is not to get the party to endorse   marriage but to add a more   statement that commits the party “to respect for all families,” though there is still fierce resistance from the right. “We don’t have to say we’re tolerant because we are tolerant of other views,” said James Bopp Jr. a member of the platform committee from Indiana who has long supported efforts to make the platform more strongly in favor of traditional marriage. Such language promoting tolerance, he added, would be “redundant and superfluous. ” Advisers for the American Unity Fund, who say they know they are fighting a steep uphill battle, argue that the Republican Party can no longer afford to alienate people on gay rights issues. “We’ve got to make room for people with diverse views on civil marriage,” said Tyler Deaton, the group’s senior adviser. “This platform doesn’t even make room for people who support civil unions or domestic partnerships or people who support basic legal equality. ” Both parties adopt new platforms at their conventions every four years. A draft of the 2016 version has been put together over the last several weeks by the Republican National Committee, with help from conservative activists. Members of the platform committee received the draft on Sunday evening and will add or change certain provisions over the next two days. The draft circulating Sunday night condemned the Obama administration’s effort to deny funding to states that prohibit transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, accusing the administration of trying to impose a cultural revolution. “They are determined to reshape our schools  —   and our entire society  —   to fit the mold of an ideology alien to America’s history,” the draft reads. Another section criticizes those who boycott businesses that deny services to   couples. Though he will almost certainly not mention it when he accepts the nomination next week, Mr. Trump’s actions and words on gay rights have been more supportive than those of any Republican presidential nominee, even if they fall short of the full social and legal acceptance that his expected opponent, Hillary Clinton, has promoted. He has boasted of his friendships with many gay people, saying “I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay. ” He has supported AIDS charities for years, and welcomed gay couples at his Palm Beach club when doing so was considered remarkable. And he has recently started insisting that he would be a better friend to the gay community than Mrs. Clinton, even though he opposes legal rights like marriage. But as he tries to convince social conservatives that he is not acting as a moderate, Mr. Trump has been largely   with the platform. “His guys have not shown up and said, ‘Change this, change that,’” David Barton, a platform committee member from Texas, said. The Republican platform committee has long been dominated by some of the party’s most stalwart activists. And some of them have hardly been shy about their views. There is Cynthia Dunbar of Virginia, who has compared the gay rights movement to Nazism. Hardy Billington, a committee member from Missouri,  placed an ad in a local paper asserting that homosexuality kills people at two to three times the rate of smoking. And Mary Frances Forrester of North Carolina has claimed that the “homosexual agenda is trying to change the course of Western civilization. ” Mr. Bopp of Indiana recently wrote to delegates to say that the Republican Party has always opposed threats to traditional marriage “beginning with our opposition to the ‘twin relics of barbarism’ of slavery and polygamy in our 1856 platform. ” As dominant as those conservative voices have been, delegates who want to see a more inclusive platform are gaining seats on the committee. Many of them believe the Republican Party needs to have a serious debate this year about whittling down a platform that has grown long and become riddled with   additions. Boyd Matheson, a   platform committee member from Utah, noted that at 33, 000 words, the 2012 platform was “six or seven times longer than the Constitution. ” Recent platforms have become, he said, “these laundry lists and litmus tests of ‘thou shalts’ and ‘thou shalt nots. ’” The party’s first platform in 1856 was fewer than 1, 000 words. As an alternative this year, Mr. Matheson proposed a   document that he said adheres to the founding principles of the party, like equal rights and economic opportunity. It contains no mention of   marriage or transgender issues. “That does not elevate the discussion we need,” Mr. Matheson said. It is not the discussion Mr. Trump is eager to have, either. Asked in a recent interview about the platform, he declined to comment, saying only that he was “looking at it. ” But as a reminder of how unorthodox a Republican Mr. Trump is  —   and of how contrary many of his views on issues like trade, foreign policy, eminent domain and gay rights are to the party’s doctrine  —   there is no more vivid example than the platform. “The bigger problem for Trump and the Republican National Committee,” said Lanhee J. Chen, who led Mitt Romney’s platform efforts in 2012, “is the fact that there are these major disagreements between where Trump is on some of these issues and where the activist base of the party is. ” Differences between a candidate’s views and what is written in the platform are nothing new, of course. Bob Dole admitted he had not read the entire document when he was the Republican nominee in 1996. And he publicly repudiated parts of it that called for a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants. It is not clear Mr. Trump would ever go that far, given how little attention he has paid to the party’s traditions and sacraments. “I don’t know if Trump really cares,” Mr. Chen added.",0

هرب أتباع كرومويل المتشددين من انجلترا بعد استعادة النظام الملكي، واستقروا في هولندا، حيث رسى البعض منهم لاحقا على ضفاف"" ماي فلاور"" في القارة الأمريكية، فعرفوا باسم ""الآباء الحٌجًاج"".
كررت حرب الاستقلال الأميركية في القرن الثامن عشر، أحداث المواجهة الكالفانية ضد النظام الملكي البريطاني، لدرجة أن الانكليز أطلقوا عليها اسم ""الحرب الأهلية الثانية"".
في القرن التاسع عشر، أدت الحرب الانفصالية إلى مواجهة مسلحة بين ولايات الجنوب (التي تقطنها أغلبية من المستوطنين الكاثوليك) ضد ولايات الشمال (التي يسكنها عموما مستوطنون بروتستانت).
التاريخ الذي يكتبه عادة المنتصرون، أخبرنا أن تلك الحرب كانت نضالاً من أجل التحرر من العبودية، وهي بالطبع رواية دعائية (بروباغاندا) لأن الولايات الجنوبية ألغت العبودية أثناء الحرب، بعد أن تمكنت من عقد حلف مع المملكة البريطانية).
في الواقع، لاتزال المواجهة مستمرة بين المتشددين، وبين التاج البريطاني الذي يحاول النهوض من جديد.
إنه هو ذاته، الفكر البروتستانتي المتشدد الذي دفع الإدارات المتعاقبة لكل من كارتر، وريغان، وبوش (الأب والابن على حد سواء، أحفاد الآباء الحجاج)، فضلاً عن كلينتون وأوباما لدعم الوهابية، وداعش الآن، رغم تعارضهما مع القيم السامية التي يعلنها بلدهم.
أسس الآباء الحجاج في السابق مجتمعات طائفية في بلايموث وبوسطن، وادعوا إنشاء ""إسرائيل جديدة"". وعلى الرغم من كونهم مسيحيين، فقد أولوا الكتابات اليهودية أهمية أكبر من الإنجيلية، فانتزعوا الصلبان من معابدهم، واستبدلوها بألواح النبي موسى. كما أجبروا النساء على وضع الحجاب وتغطية رؤوسهن بالكامل، وأعادوا تطبيق العقوبات الجسدية.

18087,New ‘London pound’ coin to be worth about 45p,"New ‘London pound’ coin to be worth about 45p 01-11-16 THE new 2017 pound coin will be a special ‘London pound’ worth less than half as much as the national version. Londoners will be paid their salaries in the new currency without any increase to reflect the lower value, then be expected to still somehow pay their rent and bills. A Royal Mint spokesman said: “It’s past time London had its own currency which reflects the remarkably poor value and hellish nature of the city.” Restaurants and cafes have already prepared for the new coin by removing the ‘£’ signs from menus to make prices seem less extortionate. Londoner Norman Steele said: “According to this menu a bacon butty is ‘7’. I knew there was no way that would be in normal pounds because it’s a bit of bacon jammed between two slices of bread. “It’s good to know the precise terms on which I am being totally fucked.”

18088,Defying the Politics of Fear   :," Defying the Politics of Fear By Chris Hedges
Chris Hedges gave this talk Saturday evening at a rally in Philadelphia for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka.
November 08, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" Truth Dig "" - No social or revolutionary movement succeeds without a core of people who will not betray their vision and their principles. They are the building blocks of social change. They are our only hope for a viable socialism. They are willing to spend their lives as political outcasts. They are willing to endure repression. They will not sell out the oppressed and the poor. They know that you stand with all of the oppressedpeople of color in our prisons and marginal communities, the poor, unemployed workers, our LGBT community, undocumented workers, the mentally ill and the Palestinians, Iraqis and Afghans whom we terrorize and murderor you stand with none of the oppressed. They know when you fight for the oppressed you get treated like the oppressed. They know this is the cost of the moral life, a life that is not abandoned even if means you are destined to spend generations wandering in the wilderness, even if you are destined to fail.
I was in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania in 1989 during the revolutions, or in the case of Romania an interparty putsch. These revolutions were spontaneous outbursts by an enraged population that had had enough of communist repression, mismanagement and corruption. No one, from the dissidents themselves to the ruling communist parties, anticipated these revolts. They erupted, as all revolutions do, from tinder that had been waiting years for a spark.
These revolutions were led by a handful of dissidents who until the fall of 1989 were marginal and dismissed by the state as inconsequential until it was too late. The state periodically sent state security to harass them. It often ignored them. I am not even sure you could call these dissidents an opposition. They were profoundly isolated within their own societies. The state media denied them a voice. They had no legal status and were locked out of the political system. They were blacklisted. They struggled to make a living. But when the breaking point in Eastern Europe came, when the ruling communist ideology lost all credibility, there was no question in the minds of the public about whom they could trust. The demonstrators that poured into the streets of East Berlin and Prague were aware of who would sell them out and who would not. They trusted those, such as Václav Havel , who had dedicated their lives to fighting for open society, those who had been willing to be condemned as nonpersons and go to jail for their defiance.
Our only chance to overthrow corporate power comes from those who will not surrender to it, who will hold fast to the causes of the oppressed no matter what the price, who are willing to be dismissed and reviled by a bankrupt liberal establishment, who have found within themselves the courage to say no, to refuse to cooperate. The most important issue in this election does not revolve around the personal traits of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. It revolves around the destructive dynamic of unfettered and unregulated global capitalism, the crimes of imperialism and the security and surveillance apparatus. These forces are where real power lies. Trump and Clinton will do nothing to restrict them.
It is up to us to resist. We must refuse to be complicit, even in the act of voting, with the fossil fuel industrys savaging of our ecosystem, endless wars, oppression of the poor, including the one in five children in this country who is hungry, the evisceration of constitutional rights and civil liberties, the cruel and inhumane system of mass incarceration and the state-sponsored execution of unarmed poor people of color in our marginal communities.
Julien Benda reminds us that we can serve two sets of principles. Privilege and power or justice and truth. The more we make compromises with those who serve privilege and power the more we diminish the capacity for justice and truth. Our strength comes from our steadfastness to justice and truth, a steadfastness that accepts that the corporate forces arrayed against us may crush us, but that the more we make compromises with those whose ends are privilege and power the more we diminish our capacity to effect change.
Karl Popper in The Open Society and Its Enemies writes that the question is not how do you get good people to rule. Popper says this is the wrong question. Most people attracted to power, he writes, have rarely been above average, either morally or intellectually, and often [have been] below it. The question is how do we build forces to restrict the despotism of the powerful. There is a moment in Henry Kissingers memoirsdo not buy the bookwhen Nixon and Kissinger are looking out at tens of thousands of anti-war protesters who have surrounded the White House. Nixon had placed empty city buses in front of the White House to keep the protesters back. He worried out loud that the crowd would break through the barricades and get him and Kissinger. And that is exactly where we want people in power to be. This is why, although he was not a liberal, Nixon was our last liberal president. He was scared of movements. And if we cannot make the elites scared of us we will fail.
The rise of Donald Trump is the product of the disenchantment, despair and anger caused by neoliberalism and the collapse of institutions that once offered a counterweight to the powerful. Trump gives vent to the legitimate rage and betrayal of the white underclass and working poor. His right-wing populism, which will grow in virulence and sophistication under a Clinton presidency, mirrors the right-wing populism rippling across much of Europe including Poland, Hungary, France and Great Britain. If Clinton wins, Trump becomes the dress rehearsal for fascism.
A bankrupt liberal class, as was true in Yugoslavia when I covered the war and as was true in Weimar Germany, is the great enabler of fascism. Liberals, in the name of the practical, refuse to challenge parties that betray workingmen and women. They surrender their values for political expediency. Our [failure] to build a counterweight to the Democratic Party after it abandoned the working class with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 was our gravest mistake.
Hillary Clinton embodies the detested neoliberal establishment. She can barely fend off one of the most imbecilic and narcissistic candidates in American history. Matched against a demagogue with brains and political skill, she would lose. If we do not defy the neoliberal order, championed by Clinton and the Democratic Party elites, we ensure the conditions for a terrifying right-wing backlash, one that will use harsh and violent mechanisms to crush the little political space we have left.
The tactic of strategic voting begs the question Strategic for whom? Our money-drenched, heavily managed elections are little more than totalitarian plebiscites to give a veneer of legitimacy to corporate power. As long as we signal that we are not a threat to the established order, as long as we participate in this charade, the neoliberal assault will continue towards its frightening and inevitable conclusion.
Alexis de Tocqueville correctly saw that when citizens can no longer participate in a meaningful way in political life, political populism is replaced by a cultural populism of sameness, resentment and mindless patriotism and by a form of anti-politics he called democratic despotism. The language and rituals of democracy are used to mask a political system based on the unchallenged supremacy of corporate power, one the political philosopher Sheldon Wolin calls inverted totalitarianism.
We must build structures of open defiance to the corporate state. It may take as long as a decade for us to effectively confront corporate power. But without a potent counterweight to the neoliberal order we will be steadily disempowered. Every action we take, every word we utter must make it clear that we refuse to participate in our own enslavement and destruction. The rapid disintegration of the ecosystem means resistance cannot be delayed.
Our success will be determined not by the number of votes we get in this or any other election but by our ability to stand unequivocally with the oppressed. The enemies of freedom throughout history have always charged its defenders with subversion. The enemies of freedom have often convinced large parts of a captive population to parrot back mind-numbing clichés to justify their rule. Resistance to corporate power will require fortitude, an ability to march to the beat of our own drum.
No revolutionary abandons, no matter what the cost, those he or she defends. We cannot betray those murdered by police in our marginal communities. We cannot betray the courageous dissidentsJulian Assange, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden and the great revolutionary Mumia Abu-Jamal . They have not betrayed us. We cannot betray the dissidents in North Dakota who are defying a fossil fuel industry that is orchestrating the sixth great mass extinction , melting the polar ice caps and raising carbon emissions to over 400 parts per million. We cannot betray the 2.3 million men and women locked in cages across this nation for years and decades. We cannot betray the Palestinians. We cannot betray the Iraqis and Afghans whose lives we have destroyed by state terror. If we betray them we betray ourselves.
We cannot betray the ideal of a popular democracy by pretending this contrived political theater is free or fair or democratic. We cannot play their game. We cannot play by their rules. Our job is not to accommodate the corporate state. Our job is to destroy it. We think we are the doctors, Alexander Herzen told anarchists of another era. We are the disease.
The state seeks to control us through fear, propaganda, wholesale surveillance and violence. [This] is the only form of social control it has left. The lie of neoliberalism has been exposed. Its credibility has imploded. The moment we cease being afraid, the moment we use our collective strength as I saw in Eastern Europe in 1989 to make the rulers afraid of us, is the moment of the systems downfall.
Go into the voting booth on Tuesday. Do not be afraid. Vote with your conscience. Vote Green. If we win 5 percent we win. Five percent becomes the building block for the years ahead. A decade ago Syriza, the ruling party in Greece, was polling 4 percent. And after you vote, join some movement, some protest, some disruption, Black Lives Matter, the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel, an anti-fracking demonstration. Courage is contagious. Revolutions begin, as I saw in East Germany, with a few Lutheran clergy holding candles as they marched through the streets of Leipzig in East Germany. It ends with half a million people protesting in East Berlin, the defection of the police and the army to the side of the protesters and the collapse of the Stasi state. But revolutions only happen when a few dissidents decide they will no longer cooperate, when they affirm what we must all affirm, when, as Havel said, they choose to live in truth.
We may not succeed. So be it. At least those who come after us, and I speak as a father, will say we tried. The corporate forces that have us in their death grip will destroy our lives. They will destroy the lives of my children. They will destroy the lives of your children. They will destroy the ecosystem that makes life possible. We owe it to those who come after us not to be complicit in this evil. We owe it to them to refuse to be good Germans. I do not, in the end, fight fascists because I will win. I fight fascists because they are fascists.
Chris Hedges, spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in Central America, the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. He has reported from more than 50 countries and has worked for The Christian Science Monitor, National Public Radio, The Dallas Morning News and The New York Times, for which he was a foreign correspondent for 15 years.
Chris Hedges: The End of the Election Will Not Mean the End of Public Anger Posted on Nov 8, 2016
In a 30-minute interview with Sophie Shevardnadze at RT, Truthdig columnist Chris Hedges discusses who will be the real loser in the 2016 U.S. presidential race.
Sophie Shevardnadze: Chris Hedges, Pulitzer-prize winning journalist, author, welcome to the show once again, great to have you back. Hillary was seemingly cruising to victory just after the debates - some polls gave her a 10 point lead - and now theres virtually nothing separating the candidates. Today, if you had a million bucks whod you bet it on - Clinton or Trump?
Chris Hedges: Its impossible to tell you, because it really will depend on the mood, on the emotions of the voters on election day. That's all these campaigns are about, because they both essentially are neo-liberal candidates who will do nothing to impede imperial expansion and corporate power. The whole campaign has descended to, you know, not surprisingly, to the level of a reality TV show, with presidential debates featuring women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault being brought in by Donald Trump; videos - I'll go back to the primaries - of the size of people's genitals. I mean, it's just appalling, but all of that is emblematic of a political system in deep decay and one that no longer revolves around fundamental issues. We know from the Wikileaks emails, the John Podesta emails that were leaked from Hillary Clinton, that there was a calculated effort on a part of a Clinton campaign to promote these fringe candidates - like Trump, and they particularly wanted Trump, because the difference between Hillary Clinton and a more mainstream Republican candidate, like Jeb Bush, is so marginal. So if you had to ask me, I don't think Trump will win, but I don't rule out the possibility that he will win - we have to look at the Brexit polls in Britain...
SS: Right.
CH: ...And same kind of anger is underway here.
SS: The FBI is extending its investigation into the Clinton email case - after obtaining a warrant to search the laptop of Clintons closest aide Huma Abedin. The Clinton campaign says the move is political - is the FBI guilty of swaying the vote, like Hillary suggests?
CH: To be fair to FBI, they were put in a very difficult position - there are tens of thousands, they say 660,000 emails, we don't really know how many of those, but if the FBI made this discovery and did not make it public, they would be accused, of course, of aiding Clinton campaign. I don't know the motives, but I think we do have to recognise that the FBI, I think, felt correctly, that given the volatility of the campaign and the fact that they had, after the investigation of the Clinton email - she had used a private server - while they certainly felt that it was inappropriate to exonerate her of criminal activity that they felt kind of a responsibility to be transparent.
SS: Another FBI investigation showed that the bureau didnt find any evidence that Trump is tied to the Kremlin, like the Clinton campaign implied - has Hillarys attempt to play the Russian card failed?
CH: I don't know that it's failed, because the media has been quite obsequious in terms of parroting back this narrative, and one of the frustrations of the Wikileaks email dumps, the John Podesta emails, he is her campaign manager, runs her campaign - is that the contents were often overlooked to essentially ask the question: ""Is Russia trying to influence the elections?"", and as a former investigative reporter for the New York times, this is just not a legitimate question. I spent many-many years, 15 years with the Times, I was elated all sorts of information by all sorts of governments, from the French Intelligence agency to the Israeli Secret Service, the Mossad, to the U.S. government - and these people were not leaking it because they cared about democracy or an open society, they were leaking this information because it was in their interest to do so, and my job, as a reporter, was to determine whether this leaked information was true or untrue - and that's really the only thing the reporter should do with the leaked information on the Podesta emails. But one of the things that as a reporter, as a former investigative reporter, that has disturbed me is that they have - I'm talking about the press, especially about the electronic, commercial corporate press - they have effectively ignored much of what is in the emails to carry up this speculation. Meanwhile, of course, nobody has offered us any evidence that the Trump campaign is linked in any way to Russia or that Russia is responsible for the email dump.
SS: Were used to the fact that ordinary Americans dont really care about foreign policy, but this campaign has focused a lot on foreign issues and Russia in particular. Are candidates trying to unite the nation by creating the image of a foreign threat?
CH: Yeah. It's very disturbing on many levels, the kind of neo-conservative foreign policy cabal led by Robert Kagan and others that is around Clinton. The very people who gave the disastrous Iraq war, are now proposing policies to bait Russia. You know, it makes absolutely no sense to those of us who spend as many, as I did, two decades abroad as a foreign correspondent, except that it plays well politically into this very stunted, peculiar, neocon vision of the world, and that is that everybody out there only understands one language, and that's force. That's how you see these 15 years now of war, the longest war in U.S. history. It's been an utter disaster, utter failure, both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and of course, Syria, and Libya - and yet, what's the response? More bombs, more bombs, more bombs, which created the problems in the first place.
SS: Yeah, and do Americans like being scared by a foreign adversary?
CH: No, I don't think they ""like"" it, but it's a very effective form of control. Fear works, and Americans are hardly the only people to use it. Terrorism, the specter of Russia...whatever it is! Fear is a form of social control, and when you have essentially two political parties that are doing corporate bidding that serves the interests of corporate global elites, at the expense of the citizens - they need fear, they need to manufacture fear, and I think that's what we're seeing.
SS: Trump has said things along the lines of this election is rigged and hes hinted that he may contend the results, which is kind of like admitting hell be defeated. Is this talk backfiring and scaring away voters? Why would people head to the ballots if they think their voice doesnt count anyway?
CH: The Trump's base, primarily white lower-working class, which has been dispossessed through de-industrialisation, is going to head to the polls. They are attempting to work within the system. If the race is close and Trump loses, I think, everything we have seen, given the volatility of Trump, suggests that he will charge that the elections were rigged. We certainly have seen evidence now, from in particular the leaked emails, of the rigging of the primaries on the part of the Democratic National Committee, on behalf of the Clintons. It's pretty clear that Nevada Caucus was stolen, they blocked independents from voting in many of the primaries, in many of the states, and independents were Bernie Sanders' primary base. We just saw a few days ago, a day or two ago, that Clinton was actually leaked questions that would be given to her at a staged... I mean, they call them ""Townhalls"", they're totally Potemkin-like reality shows, totally scripted - so, its enough to look into the inner workings to suggest that these people, the Clinton machine, the Democratic party do not play fair. So, yeah, I think that that is the danger and the danger becomes then, when enraged Trump supporters believe that the system is rigged, the system is broken, it doesn't function fairly - and that becomes dangerous, because these people will resort to kind of anarchic levels of violence.
SS: Filmmaker Michael Moore, who you cant call a Republican-friendly figure exactly, called Trump a human Molotov cocktail which desperate poor voters can throw at the system that stole their lives from them. How come a Republican candidate is the candidate of the dispossessed, shouldnt Hillary be the one taking care of them?
CH: Yeah. That is the whole idea, that a billionaire developer is somehow the voice of the dispossessed, but he has tapped into this right-wing populism. This is coupled with a kind of xenophobia, kind of exalted nationalism, and a statement - which is true, of course - that the elites have betrayed the ordinary citizenry. So, when Donald Trump goes to Michigan and stands before the executives from car manufacturers, who are moving their plants over the border, courtesy of NAFTA, to Mexico, and says that if you try to make cars in Mexico, I'll put a 35% tariff on it - this is something that no candidate, in either party, has been saying, and there are many-many really struggling... I mean, half of this country now lives in poverty, people who have been waiting a long time for somebody to stand up and defy these corporate executives and CEOs who have destroyed their lives, the lives of their communities, destroyed the lives of their families. So, in that sense, Trump is not a traditional Republican which is why the Republican establishment itself has united with the Democratic establishment to try and destroy the Trump presidency - much as in 1972, the left-wing insurgent candidate George McGovern saw the establishment of the Democratic party unite with the establishment of the Republican party to elect Richard Nixon.
SS: The election is estimated to have cost 6.6 billion dollars so far -thats including the House and Senate campaign spending, and is likely to end up being even more pricey than that. Thats the whole budget of Bahrain. Elections in India have four times as many voters and cost one billion less. Is this price tag cutting off any truly independent candidate, like Bernie Sanders?
CH: You can't compete, unless you can raise that kind of money, unless you can get into debates. Bernie Sanders actually raised significant sums, he didn't do it through corporations, his average campaign contribution was $27 - but yeah, you can't play in this game of political theater, unless you're bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. That is the part of the way they lock out third-party candidates, like the Green party candidate Jill Stein.
SS: The Democratic party managed to fend off an anti-system challenger - Sanders - how come the Republicans couldnt find anyone who could defeat Trump?
CH: Because the establishment itself is so deeply hated, so when the Republican establishment finally did - they didn't take him seriously in the beginning, and when they did turn on him, they trotted out the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney to attack him, and people just laughed. It's the Romneys, the Bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas, it's that establishment that people are turning against - which is why Hillary Clinton is having such a difficult time competing against such an imbecilic, undisciplined and impulsive and, frankly, ignorant candidate.
SS: I'm just wondering - why is the media, even the right-leaning media, which created Trumps phenomenon - turning on him in this campaign?
CH: Two reasons. One - he is attacking the trade agreements, which is how the elites make their money, and secondly, he's a public relations disaster for the U.S. I think those are the two reasons. Maybe, the third reason is that they don't know what they're getting with Trump - nobody knows what they're getting with Trump. Trump doesn't know what he's getting with Trump, and they know that Clinton will maintain both the imperial overreach and the design of the corporate state. So, Clintons a sure bet and Trump is just too volatile a candidate, and that's why the establishment has turned on him.
SS: PresidentObama has hit the campaign trail to endorse Hillary Clinton - hes warning that all the progress will go out the window if we dont make the right choice. Do you think everything Obama achieved will really go out the window if Trump gets elected?
CH: I don't think Obama has achieved very much. His healthcare program which is essentially forcing citizens to buy defective corporate products and we're watching now massive increases, on an average of 22%, and people that have the bronze plan, different levels of plans cannot even afford the kinds of premiums and copayments... - I mean, the whole system is a disaster. His assault on civil liberties has been worse than under Bush, he has expanded imperial wars, in places like Libya, create more failed states. I don't think Obama has much of a legacy. He'll walk out and get rich and will start his own Foundation like the Clintons - there's almost a complete continuity between Bush and Obama.
SS: A recent CNN ORC poll says Obamas approval rating is higher than at any time during his presidency - why is he doing so great now that hes leaving? Is that his Hillary campaigning paying off?
CH: You know, these people run very skilled public relations operations which revolve not around policy but around creating manufactured personalities, and that has been very difficult for Clinton - and that's why Clinton has the second-highest disapproval rating of any Presidential candidate as far as we know in American history, with the exception, of course, of the person she's competing against - Donald Trump. We have to look at what American politics is - it's really about creating feelings, emotions, getting voters to confuse how they are made to feel with knowledge. It is not about actual policies, and both Michelle Obama who has a very high kind of favourability rating and Barack Obama have been skilled in doing that. It's much more difficult, that's part of the problem, for the Clinton campaign.
SS: Looking back at the beginning of Obama's presidency, the Nobel committee handed Obama the peace prize in 2009 - not for his accomplishments, but for his intentions. But the promised peace didnt come to Afghanistan, didnt come to Iraq, were seeing the unravelling of other Middle Eastern states - did Obamas peace vision not only fail but make things worse?
CH: Oh yeah, of course, look at Libya, look at Syria, look at Somalia, look at Iraq, look at Afghanistan, look at Pakistan. No, it's a complete catastrophe. I've spent seven years in the Middle East, I was the Middle East bureau chief for the New York Times, and what we've done is, I would argue, the greatest strategic blunder in American history, and it's one that Obama aided and abetted. The whole idea of him as a peace candidate is... I mean, I kind of gave up on the Nobel Prize Committee, I have no idea why this was done. As you correctly pointed out, he hadn't even done anything.
SS: Was it a genuine inability to make things better, were his hands tied?
CH: No. He was an establishment candidate, he was selected, anointed and promoted by the Democratic Chicago political machine, which is one of the dirtiest in the country, he got more money in 2008 from Wall St. than the Republican candidate who was against him - McCain. No, he's very cynical...bright, talented, unlike George Bush, but deeply cynical candidate. He brought in the old establishment, including the old Defence Secretary Robert Gates, who had been the Secretary of Defence under Bush, he brought in old these figures like Larry Summers and Geithner who are Wall St. marionettes. No, Obama knew very well what he was doing from the very beginning and effectively... Look, he won Advertising Age's top annual award which was ""Marketer of the Year"". His campaign did, because the professionals knew just what he done - he functioned as a brand for the corporate state, a very powerful and a very effective one.
SS: On the other hand America has restored relations with Cuba and reached a nuclear deal with Iran - both seemed unachievable just a couple of years ago. Do you count those as a Obama's foreign policy successes?
CH: Yeah, they are foreign policy successes, but we have to understand that the Pentagon had long fought the neocons call for war with Iran, even under the Bush administration they put a stop to it. So, there was no appetite within the American military establishment for war with Iran anyway. So that wasn't really an option, despite Israeli pressure. In terms of Cuba, it just got to the point of absurdity - the boycott of Cuba, and we must also remember that the second generation of Cuban Americans did not have that kind of hatred towards Fidel Castro and towards the Cuban regime, and so it was politically safer for the Democratic party because the new generation, just like the new second and third generation of Jewish Americans don't have that loyalty to Israel - it wasn't as politically volatile a decision.
SS: Obama made global zero a strategic objective - however he failed to get America to ban nuclear tests by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty, while the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock to three minutes to midnight - that is to a nuclear war. Why did Obamas promise to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American foreign policy backfire?
CH: Because the military-industrial establishment is so powerful in the United States that politicians serve its interests. They don't dictate what the interests of that industry is - officialy, it swallows about 53% of our discretionary budget, but that, of course, masks huge other expenditures, including for our nuclear weapon systems, which isn't counted for Veteran's affairs, which is huge for, if you want to count, the security and surveillance state, which is officially hidden, but probably at least a hundred billion dollars... We're starving the rest of society to do that, and you can't fight these wars. Indeed, if you were watching the Bernie Sander's campaign, Sanders did not take on imperial adventurism or the military establishment - because you can't, within the American political system - and Obama, I think, is an example of that.
SS: Police shootings of unarmed black men have sparked massive protests and the Black lives matter movement - does Obama being the first black president actually mean little for race troubles in the U.S.?
CH: It means nothing, because you have de-industrialised urban centres, i.e. places that once had factories and jobs, which are now in ruins - you walk through them and it's boarded up factories and pothole streets and crumbling infrastructure, dysfunctional schools, and there are no jobs. So you have created mini police states in these marginal communities, where police can serve, as we see, as Judge, Jury and Executioner - three in one. Americans, almost all poor people of colour, are shot by police in this country every day, and it's a form of social control, along, of course, with mass incarceration. We have 25% of the world's prison population and 4% of the world's population - most of those imprisoned are poor people of colour. So, when you've taken away the possibility for jobs and with it the possibilities for hope, for advancement, for inclusion within both the economic and political system - then you need these very harsh forms of controls in order to keep people, essentially, fenced in. That's why these killings don't stop, it doesn't matter how many protests are carried out, and Obama has quite sadly betrayed, if we go back especially to 2008 and even to 2012, his primary base - African-Americans voted in staggering numbers for Obama, I think, 90% or something. Almost that high, and yet life for African-Americans, I would argue, after 8 years of Obama, is worse than when he took power.

18089,Supreme Court Turns Away Challenge to Connecticut Ban on Semiautomatic Weapons - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court refused on Monday to hear a Second Amendment challenge to a Connecticut law banning many semiautomatic rifles. The law, enacted in 2013 in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. made it a crime to sell or possess the firearms, which critics call assault weapons. The decision not to hear the case, not long after the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. does not set a Supreme Court precedent. But it is part of a trend in which the justices have given at least tacit approval to broad   laws in states and localities that choose to enact them. The case, Shew v. Malloy, No.  was brought by four individuals, a business and two advocacy groups. They said the ban was irrational, ineffective and unconstitutional. “Connecticut dubs a semiautomatic firearm” with one of several common features “an ‘assault weapon,’ but that is nothing more than an argument advanced by a political slogan in the guise of a definition,” they told the Supreme Court in their petition seeking review. In October, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, upheld the ban almost entirely. It acknowledged that the affected weapons were in common use and assumed their possession was protected by the Second Amendment. But the appeals court ruled that the Connecticut law passed constitutional muster. The law was “specifically targeted to prevent mass shootings like that in Newtown, in which the shooter used a semiautomatic assault weapon,” Judge José A. Cabranes wrote for the court. “Plaintiffs complain that mass shootings are ‘particularly rare events’ and thus, even if successful, the legislation will have a ‘minimal impact’ on most violent crime. “That may be so,” Judge Cabranes continued. “But   legislation ‘need not strike at all evils at the same time’ to be constitutional. ” The Supreme Court also turned down on Monday a challenge to a similar New York law in Kampfer v. Cuomo, No.  . It was filed by Douglas E. Kampfer, a New York resident who had litigated the case without a lawyer. The Second Circuit denied his appeal in a brief order in March. It has been eight years since the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to keep guns at home for   in District of Columbia v. Heller, which struck down parts of an exceptionally strict local law. Since then, the justices have said almost nothing about the scope of that right. When the court rejected a Second Amendment case in December from a Chicago suburb, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, dissented. They accused the majority of abdicating its responsibility to enforce the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. (Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion in the Heller case, which was decided by a    vote.) “Roughly five million Americans own   semiautomatic rifles,” Justice Thomas wrote. “The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including   and target shooting,” Justice Thomas added. “Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons. ”",0
18090,"More Than 200 MS-13 Members Reside in Long Island, FBI Says","There are more than 200 members of the violent, El Salvadorian   gang in the Long Island, New York area, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [The FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force Director Geraldine Hart told NBC New York in an interview that members of   “bolster their ranking among other gangs by using violence. ”  Hart told the media that the   gang problem, specifically as its members are usually illegal immigrants, is a national issue across the U. S. “This is not a local problem,” Hart told NBC New York. “This is a national and international problem. We know that there are direct links from El Salvador up here into the New York area. ” The area of Brentwood, Long Island, more precisely, has undergone a transformation due to the   gang and its roots in illegal immigration. As the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) notes,   flourished in Brentwood as placement of unaccompanied minor illegal immigrant children grew more than 100 percent from 2015 to 2016. Brentwood has seen a booming El Salvadorian population in an area that was once primarily working class, Puerto  . “By 2010, nearly 40 percent of the community was born in or had citizenship from a Central American country,” CIS Fellow Joseph Kolb writes. “This figure was nearly six times the national average. The majority 68 percent Hispanic population shifted now to 51 percent Central American and 18 percent Puerto Rican. ” Recent Long   deaths by   include the brutal murders of Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, two teenage girls beaten and killed by illegal immigrant gang members, Breitbart Texas reported.

18091,Among Questions for Trump on Iran: What About American Prisoners? - The New York Times,"President Trump and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran have made no secret of their mutual contempt, raising fears of possible armed confrontation and doubts about the nuclear agreement reached under Mr. Trump’s predecessor. Equally uncertain are the fates of at least seven people in Iran, five of them American citizens. Four were imprisoned after the nuclear accord took effect and relaxed sanctions against Iran in exchange for its verifiable guarantees of peaceful nuclear work. Relatives of the imprisoned and their advocates have been speaking out, frustrated and wondering how Mr. Trump will deal with the problem. As a candidate, he promised to resolve the prisoner issue but since the inauguration has said little about it. “I’m trying to reach out to everyone I can to help,” said Babak Namazi, whose father, Baquer Namazi, 80, a former Unicef official, and brother, Siamak, 45, a businessman and advocate of stronger Iranian ties with the United States, are among the Americans languishing in prison. “Every day that goes by, my concern for my father and Siamak increases,” Mr. Namazi said this week in a telephone interview from Dubai, where he lives. He expressed particular anxiety about his father, who has a heart ailment, saying that an Iranian prison cell was “no place for an aging old man. ” Last month, on the anniversary of the elder Mr. Namazi’s imprisonment, Unicef exhorted the Iranian authorities to release him. “After a lifetime of humanitarian service, he has earned a peaceful retirement,” a Unicef statement said. Mr. Trump has frequently railed against the nuclear agreement, describing it as a giveaway to Iran. He also vowed as a candidate to bring home Robert Levinson, an American who has been missing in Iran for 10 years. The Iranian authorities, who have claimed ignorance about Mr. Levinson’s whereabouts, are holding at least four American citizens of Iranian descent and two permanent residents of the United States. No official talks are known to be underway about releasing them. But Mr. Trump has made clear that he will not pay what he says amounts to ransom, which the Obama administration was accused of doing after the Iranians released five Americans in January 2016, when the nuclear agreement entered into force. President Barack Obama’s aides described the payment made to Iran, which totaled roughly $1. 7 billion, as the coincidental settling of an old, unresolved debt, an explanation widely regarded by critics  —   and even some administration supporters  —   with cynicism. Their suspicions were reinforced when Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers were later quoted in Iran’s state press as having bragged about the payment. The boasting suggested that some powerful Iranians believed a precedent had been set to demand more money for further prisoner releases. “Whatever Obama administration officials wish to call it, their de facto ransom payment has encouraged Iran to double down on efforts to target U. S. citizens traveling there,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, an associate fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a   group critical of the Iran nuclear deal, wrote in a recent policy brief. The Americans seized since the deal was completed, he wrote, are “testament to that disconcerting trend. ” In a widely quoted Twitter message in October, after Siamak and Baquer Namazi were sentenced to 10 years in prison on unexplained charges of having aided a hostile foreign power  —   meaning the United States  —   Mr. Trump denounced Iran over what he called its demand “for a fortune” in prisoner exchanges. “This doesn’t happen if I’m president,” he stated. Iran’s use of American prisoners for negotiation leverage has been a recurrent theme in the   history of its enmity with the United States. The prisoners released after the successful nuclear diplomacy were widely seen as pawns in that effort. It remains unclear precisely why Iran has continued what appears to be an arbitrary pattern of arresting Americans of Iranian descent, with no obvious evidence of wrongdoing. But many   advocates of   views in Iran, including Ayatollah Khamenei, see   as particularly dangerous spreaders of seditious ideas. Other Americans known to be held in Iran are Karan Vafadari, 55, a Tehran art gallery owner, arrested in July along with his wife, Afarin Niasari, 44, an Iranian citizen with permanent United States residency status and Robin Shahini, 46, a rights activist and San Diego State University graduate student, arrested in July while visiting his sick mother. What charges, if any, Mr. Vafadari and his wife face have not been disclosed. The couple have been described by friends, including foreign diplomats, as prominent in Iran’s artistic and cultural communities. Mr. Shahini was sentenced in October to 18 years in prison on charges similar to those in the case of the Namazi father and son, and is believed to be on a hunger strike. Iran also is holding Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen and internet freedom advocate with permanent United States residency status. He was arrested in 2015 and sentenced in September to 10 years in prison for spying. He also is believed to be on a hunger strike. Mr. Vafadari’s sister, Kateh Vafadari, who lives in the Washington area, said nothing of the arrests for a few months. But on Dec. 1, she wrote to Ayatollah Khamenei, imploring him to intervene, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New   advocacy group. The center quoted the letter as saying Mr. Vafadari and his wife had been subjected to “extortion, property seizure and national security threats. ” Babak Namazi, who called on Mr. Trump to help his family in an   column published last Friday by The Washington Post, also visited the capital last week, meeting with representatives of the National Security Council and State Department. He said afterward, “I think we heard the right things. ” Mr. Namazi and Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer representing the Namazis, who accompanied him, declined to specify what assurances, if any, they had received, or identify whom they had met. But Mr. Genser said a senior National Security Council official had “indicated that the Trump administration was rapidly developing a broader Iran policy, of which the hostages would be a key part. ” National Security Council and State Department officials declined to comment on the meetings but reiterated that Americans held unjustly abroad must be released. Part of the challenge is that in Iran’s view, any American of Iranian descent it incarcerates is an Iranian citizen, not entitled to consular privileges given to foreigners. During the Obama administration, extensive diplomatic contacts were established with Iran, most notably between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. That relationship was important in the 2016 release of the five Americans  —   four of them of Iranian descent. The Trump administration, by contrast, is not known to be cultivating such relations. Mr. Kerry’s successor, Rex W. Tillerson, is still preoccupied with filling key posts. The continued inclusion of Iran among the six predominantly Muslim nations in Mr. Trump’s revised visa ban has only aggravated matters, according to   advocates. Iran, which has described the ban as insulting, has retaliated by prohibiting most American visitors. “The problem is that no one has a clue about Trump administration policy,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran. With the American prisoners in Iran, he said, “there is limbo, really. ”",0
18092,Jerry Brown’s New Budget Includes Millions to Defend Illegal Aliens from Deportation - Breitbart,"Last week, California Governor Jerry Brown unveiled his May revisions to the state budget proposal he rolled out in January. Buried deep among billions of dollars in proposed new spending are millions of dollars for the state to provide criminal defense for illegal immigrants in California who are facing deportation to their home country by our own federal government. [Apparently the governor is proposing to put taxpayer money where his mouth is, following up on his bold statement last January in his State of the State speech to the California legislature: “Let me be clear: We will defend everybody  —   every man, woman and child  —   who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the   of our state. ”  It is certainly controversial, to say the least, for a state government, within the United States, to start providing taxpayer dollars to fight efforts by the United States to deport people who have entered the country, or overstayed their visas, in violation of the law. To find this controversial spending proposal, just in the summary document of the budget, you have to comb through to the Department of Social Services section, and then read all of the way through to page 38, in the Health and Human Services subsection  —   where you find under “Immigration Services” an increase of $15 million to $30 million “to further expand the availability of legal services for people seeking, “  …    deportation defense  …    ”. President Donald Trump ran and was elected on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigration. Trump’s Attorney General, former Senator Jeff Sessions ( ) has been carrying out the President’s promises by focusing federal law enforcement resources on cracking down on illegal immigration. The Trump administration’s focus on this issue, conversely, has been a rallying cry for the progressive Democrats that control the levers of political power in California. Legislation authored by State Senate President pro Tem Kevin De León (  Angeles) to make California a “sanctuary state” is rapidly advancing through the legislative process. In addition, the state legislature has produced stinging   resolutions. Last week, it was announced that the California legislature extended a controversial contract for former   Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm, at $25, 000 per month, focused on taking an aggressive posture against the Trump administration. Sacramento Democrats are not the first to engage in this very aggressive funding of efforts to stymie federal immigration enforcement. Several large cities around California with Democratic mayors and city councils have already entered into this space. Last December, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the creation of the “L. A. Justice Fund” to include $5 million in taxpayer funds, saying that the city would fight for and, “  …    reach out to people who are American by every measure except the papers they hold  …    ”. (Earlier this year, the Los Angeles City Council also unanimously passed a resolution calling on the President to be impeached.) In February, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee allowed the city’s Public Defender’s Office to use more than $200, 000 in savings from the city’s budget to hire additional staff attorneys for the defense of illegal immigrants facing deportation. Most recently, earlier this month, at the request of Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, the city council of California’s capital voted unanimously to make $300, 000 of city funds available to assist a network of legal, education and   groups help illegal immigrants facing deportation. In yet another example of the high priority that Governor Brown places in “taking on” the policies of the federal government and President Trump, he has also proposed increasing the budget of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to support a stream of lawsuits challenging executive orders of the President. The revision to the Attorney General’s budget includes funding for 19 attorneys and 12 other staff members. There is no doubt that Democrats in California are on the “tip of the spear” in taking on the policies and directives of the newly elected Republican president. Frankly, in and of itself, that is not so surprising. But what is controversial to say the least is the fact that tens of millions of dollars are being spent, so far, by the State of California and some of the state’s largest cities to  wage public relations and legal battles against the federal government.  —   —    Jon Fleischman is the Politics Editor for Breitbart California.

18093,Macron to Lobby for Closer EU Integration on First Day as President,"Emmanuel Macron plans to use his first full day as president of France to fly to Berlin to lobby for greater Eurozone integration. Macron wants a common budget and a joint finance minister for all 19 states to have adopted the euro. [In a gesture which will be interpreted by many as a demonstration that Macron’s priorities lie with the European Union rather than France, the new president will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the hopes of persuading her that greater European integration is in both of their countries’ interests.  “The truth is that we must collectively recognise that the euro is incomplete and cannot last without major reforms,” Macron said in a speech delivered in Berlin in January. He continued: “It has not provided Europe with full international sovereignty against the dollar on its rules. It has not provided Europe with a natural convergence between the different member states. ” Arguing that a dysfunctional euro and ongoing trade surpluses were to Germany’s benefit, Macron said that lack of trust between France and Germany was acting as a roadblock to reforms which would increase solidarity between the 19 eurozone states. “The euro is a weak deutsche mark,” Macron insisted. “The status quo is synonymous, in 10 years’ time, with the dismantling of the euro. ” Macron plans to tackle the problems with the euro, as he sees them, with major reforms at the European level. Amongst his planned reforms is the creation of a common eurozone budget managed by a joint finance minister, and the creation of a ‘two tier’ EU, with the Eurozone countries moving ahead of the other member states. If enacted, the reforms would constitute the biggest step so far toward integration of European states into one entity. Many of the new president’s proposals are still nothing more than vague outlines. But Sylvie Goulard, one of Macron’s foreign policy advisers, says Macron is deadly serious in his ambitions. A series of domestic economic reforms, including a €60 billion cut in public spending over five years, a pledge to keep the country’s deficit to under three per cent of GDP, and a cut in corporation tax from the current rate of 33. 33 per cent to 25 per cent seem to have been designed with Berlin, rather than the French people, in mind. Macron’s hope is that building economic credibility at home will help to persuade Germany to back him on the European stage. “France must carry out structural reforms: it’s good for us and will reassure our partners, and chiefly Germany,” he said in February. “If we don’t have a brave plan of structural reforms, the Germans won’t follow us. ” But he may have a more difficult time persuading the people of France to back him. Only two candidates in the first round of presidential voting  —   Macron and Republican candidate François Fillon  —   made a case for structural reforms during the election campaign. “The good news is that Macron and Fillon won 50% of the vote, but the bad news is that 50% of the French people still have no idea about what needs to be done, and that poses questions about what happens next,” French economist Charles Wyplosz said. “France has been in the slow lane for decades, losing political influence in Europe, largely because there have been these arrangements where everyone has these privileges that they have been skilled at protecting. Macron has to confront powerful forces that often by putting 2 million people on the streets have won every battle in the last decade. ” Macron will be officially sworn in as president on Sunday morning after walking up the red carpet to the Élysée Palace. Amongst his first acts as president will be naming his prime minister, being briefed on the nuclear deterrent by the outgoing Socialist leader François Hollande, and making his first speech. On Monday, he flies to Berlin to meet with Mrs. Merkel, who has welcomed his victory over Front National leader Marine Le Pen in last week’s election. Macron carries “the hopes of millions of French people and also many in Germany and across Europe,” Merkel said.",0
18094,Nuclear War Alert: US Prepares For North Korea Missile Launch - Morning News USA,"Nuclear War Alert: US Prepares For North Korea Missile Launch 
By Comment North Korea may soon launch nuclear attacks on the U.S., based on a recent evidence seen via satellite. Along with the U.S., the defense forces of South Korea and Japan are on high alert following a recent finding through satellite imagery which exposed potential preparations being carried out at a North Korean facility for a new missile launch. North Korea going rogue with nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs could soon turn into an international crisis that might come even earlier than expected, said USA Today in a report. North Korea’s advances in nuclear weapons and missile technology make defense planners “nervous and alarmed,” as said by Narushige Michishita, director of the security and international studies program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. Pyongyang carried out two nuclear weapon tests earlier this year, including dozens of missile tests, which failed to adhere to U.N. sanctions. Now, while not all missile tests were successful, the country mate significant improvements in the development of nuclear weapons as well as the tech which can help them attach the nukes to long-range missiles. Also Read: North Korea Declares War 2016- Kim Jong Un Ordered Preemptive Nuclear Strikes Against America The latest missile launch preparations have been reported to be active at North Korea’s Sohae launch facility. As reported by USA today, North Korea has roughly 20 functional nuclear weapons, and plans to build an arsenal of around 50-100 nukes within the next five years. Pyongyang also boasts of a whopping 200 to 320 medium-range Nodong ballistic missiles that are capable of reaching major cities in Japan, along with key U.S. military bases there. The long-range missiles can reach the U.S. bases in Guam and even Alaska. Meanwhile in North Korea, Pyongyang authorities have ordered citizens to donate tin foils as a support to the military for the purpose of camouflaging military facilities. Shielding the military bases with tin foils “will reflect light”, making it impossible for satellite cameras to take pictures, Pyongyang authorities told citizens. “Those households unable to donate tin foil are being asked to make cash donations,” as reported by a UPI source. Locals, however, have criticized the latest measures are pointless, citing the plight of North Korean soldiers suffering from malnutrition and other problems.

18095,AT&ampT Agrees to Buy Time Warner for $85.4 Billion - The New York Times,"In the world of media, bigger remains better. So in the wake of Comcast’s $30 billion takeover of NBCUniversal and Verizon Communications’ serial acquisitions of the Huffington Post and Yahoo, ATT has bought one of the remaining crown jewels of the entertainment industry. The telecommunications giant agreed on Saturday to buy Time Warner, the home of HBO and CNN, for about $85. 4 billion, creating a new colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions with wireless phones, broadband subscriptions and satellite TV connections. The proposed deal is likely to spur yet more consolidation among media companies, which have already looked to partners to get bigger. This year, Lionsgate struck a deal to buy the   channel Starz for $4. 4 billion. And the Redstone family, which controls both CBS and Viacom, has urged the corporate siblings, which split 10 years ago, to consider reuniting. ATT and Time Warner said both of their boards unanimously approved the deal. “When Jeff and I started talking, it became clear to us very quickly that we shared a very similar vision,” Randall L. Stephenson, ATT’s chief executive, told reporters on a conference call on Saturday, referring to Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive. “Time Warner, we believe, is the clear leader in premium content. ” Most analysts and investors have noted that Time Warner was part of one of the biggest merger follies of all time, when it sold itself to AOL at the height of the   boom. That combination  —   also pitched on the idea of uniting content and the internet  —   proved unwieldy and was later stripped apart to a few core businesses. This time, however, the rise of online outlets like Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube and the shift of younger customers from traditional media have pressured media companies to seek out consolidation partners. These media companies are anticipating drops in fees from cable service providers and declining revenue from advertisers. Getting bigger would give them more negotiating leverage with both service providers and with advertisers. Among their top priorities is finding new ways of reaching consumers. HBO, for example, offers its HBO Now service to deliver shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Westworld” to consumers who do not have cable subscriptions. Even Disney, widely seen as the strongest content company, with brands like Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, has been grappling with how to overcome challenges facing its network channels. ESPN, which long served as a growth engine, is now facing declining ratings and subscriber erosion, putting advertising sales into question. “The biggest thing that we’re trying to do now is figure out what technology’s role is in distributing the great content that we have,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said at a presentation at Boston College on Oct. 5. Comcast’s takeover of NBC has proved a model for this new world of media  . While the cable giant has occasionally been scrutinized for possible regulatory violations, NBCUniversal has generally thrived under its current ownership, with NBC enjoying a ratings comeback and Universal delivering a wide range of hit films, from blockbusters like “Jurassic World” to dramas like “Straight Outta Compton. ” Still, Time Warner’s deal with ATT is likely to face tough scrutiny from government regulators increasingly skeptical of power being consolidated among a few titans. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, indicated on Saturday that he would seek to block the merger if elected “because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. ” Over the last decade, Time Warner has spent significant time selling or spinning off AOL, many of the Time Inc. stable of publications, and Time Warner Cable, which was sold to another cable operator. The remaining businesses are HBO, one of the     channels Warner Bros. movie studios and cable channels that include CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS. Overseeing much of Time Warner’s downsizing was Mr. Bewkes, for whom Saturday’s agreement serves as validation of sorts. He faced tough questions two years ago when he turned down 21st Century Fox’s bid of $85 a share, arguing that the offer sharply undervalued his company. Now, Mr. Bewkes has found a suitor willing to offer significantly more  —   $107. 50 a share in cash and stock  —   and done so at a time when media companies are under pressure to strike their own deals. ATT’s offer represents a roughly 35 percent premium to where Time Warner’s stock was trading before news reports of the merger talks emerged. “Time Warner chairman and C. E. O. Jeff Bewkes and his senior management team can see where the entire legacy media world is headed: secular decline,” Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, wrote in a research note on Saturday. Mr. Greenfield added, “We believe Bewkes will end up being remembered as the smartest C. E. O. in sector  —   knowing when to sell and not overstaying his welcome to maximize value for shareholders. ” The announcement on Saturday also affirms the ambitious   of ATT. One of the former   Baby Bells that arose from the 1982 breakup of the original ATT, the company has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on acquisitions to reconstitute some of its parent’s empire. That has included buying DirecTV for $48. 5 billion, adding satellite TV subscriptions as an additional source of negotiating leverage with content providers, along with the satellite company’s steady stream of cash. ATT has also made other moves to acquire content. It has set up a joint venture with Peter Chernin, a prominent media executive, and the company was one of the bidders for Yahoo this year. The telecom company has also been working on its own online video service, for which Time Warner’s trove of media could prove enormously helpful. Combining with ATT is meant to accelerate those efforts, Mr. Bewkes said. “We think this is great for continued innovation in content,” he said during Saturday’s conference call. Still, ATT’s biggest rivals have not stood still. Comcast struck an agreement this spring to buy DreamWorks Animation for $3. 8 billion, adding the “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda” franchises to its media holdings. Verizon has charted a different course, focusing more on   properties and advertising technology players rather than traditional media companies. Its $4. 8 billion deal to buy Yahoo, rooted in the aging tech company’s hundreds of millions of users, follows previous takeovers of the Huffington Post and AOL. Not everyone seems persuaded by the latest flurry of  . Disney commented on the deal in a statement late Saturday, saying, “A transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny. ” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, also put out a statement cautioning approval. “I will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks, and whether it stands up to stands up to the rigorous review standards set by the Department of Justice’s antitrust division in the last few years,” he said. And in a Twitter post on Saturday, Steve Case, the former chief executive of AOL responsible for the doomed merger with Time Warner, wrote of ATT’s move, “#DejaVu. ”",0
18096,"After 8 Years of Campaigner-in-Chief Obama, NPR Accuses Trump of ’Permanent Campaign’ - Breitbart","After eight years of Barack Obama putting his office into permanent campaign mode while keeping his campaign machinery in constant operation, NPR is accusing Donald J. Trump of waging  a “permanent campaign. ”[In a February 17 article, NPR’s Ron Elving claimed that the American people are tired of presidential campaigns that last too long, but “Now, they are confronted with one that refuses to end  —   even after reaching the White House. ”  Elving’s attack on Trump came in response to the President’s often combative February 15 press conference that the NPR Washington correspondent described with a simple “Wow. ” After noting the criticism of the presser published by various news outlets, Elving then complained that Trump used “I” or “me” or “the royal we” too often during his presentation. The NPR staffer then went on to say, “The president often seemed to be responding in the manner of a candidate. ” He added, “The campaign mode continues this weekend, with the president again rallying like it’s 2016. ” Elving suggested that Trump might be being using this “permanent campaign” as a tactic to keep his policy ideas at the front of the political discussion. “Or perhaps the campaign continues because it continues,” Elving said as he wrapped up. “The president does not yet seem comfortable in his new office with all the crosswinds and complications of divided powers and shared responsibilities. ” Perhaps Elving has been in a coma since 2007, when Obama launched a campaign for president that didn’t end until he left office on January 20, 2017. Obama spent eight years being hit with charges that he never stopped campaigning, It was one of the most common criticisms of the Obama presidency. In fact, Obama kept his campaign apparatus, Organizing for America, in operation even after what he claimed would be his “last election. ” In December of 2012, for instance, The Observer remarked that OFA was still soliciting contributions months after Obama won his second term. Indeed, OFA is up and running today, aiming to undermine Donald Trump  —   and many are making note of it. Obama continues to issue tweets using the OFA Twitter account, and gives marching orders to his OFA army, even in reputed retirement. In August of 2009, former George W. Bush political advisor Karl Rove charged that Obama was continuing to use “divisive,” and “permanent campaign tactics” despite easily winning his election. The Washington Times observed the same thing. The claim was not made only by disgruntled conservatives or   news sources, either. In 2013 The New York Times wrote that Obama’s “campaign without end” was fundraising in an “unprecedented” manner. Before that, the Washington Post’s Dana Milbank commented on the issue in May of 2012, saying that Obama had “embraced the permanent campaign” and was flying all across the country leading   rallies to push his agenda. “To a greater extent than his predecessors, Obama has used the trappings of his office to promote his reelection prospects even while handling   business,” Milbank wrote. In addition, several   websites and commentators actually celebrated Obama for using campaign tactics to continue to sell his ideas. MSNBC praised Obama for “putting the permanent campaign to good use,” and The Atlantic marveled that Obama’s “permanent campaign” was using his “reelection playbook to change Washington. ” With all this, it is interesting that today NPR’s Ron Elving seems to have only just noticed that a president is perpetrating a “permanent campaign” to keep his policies on track to completion. Finally, it was rather tone deaf for Elving to criticize Donald Trump for using “I” and “me” too much, coming off the last eight years of a president famous for his narcissistic references to himself in every appearance. Despite mocking the penchant of the   press for keeping count of his   habits, The Washington Post recently published a piece noting just how often Obama talked about himself. After all, Barack Obama was the president so enthralled with himself that he gave the Queen of England the dubious gift of an iPod filled with Barack Obama speeches.

But we never said before that we supported a full separation of banks  —  ” Warren interpreted Mnuchin saying “I’m sorry, let me just stop you right there, Mr. Secretary. ” Mnuchin objected saying, “You’re not letting me finish. ” Warren shot back,  “Yeah, I’m not because I really have to understand what you’ve just said. There are aspects of   that you support, but not breaking up the banks and separating commercial banking from investment banking? What do you think   was if that’s not right at the heart of it?” As Mnuchin tried to explain, Warren said, “So you’re in favor of   which breaks apart the two arms of banking, regular banking, and commercial banking, except you don’t want to break apart the two parts of banking. This is like something straight out of George Orwell. ” Warren continued the grilling, saying, “This is just bizarre. The idea that you can say we are in favor of   but not breaking up the banks. ” Mnuchin said, “We never said we were in favor of  . We said we were in favor of a    . It couldn’t be clearer. ” She ended by saying, “We are in favor of a bill that is called breaking up the banks only don’t break up the banks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is crazy. ” (  Grabien) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
18098,"Ahmed Kathrada, Anti-Apartheid Activist in South Africa, Dies at 87 - The New York Times","Ahmed Kathrada, who spent 26 years in prison, many of them alongside his close friend Nelson Mandela, for resisting the apartheid system of white minority rule in South Africa, died on Tuesday in Johannesburg. He was 87. The death was announced by Mr. Kathrada’s foundation. He had been hospitalized this month with a blood clot in his brain. President Jacob Zuma ordered flags to be displayed at   and said that Mr. Kathrada would receive a “special official funeral. ” Mr. Zuma’s office called Mr. Kathrada a “stalwart of the liberation struggle for a free and democratic South Africa. ” Born to an Indian Muslim family, Mr. Kathrada was the most prominent Asian South African in the movement to end apartheid, the system of racial segregation and white domination. Active in leftist politics since his teenage years, he came to prominence in July 1963, when he was arrested with other   activists in Rivonia, a northern suburb of Johannesburg, where the South African Communist Party and the armed wing of the outlawed African National Congress had purchased an isolated farm to use as a meeting place. Among the others arrested was Walter Sisulu, secretary general of the A. N. C. That October, Mr. Kathrada was indicted on charges of trying to overthrow the government, start a guerrilla war and open the door to invasion by foreign powers. Mr. Sisulu was also indicted, as was Mr. Mandela, who had been in prison since 1962, but who faced new charges after the authorities found documents at the Rivonia farm linking him to the A. N. C. ’s armed wing. The Rivonia trial, which began in April 1964, became a signature moment in the struggle against apartheid. A high point came when Mr. Mandela, in a   speech, told the judge that he was “prepared to die” for “the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. ” Eight defendants  —   including Mr. Mandela, Mr. Sisulu and Mr. Kathrada  —   were convicted on June 11, 1964, of plotting a “violent revolution. ” They were sentenced to life in prison, at hard labor. Mr. Kathrada spent 26 years and 3 months behind bars, 18 of them on Robben Island, the apartheid regime’s most notorious prison. Confinement was something of an education: he and his fellow prisoners deepened their conviction that only continued pressure, at home and abroad, would help bring about an end to apartheid. “It really confirmed our belief that the South African authorities do not suddenly undergo a change of heart,” Mr. Kathrada said in 1989. He and his compatriots had suspected that they would be arrested, he said, and had prepared psychologically. They understood, he said, that the isolation of Robben Island  —   in cold,   Atlantic waters off Cape Town  —   was intended to break them. “From the security police to the prison authorities, they tried to instill into our minds that we would be forgotten in a few years’ time,” Mr. Kathrada said. “They did everything to crush our morale. ” For the first six months, he said, the prisoners were put to work breaking stones with hammers. Then they were sent to work in the prison’s lime quarry for more than a decade. At one point, he said, Mr. Mandela and Mr. Sisulu were put on a meager ration of rice gruel as punishment for supposedly not working hard enough. Mr. Kathrada said that on arriving at the prison he and the   convicts were issued long trousers, while black convicts like Mr. Mandela and Mr. Sisulu had to wear shorts without socks. Even sugar, coffee, soup and other foods were apportioned to inmates according to lines of racial hierarchy.   convicts were also spared the brutality that was inflicted on less prominent prisoners, Mr. Kathrada said, though they were hardly exempt from mistreatment. He recalled one night when the guards, “many of them very drunk,” awakened the convicts, stripped them and forced them against a wall for a rough search. One inmate, Govan Mbeki, nearly suffered a heart attack, he said. (Mr. Mbeki was released in 1987.) The guards’ attempt to humiliate them only stiffened their defiance, Mr. Kathrada said. “Because we were so close to the oppressor, it helped to keep us united,” he said. They went on hunger strikes to force concessions. They tried to keep up with events outside by talking to new prisoners, reading smuggled letters and “begging, stealing and bribing” to procure information. “Political prisoners give top priority to keeping themselves informed,” Mr. Kathrada said, but they sometimes went without news for several months. They communicated sporadically with the A. N. C. through messages passed among other inmates. “In prison, the best comes out and the worst comes out as well, because of the deprivation and suffering,” he said. In 1982, Mr. Kathrada, Mr. Mandela, Mr. Sisulu and two fellow activists were transferred to Pollsmoor Prison, in the Cape Town suburb of Tokai. While in prison, Mr. Kathrada obtained four university degrees, two in history and two in African politics. He was 60 when he was freed, in October 1989. On his release, he left no doubt that his dedication to the African National Congress had not waned. “We will carry out whatever the A. N. C. wants us to do,” he said at the time. Mr. Kathrada later became a member of Parliament. He wrote several books. He gave tours of Robben Island, to Margaret Thatcher, Fidel Castro, Jane Fonda, Beyoncé and, twice, to Barack Obama  —   in 2006, when he was a senator and again in 2013, during Mr. Obama’s presidency. Though Mr. Kathrada remained loyal to the A. N. C.  —   he served on the party’s National Executive Committee and ran its public relations department  —   in recent years he criticized the   Mr. Zuma, who has been in office since 2009. Last April, Mr. Kathrada called on Mr. Zuma to resign, after the country’s highest court found that the South African president had violated his oath of office by refusing to pay back public money spent on renovations to his rural home. Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada was born on Aug. 21, 1929, in   a small town in northern South Africa, the son of Muslim emigrants from Gujarat in western India. He was introduced to politics when, as a child, he joined a club run by the Youth Communist League. At 17 he took part in what was called a “passive resistance campaign” organized by the South African Indian Congress, and was one of 2, 000 people arrested on the charge of defying a law that discriminated against Indians. Shortly afterward, he quit school. Selected to visit East Berlin in 1951 for a youth festival, he toured Auschwitz, the former Nazi concentration camp in Poland, before returning to South Africa. In the 1950s he was arrested several times and monitored by the authorities for his political activities. Mr. Kathrada, who once said that his being denied the ability to have children was “the greatest deprivation” he endured in prison, is survived by his longtime partner, Barbara Hogan, a white   activist who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1982 for treason. She became a government minister after the fall of apartheid in the early 1990s. In a 2013 interview, Mr. Kathrada said that he and his fellow prisoners had had it better than those on the outside. “No policeman could come to Robben Island and start shooting at us,” he said. “In the Soweto uprising of 1976, we are told, 600 kids were killed. Others, people we knew closely, tortured to death, shot, assassinated. We were safe. ”",0
18099,"UCSD Students: Dalai Lama Violates ’Respect, Tolerance, Equality’","Students at the University of California, San Diego are protesting an upcoming speech by the Dalai Lama on the grounds that he is an “oppressive figure threatening to divide a unified China. ”[According to a report from Quartz Magazine, an offshoot of The Atlantic, students at the University of California, San Diego are concerned about an upcoming visit from the Dalai Lama, who they consider to be a threat to the Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China.  The announcement triggered outrage among Chinese students who view the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader as an oppressive figure threatening to divide a unified China. A group of them now plans to meet with the university chancellor to discuss the content of the upcoming speech. The awkwardness doesn’t end there. As the aggrieved students have trumpeted their opposition, their rhetoric has borrowed elements from larger campus activist movements across the United States. The upshot: What Westerners might perceive as Communist Party orthodoxy is mingling weirdly with academia’s commitment to diversity, political correctness, and other championed ideals. Shortly after UCSD announced the Dalai Lama’s visit, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) issued a lengthy statement expressing their concern. UCSD is a place for students to cultivate their minds and enrich their knowledge. Currently, the various actions undertaken by the university have contravened the spirit of respect, tolerance, equality, and earnestness —  the ethos upon which the university is built. These actions have also dampened the academic enthusiasm of Chinese students and scholars. If the university insists on acting unilaterally and inviting the Dalai Lama to give a speech at the graduation ceremony, our association vows to take further measures to firmly resist the university’s unreasonable behavior. Specific details of these measures will be outlined in our future statements. “What Westerners might perceive as Communist Party orthodoxy is mingling weirdly with academia’s commitment to diversity, political correctness, and other championed ideals,” Quartz notes.

18100,Будущее внутренней политики РК | Новое восточное обозрение,"Кроме скандала с конфиданткой президента, в политической жизни РК случаются и иные события. Во-первых, президент Республики Корея Пак Кын Хе предложила внести поправки в Конституцию страны, предусматривающие возможность избрания на пост главы государства на второй срок. Выступая в Национальном собрании, она отметила, что сделает эту реформу основной своей задачей на оставшееся время правления. Сейчас срок президентства ограничен 5 годами без права переизбрания, и этот момент многие критикуют. Хотя «один пятилетний срок» был установлен в 1987 году, до демократизации страны, как «прививка от тирании», сегодня это существенно подрезает способность президента к крупномасштабным реформам, проведение которых требует значительного времени. Как показывает исторический опыт, после вступления во власть, президент РК обычно тратит первые год-полтора на то, чтобы расставить своих людей на ключевые посты и обеспечить себе опору в аппарате, а последний год он находится в роли «хромой утки», ибо логика фракционной борьбы в Корее заставляет каждого нового президента игнорировать бόльшую часть достижений своего предшественника. Между тем, долговременная программа реформ требует несменяемого руководства и неизменного политического курса, и нет ничего хуже реформы, которую начали, но не довели до конца, поскольку старая структура разрушена, а новая еще не построена. Наконец, ограниченный срок пребывания у власти стимулирует окружение президента «хватать, пока можно» и не заботиться о будущем, так как все порожденные ими проблемы будут решать уже не они. Это не уничтожает, а усиливает коррупцию и безответственность. Именно это Пак и подчеркнула — из-за смены политического курса каждые пять лет страна не может устойчиво развиваться. Это тормозит решение ядерной проблемы КНДР и развитие экономики. Однако оппозиция заявила, что Пак таким образом пытается отвести внимание общественности от коррупционного скандала вокруг ее ключевых соратников, тем более что зондировать почву на тему внесения поправок в Конституцию пытался и Но Му Хен, когда находился в аналогичном кризисе последнего года. Отвлечение внимания и разговоры о втором сроке при том, что пойдет на него не выдвигающий инициативу, а его преемник, — типичный прием корейской политической борьбы. Правда, 28 октября агентство Gallup Korea опубликовало результаты опроса на тему изменений в президентской системе правления, проведённого 23-27 октября среди 1033 совершеннолетних граждан страны. За внесение поправок в Конституцию в связи с недостатками нынешней президентской системы правления высказались 54% респондентов. 33% высказались против, считая, что проблема не в системе, а в методе ее реализации. 14% респондентов воздержались. С момента начала проведения опросов на данную тему количество согласных с внесением поправок в конституцию впервые превысило 50%. Во-вторых, продолжается кризис в главной оппозиционной Демократической партии. Ее покинул влиятельный политик Сон Хак Кю, за ним стали уходить и другие известные фигуры. Экс-премьер и видный деятель левого движения, он два года колебался, но затем решил покинуть партию и самостоятельно пойти кандидатом в президенты. Вместе с ним ушли такие его сторонники, как Ли Чхан Ель, Ким Бён Ук и Пак Чхан Дэ. На этом фоне практически ушла в тень тема, которая могла превратиться в скандал, сравнимый с историей Чхве Сун Силь. Она была связана с отрывком из недавно опубликованных мемуаров бывшего министра иностранных дел и внешней торговли Сон Мин Суна, в котором рассказывается, как в 2007 году правительство Но Му Хёна воздержалось от голосования за резолюцию ООН по правам человека в Северной Корее, согласовав данное решение с Пхеньяном. В мемуарах говорится, что предложение о консультациях с Севером поступило от Ким Ман Бока, который занимал пост главы Национальной службы разведки, после чего глава администрации президента Мун Чжэ Ин пообещал тогда выяснить позицию Пхеньяна через межкорейский канал. В итоге Республика Корея от голосования воздержалась. Тут надо отметить, что обвинение в капитулянтской политике по отношению к КНДР весьма убийственно, тем более что данный вопрос напрямую касается самого влиятельного кандидата в президенты от оппозиции Мун Чжэ Ина, который тогда занимал пост главы администрации президента. Для установления истины правящая партия Сэнури даже создала специальную группу, а потом и вовсе перевела данный вопрос в задачи своего комитета. Лидер партийной фракции Чон Чжин Сок представил 10 сомнительных моментов из опубликованной книги и потребовал от Мун Чжэ Ина дать объяснения. В оппозиционной партии Тобуро уверены, что подобные обвинения — не что иное, как типичная попытка нападения на ведущего оппозиционера. Сам Мун Чжэ Ин данные действия также подверг критике, хотя правдивость мемуаров никак не подтвердил. Нечто похожее уже происходило в южнокорейской политике перед президентскими выборами в 2012 году, когда разгорелись споры по поводу северной разграничительной линии и заявления о её аннулировании, якобы сделанного президентом Но Му Хёном. Скорее всего, как и в прошлый раз, вопрос утонет в спорах о том, действительно ли правительство Но Му Хёна запрашивало мнение Севера или приняло решение самостоятельно. Тем не менее Демократическая партия частично переименовалась – если ранее на английском они записывались как Minjoo Party of Korea (Minjoo на корейском значит «демократия»), то теперь их следует писать как Democratic Party of Korea. Как правило, это делается или при очередном слиянии-размежевании, или когда надо «очистить карму» и показать, что мы несколько не те, что прежде, сбросив ошибки прошлого. Неслучайно эксперты уже гадают, как скоро такое же переименование претерпит Сэнури. В-третьих, премьер Ким Бен Чжун, которого назначила Пак Кын Хе, не собирается добровольно отказываться от предложенной ему должности. Как сказал сам Ким Бён Чжун, несмотря на требования оппозиции к главе государства отменить данное назначение, он даже не рассматривает возможность отказа. Глава государства провела кадровые перестановки в ответ на требования Национального собрания сформировать нейтральное правительство с участием представителей всех политических сил и передать часть полномочий президента главе правительства, а что она назначила не того представителя левых, которого ей предлагали, уже неважно. Правда, для вступления в должность премьер-министра Ким Бён Чжуну необходимо получить одобрение большинства депутатов, а оппозиция угрожает бойкотом слушаний. В-четвертых, несмотря на требование руководства вернуться на работу, южнокорейские железнодорожники бастуют уже больше месяца — это самый продолжительный срок для подобных выступлений профсоюзов. По состоянию на 28 октября, согласно данным корпорации «Корейские железные дороги», расписание движения в пригородах соблюдается на 100%, а в столичном регионе на 88,4%. Это связано с тем, что забастовщики не бьют по интересам рядовых граждан, зато график движения грузовых поездов выполняется только на 45%. На данный момент в забастовке принимают участие 7,753 человека, а общий уровень участия членов профсоюзов в протесте составил 39,9%. В общем, преувеличивать масштабы политического кризиса не стоит, предвыборное обострение политической борьбы проходит в обычном для РК шумном режиме.

18101,Will Hillary Accept Defeat?,"Print 
The headlines are in. Trump is the “anti-Democratic” candidate because he refuses to rule out challenging the results of an election that has yet to take place. Such a course of action is “beyond the pale.” It’s a threat to democracy. And it is utterly and thoroughly unacceptable. 
Except when Democrats do it. 
It was the day after the election. While the Democratic Party faithful waited in the rain in Nashville, William Daley strode out and announced, “Our campaign continues.” Al Gore had called George W. Bush to withdraw his concession. “Are you saying what I think you’re saying?"" a baffled Bush asked. “You don’t have to be snippy about it,"" Gore retorted snippily. 
Gore did eventually concede. Though years later he would attempt to retract his concession a second time. But his political movement never did concede. It remained a widespread belief in left-wing circles that President Bush was illegitimately elected and that President Gore was the real winner. 
How mainstream is that belief? 
When Hillary dragged Gore away from playing with his Earth globe to campaign for her, the crowd booed at his mention of the election and then chanted, “You won, you won.” 
Hillary grinned and nodded. 
Hillary Clinton has always believed that President Bush illegitimately took office. She has told Democrats that Bush was “selected” rather than “elected”. In Nigeria, of all places, she implied that Jeb Bush had rigged the election for his brother. 
But it’s not unprecedented, beyond the pale or utterly unacceptable when Democrats do it. 
It’s just business as usual. 
The media’s focus has been on whether Trump would accept the results if he loses. Yet a better question might be whether Hillary Clinton would accept her defeat. 
Even when it came to the battle for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton refused to concede defeat until the bitter end and then past it. Not only did Hillary refuse to drop out even when Obama was the clear winner, while her people threatened a convention floor fight, but she insisted on staying on in the race for increasingly bizarre and even downright disturbing reasons. 
In South Dakota, Hillary explained that there was no reason for her to drop out because somebody might shoot Barack Obama, ""We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California."" 
There’s something disturbing in the revelation that Hillary was basing her decision to stay in the race in the hope that her rival would be assassinated. 
Obama’s spokesman said that her remark “has no place in this campaign”. But it had a place inside Hillary Clinton’s very warped brain which preferred to see Obama die than concede the election to him. 
If that’s how Hillary felt about a fellow Democrat, imagine how she feels about Trump. 
Even after Obama had clinched the delegate votes, Hillary’s speech brought back the Gore argument insisting that, “Nearly 18 million of you cast your votes for our campaign, carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history. Even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over, you kept on voting.” 
Then the fabulously wealthy Hillary asked those 18 million people to go to her website and give her money while refusing to make any decision on ending her campaign. It took her another day to do that. 
It’s not as if the Obama side was any better. It was arguably worse. Governor Wilder, an Obama ally, threatened a return of the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention riots if Hillary won. ""If you think 1968 was bad, you watch; in 2008, it will be worse,” Wilder warned. 
Unprecedented. Outrageous. Beyond the pale. Except this is how Democrats act even to each other. 
Now how would they respond to a Trump victory? Would they urge Hillary to concede or to fight on? Would they stage more riots while claiming voter disenfranchisement had stolen the election? 
Hillary Clinton has made it clear that she views Trump’s candidacy as illegitimate. She has called him “unfit” and described his supporters as “deplorables.” Democrats, all the way up to the White House, are constantly accusing Republicans of scheming to disenfranchise voters. These “schemes” involve asking undocumented Democrats to show some ID instead of relying on an honor system and removing illegitimate voters from the rolls. But beyond enabling voter fraud, such arguments can easily be employed to attack the legitimacy of a Republican winner. They provide the fodder for another Florida. 
Does anyone really believe that Hillary Clinton, who couldn’t even graciously concede to Obama will graciously concede to Trump? 
And, given the fact that Hillary won the nomination by using the DNC to rig the process, leading to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz , are Trump’s concerns of a rigged election illegitimate? 
Donald Trump has clarified that he would accept “a clear election result” but that he was “being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.” 
And he’s right. No one preemptively cedes elections. And Hillary Clinton has faced accusations of abusive and fraudulent tactics from Democratic rivals in two different presidential elections. 
Why should Republicans assume that she’ll treat them better than she treated Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders? 
Not all that long ago, the left wanted Gore to fight to the bitter end. A Gore adviser recalled, ""People were calling us from everywhere, telling us, 'Don't concede.'"" Left-wing voices urged Bernie Sanders to stay in the race long after it became obvious that the left-winger had no realistic path to victory left. 
But the same behavior that is virtuous when Democrats do it becomes an unpardonable sin when Republicans take it up. 
That’s a pernicious double standard that cannot and should not be allowed to stand. 
When Democrats warn of voter disenfranchisement, the media backs them up. When Republicans complain about voter fraud, they are accused of voter suppression. When Democrats fight elections past the point that they’re lost, then they are courageous. But when Republicans do it, they are a threat to democracy. 
But democracy does not mean Democratic Party rule. That’s just the mistake that the media makes. 
Whatever rules we have, run both ways. Any practices, new or old, also apply to both sides. If challenging election results is legitimate, then it is so for both sides. Whatever options were available to Gore and Hillary cannot help but be available to Trump. 
That is how democracy, rather than Democratic Party rule, works.

18102,President-elect Trump to Become Honorary Scoutmaster,"Monday, 14 November 2016 New addition to Boy Scout camping equipment 
Special to TPN - Boy Scouts of America president Randall Stephenson announced that President-elect Donald Trump will become an honorary scoutmaster at the organization's National Jamboree to be held in July 2017. ""Mr. Trump exemplifies all those characteristics we hold dear in scouting,"" said Stephenson. ""These include being courteous and kind, among others. Without these qualities, his Republican comrades never would have flocked to him in his hour of need."" 
Stephenson also said that in recognition of the President-elect's expertise in two fields of endeavor that all scouts aspire to, Gambling and Misogyny will be added to the long list of merit badges scouts can earn. ""Both badges need little in the way of equipment, and we urge all dads to take their sons to a Trump casino to sharpen their skills. By contrast, Misogyny can be practiced at home on their mothers and sisters. Dad can help here as well."" 
To accommodate Trump while at the jamboree, a huge Winnebago motorhome is being outfitted with a hair salon and mirrored paneling. It will be designated RV-1, which will be embossed on the sides in gold lettering. Trump is also being fitted for a scoutmaster uniform with five gold stars stitched onto both shoulder epaulettes. His official title will Master of the Masturbators. 
In other news, Bernie Sanders was rumored to have joined an ISIS cell in New Hampshire.

18103,The Magnificent 10: Restaurants That Changed How We Eat - The New York Times,"Paul Freedman was having lunch at Delmonico’s  —   not the original, which opened in the early 19th century, but a relic of it in the financial district. Lobster Newburg was still on the menu, the meat napped with a   butter. “But the sauce used to have much, much more brandy in it,” Mr. Freedman said. “The style now is less severe. ” Whatever the brandy content, this plush dish and its environs hardly seemed the stuff of revolution. But to hear Mr. Freedman tell it, Delmonico’s fired the first real shot for American dining, giving rise to a huge, diverse industry that would thrive and adapt to every major shift in the nation’s identity. In his navy suit and   glasses, Mr. Freedman, a professor of medieval history at Yale University, doesn’t look the part of a provocateur, either. But for his new book, “Ten Restaurants That Changed America” (Liveright) he set out on a brash mission: culling through hundreds of thousands of restaurants, across a span of two centuries, to produce a list of what he believes were the 10 most influential. The list is brief, but Mr. Freedman marshals deep research to map the changes each restaurant made to American culture. Howard Johnson’s, the   chain that still evokes nostalgia for the comforting sameness of its fried clams, was designed to be immediately recognizable from a moving vehicle: a wholesome,   restaurant for the growing,   middle class. Until it became a fixture in the 1930s and ’40s, Mr. Freedman writes, roadside dining options were mostly limited to truck stops that catered to men (salesmen and truckers) popping in on their own. Though Howard Johnson’s wasn’t able to keep up with chains that followed in its footsteps, like McDonald’s and Burger King, this was the restaurant that pioneered franchising as an expansion plan, strategically opening along highways and ushering in the era of big fast food. “Uniformity in everything, not just food, was enforced by a manual,” Mr. Freedman writes, “a ‘Bible’ of rules and procedures covering kitchen equipment, décor, maintenance, uniforms and cleaning. ” Chinese restaurants had been in business here since the   century, after the California Gold Rush, but Mr. Freedman zooms in on the Mandarin, which opened in San Francisco in 1961. At a time when most Chinese restaurants were identified with a single dish, chop suey, the Mandarin showed off the cuisine’s nuance. Its owner, Cecilia Chiang, focused on Northern Chinese home cooking, creating a highly successful restaurant that doubled as a bid to broaden Americans’ understanding of Chinese people and culture. Mr. Freedman devotes a chapter to Sylvia’s, the restaurant that Sylvia Woods opened in 1962 in Harlem. Ms. Woods, who was born in South Carolina, was one of many black Americans who moved north in the early 20th century, and she built her business on the traditional Southern cooking she had known as a child. Although in later years, Sylvia’s would become   a shorthand for the very meaning of soul food, for decades it was a prime example of how a neighborhood restaurant could thrive as a social center. Mr. Freedman writes, “It developed a group of regulars, whom Sylvia Woods and her family called by their occupations: ‘  man,’ or ‘  man. ’” At Delmonico’s, a jacketed waiter appeared (“Excuse me? ”) and asked to know if Mr. Freedman would care for some freshly ground black pepper for his pasta with   sauce and peas. Mr. Freedman’s book begins here. When Delmonico’s opened, as a pastry shop in 1827, the restaurant scene in New York was wobbly at best. A hustle of street stalls specialized in cheap, fast oyster preparations. Rowdy taverns served a limited number of simple dishes to people at common tables. That was about it. Americans ate at home, and rich New Yorkers ate and entertained at home. But within a few years, the ambitious Delmonico brothers, from Switzerland, had expanded their pastry shop into a serious French restaurant that modeled itself on   fine dining. It was, as Mr. Freedman tells it, America’s first true restaurant, in that groups could make reservations and order from a deep menu. The kitchen imported black truffles from the Dordogne region of southwest France to bake in pastry, and served   crabs from the Eastern Seaboard, bluefish and turtle. The fare was a prototype: the kind of expensive, endlessly reproduced French cuisine that would rule in American cities for well over 100 years. “I asked the chef if he would recreate an old turtle dish,” said Mr. Freedman, who started the research for his book three years ago, “but he never did get back to me on that. ” Mr. Freedman, who is 67, was raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His father was a psychiatrist and the president of the American Psychiatric Association in the early 1970s (when it declared that homosexuality was not, in fact, an illness). His mother was a labor economist. The family went out to eat French food occasionally, and to Tien Tsin, a Chinese restaurant in Harlem, almost every Saturday. As a treat, Mr. Freedman’s grandmother took him to Schrafft’s, where he ate club sandwiches, chicken potpie and butterscotch sundaes. Schrafft’s, a Northeastern chain, started as a candy store, but in the 1910s transformed itself into a lunch counter and restaurant for women and the expanding middle class. In its early days, before it was considered a stodgy place for little old ladies, it was radical: a safe, affordable space for women to socialize on their own, in an era when women without male escorts were not welcome in restaurants. Schrafft’s also hired many women, not only as waitresses, but also as cooks and managers, and offered maternity leave. Half a dozen of the restaurants in Mr. Freedman’s book could be found in New York, though most are no longer around. The Four Seasons, which established the notion of sophisticated American cuisine in 1959, when French traditions still dominated, also brought in the era of seasonal fine dining. It’s hard to imagine today, but luxury dining up until then had been built on the notion of consistency throughout the year, and on shipping    ingredients, regardless of their quality. A menu that did not change was considered a luxurious menu. Mr. Freedman made it to the Four Seasons before it left its space in the landmark Seagram Building in July, after an impasse with the landlord. (It plans to reopen a few blocks away.) But he missed the chance to experience other restaurants on his list, like Le Pavillon, the Midtown restaurant where Henri Soulé influenced an entire generation of French chefs. Mr. Freedman snubbed one of his choices on principle. “Everyone who lived in New York knew that Mamma Leone’s was a tourist trap,” he said. It was also, as he explains in the chapter devoted to it, much more than that. A giant moneymaking machine, Mamma Leone’s helped bring Italian cuisine and culture into the American mainstream, he writes. Founded by Luisa Leone in 1906, it provided a model for the success of an   restaurant on its own terms, expanding its clientele well beyond   diners. Mr. Freedman rounds out his Top 10 with two restaurants that endure: Antoine’s, which opened in 1840 in New Orleans, “the American city with the strongest roots and the longest run of culinary traditions,” and Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif. where in 1971 the chef Alice Waters championed the brand of new American cooking  —   local and seasonal  —   that reigns in restaurants today. Though Mr. Freedman is a medievalist and does not consider himself a food writer, food culture was also the engine of his 2008 book, “Out of the East: Spices and the Medieval Imagination,” in which he debunked the myth that European cooks in the Middle Ages used spices to preserve meat. He lives in Pelham, N. Y. with his wife, Bonnie J. Roe, a lawyer, but often travels to Queens to eat noodles and dumplings at the excellent Taiwanese, Indonesian and Sichuan restaurants in Flushing and Elmhurst. In New Haven, Mr. Freedman’s pizza loyalty lies with Zuppardi’s Apizza and its clam pies, for which the clams are shucked to order. “It takes a little longer, but it’s worth it,” he said. Of the young, ambitious restaurants on the scene now, Mr. Freedman thinks a few may just be in the same league as his 10: Benu, in San Francisco, with its distinctly modern American aesthetic, comes up. So does Husk, in Charleston, S. C. and its ethos that goes far beyond    into reviving historical ingredients. The burger chain Shake Shack, Mr. Freedman notes, could be another contender, with its capacity for   and   reproduction. For dessert at Delmonico’s, Mr. Freedman ordered a baked alaska. It wasn’t just dessert, but a carefully preserved artifact from one of Charles Ranhofer’s old menus: banana ice cream sandwiched in walnut cake, sticky with apricot jam, swaddled in a thick layer of spiky torched meringue. One of the more remarkable things about Mr. Freedman’s book is the way it shows how culinary history repeats itself. By 1867, when Mr. Ranhofer served this dessert, Delmonico’s was buying produce at local markets. “But for many years before that,” Mr. Freedman pointed out, “the restaurant relied on its own farm in Williamsburg. ” Yes, even America’s first restaurant cycled through the Brooklyn    thing. Here are the 10 restaurants that made Mr. Freedman’s list. What would you add to it and why? Tell us in the comments.",0
18104,Jordan Troops Kill Three US Military Trainers at Air Base,"Jordan Claims US Vehicle 'Failed to Stop' at Gate by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This 
Three US soldiers assigned to a training operation in Jordan were killed today by Jordanian troops at the al-Jafr Air Base, when base security opened fire on them near the gate. One Jordanian soldier was also reported wounded in the incident. 
Unlike other recent incidents of US soldiers killed by allies, this incident was not chalked up to infiltration by rogue elements. Rather, Jordanian officials blamed the US soldiers, claiming their vehicle failed to stop at the gate to the air base and security reacted. 
The Pentagon was a little less cut and dry on the matter, saying they can’t say for sure if it was a “deliberate” attempt to kill US soldiers or some sort of misunderstanding. They say they are working with the Jordanian government to gather more details. 
US trainers in Jordan are there to train Syrian rebels, an operation which has been ongoing for years. Last year in November, two US contractors were killed in another incident in which a police officer opened fire on them. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
18105,Houston Gunman With Nazi Emblem Injures 9 Before Being Killed by Police - The New York Times,"A lawyer wearing a military uniform with a Nazi emblem and armed with two guns and nearly 2, 600 rounds of ammunition opened fire on random   in Houston early Monday, injuring nine before he was killed by the police, the authorities said. Six of the victims were taken to hospitals, one in critical condition and another in serious condition, the police said. Three others were treated at the scene. At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Capt. Dwayne W. Ready of the Houston Police Department described a tense episode that began about 6:30 a. m. local time. The first reports of gunfire began to trickle in when children were being driven to school, workers were setting off for their jobs and it was still dark on Law Street, where the shooting took place. The street is part of West University Place, an upscale area in southwest Houston. Police officers from several departments converged on the neighborhood, engaging the gunman while trying to protect people in the neighborhood and keep others away. The suspect exchanged gunfire with officers from about 25 yards, Captain Ready said, and was forced to take cover behind a tree close to his parked car. One officer went to the aid of a person who had been shot in a vehicle while other officers provided cover. “One of the more complex issues was tending to both the injured citizens who were still in the line of fire while engaging the suspect,” Captain Ready said. The police would not identify the suspect at the afternoon news conference or speculate on his motive. But earlier in the day, the department’s interim chief, Martha Montalvo, “He is a lawyer, and there were issues concerning his law firm. ” The authorities believe the suspect acted alone, and at the news conference, Mark Webster, an assistant special agent in charge of F. B. I. special operations, said they were not aware of any connection to a terrorist organization. He said the investigation was still preliminary. Captain Ready said that the gunman was wearing   apparel, and that there were “some old Nazi emblems about his personal effects” and where he lived, along with “vintage military stuff” dating to the Civil War. He would not speculate on whether it was Nazi apparel, but Chief Montalvo said later that “an old Nazi emblem” was on his uniform. The gunman also carried an “edged weapon,” something like a knife, which was in a sheath, Captain Ready said. The suspect had a .  Tommy gun and a .  semiautomatic handgun. Both were purchased legally, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said. The local TV station ABC 13 showed images of a Porsche Boxster parked on the street and being searched. Jennifer Molleda, whose husband’s car was struck while he was driving, told ABC 13, “The shooter was literally pointing the gun at windshields. ” She said her husband had spoken to her by telephone after he pulled into the parking lot of a Petco store at a strip mall nearby. “He was screaming: ‘I am shot. I am shot,’ ” she said. The mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, who was in Cuba on a trade trip, told ABC 13 by telephone that the investigation was looking into whether a relationship at the lawyer’s workplace had gone “awry. ” Witnesses told local television stations that they had heard several gunshots. “Steady shooting back and forth  —   it was a lot,” said Antoine Wilson, who told ABC 13 that he was driving in the area and heard multiple gunshots. An unidentified woman told the TV station that she had been driving to work when she heard the gunfire. Her car was struck from the front and side, she said, but she kept driving, pulling around a corner until she came to a stop. “I could still hear shots being fired on the streets,” she said, her arm bloody from broken glass. Lee Williams, who said he lives near the site of the gunfire, told ABC 13 that he was outside and tried to direct traffic away. “Once the police got here, they made me go back to my house,” he said. “I heard a lot of back and forth,” he said, adding that he had counted about 50 shots. Mr. Williams retreated to his front porch but was close enough to hear the police radios say, “He is down. ”",0

18107,Liberal CNN Commentator Blames Republicans for Obamacare’s Rising Premiums,"Washington Free Beacon October 27, 2016 
CNN commentator Angela Rye on Wednesday blamed the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare for the newly announced double-digit premium increases in the president’s signature health care law. 
“It’s not just Hillary Clinton that needs to tackle this but also Congress,” Rye said on CNN’s New Day. “The reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly, Alisyn, is because Republicans fell short of their promise to repeal, which is what they said they wanted to do, and replace.” 
Host Alisyn Camerota stopped Rye before she got any further and reminded her that President Obama had promised premiums would go down. 
Most states will see health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act increase by an average of 25 percent, according to data released this week by the Obama administration. Indiana will see its rates slightly go down, but other states like Arizona will see costs skyrocket by 116 percent. Members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the Obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans.   8:17  ",0
18108,"Re: If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office","Email 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like Hillary Clinton was all set to cruise to victory , but now the FBI has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time. A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don’t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me   was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn’t look good for Trump at the time, but now   their   emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump’s favor . 
As I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. 
And as I noted yesterday , more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. 
So we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. 
Donald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. 
And if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. 
Of course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. 
So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. 
And this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. 
These amazing “coincidences” were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. 
I just thought that this information was “interesting” and so I thought that I would share it. 
Someone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.” 
Beck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that “magic exists”, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points … 
“Let’s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,” Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . “He should win by 5 points.” 
Beck later added: “How can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can’t. Can’t.” 
The conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America” and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof “magic exists.” 
Hopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. 
She is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can’t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. 
And the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton “fixer” Cheryl Mills that they were “going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later” … 
It was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun   . 
Back in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn’t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. 
But in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. 
The Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. 
I believe that this election is America’s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. 
If the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don’t think that anyone will be able to say that we don’t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. 
The time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. 
If that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation.

18110,Liberal Tech Leaders at Risk from ’Occupy Silicon Valley’ - Breitbart,"Bank of America has warned that America’s next social justice movement will be “Occupy Silicon Valley,” which will demand a redistribution of wealth from liberal tech moguls to workers. [With large cap tech stocks that are mostly headquartered in Silicon Valley accounting for about 40 percent of all market gains from the Trump stock boom, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett suggests that the irrational bonanza “could ultimately lead to populist calls for redistribution of the increasingly concentrated wealth of Silicon Valley,” as first reported by the Value Walk blog.  B of A sees parallels to the “Occupy Wall Street” protests in 2011 that targeted the “one percent,” including big banks that were bailed and given cheap federal loans during the financial crisis of  . Occupy protestors claimed the government loans were a wealth transfer for the rich, at the expense of workers. The bipartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of Silicon Valley money on American elections and government bureaucrats, commented, “Just as water flows downhill, money in politics flows to where the power is. ”  Their research found that with the rise of Democrat Barack Obama since 2008, Silicon Valley’s annual lobbying expenditures skyrocketed by 800 percent, from $17. 8 million to $139. 5 million. Premier venture capitalist and Trump supporter Peter Thiel famously stated that Silicon Valley’s symbiotic business relationship with Washington D. C. earned it the nickname “Valley of the Democrats” in the 2012 presidential election, when 83 percent of Silicon Valley top tech firm employee donations went to Obama.   CrowdPac found the trend continued in 2016 presidential contest, with 95 percent of the $8. 1 million contributed by Silicon Valley tech employees going to Democrat Hillary Clinton. Silicon Valley captured a growing percentage of the $1. 24 trillion federal procurement budget during the Obama Administration, including half the $86. 4 billion information technology budget, and billions in secret “black”   budgets. The Democrat president’s policies also allowed the offshoring of U. S. tech jobs, and let tech companies use foreign tax havens to shelter $89 billion a year from the IRS. Thiat explains why Silicon Valley firms dominate the $2. 1 trillion in profits that American businesses now have parked offshore. Michael Hartnett suggests that liberals are beginning to understand that Silicon Valley’s globalist digital technology firms’ business model has been spectacular for a handful of CEOs and venture capitalists, but left the vast majority of Americans economically behind. Harnett calls attention to the fact that Apple, Alphabet (Google) Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook now have a market capitalization of $16. 1 trillion. That is about $1. 2 trillion greater than the entire GDP of New York City, and twice the GDP of Los Angeles. And one fact illustrates the potential that tech companies have to dominate the United States government: each one of America’s five largest tech companies now has a market capitalization that exceeds the GDP of Washington, D. C. B of A believes that the divergence between the spectacular technology   stock market gains on the one hand, versus the continued weak global economy on the other hand, will ultimately be unsustainable. Harnett’s strategy to prepare for potential economic turmoil is to sell highly appreciated technology stocks, and then buy bank stocks, European stocks, resource commodities and gold.",0
18111,Are You Prepared For The Unwinding Of The Biggest Bubble In History?,"74 Views November 21, 2016 GOLD , KWN , KWN II King World News 
With the Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday of this week, are you prepared for the unwinding of the biggest bubble in history? 
Here is a portion of what Peter Boockvar wrote today as the world awaits the next round of monetary madness: I want to start the week by saying I believe ‘secular stagnation’ is bulls**t. As a believer in free trade and comparative advantage and thus with hopes that no trade battles take place in the next 4 years, I want to reiterate my optimism over the potential liberation of the US economy via lower and more competitive tax rates and an easing of the regulatory strait jacket all around the economy. This said, before we get to that economically better place (which we no doubt will I believe) I can’t help but be on alert about what the implications are of an unwinding of the biggest bubble ever created, that of credit via the helping hands of our central bankers… IMPORTANT: To find out which high-grade silver mining company billionaire Eric Sprott just purchased a nearly 20% stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
As a reminder, back in October the IMF quantified the extent of this credit bubble by saying that global debt reached $152 Trillion in 2015 or 225% of world GDP (see attached chart), a record high. They said “about two thirds of this debt consists of liabilities of the private sector.” Thus, simply stated, this is the context that a rise in global interest rates comes in. The caveat on this debt build up though is stated by the IMF, “there is no consensus about how much is too much.” Staggering Global Debt Hits Record High Sources: Abbas and others 2010; Bank for International Settlements; Dealogic; IMF, International Financial Statistics; IMF, Standardized Reporting Forms; IMF, World Economic Outlook; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; and IMF staff estimates. Note: U.S. = United States. 
According to SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association), US bond market debt of which will be impacted by the rise in rates totaled $40.7T at the end of Q2 (a similar ratio to GDP as the world ratio). This debt consists of Treasury, municipal, mortgage related, corporate debt, federal agency securities, money markets, and asset backed. 
Higher Interest Rates To Impact Key Markets Direct to consumer, higher rates will of course influence auto’s and housing (negatively on the cost of funding a home purchase but positively for first time buyers where hopefully higher rates slows down the persistent 5%+ rate of home price gains). 
Corporate earnings will be helped by faster revenue growth in coming years from lower tax rates and reduced regulations but the lever of lowered interest expense, likely a slowdown in debt driven stock buybacks, multiple compression and the negative impact of a higher cost of capital for both businesses and individuals will be an offset. 
Bottom Line Bottom line, central banks have been suppressing the beach ball under water for nearly 10 years and that ball finally saw some air. In particular, a gradual rise in rates is the choice of the Fed stated a multitude of times but gradual is of course not what we’ve seen from the market. In a world of epic debt levels, it would be naïve not to worry about the end of the 35 year bull market in bonds irrespective of the economic positives that a Trump presidency will bring.

18112,"Syrian War Report – November 1, 2016: Syrian Military Deploys Advanced T-90 Battle Tanks to Aleppo","Syrian War Report – October 31, 2016: Al-Nusra-led Forces Failed to Break Aleppo Siege ‹ › South Front Analysis & Intelligence is a public analytical project maintained by an independent team of experts from the four corners of the Earth focusing on international relations issues and crises. They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. Syrian War Report – November 1, 2016: Syrian Military Deploys Advanced T-90 Battle Tanks to Aleppo By South Front on November 1, 2016 …from SouthFront 
The Syrian military has deployed advanced Russian-made T-90 main battle tanks to western Aleppo, according to the video released on October 31. T-90 MBTs were observed in the Minyan area where they were participating in operations against Jaish al-Fatah, a Jabhat al-Nusra-led coalition of militant groups. Last weekend, elite units of the Syrian Army’s Tiger Forces and the Desert Hawks Brigade were deployed in Aleppo to counter the militants’ offensive operation to capture the al-Assad Military Academy and the nearby areas. Both formations operate T-90 MBTs supplied by Moscow over the last year. The government forces massively use tanks, artillery, warplanes and helicopters to attrit Jaish al-Fatah’s manpower in non-populated urban areas. 
Experts note that the jihadists have also concentrated a high number of experienced troops, artillery, rocket launchers and military equipment at a restricted front in western Aleppo. To do this, they had been pushed to use almost all their resources from the rear bases in Idlib province. If Jabhat al-Nusra is not able to achieve a decided success in clashes with the government forces soon, this will lead to its total collapse as a powerbroker in the war. The group’s material and technical base will be destroyed and experienced troops and field commanders killed in the clashes. We’ve been already able to observe signs of this tendency since the failed al-Nusra attempt to dig in the Ramouseh Artillery Acandemy in southern Aleppo. 
The Kurdish YPG and the Ankara-led forces (Turkish-backed militant groups and the Turkish Armed Forces) have been competing in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo city. Both forces recently captured a bunch of villages from ISIS in the direction of Al-Bab. In this case, the ongoing coordination between the Syrian army and the YPG has once again become reality on the ground. The recent Kurdish operations were coordinated and supported by the Russian and Syrian military and military sources say that Moscow increased military supplies to the YPG in the area. Moscow and Domascus believe that the Kurdish buffer zone plays an important role, preventing Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki and other pro-Turkish groups from attacking the Syrian army and its allies in Aleppo city. In mid-October Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki officially announced that the next stage of Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield will include an advance on the ‘regime forces’ in Aleppo. 
Dozens of al-Nusra Front and linked-groups members were killed during their failed attempt to break the Syrian army’s defenses at the abandoned al-Mahjoorah Battalion military camp near the militant-controlled town of Ibtaa in the province of Daraa on October 31. According to pro-government forces over 40 militants were killed. Pro-militant media outlets confirm 26 killed in action terrorists.

18113,"Dr. Joy Browne, Long-Running Psychologist of the Airwaves, Dies at 71 - The New York Times","Dr. Joy Browne, the syndicated radio and television psychologist who dispensed advice and earnest inspiration over the air for nearly four decades, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 71 and still hosting her daily   radio program. Her death was confirmed by her brother David Oppenheim, who did not give a cause. Beginning in 1978  —   when she was suddenly thrust onto the air because a hockey game had been canceled  —   Dr. Browne reached millions of radio listeners, many of whom revealed their concerns to her in cathartic   segments or emailed her their problems, which she read and responded to over the air. “She was the   psychologist on   radio at the time of her death,” Michael Harrison, the publisher of Talkers magazine, said in an email on Wednesday. “More importantly,” he added, “she kept the presence of the radio   show alive on terrestrial   radio at a time when the genre had all but dried up in favor of mostly conservative, political programming. ” On television, versions of her program appeared on CBS, with a studio audience, and on the Discovery Health cable channel. In contrast to other   psychologists, some of whom could come across as scolds, Dr. Browne was unflaggingly buoyant as she delivered   advice and gentle goading. “I’m in the business of helping make lives better,” she once said, “not by bashing but by teaching people how to take responsibility for their behavior. ” On a recent program she asked: “If we can figure out a way to get to the moon, wipe out disease, double life expectancy, don’t you think we can be a little nicer to each other? Maybe. I know, I believe in the Easter bunny and the Tooth Fairy as well. ” With her advice came rules to live by, like these for couples: ¶If you’re married, go on dates together (to keep the romance alive). ¶If you’ve gone through a divorce or a breakup, no dating for a year (to let you experience life on your own). ¶If you’re both in love and either of you has children, get married (an unmarried state can be disruptive for younger children, who tend to become attached, and for teenagers, who are dealing with their own sexuality). The psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who became a fixture in American homes, made her television debut in the 1950s, but the roots of radio therapy are usually traced to Toni Grant, who started broadcasting on   in Los Angeles in 1975. (Dr. Grant died this year.) Dr. Browne was among those who followed in her footsteps, in her case on   (now WMEX) in Boston. “When I first started, the A. P. A. tried to take my license away,” Dr. Browne told The New York Times in 1996, referring to the American Psychological Association. In 1998, the group gave her an award under the rubric “outstanding contribution by a psychologist in the media. ” Dr. Browne found her niche in the 1970s, at a time when seeking professional help was still stigmatized and family and community support networks had weakened. Radio gave people wrestling with emotional issues the safety of anonymity. She said she was as much concerned with moral and ethical issues as she was with mental health. “It’s Problem Solving 101,” she said in 1996 (while acknowledging that some listeners might consider it “Voyeurism 102”). Indeed, Dr. Frank Farley, a former president of the psychological association and a professor at Temple University, said in a phone interview on Wednesday that   programs like Dr. Browne’s were more successful at offering practical advice on ethical issues than at providing actual therapy in public. “You can’t give therapy to people you haven’t seen,” he said. He added: “Joy Browne was certainly among the best of the media psychologists. She was very solid,   in psychology, and wasn’t going to be shooting from the lip. ” She was born Joy Oppenheim on Oct. 24, 1944, in New Orleans, the daughter of Nelson Oppenheim, a life insurance salesman, and the former Ruth Strauss, a teacher. She was raised in Pennsylvania and Denver and graduated from Rice University in Houston with a degree in behavioral science. After earning a master’s degree and a doctorate from Northeastern University in Boston, she began practicing psychology and attending Tufts University School of Medicine. That was when she was recruited by WITS. “I found something in my life I was good at and could help more people in one hour than I could in one year,” Dr. Browne told Talkers magazine last year. (She took her husband’s name when she married Carter Browne.) WITS had scheduled her to begin broadcasting in October 1978, but weeks earlier she was summoned one night without warning to fill in when a scheduled broadcast of a Bruins hockey game was abruptly canceled the ice had melted at Boston Garden. Her mission, she said, was to persuade depressed listeners that they could change only their   not those of the people who might be causing them stress. “They want to know how to kill the person who is making them feel that way and not be held responsible,” she told Talkers. “The only behavior I can help change is yours, but that isn’t what a caller wants to hear. They want me to tell them that the other person is to blame. ” She also learned, she said, that “one secret to doing a great interview is listening,” a skill she had already developed as a therapist. Certain topics were taboo, she said, including abortion, “because you will never change anyone’s mind,” and horoscopes, “because it will get phone calls  —   but no listeners. ” Partisan politics was also off limits. After another radio stint in California, Dr. Browne joined the WOR Radio Network in New York, which in the early 1990s sent her program into national syndication.

Dr. Browne was also an author. Among her titles are “The Nine Fantasies That Will Ruin Your Life” (1998) “It’s a Jungle Out There, Jane” (1999) “Getting Unstuck” (2002) “Dating Disasters” (2005) and “Dating for Dummies” (2006) which includes this   tip: “If you have fingernail marks on the palms of your hands, you’re a little too tense. ” Her marriage to Mr. Browne ended in divorce. In addition to her brother David, she is survived by a daughter, Patience three sisters, Jane Russo, Judy Hawkins and Alannah Sinclaire and another brother, Daniel Oppenheim. Embracing the    philosophy, Dr. Browne imposed one rule on herself: No chocolate during Lent. “That keeps me humble,” she said. “I’m always telling people to do things to change. This is my yearly reminder to myself that change is really hard. ”",0
