6785,Сербская газета высмеяла украинского посла-графомана,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
Как пишет журналист Боян Билбияпетак, читатели сотни раз высмеивали аргументы дипломата о ""Крыме и исторической правде"". Но Александрович готов ввести санкции. Против кого? Против всех, кто осмелился посетить ""украинский Крым"" или, не дай бог, самопровозглашенный Донбасс и не спросил у посла разрешения? 
Под удар Украины итак попали шестеро граждан Сербии , включая народных депутатов, против которых будут введены экономические санкции. Как пишет обозреватель, но и это ""Александровичу стало мало, он желает стать инквизитором, на костре которого будут гореть и сербские журналисты"". 
Так в редакцию газеты поступило сообщение Александровича, в котором он желает, чтобы ""правительство Украины открыло уголовное дело против журналиста Бояна Билбия, который побывал в Крыму в обход законов Украины"". 
Журналист издания пишет, что не понимает, чем он ""нарушил законы державы, которая годами не контролирует огромную часть своей территорию"". Однако ему совершенно ясно другое. ""Киев, через своего посла, хочет запугиваниями повлиять на свободу информации, слова и передвижения. Украинское правительство и его посол прикрываются ""европейскими ценностями"", но они должны знать, что подавление свободы СМИ и угрозы журналистам отдаляют их от стандартов европейской цивилизации"". 
Боян Билбияпетак пишет, что в демократических странах журналисты имеют право передвигаться свободно, путешествовать по миру и делать репортажи и интервью со всеми, даже если речь идет о приверженцах противоборствующих сторон, диктаторах или других темах интересных общественности. И Крым, который ""европейский Киев"" два года назад отрезал от электроэнергии и воды, является чрезвычайно интересной темой для сербской публики. 
Журналист напоминает, что читатели ""Политики"" ясно дали понять послу Украины, что они думают о его санкциях и угрозах. Билбияпетак не удивился бы, если украинское посольство задумает наказать даже правительство Сербии за то, что оно не приводит на допросы граждан, желающих посетить Крым. 
Автор считает, что посол Украины просто пускает пыль в глаза. Билбияпетак задается вопросом, почему Александрович говорит ""Косово — это Сербия, Крым — это Украина"", а Украина, в отличие от России и многих других друзей Сербии, не голосовала против принятия Косово в ЮНЕСКО? 
""Да, я, может, сам добровольно предстал бы перед судом в Киеве. Но, господин Алексанрович, вы должны лично за мной прийти"", — подытоживает Боян Билбияпетак. 
Напомним, ранее президент Сербии Томислав Николич заявил, что страна не введет санкции по отношению к России , даже если этого требует общая внешняя политика ЕС. Об этом президент республики сообщил на встрече с вице-президентом США Джозефом Байденом. 
""Мы не можем ввести санкции России, если это подразумевает приведение в согласие (сербской — ред.) внешней политики с ЕС. Мы связаны с Россией и связаны с США, в которых живет многочисленная сербская община"", — цитирует пресс-служба главу государства. 
Николич также отметил, что несмотря на то, что ""нет лучшей опции для граждан Сербии, чем путь в Евросоюз"", он не готов подписать с самопровозглашенной республикой Косово документ, который имел бы межгосударственный характер. В свою очередь, по данным пресс-службы, Байден подчеркнул, что ""США не ожидают, что Сербия сделает выбор между ними и Россией"" и поддерживают ее на пути евроинтеграции. 
  Друзья не предают: Сербия не откажется от России из-за ЕС Поделиться:",0
6786,"Climber Conquers El Capitan Without Rope, Using His Bare Hands - Breitbart","On Saturday, Alex Honnold, one of the world’s most   climbers, scaled the side of Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan in just under four hours using his bare hands and a bag of chalk on Saturday. [“So stoked to realize a life dream today,’ Honnold, 31, wrote on Facebook after he completed the steep vertical climb, which some have described in the past as a suicide mission.  Honnold, who has been climbing since he was 11, told the San Francisco Chronicle that he has dreamt about conquering El Capitan free style for eight years. “The hardest part was 2, 300 feet off the ground,” Honnold reportedly said. Others have not dared conquer El Capitan without ropes or safety backups. The feat Honnold accomplished was so bold that Alpinist magazine wrote on its Facebook page, “This is indisputably the greatest free solo of all time. Congratulations, Alex!” While likely his most dangerous, this is not Honnold’s first risky climb. According to the Chronicle, in 2008, he climbed the Moonlight Buttress in Utah’s Zion National Park, and the northwest face of Yosemite’s Half Dome, without rope. Just one moment of distraction could have cost him his life. In 2015, two men reached the peak of El Capitan after climbing the face of the granite Dawn Wall for 17 days using only safety ropes and their hands and feet. This March, a mountain climber fell   off a mountain in Colorado, but survived. He was discovered by a jogger after he was reported missing for several days.

6787,"Trump’s Promises Will Be Hard to Keep, but Coal Country Has Faith - The New York Times","WILLIAMSON, W. Va.  —   If a single moment captured coal country’s despair this year, it was when Bo Copley, a      mine maintenance planner, fought tears as he asked Hillary Clinton how, having dismissed coal’s future in language that came back to haunt her, she could “come in here and tell us you’re going to be our friend. ” That was in May. Mr. Copley, 39 and a registered Republican, was “very uncomfortable” with Donald J. Trump then, he said. But over time, in a paradox of the Bible Belt, Mr. Copley, a deeply religious father of three, put his faith in a     Manhattan real estate mogul as a savior for coal country  —   and America. “God has used unjust people to do his will,” Mr. Copley said, explaining his vote. Now coal country is reckoning with an inconvenient truth: Experts say Mr. Trump’s expansive campaign promise to “put our miners back to work” will be very difficult to keep. Yet as he prepares to move into the Oval Office, Appalachians are eyeing Washington with a feeling they have not had in years: hope. The American market for coal is shrinking, industry analysts agree. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal, in part because of President Obama’s aggressive regulations to cut emissions from power plants, but also because natural gas is cheaper. Nationally, about 300   power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Many of those plants  —   including one in nearby Louisa, Ky. where a giant cooling tower was recently demolished after the plant converted from coal to natural gas  —   are not coming back. Politicians and economists agree that what Appalachia really needs is a diversified economy, a goal that has eluded Mr. Obama and state and local politicians. But in this land of staggering beauty and economic pain, Trump backers said over and over again that while coal might never be what it once was, the businessman they helped send to the White House could indeed put them back to work  —   if not in mining, then in some other industry. “I don’t think he can ever fulfill all the promises he made even in four or eight years,” Danny Maynard, 59, said after Bible study at the Chattaroy Missionary Baptist Church. Mr. Maynard lost his job at a coal company last year. “But I think we’re headed in the right direction,” he said. “He wants to make America great again. ” Mr. Trump pummeled Mrs. Clinton in coal country. Here in West Virginia, he won every county and took 69 percent of the vote, a landslide also fueled by his promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices who would roll back abortion rights. As Mr. Copley put it, “Coal is secondary to me. ” It is difficult for outsiders to fathom how deeply faith and work are intertwined here, or the economic and psychological depression that sets in when an entire region loses the only livelihood many of its people have ever known. Coal has always been boom and bust its decline began long before Mr. Obama took office. But in West Virginia alone, 12, 000 coal industry jobs have been lost during his tenure. At the Huddle House on Route 119, Kayla Burger, 32, a waitress, has worked three jobs since her husband lost his they take home less than a quarter of the roughly $100, 000 he used to earn. She took an offer for miners’ wives to train as phlebotomists, but with so many miners out of work, the phlebotomy market was flooded. She also substitute teaches and cooks at the school. They have given up cellphones and sold their boat one car has been repossessed the only reason they still have their house, she said, is that they saw layoffs coming and saved money. Her husband, who cares for the children, has experienced depression. “He doesn’t feel like a man,” Ms. Burger said. Her father was a miner, too he and her mother drive   now. In Williamson  —   population roughly 3, 100, down from 4, 300 two decades ago  —   everyone has a story. The city used to market itself as “the heart of the   coal fields,” but it now wraps its tourism pitches around the   trails that run through the nearby mountains. (“We’re the   coal fields,” said Natalie Taylor, the executive director of the Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce.) Williamson’s downtown, on the border with eastern Kentucky, sits between the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River and the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks. At the newly opened pulmonary clinic here for patients with black lung disease, Patricia Sigmon, a respiratory therapist, has been caught in the  . With coal paying less in severance tax to the state, there is less funding for schools. Her husband, a school bus driver in nearby Boone County, was forced to take a $4, 000 cut in pay. Larry Gannon, 61, retired early from his job as a coal processing plant foreman so that a younger man could keep his. Mr. Copley’s wife, Lauren, has a photography business, which is how they make do. They used to have “Cadillac” health coverage now they have Medicaid. So when scientists, and Democrats like Al Gore, warn that Mr. Trump will endanger the planet, people hear that as something off in the future feeding your family is here and now. Many say Mother Nature will have her way. “When I was growing up, they said we were in an ice age,” said Kyle Lovern, the managing editor of The Williamson Daily News. He voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump this year. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in West Virginia, where anger at politicians has been building for years. Mr. Copley remembers the Democrats who held power here  —   men like Senator Robert C. Byrd, who died in 2010 and whose name is on buildings and roads built with the tax dollars he brought home  —   and wonders why they did not see the coal bust coming and work to diversify the economy. “We’re a forgotten people,” Ms. Taylor said, explaining why it did not take much for Mr. Trump to win coal country’s trust. “He mentions West Virginia, he mentions the coal workers, and that was pretty much all he had to do to seal this deal. ” Now that the deal has been sealed, Mr. Trump has put a climate change contrarian and friend of the coal industry in charge of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. Environmentalists are horrified, but Bill Raney, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, a trade group, is thrilled. “Just a positive attitude in the White House is enormously important,” he said. While American utilities are shunning coal, Mr. Raney says, some mines are shipping coal overseas. He sees promise in clean coal technology and says that “some plants can get back on line” if Mr. Trump dismantles Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan. But that will take time. The plan is tied up in litigation the Supreme Court was expected to hear the case next year. Mr. Copley, and many others, are waiting  —   and contemplating a divided nation. Mr. Copley is now a   here. Yahoo News declared that he had helped shape the race and invited his family to its studios in New York on election night. The family had never been to the city. Mr. Copley did not like having to explain to his children why   protesters were shouting profanities in Times Square, and he later felt put off by the cast of “Hamilton” reading a statement he deemed “rude” to Mike Pence, the vice  . At home, though, Mr. Copley sees nuance. His children’s drama teacher, Dusty Smith, 36, who has purple and blue streaks in her hair, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because he seemed “very humble” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. ” At the Thanksgiving play Ms. Smith directed, an   teenager delivered a   homage to racial harmony. Watching it, Mr. Copley worried that his black friends would think he was racist because of his vote. People have asked Mr. Copley if he will run for public office if God leads him to, he said, he will. As for Mr. Trump, he will give the   time: “He’s got four years. ”",0
6788,"Damaged by War, Syria’s Cultural Sites Rise Anew in France - The New York Times","PARIS  —   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March, Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria’s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training, Mr. Ubelmann, 36, had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects, mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra, parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous, was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad, his Syrian colleague, spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. “Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details, every crack and hole, and we can take very precise measurements,” said Mr. Ubelmann, who founded the company Iconem. “This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need. ” They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists, archaeologists and others, like Mr. Ubelmann, are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored, repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria, and also Iraq, that have suffered from war, looting and the Islamic State. “Palmyra was very difficult,” Mr. Ubelmann said. “The terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion,” he said. “We felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images. ” The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris, where, through Jan. 9, many of the 40, 000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called “Eternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra,” the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibition’s political importance, it was opened several weeks ago by President François Hollande of France, who described it as “an act of resistance” against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage, he said, “is the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate, destruction and death. ”   Martinez, the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show, said the sites had been chosen because “all are under threat from pillaging, neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public. ” He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion “in the face of the devastation of unique heritage. ” Besides images from Palmyra, the multimedia show projects enormous   photographs and videos, immersing visitors in different eras, including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an   mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president, Bashar  . “We were working pro bono, not for any government, but to help the archaeologists,” he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists, he said, adding, “We also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own. ” What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year, his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently, it moved into   zones in Iraq, close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the war’s effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3, 000 years, including Nineveh, Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud, where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015, Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign. “Nimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities,” Layla Abdulkarim, a Syrian architect, said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new, specialists say, but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice “war archaeology,” that is, collecting reliable data from   areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war, close to 150 archaeological projects were underway, just in Syria, researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syria’s old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria, the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. “People are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms, but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible,” said Pascal Butterlin, a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence, even in the case of    ruins, Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari, near Syria’s border with Iraq. Before fleeing, the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq, he said. “We need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites,” he said. “Important evidence, like clandestine pits, can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion. ” Cheikhmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist based in France, who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology, said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012, Mr. Ali said, and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts, they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed, objects carted off, safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris, which is drawing large crowds, coincides with “History Begins in Mesopotamia,” a show at the Louvre’s regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French government’s active concern about cultural damage in Syria, which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest, condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as “war crimes. ” This past month, France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates, provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the “Eternal Sites” opening at the Grand Palais, Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. “Should we be concerned about the patrimony?” he asked. “What is more important, saving lives or saving stones? In reality, these two are inseparable. ”",0

Please mention them in the comments section below! Much Love Documentaries hold a power unique to any other type of film. They have the remarkable capacity to shift our understanding of the vast and complex world in which we live, most of the time presenting us with powerfully relevant information, a previously unknown perspective, and hopefully, a new choice to make a difference. The following list of documentaries showcases films that may inspire a new outlook on the world we live in. There were so many to choose from that compiling this list proved challenging, however, each one of these films stands as prudent commentaries offering valuable insight into the wonders and workings of the world at large. Enjoy! 11) Life: The BBC Mini-Series A vast majority of people live their lives exiled from the wonders of nature and the myriad of living creatures that inhabit our incredibly diverse biosphere. Not to worry, however, as this wonder is magnificently captured in the 2009 BBC mini-series, Life. Shot in crystal clear high-definition and narrated by the world’s most beloved narrator himself, David Attenborough, the series chronicles some of the most unusual, if not downright bizarre, behaviors that living organisms h ave devised to keep their species alive. The massive project took 4 years to shoot and put together, taking brave camera crews across every continent and habitat imaginable. Get your popcorn ready and prepare for your mind to be blown. 12) The Zeitgeist Trilogy Commonly pegged as the films that ignited a global awakening, the Zeitgeist Trilogy quickly opened a public discourse into the largest “conspiracies” to brace the modern day world. Narrated by the enigmatic filmmaker and social activist, Peter Joseph, the film audaciously exposes the high-ordered corruption in all aspects of finance, religion, and politics today, inspiring the masses to open their eyes to the the inner workings of the global tyranny ruling our world. The series leaves the viewer with a whetted appetite for more, making this documentary film series a can of worms only for the brave and ready. 13) The Square By now, we have undoubtedly heard about the horrendous ongoing conflict in Egypt through the mainstream lens, but rarely have we gotten the chance to see an inside perspective from the men, women and children who are actually experiencing the carnage and chaos. The 2013 documentary, The Square, does just this. Audiences get a compelling inside look at the cascading series of revolutions and counter-revolutions that have shaken Egypt since the beginning of 2011, shattering routine bias commonly imposed by the mainstream media. We see the humanness of the Egyptian conflict like never before, a frightening reality that reminds us of the possibilities any country could experience in the face of governmental defiance. 14) I Am Known for his clever knack for ridiculous humour, filmmaker Tom Shadyac’s resume of films include blockbuster hits like The Nutty Professor, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and Bruce Almighty . But after a 2007 biking accident left him with a series of insistent headaches and a painful sensitivity to light, Tom was forced to spend a 6-month period bed-ridden, in complete darkness. Once Tom recovered, he found himself with a new perspective and a slew of burning questions about life. This prompted his journey into the realm of documentary film-making, spawning the film I Am. The film asks two central questions: “ What’s Wrong With the World?” and “ What Can We Do About it?”, picking the brains of a cast of intriguing and insightful public figures. The themes explored in I Am make important food for thought for everyone. 15) Samsara Samsara also made a previous list of life changing films we wrote about, seen here , due to its success in capturing the unfathomable reaches of humanity’s spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, visionary inspired guided meditation. From the mundane to the extraordinary, prepare for a journey around the world like nothing you’ve seen before. 16) Earthlings Coming in at number 5 is a film that changed my life only 20 minutes in. Earthlings is one of those films you cannot walk away from unaffected, exposing a reality so often swept under the rug by most. Some of the largest industries in our world today operate from the exploitation and slaughter of billions of animals annually, and this film exposes these gruesome and oft-ignored facets of society. The film does well at showing how all living beings on this planet are ‘earthlings,’ and that somewhere along the way we’ve severed our connection to animals to a sadistic degree. If you are ready, watch this film and prepare for a massive wake-up call. 17) Life In A Day Life In A Day takes the number 3 spot for a few reasons. The first reason is due to it’s incredibly original concept – an arranged series of video clips selected from 80,000 clips submitted to YouTube, the clips showing respective occurrences from around the world on a single day, July 24, 2010. The second reason is due to the sheer magnitude and global perspective it provides the audience with. The film leaves you with a feeling of connectedness, having seen the diversity and rawness of humanity and the windows into different lives, capturing moments humourous and sad, ordinary and momentous. 18) Revolution Revolution is an urgent call to action over the looming ecological collapse. It presents the idea that all of our actions are interconnected and that environmental degradation, species loss, ocean acidification, pollution, and scarcity of food and water are limiting, even reducing, the Earth’s ability to support humans. What is particularly important about this film is the director’s passion to get this message across to our youth, the ones who will be left to deal with the mess of previous generation’s decisions. Revolution is a film that should no doubt be mandatory for high school and university students to watch, whence the future policy makers emerge, to hopefully one day make a difference. 19) Planet Earth What other documentary would you expect to take the top spot on our list other than BBC`s Planet Earth ? The series is probably the most breath-taking visualization of our planet ever conceptualized. Comprised of eleven episodes, each features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth captured in stunning high-definition. Planet Earth comes in at number one for the sole reason that it gives us a truly epic perspective on the world we live in, and reminds us of how freaking awesome and sacred our planet truly is. 

The Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle.

6790,"A Born-Again Donald Trump? Believe It, Evangelical Leader Says - The New York Times","Has Donald J. Trump become a   Christian? That is the suggestion of James C. Dobson, one of America’s leading evangelicals, who said Mr. Trump had recently come “to accept a relationship with Christ” and was now “a baby Christian. ” Dr. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family and one of the country’s most prominent social conservatives, gave his account at a meeting Mr. Trump had in New York on Tuesday with hundreds of Christian conservatives. In an interview recorded at the event by a Pennsylvania pastor, the Rev. Michael Anthony, Dr. Dobson said he knew the person who had led Mr. Trump to Christ, though he did not name him. “I don’t know when it was, but it has not been long,” Dr. Dobson said. “I believe he really made a commitment, but he’s a baby Christian. ” Mr. Anthony posted the interview to his blog on Friday. Dr. Dobson could not be reached on Saturday, and Hope Hicks, the Trump campaign spokeswoman, did not respond Saturday to a request for details. Mr. Trump stumbled at times last year when speaking about faith. At one point he said that he had never asked for God’s forgiveness. And after repeating on the campaign trail that the Bible was his favorite book, ahead of his own “Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump declined to name a favorite verse. “The Bible means a lot to me, but I don’t want to get into specifics,” he told Bloomberg Television. Mr. Trump, a Presbyterian, questioned the faith of Hillary Clinton, a Methodist, at a meeting with a smaller group of evangelical leaders on Tuesday, saying, “We don’t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion. ” During the New York meeting, Mr. Trump made no mention of being born again. It is a possibility certain to cause chortles in some corners, but it could also open doors in others for the   presumptive Republican nominee for president. For evangelicals, “accepting Christ” is at the heart of becoming a genuine Christian, and refers to acknowledging sin and declaring the need for Jesus Christ as savior. “The expectation evangelicals have is of a radical change, a   turn from the life of sin to following Christ,” said Kedron Bardwell, a political science professor at Simpson College in Iowa, who is the son of an evangelical pastor. With new believers, this is often done in prayer with another Christian, which may have been what Dr. Dobson was referring to when he said that he knew the person who had “led him to Christ. ” Mr. Trump won a majority of evangelical voters in the Republican primaries, though some prominent conservative Christian leaders kept their distance. Dr. Dobson endorsed Senator Ted Cruz. Since Mr. Trump clinched the nomination in May, some of those leaders have rallied to him, including Ralph Reed. In his interview, Dr. Dobson conceded that Mr. Trump did not exactly fit the typical mold of an evangelical. “He used the word ‘hell’ four or five times,” he said. “He doesn’t know our language. ” He added that Mr. Trump “refers a lot to religion and not much to faith and belief. ” For evangelicals, the heart of Christianity is a   dependence on God. They often contrast this with what they characterize as merely “religion,” which they view as more rules and  . Dr. Dobson joked that Christians should take it easy on Mr. Trump for what some might perceive as  . “You got to cut him some slack,” Dr. Dobson said. “He didn’t grow up like we did. ” Mr. Anthony referred to the   conversion of Saul, a zealous Pharisee, who later became the Apostle Paul: “He didn’t know the language either. ” Dr. Dobson agreed. “I think there’s hope for him,” Dr. Dobson said. “And I think there’s hope for us. ”",0
6791,Illegal Alien Flees to Avoid Trial on Food Stamp Scam,"Law enforcement authorities are searching for a foreign national who they say cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet right before he was set to go to trial. The Dominican national allegedly fled to avoid charges involving a fraudulent $1. 5 million food stamp racket. [Martin B. Santiago, a    from the Dominican Republic did not show up for his criminal trial in Essex Superior Court on Thursday. He faces charges of fraudulently selling food stamps and laundering money out of his three stores in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the Boston Herald reported. The local newspaper reported Santiago to be an “illegal immigrant. ”  When Santiago did not come to court, state investigators found that he “forcibly removed” the GPS monitoring apparatus about 6 a. m. that morning, the Boston newspaper reported. Despite being an illegal immigrant, court officials released the Dominican national on a $75, 000 cash bond. U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) investigators became suspicious of Santiago, and his   after his stores reported counter sales they said were unusually high for a convenience store. The USDA oversees the food stamp program. Investigators found the majority of their individual sales in amounts greater than $100, the Eagle Tribune reported following Santiago’s arrest in 2015. “These are small convenience stores with no (grocery) carriages and a small checkout area,” Assistant District Attorney Philip Mallard told the Eagle Tribune. “It’s hard to get to $100 in groceries without a carriage. ” The stores also had unusual    ratios, investigators said. The USDA reported Santiago’s businesses ran $2. 19 million in food stamp sales over a   period. However, their expenses for inventory costs only totaled $300, 000. “It’s an astronomical rate of return for a convenience store,” Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement reported by the Eagle Tribune. The Violent Fugitive Apprehension Section of the Massachusetts State Police Department has issued a “Wanted” notice for Santiago. The    inch Hispanic male weighs about 190 pounds and has black hair and brown eyes. Santiago speaks Spanish and has used the names Mark Santiago and Martin Billone Santiago. Anyone having information about Santiago’s location can call the state police in Massachusetts at (800)  . Santiago reportedly has connections to the city of Methuen, as well as Lawrence. These municipalities are both located in Essex County. Santiago faces charges of money laundering, three counts of food stamp trafficking, and three counts of larceny over $250. Food stamp fraud can be a big business for unscrupulous store owners. In late February, a federal judge sentenced George Rafidi, 62, to 33 months in prison for his $2. 8 million food stamp fraud scheme. Breitbart News reported that authorities investigated him after store audits revealed that his establishment redeemed more than ten times the amount of food stamps than larger stores in his area took in. Agents found that Rafidi would exchange food stamps for cash and allow food stamp recipients to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to purchase tobacco and alcohol. A federal grand jury also indicted a store clerk and approximately 30 food stamp recipients. Rafidi is also serving an additional   for brandishing a firearm at federal agents who were investigating him, In early April, a Mexican citizen in Hartford, Connecticut, was found guilty of food stamp fraud and sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. He also allowed customers to redeem food stamps for cash. He collected over $3. 2 million during an   period. He was ordered to pay $1. 5 million in restitution. A New Jersey man, Miguel Antonio Azcona, pleaded guilty in late January to defrauding the federal government of more than $800, 000 in a food    scam.

6792,FBI finds no evidence to prove Trump's relations with Moscow. Clinton thinks otherwise,"FBI finds no evidence to prove Trump's relations with Moscow. Clinton thinks otherwise   Pravda.Ru The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was trying to find evidence linking US presidential candidate from the Republican Party Donald Trump with Russia. The search ended unsuccessfully, The New York Times wrote. The article in the newspaper said that the FBI was unable to find even one clue in the case. In addition, representatives of the FBI and US intelligence believe that hacker attacks on Democratic Party servers were most likely meant to undermine the election process, rather than the leadership of the Republican candidate. However, the FBI still said that the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email correspondence and Donald Trump's possible ties with Russia would continue. Interestingly, though, Hillary Clinton insists there is ""irrefutable"" evidence linking Trump and the Russian government.

6793,The High Cost of Investing Like a Daredevil  - The New York Times,"Live in the moment: If you’re skiing, surfing or scuba diving, that’s the way to go. But if you’re investing, that approach can lead to disaster. The numbers show that most people who are lucky enough to have money to invest end up underperforming the markets by staggering margins. A big reason for that is living in the moment  —   acting in response to ephemeral events. Most of us would be much better off we focused relentlessly on the far horizon, sticking with a simple and cheap plan for getting there. “When investors think   and try to time the market, they haven’t done very well,” Louis S. Harvey, the president of Dalbar, a Boston research firm, said in an interview. “They have been leaving a lot of money on the table. ” His company has been chronicling mutual fund investors’ efforts to beat financial markets for many years, and it has found that as a group, typical investors almost invariably lose. The numbers are devastating. For the two decades through December, Dalbar found, the actual annualized return for the average stock mutual fund investor was only 5. 19 percent, 4. 66 percentage points lower than the 9. 85 percent return for the Standard  Poor’s   index. Bond investors did even worse, trailing the benchmark Barclays Aggregate Bond index by 4. 71 percentage points. In isolation, these figures, which aren’t adjusted for inflation, may seem small. But they aren’t when they recur year after year. In fact, because of the effects of compounding  —   in which a positive return in one year adds to your stash and can grow further in subsequent years  —   those annualized numbers translate into   disparities. Consider a $10, 000 investment in the S. P. 500 index. Using the Dalbar rates, my calculations show that with dividends, that $10, 000 would grow to $65, 464 over 20 years, compared with only $27, 510 over the same period for the return of the average stock mutual fund investors. That gap grows over time. At those rates after 40 years, with compounding, the nest egg invested in the plain vanilla stock index would grow to about $428, 550, compared with only $75, 680 for the average returns of stock mutual fund investors, a $352, 870 difference. Disparities of this order have been showing up year after year in the Dalbar numbers. And with so many Americans forced to rely on their own investing acumen because of the decline of traditional pension plans and lax government rules about financial advice, these awful returns really matter. Why do typical mutual fund investors do so badly? For multiple reasons, and I’ve written about some of them in recent columns. Briefly, actively managed mutual funds over long periods tend to underperform the market, and, as a group, don’t do markedly better than would be expected from flipping coins. Expenses eat into returns. Buying  —   and holding  —   a   index fund over an extended period would improve the returns of most people radically, the Dalbar numbers suggest. That’s where living in the moment comes in. People tend to make big mistakes in periods of big up or down market moves, when finance is in the news, Dalbar has found. And while chasing better returns, investors often buy into funds that don’t match market returns, once costs are included. When you factor in those choices, typical investors actually earn less “in many cases, much less  —   than mutual fund performance reports would suggest,” the Dalbar report says. By buying and selling too frequently and at the wrong times and not benefiting fully from compounding, people typically do even worse than they would have done if they simply held on to their investments  —   even if those investments were in mutual funds that themselves trailed the market, Dalbar found. In short, investors have been penalized multiple times  —   for buying funds that underperform, for selling those funds at the wrong times and, often, by generating unnecessary costs by trading relatively frequently. Some clues as to why this happens year after year appear when you review   market returns. I did that, using historical data from Morningstar’s Ibbotson unit. I examined the monthly returns of a large capitalization stock index and an index modeling the   United States Treasury market over hundreds of rolling       and   periods going back to 1926. I also looked at the blended returns of those two indexes in simple asset allocation portfolios. On the positive side, the numbers show the beneficial effects of simply buying and holding portfolios based on the simplest and most straightforward of plain vanilla market indexes over long periods. Over   periods, if investors had been patient enough to wait that long, they could have had remarkably consistent, favorable returns, as the Dalbar study suggests. Over short stretches, though, the data shows that the pure stock portfolio produced   variations. Looking at these numbers, it’s no wonder that investors have been alternately frightened and enticed, driving up their own costs by shifting their holdings incessantly into hot funds, usually at inopportune times. But if you had lengthened your perspective, it would have been easier to stay in the market. As the holding periods extended, the growth in the $10, 000 portfolio became more consistent. The $10, 000 stock portfolio, after 20 years of compounding, ranged in size from a bonanza of $286, 386 in the two decades through March 2000, to the modest sum of $14, 539 in the 20 years through August 1949. In every rolling   period  —   and there were 833 of them  —   the returns were positive. Bond returns were generally lower but steadier, and when you mixed bonds with stocks, as modern portfolio theory suggests you should, you had extremely smooth returns. In fact, a simple portfolio composed of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds never produced a loss over any   stretch in nearly 90 years. The average annual return for those periods was nearly 9 percent, and it was more than 9 percent for the   periods. It isn’t hard to set up a portfolio like this, either. It can be done by buying   index funds, either as   funds or mutual funds, and rebalancing them every so often many asset allocation funds will do all the work for you. Investors can diversify further by including foreign stocks and bonds but, as John Rekenthaler, vice president for research at Morningstar, said in an interview, “It’s not just about buying hot mutual funds. It’s important not to chase hot asset classes, either.   and steady, both of them, are important. ” But to pull off a strategy like this, you would need to ignore the moment and take the long view. If you had done that, you would have beaten most investors and most comparable mutual funds, and you would have an impressive stash. Past performance definitely does not guarantee future returns, and this approach might not work as well over the next five, 10, or 100 years. But it’s a baseline. I’m not sure that anything else is better, at least not for those of us who don’t invest full time. The beauty of this method is that it can be accomplished at low cost by anyone with enough money and discipline, or obliviousness, to take a really long view. Live in the moment, by all means. But invest in the future.",0
6794,Lawyer Says Ex-Aide and Christie Spoke of Bridge Plot Beforehand - The New York Times,"NEWARK  —   Bridget Anne Kelly discussed the George Washington Bridge lane closings with her boss, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, before they happened in September 2013, her lawyer asserted in federal court here on Tuesday. She also discussed them with him the week they were happening. The lawyer, Michael Critchley, did not elaborate on his cryptic claims, which he made while questioning a prosecution witness. Testimony in the trial has shown that in the months after the lane closings, several of Mr. Christie’s top advisers had told him that Ms. Kelly, his former deputy chief of staff, had emails about the closings. Those people included his chief of staff, chief counsel, press secretary, chief political adviser and an aide he had tapped to lead the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the bridge. Yet Mr. Christie, a Republican, convened a staff meeting in December 2013 and angrily demanded to know if anyone had knowledge or emails about the closings. An hour later, he held a news conference where he said he was certain that none of his staff members had any knowledge of or had been involved in the scheme. When emails with Ms. Kelly’s name appeared as a result of a legislative subpoena a month later, Mr. Christie held another news conference and declared that she had lied to him. It was, Mr. Critchley said in court on Tuesday, a “sham. ” According to testimony in federal court here, where Ms. Kelly and another former Christie aide, Bill Baroni, are on trial for authorizing the lane closings and then covering them up, the governor’s office was not much concerned about finding the truth about the shutdown in the months after they took place. Instead, the governor and his aides, keenly aware of Mr. Christie’s presidential ambitions and how a scandal could damage them, were more worried about keeping any evidence implicating his office hidden.   a former top Christie aide, Mr. Critchley offered tantalizing clues as to what Ms. Kelly may say on the stand about what Mr. Christie knew about the closings, which prosecutors say were meant to punish the mayor of Fort Lee, N. J. for refusing to endorse the governor’s  . Mr. Critchley asked the witness, Deborah Gramiccioni, who in 2013 was the governor’s deputy chief of staff for policy, if she recalled a lunch that she, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Christie had in August that year, on the day Ms. Kelly sent her   email: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. ” No one  —   not prosecutors, nor David Wildstein, the Port Authority executive who received the email and ordered the lanes closed and is now the prosecution’s star witness  —   has ever explained why Ms. Kelly would have sent the email that day when the mayor had said months earlier that he would not endorse Mr. Christie. Ms. Gramiccioni did not recall what was discussed that day. Ms. Kelly, who has never publicly given her account, is expected to testify this month. Her lawyers have argued that virtually the entire governor’s office knew about the closings and that she has been made a scapegoat. Mr. Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to his role in the lane closings, has already testified that he told the governor about them as they were happening. Ms. Gramiccioni testified she first heard that Ms. Kelly was looped into emails about the lane closings in December 2013, from Mr. Baroni, Mr. Christie’s top staff appointee at the Port Authority, and that the governor had asked Ms. Gramiccioni to succeed Mr. Baroni. Ms. Gramiccioni said she shared the information with Charles McKenna, the governor’s chief counsel, who told her he had heard “something about that. ” But under   she said Mr. McKenna did not mention that he had heard the same thing nearly two months earlier from Mr. Christie’s press secretary, Michael Drewniak, and had asked Ms. Kelly about it at the time. Ms. Gramiccioni said that she then told Mr. Christie’s chief of staff, Kevin O’Dowd, about what Mr. Baroni had said about the   emails involving Ms. Kelly, and that Mr. O’Dowd said he would talk to Mr. Baroni about it. Mr. Critchley pressed her: Did Mr. O’Dowd tell her that he had discussed the same subject with Mr. Christie and Mr. Drewniak a week earlier? Did he tell her he had already had a talk with Ms. Kelly earlier that day, asking her to comb through her emails? “He did not,” Ms. Gramiccioni said. Ms. Gramiccioni spoke to Mr. O’Dowd again the next day, Dec. 13, after Mr. Christie’s news conference, to report that she had seen Ms. Kelly in her office and that she seemed upset. Mr. Critchley asked whether Mr. O’Dowd had told her that the governor’s political strategist, Michael DuHaime, had also told him about Ms. Kelly’s emails, and whether Mr. O’Dowd had told her Ms. Kelly had given him emails related to the lane closings. “He did not,” Ms. Gramiccioni said. Ms. Gramiccioni said she told Mr. Christie on Dec. 12 what Mr. Baroni had told her about emails including Ms. Kelly about the lane closings. Mr. Critchley asked if the governor had informed her that Mr. DuHaime had told him the same thing the previous day. “I did not know that, nor did anyone tell me that,” she said. On Dec. 13, Mr. Christie held his staff meeting, speaking in what Ms. Gramiccioni called a “thunderous” voice, telling his senior staff members that he would hold a news conference, and that “if we had any emails or any information about the lane closure, that we had one hour to get that information or those emails to Kevin or Charlie,” she testified, referring to Mr. O’Dowd and Mr. McKenna. “Did you know he was lying? All that sound and fury was just made up?” Mr. Critchley asked, prompting an objection from the prosecution. “Did he say, ‘the confessionals are open’?” Mr. Critchley asked. “Language like that,” Ms. Gramiccioni said. “Did you see the governor walk into one of those confessionals?” Mr. Critchley asked. The prosecution objected again. “Did you ever ask them, ‘Did anyone ever go talk to Bridget Kelly and ask her what she knows about the lane closures? ’” Mr. Critchley asked. Ms. Gramiccioni said she had not. And how long would it take for Mr. O’Dowd to walk from his office to Ms. Kelly’s, he asked her. “A couple of seconds,” Ms. Gramiccioni replied.",0

TPP/TTIP/TISA 
TPP: A Podesta mail where Nikki Budzinski, Labor Outreach Director, discusses Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson: “I have received four calls from labor about a district meeting that Congresswoman Johnson (a HRC public supporter) held in Dallas, Texas where she discussed TPP. She claimed in the meeting that she speaks with HRC 2-3 times a week and that she was told by the Secretary that the only reason she opposes TPP is to get ‘labor off her back’ and that once she is elected President she will reverse position. I have worked with our Western Political Director Jessica Meija, and she has connected with the Congresswoman’s COS to clarify the inaccuracy of what she said and push back on her comments. This was not helpful with labor. [ Wikileaks (attachment)]. “Inaccuracy.” Of course, of course. 
TPP: “[Our Revolution,] the progressive group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders has begun a targeted campaign to sway at least five House Democrats to oppose the TPP in hopes it could change the outcome of a ratification vote — and it’s getting some results” [ Politico ]. “Our Revolution, which Sanders formed in late August to support liberal candidates, has set its sights on at least five other fence-sitting lawmakers. In a vote that’s expected to have razor-thin margins, plundering just a few Democratic votes the White House hoped to gain could make all the difference. The target list includes Reps. Seth Moulton (Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (Colo.), Beto O’Rourke (Texas), Derek Kilmer (Wash.), and Pennsylvania state Rep. Dwight Evans.” 
TPP: “In Thursday, Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers published a report warning that if the TPP isn’t passed, a China-backed trade agreement will takes its place. That could put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage when they try to sell to customers in Japan and other Asian nations. The report argues that if China’s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership goes into effect, at least 35 U.S. industries as diverse as plastics, fishing and footwear will be at risk of increased competition from China in the Japanese market” [ FiveThirtyEight ]. So they’ve settled on this messaging, now? And: “[I]f Clinton wins, Obama might be able to put together a coalition of Republicans and trade-friendly Democrats* to support the treaty. In other words, TPP isn’t dead yet.” * Especially those looking for jobs on K Street. 
TPP: “”If TPP is not passed and RCEP is enacted, which is what all these countries say they are planning to do, then U.S. businesses would face a direct loss of competitive position,” said Jason Furman, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers” [ Reuters ]. “This would displace U.S. goods and be worse than simply maintaining the trade status quo, Furman said. The study identifies 35 industrial sectors employing 4.7 million people with $5.3 billion in sales to Japan that would face such a disadvantage.” 
TPP: “Japan’s ruling parties push TPP through committee after opposition walkout” [ Nikkei Asian Review ]. “The next hurdle for the trade deal is a vote during a plenary session of the House of Representatives, expected early next week. It will then be sent to the Diet’s upper house, the House of Councillors.” 
TPP: “Working-class U.S. residents already lose about $1,800 annually because wages have been depressed by global competition on labor rates, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. TPP would deepen this problem” [ Detroit Free Press ]. I know the cheap goods are supposed to make up for this, but when your jobs and and what you can afford to buy are both crapified….

Days until: 3! 
Corruption 
“Two former Christie administration insiders charged in a bizarre scheme of political retaliation against a mayor who refused to endorse the governor for re-election were found guilty Friday on all counts in the long-running Bridgegate saga” [ Newark Star-Ledger ]. “‘In keeping with the disgrace that was this trial, one of the things the U.S. Attorney’s Office should be ashamed of is where it decided to draw the line on who to charge and who not to charge,’ Baroni’s attorney Michael] Baldassare said. ‘… They should have had belief in their own case to charge powerful people, and they did not.” Hmm. I wonder which “powerful people” Baldassare has in mind? 
Our Famously Free Press 
“Behind all the Times’ fawning profiles of Clinton — and the denigrating pieces not only on Trump but also Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders — was a cozy understanding between Times reporters and the Clinton campaign, WikiLeaks has shown us, that getting Clinton elected is something of a collaborative effort” [ MarketWatch ]. “Editors at the Times, the Washington Post and elsewhere justify this hostility because they have determined that Trump is an existential threat to democracy and the worst presidential nominee in history and can’t be treated as an ordinary candidate. So why do the polls show the worst nominee ever running neck-and-neck with the candidate President Barack Obama has praised as the most qualified person ever to run for president? Do these editors know something that tens of millions of American voters are missing? Whose job is it really to decide what poses a threat to our democracy — a handful of editors in the corporate media or the voters?” 
The Voters 
New Hampshire : Clinton 44%, Trump 44%, Johnson 5% ( UMass Lowell ) 
Iowa : Trump 44%, Clinton 41%, Johnson 5% ( RABA Research ) 
Virginia : Clinton 45%, Trump 38%, Johnson 5% ( Roanoke College ) 
Georgia : Trump 48%, Clinton 46%, Johnson 4% ( Landmark ) 
Missouri : Trump 52%, Clinton 41% ( PPP ) 
New Hampshire : Clinton 48%, Trump 43% ( PPP ) 
Nevada : Clinton 48%, Trump 45% ( PPP )

Pennsylvania : Clinton 48%, Trump 44% ( PPP ) 
North Carolina : Clinton 49%, Trump 47% ( PPP ) 
Wisconsin : Clinton 44%, Trump 38%, Johnson 7% ( Loras College ) 
If I plug all the states where Clinton is ahead into the New York Times “paths to victory” calculator , Clinton wins — even if Trump wins Florida. Of course, last I checked, NH was dead even, not Clinton up 4, and I don’t have the chops to assess how good any of these polls are. 
“Trump is finishing the race the way many Republicans wished he could have run it from the start: fiercely on message and on offense” [ RealClearPolitics ]. “Trump has largely adhered to his teleprompters and resisted controversial tweets this week. As Clinton campaigned a few days ago with Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner with whom Trump has infamously feuded, the GOP nominee focused primarily on higher costs for Obamacare and the revived FBI investigation into emails pertinent to Clinton’s private server. The campaign believes those issues bolster his closing argument that Clinton is corrupt and a vestige of old politics, while he says he’s an agent of change.” 
“Our polling data suggests that the missing whites aren’t exactly conservative populists who support Mr. Trump. They’re just dissatisfied: They don’t like their candidate, and they don’t like the other party’s candidate much either” [ New York Times ]. “The registered white missing Democrats, for instance, support Mrs. Clinton by only 61 percent to 19 percent. The missing registered white Republicans support Mr. Trump by only 69 to 13.” 
“Election Update: Why Clinton’s Position Is Worse Than Obama’s” [Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight ]. “In the table below, I’ve run a head-to-head comparison showing how many electoral votes each candidate was projected to have at various margins of victory or defeat. For instance, Obama had a lead in states (and congressional districts) totaling 332 electoral votes in our final 2012 forecast. Clinton leads in states totaling only 272 electoral votes, just two more than the minimum she needs to win the Electoral College.” In brief, Clinton is stronger than Obama among highly educated voters in states that she would win anyhow , and weaker among white voters without college degrees in states that are close. 
War Drums 
“The U.S. government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week’s presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling, American officials told NBC News. The effort is being coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, but reaches across the government to include the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, current and former officials say” [ NBC ]. ” Officials are alert for any attempts to create Election Day chaos, and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. But what is more likely, multiple U.S. officials say, is a lower-level effort by hackers from Russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. For example, officials fear an 11th hour release of fake documents implicating one of the candidates in an explosive scandal without time for the news media to fact check it. 
The Trail 
“With Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump breathtakingly close in polls of key states, analysts are beginning to factor in the possibility of recounts that would delay the outcome” [ MarketWatch ]. “Bear in mind that a candidate would have limited time to contest the vote. This year, the Electoral College is due to meet on Dec. 19. By law, electors meet on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.” A recount would make Florida 2000 look like a walk in the park, especially because Clinton, bless her heart, is unlikely to let herself be rolled, unlike Gore. 
Michigan: “Hillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow 4-point lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesday’s election, with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat” [ Detroit Free Press ]. ” [T]he number of undecided voters — 13% — remains extraordinarily high for this late in an election cycle, speaking to the high unfavorable marks voters give both major party candidates.” Normally, I’d say a 4% lead is a lot, but those undecideds. Wowsers. 
Realignment 
“Who Broke Politics?” [Paul Krugman, New York Times ]. “So how did all our political norms get destroyed? Hint: It started long before Donald Trump. On one side….” Hint: You will read to the end of the column without finding the “On the other side” that “on one side” sets up. I mean, it wasn’t mean Republicans who prevented Obama from throwing the banksters in jail, was it? 
“America and the Abyss” [Andrew Sullivan, New York Magazine ]. Of course, if Trump really were a fascist, the Democratic Establishment would fight him tooth and nail. Right? 
“Donald Trump didn’t break one of our two great and ancestral political parties. He won the nomination because the Republican Party was already broken, and those responsible for the party, the elected officials and thinkers, didn’t know. Now they do” [Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal , “Democracy’s Majesty and 2016’s Indignity”]. “Soon they will begin that stage of political mourning known as the symposia process. They’ll discuss how to repair, renew, keep the party together. Or the party will, over the next few cycles, split apart… The Democratic Party and its lobbyist/think-tank/journalistic establishment in Washington have long looked to me to be dominated by people devoted mostly to getting themselves in the best professional position and their kids into Sidwell Friends School. They want to be part of the web, the arrangement. They want to have connections, associates, a tong. They want to be wired in. They don’t want to be I.F. Stone, alone, reading the fine print of obscure government documents. And Clintonism—for years the biggest web, the securest source of money, a real tong with enforcers and reward-dispensers—has long been a sound route to all of this. You may have to bend rules to be part of it, accept unsavory deals and characters, but it is warm and cozy in there.” And: 
One thing I saw this year was that sincere conservatives wholly opposed to socialism had real respect for Bernie Sanders because they saw his sincerity. He wasn’t part of the web and they honored him for it. 
I never thought I’d find myself writing this, but for punditry I’ll take Nooners over Krugman’s hackery or Sullivan’s hysterical ranting. It’s been quite a year. 
Democrat Email Hairball

Particularly the genesis of the meeting in previous meeting between Podesta and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough in an “offsite” Starbucks near the White House. If I were Putin, I’d have that Starbucks wired to the gills.

Stats Watch 
Employment Situation, October 2016: Unemployment Rate – Level (4.9 %); Participation Rate – level (62.8%) [ Econoday ]. “Solid payroll growth is not the whole story of the October employment report. Average hourly earnings are rising, up an outsized 0.4 percent in the month with the year-on-year rate, at 2.8 percent, suddenly near 3.0 percent and at its recovery peak… The unemployment rate is down 1 tenth to 4.9 percent and, for some, is already signaling full employment for the labor market.But negatives are scarce in this report, where strength is emphatically underscored by the unexpected acceleration in average hourly earnings which further includes an upward revision to September. Today’s report marks a solid opening to fourth-quarter data and will raise talk of a wage-inflation flashpoint…” Gotta take the punchbowl away from lower orders! But: ” The number of persons working part time for economic reasons was essentially unchanged in October. This level suggests slack still in the labor market” [ Calculated Risk ]. Moreover: “t’s also worth noting that the standard measure of unemployment — now at 5 percent — doesn’t capture the lingering weakness in the market seen in the broader U6 measure, which includes discouraged workers, other workers marginally attached to the labor force and those in temporary jobs because they can’t get full-time work. The conventional unemployment measure is a hair below its mean from 2003-7, which is 5.2 percent. The broader U6, however, at 9.7 percent is higher than its 2003-7 mean of 9.1 percent. This is just another sign that there’s still slack in the labor market.” [ Bloomberg ]. And: “Should we believe the employment numbers in this report? There is little evidence of political bias in past election cycles” [ Econintersect ]. “To sum this report up – employment is continuing to tread water – growing little better than the theoretical working population growth. However, note that the household survey removed 43,000 to the workforce (which is the reason the unemployment rate declined). There was really nothing good or nothing really terrible – although manufacturing declined. The year-over-year rate of growth significantly declined this month.” Again, the Econoday summary is just a little too breathless for this Maine bear. 
International Trade, September 2016: “A decline in imports helped pull down the nation’s trade gap sharply in September, to $36.4 billion from a revised $40.5 billion in August. Imports, reflecting declines for capital goods and also consumer goods, fell 1.1 percent while exports, showing an especially strong gain for capital goods, rose 0.6 percent” [ Econoday ]. “Declining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand, whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays.” And: “Declining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand, whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays” [ Econintersect ]. 
Jobless Claims: “However, comparing initial claims today with the past is the proverbial apples to oranges. An important fact in looking at claims data is that vastly fewer people today are eligible for unemployment benefits. In other words, the number of unemployed people who can’t receive jobless benefits — and thus are not in the initial claims data — has risen relative to those who have unemployment insurance” [ Bloomberg ]. As Mosler has been saying. 
Housing: “Residential remodeling has recovered to 38% of the peak it attained prior to the Great Recession. New residential construction, on the other hand, is only at 17% of the peak” [ Econintersect ]. 
Retail: “The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has just announced that Samsung is having to recall its top-load washing machines due to a risk of impact injuries. The exact hazard listed was that the washing machine top can unexpectedly detach from the washing machine chassis during use, posing a risk of injury from impact” [ 247 Wall Street ]. “What matters here is that this will not be a cheap recall. You can drive a smartphone back to the store or mail it in cheaply. Have you ever tried moving a washing machine, or just dealing with getting a technician out to deliver or fix one? And the size of this recall is huge — about 2.8 million total units!” Korea is really having its troubles, isn’t it? Samsung is a failing national champion, Hanjin went bankrupt, and there’s a ginormous scandal with their President. 
Shipping: “In August, the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA) reported its first quarterly volume decline for the first time after 25 straight quarters of growth. Earlier this week, marked its second straight quarterly volume decline, officially extending more of an unwelcome streak” [ Logistics Management ]. “Total third quarter intermodal volume movements—at 4,348,634—were off 4.6 percent annually, following a 6.1 percent second quarter decline at 4,271,162. The first quarter of 2016 saw volumes rise 2.0 percent annually. … Like recent quarters, domestic containers were the lone metric to see an increase.” 
Shipping: “Orders for heavy-duty commercial trucks in North America plummeted 46% in October from the same month last year, providing a grim outlook for truck manufacturers in the coming year” [ Wall Street Journal , “Truck Orders Tumbled 46% in October “]. “In an analyst note Thursday, Stifel said the October order total was the weakest since 2009, falling well below expectations. “October orders are critical as they represent the traditional start to the order season for trucks to be produced the next year,” the report said.” 
Shipping: “After four days [!!!] firefighters have finally managed to douse the terrible tanker blaze that killed many workers at a shipbreaking site in Gadani, Pakistan. Rescue work inside the hull of the Indonesian ship cannot start however as the steel plates are still too hot” [ Splash 247 ]. “While there are now 21 confirmed dead, the eventual death toll could hit triple figures with many unaccounted for inside the hull of the ship and a number of the 60 workers sent to hospital deemed to have such severe burns that they are unlikely to survive.” The human cost of excess capacity. 
The Bezzle: “GoPro’s forward statements are not believable, in light of its recent performance, and management’s ability to forecast. It is also essentially a one-product company, and that product does not sell very well” [ 247 Wall Street ]. 
The Bezzle: “the app economy may have passed its peak. CB Insights analyzed the company descriptions of thousands of startup companies receiving VC funding for the first time between 2010 and today, scanning for buzzwords that describe the companies’ field of focus. While ‘app] is still the keyword that shows up in the most company descriptions, the share of startups working with apps in some way has declined for three straight years” [ Econintersect ]. “Looking at the terms with the largest increase in mentions in startup company descriptions between 2010 and 2016 possibly allows us to glimpse into the future and gives us an idea of what the next big thing might be. According to CB Insights’ analysis, these terms are ‘virtual reality’, ‘machine learning’ and ‘natural language.'” I think reality is quite virtual enough already, thank you. 
The Fed: “Central bank independence ‘comes from an understanding of the macroeconomic policy problem that is not relevant to current times,’ Summers said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund” [ MarketWatch ]. “During the question-and-answer session, Summers said he did not think that entitlement reform should be on the immediate agenda for the next administration. He said that policy makers should focus solely on accelerating growth. If they are successful in sparking demand, the long-run debt-to-GDP ratio will be sustainable, he said. If policy makers fail, it will not be.”

“Instacart workers are earning a lot less money after changes to the company’s pay structure — changes CEO Apoorva Mehta told BuzzFeed News are necessary for the company’s continued growth, but that hundreds of vocal Instacart shoppers say are threatening their livelihoods.

These shoppers estimate their earnings have fallen by around 30% so far” [ Buzzfeed ]. Should have filed this under The Bezzle, maybe. Yet another Silicon Valley darling whose valuation depends on screwing over working people. Oh, and this is good: 
The vast majority of shoppers who spoke with BuzzFeed News for this article asked to remain anonymous out of concern that their accounts would be deactivated for speaking with the press; Instacart said it has never deactivated workers for speaking publicly about their experience with the company.

With a managed, socialist economy, business cycles are much less severe (though they can’t be eliminated entirely, for example, in years when agricultural production is unexpectedly low due to the weather) because the government manages production and employment. But these economies tend to grow slower than capitalist economies, and they often have substantial inefficiencies in the way resources and labor are used” [Mark Thoma, CBS ].

6797,What Travelers Should Know About New Restrictions on Devices - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   The United States Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday enacted a new flight restriction. Under the rule, passengers traveling on foreign airlines from eight   countries to the United States are barred from bringing devices larger than cellphones onto the plane. Instead, they have to stow devices like computers and tablets in checked luggage. Who is affected, why are larger devices banned, and what should you do? Here is what we know so far. The new policy affects people flying to the United States from airports in Amman, Jordan Cairo Istanbul Jidda and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia Kuwait City Casablanca, Morocco Doha, Qatar and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The United Kingdom also announced a similar ban on devices larger than smartphones on certain airlines. The policy applies to flights coming into the U. K. from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. For business travelers on those airlines, the ban may disrupt productivity. “This is going to hurt all the serious businesspeople and academics,” said Osama Sharshar, an Egyptian lawmaker and journalist who frequently travels to the United States. “They are not going there to play and don’t have time to waste. ” Only physically, not technologically. A computer or a tablet is larger than a smartphone, which would theoretically provide more room for terrorists to cram in components like bomb parts or weapons, said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab, a research group that follows technology and policy. Multiple terrorists could then each take a computer on a plane containing an explosive component and, hypothetically, put it together in the cabin, he said. Yet a smartphone may also pose threats. As Samsung demonstrated last year with its Galaxy Note 7, smartphones  —   and anything with a   battery  —   are capable of exploding and causing safety hazards. Technologically, a smartphone is a miniature computer that is just as powerful as a laptop. There is also a risk that a terrorist could use a smartphone to remotely detonate a bomb that is hidden inside a computer checked in as cargo, said Nick Feamster, a computer science professor at Princeton University. Other than preventing terrorists from smuggling components onto planes, the device ban may create additional surveillance opportunities. It is common for airport security officials to search checked luggage. In theory, if a computer is checked, airport officials can do more thorough searches, including a data frisk. “Who, if anyone, takes control of your device while it’s not in your sight or possession?” Professor Feamster said. “A search of your device is not outside the realm of possibility. ” If you are flying on an affected airline and concerned about your privacy, consider the recommendations outlined in our guide to protecting your data while crossing the border. For one, you could encrypt your files with an app like BitLocker or FileVault. That way, if someone did try to gain access to your data, a passphrase would be needed to decrypt the files, Mr. Marczak of the Citizen Lab said. In addition, travelers could seal laptops in a   bag, Mr. Marczak said. Once you reach your destination, you can see if anyone tampered with the laptop by inserting a physical surveillance device into it, for example. You could also consider traveling with an inexpensive computer that lacks any of your sensitive data, Professor Feamster added. And you could back up your data to the cloud and purge it from the inexpensive computer before checking it in with your luggage. If he were traveling to those countries now, Mr. Feamster said, “I wouldn’t even bother taking my main laptop. I’d take my clean laptop that doesn’t have any data on it. ”",0
6798,Electoral Map Gives Donald Trump Few Places to Go - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump, confronting a daunting electoral map and a significant financial disadvantage, is preparing to fall back from an expansive national campaign and concentrate the bulk of his time and money on just three or four states that his campaign believes he must sweep in order to win the presidency. Even as Mr. Trump has ticked up in national polls in recent weeks, senior Republicans say his path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for election has remained narrow  —   and may have grown even more precarious. It now looks exceedingly difficult for him to assemble even the barest Electoral College majority without beating Hillary Clinton in a trifecta of the biggest swing states: Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. President Obama won all three states in 2008 and 2012, and no Republican has won Pennsylvania in nearly three decades. With a divisive campaign message that has alienated many women and Hispanics, Mr. Trump appears to have pushed several traditional swing states out of his own reach. According to strategists on both sides of the race, polling indicates that Mrs. Clinton has a solid upper hand in Colorado and Virginia, the home state of Senator Tim Kaine, her running mate. Both states voted twice for George W. Bush, who assiduously courted Hispanic voters and suburban moderates. In addition, Trump allies have grown concerned about North Carolina, a   state that has large communities of black voters and   whites  —   two audiences with which Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. While Mr. Trump is not ready to give up entirely on any of the major battlegrounds, advisers have become increasingly convinced that his most plausible route to the presidency, and perhaps his only realistic victory scenario, involves capturing all three of the biggest contested electoral prizes on the map, and keeping North Carolina in the Republican column. Mr. Trump and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, are expected to campaign intensively across those four   states, with Mr. Trump trumpeting a set of blunt slogans through mass media and Mr. Pence focused on shoring up support from conservatives and    whites. There is no imminent plan, Trump advisers say, to match Mrs. Clinton’s spending on television ads. Instead, they intend to aim Mr. Trump like a battering ram at a small number of targets, to keep delivering his provocative message on trade, terrorism and immigration. The primary “super PAC” backing Mr. Trump, Rebuilding America Now, is taking an identical approach: It has reserved airtime only in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. The main outside group supporting Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, is advertising in those three states and half a dozen more. John Brabender, a Republican strategist who has worked extensively in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, said Mr. Trump had a real but tenuous path to victory, involving a smaller map of swing states than typical for a presidential nominee. Mr. Brabender said Mr. Trump would certainly have to seize Pennsylvania, which has not voted Republican since 1988. “Does Trump have to run the table of the top three targets? Absolutely,” Mr. Brabender said. “The fact that we have to worry about winning Pennsylvania to win the presidency tells you it’s a difficult task. ” Mr. Trump’s inability to broaden the Republican electoral map has heartened supporters of Mrs. Clinton, even as Democrats in general have been dismayed by Mr. Trump’s tenacity in national polls. In the aftermath of this month’s Republican convention, Mr. Trump appeared to enjoy a modest bounce, pulling even or slightly ahead of Mrs. Clinton in several national surveys conducted before the Democratic convention. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a longtime political ally of the Clintons, said that Mrs. Clinton could effectively throttle the Trump campaign by winning Virginia, where he is confident of her standing, and one other swing state. He named Florida as the most inviting option. “If you put a combination together of Florida and Virginia, it’s virtually impossible for Republicans to win the presidency,” Mr. McAuliffe said. “Electoral   we are in a very strong position today. ” Each of the key states presents a mix of larger cities and less populated agricultural and former industrial areas, where Mr. Trump has most often gained traction. Mr. Trump’s message of clawing back lost jobs has resonated most in distressed manufacturing regions. But with the exception of Pennsylvania, where joblessness is slightly higher, the unemployment rate in each swing state hovers near the national average of 4. 9 percent or lower. Democrats caution that they view Mr. Trump as a   candidate with unpredictable pockets of support, potentially capable of warping the political landscape even late in the election season. For now, though, Mr. Trump is grappling with a magnified version of the dilemma that threatens to stymie Republicans every four years. Democrats have won a consistent set of 18 states in every presidential election since 1992, giving them a base of 242 Electoral College votes even before counting some of the biggest swing states. As a result, the last two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, would have needed to capture nearly all the contested states on the map in order to win. At an earlier point in the campaign, Mr. Trump had hoped to leverage his support from   whites and independent voters to put some overwhelmingly Democratic states in play, including New York and Massachusetts. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, said this month that Mr. Trump intended to compete in strongly Democratic states like New Jersey and Oregon. In an email on Thursday, Mr. Manafort said the political landscape offered Mr. Trump numerous paths to victory. “We have many different ways, much more than Romney had,” Mr. Manafort said. In private, Trump advisers say the campaign now takes a colder and more clinical view of the electoral map. Mr. Trump, Republicans believe, may have even fewer ways to count to 270 than Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain had, because of his debilitating unpopularity with women and nonwhite voters. Mr. Trump continues to fight at a severe financial and organizational disadvantage against Mrs. Clinton, leaving him without the funds to campaign effectively across all of the states Mr. Romney contested. At the end of June, Mr. Trump had less than half as much cash in reserve as Mrs. Clinton  —   $20 million to her $44 million. In several major swing states, Mr. Trump’s campaign has not yet approved final budgets for his   operations, according to Republicans in communication with his campaign, leaving Republicans on the state and national levels uncertain about his ability to mount major advertising and     operations. And in some of the most crucial states, Mr. Trump continues to face resistance within his own party: In Ohio, he has feuded openly with the popular Republican governor, John Kasich, a former primary opponent who has refused to endorse his campaign. In Florida, some of the most influential Hispanic Republicans in the southern part of the state have withheld their support, hobbling his candidacy there. The map is not entirely forbidding for Mr. Trump: Both Republicans and Democrats see him as holding an edge in Iowa, a heavily white state with six electoral votes that President Obama won twice. And some top Trump aides remain hopeful that the larger terrain of the election will shift in his direction. Trump advisers have argued to national Republicans that they are well positioned to compete in Michigan, a Rust Belt state that no Republican presidential candidate has won since 1988. Should Mr. Trump overtake Mrs. Clinton there, it would allow him a bit more room for error in one of the other cornerstone states. Strategists for Mrs. Clinton largely dismiss that possibility, pointing out that Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney also hoped to compete in both Michigan and Wisconsin, only to see the states slip away well before Election Day. Joel Benenson, the chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, said Mr. Trump had not yet made inroads in any nontraditional swing states. “There isn’t any state that they’re making us play defense in, that we wouldn’t already compete vigorously in anyway,” Mr. Benenson said. Still, Mr. Pence campaigned on Thursday in the Detroit suburbs, in what amounted to an early prospecting expedition for the Trump campaign into Democratic territory. The Indiana governor intends to spend most of his time in the Rust Belt, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Pence, who is popular on the right, is also expected to play defense for Mr. Trump in a few conservative states, like Georgia and Arizona, where Mrs. Clinton may be competitive. A former radio host, Mr. Pence will be a ubiquitous presence on conservative talk shows, to ensure that the Republican base stays loyal to its unorthodox nominee. Robin Hayes, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he anticipated that Mr. Pence, an evangelical Christian, would visit the state often to speak about “North Carolina   values. ” Mr. Hayes, a former member of Congress and a friend of Mr. Pence’s, said it was essential for Mr. Trump to defend Republicans’ grip on North Carolina in order to win nationally. “There’s no substitute for winning, and it is a critically important state,” Mr. Hayes said. “It’s going to be an absolute, bruising kind of campaign. ”",0

6800,"Abbott: Finsbury Park a ’Terror Attack’, But Westminster, Manchester, and London Bridge ’Incidents’","Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott has immediately declared an apparently deliberate attack on pedestrians outside Finsbury Park Mosque terrorism  —   unlike the Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, and London Bridge attacks, which she called “incidents”. [Taking to Twitter after news broke that a    man had crashed a van into a crowd of people leaving a Mosque in Finsbury the Labour was quick to label it a “shocking terror attack”.  Shocking terror attack outside Finsbury Park mosque. Thoughts  prayers with friends  families of the victims #FinsburyPark,  —   Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) June 19, 2017,  Abbott reiterated her description of the attack as terrorism, calling on police to “urgently review security for all mosques” minutes later, and retweeted a message from Shomrim   London which also referred to the crash as a “horrific terrorist attack”. Terror attack outside #FinsburyPark mosque. Police must urgently review security for all mosques #StandTogether,  —   Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) June 19, 2017,  Abbott’s rush to judgement on this occasion stands in sharp contrast to her pronouncements following the Islamist terror attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, and London Bridge. The Westminster Bridge attack, in which Muslim convert Khalid Masood ran down several pedestrians before leaping from his car and stabbing a police constable to death on March 22nd, was not acknowledged as a terror attack until the following day in a tweet which pointed followers in the direction of a Guardian article emphasising the fact that the   migrant was “ ”. The following day, she released a statement in which she claimed it was “too early now to debate the cause or motivation for this attack”. She warned against “wild assertions about this attack by people claiming to know what the police can’t yet know, why this happened and who precisely was involved”. She added: “We should reject any false or lazy assertions and wait for the police to do their work. ” Westminster terror attack triggers   rhetoric. But the attacker was actually British born https:  .   —   Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) March 23, 2017,  Following the Manchester Arena suicide bombing on May 22nd, in which the son an Islamist refugee murdered and maimed dozens of men, women, and children at a concert, Abbott would only go as far describing the attack as a “horrific incident”. My thoughts go out to all those affected by the horrific incident in Manchester. Our emergency services have acted swiftly and bravely.  —   Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) May 23, 2017,  Abbott used similar language following the terror attack on London Bridge and Borough Market on June 3rd, in which   former child refugee Khuram Butt, bogus asylum seeker Rachid Redouane, and EU national Youssef Zaghba ran down and stabbed dozens of people in London. The Jeremy Corbyn ally was careful to refer to the terror attacks as “incidents” in two separate tweets.

6801,Shocked Stockholm Eerily Silent After Truck ’Terror Attack’,"STOCKHOLM (AFP)  —   Stockholm’s usually vibrant city centre was eerily silent on Friday evening with restaurants, bars and cinemas shuttered and streets emptied hours after a truck ploughed into a crowd outside a department store, killing four people and injuring 15. [Stockholmers appeared to be following police advice to stay indoors and avoid crowded areas, with a number of   city streets deserted.  The attack occurred just before 3:00 pm (1300 GMT) when a beer truck slammed into the corner of the bustling Ahlens store and the popular pedestrian street Drottninggatan, above ground from Stockholm’s central subway station. The initial scene was chaotic. After emergency responders rushed to the scene, several bodies could be seen lying on the ground covered with orange blankets. Shattered glass was scattered on the ground near a large blood stain on the asphalt. Shaken passersby described their horror at witnessing what police and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven described as a “terror attack”. “A massive truck starts driving   …     and mangles everything and just drives over exactly everything,” eyewitness Rikard Gauffin told AFP. “It was so terrible and there were bodies lying everywhere  …     it was really terrifying,” he added.  —   Trapped  —   Police cars and ambulances rapidly flooded the scene, as central streets and squares were blocked off amid fears that another attack could be imminent. Helicopters hovered overhead across the city, sirens wailed, and police vans   the streets using loudspeakers to urge people to head straight home and avoid crowded places. But with the metro system and commuter trains shut down for several hours after the attack, other streets heading out of the city were packed with thousands of pedestrians trying to find a way home. Central Stockholm would on any other Friday be abuzz with locals queueing up outside glitzy bars and restaurants and upscale nightclubs. Haval, a    sales clerk who didn’t want to reveal his last name, was in the metro at the time of the attack. His train stopped immediately and he had to get out, along with all the other passengers. They walked along the street before being ushered inside a nearby hotel for safety. “We were suddenly trapped inside a hotel and there was the worst kind of horror in there,” he told AFP. “We were scared, we were scared something else would happen, he added.  —   ‘Suddenly it happens’  —   The attack was the latest in a string of similar assaults with vehicles in Europe that include the southern French city of Nice, Berlin and London. “I never thought that something would happen in Sweden, but then suddenly it happens,” Haval said. One witness identified only as Dimitris told the Aftonbladet daily the truck came “out of nowhere. ” “I couldn’t see if anyone was driving but it was out of control. I saw at least two people get run down. I ran as fast as I could away from there,” he said.  —   ‘You won’t break us’  —   Marko was in coffee shop near the scene with his girlfriend when he saw the truck ram into the store. “He hit a woman first, then he drove over a bunch of other people   …     We took care of everyone lying on the ground,” he told Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet. Hasan Sidi, another passerby, told Aftonbladet he saw two elderly women lying on the ground. He said people at the scene urged him to help one of the women who was “bleeding to death”. “One of them died  …    I don’t know if the other one made it,” Sidi said. “The police were shocked. Everyone was shocked. ” Despite that shock, Sweden was determined to not let the attackers create fear. “Terrorists want us to be afraid, want us to change our behaviour, want us to not live our lives normally, but that is what we’re going to do. So terrorists can never defeat Sweden, never,” Prime Minister Lofven said. Shortly afterwards, he placed a bouquet of flowers near the scene, visibly shaken and wiping away a tear. In an editorial, Sweden’s biggest broadsheet Dagens Nyheter wrote: “What we feared for a long time finally happened. ” “The fear and panic right after the incident was inevitable. The images from the attack were terrible,” the paper said. But Stockholm managed to stay “ ” even though the attacker struck “Sweden and Stockholm’s heart” it added. “Stockholm stands strong. You won’t break Stockholm. ”",0
6802,McConnell on Trump Immigration Executive Order: ’I Don’t Want to Criticize Them for Improving Vetting’ - Breitbart,"Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” while discussing President Donald Trump executive order halting immigration from seven   countries to the United States, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) said, “the extent they’re trying to improve the vetting process, I think that’s in order. ”  “We need to bear in mind that we don’t have religious tests in this country and we also need to remember that some of our best allies in the war against Islamic terrorism are Muslims,” he added. Partial transcript as follows: RADDATZ: Do you support president Trump’s temporary immigration ban from these predominantly Muslim countries. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL ( ) MAJORITY LEADER: Well, I think it’s a good idea to tighten the vetting process. But I also think it’s important to remember that some of our best sources in the war against radical Islamic terrorism are Muslims, both in this country and overseas. And we have had some difficulty in the past getting interpreters as you suggested in the earlier segment who are helpful to us treated properly. So we need to be careful as we do this. Improving vetting, something  …     RADDATZ: And yet right now they’re being detained so  —   do you support this or not support this. MCCONNELL: It’s hopefully going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far. I don’t want to criticize them for improving vetting. I think we need to be careful. We don’t have religious tests in this country. RADDATZ: In the past, you’ve called the Muslim ban completely and totally inconsistent with American values. The president says this is not an outright Muslim ban, even if this is temporary, how is this order consistent with American values? MCCONNELL: Well, if they’re looking to tighten the vetting process, I mean who would be against that? But I am opposed to a religious tests. The courts are going to determine whether this is too broad. RADDATZ: So it sounds to me like you are opposed to certain parts of this. If we’re detaining or holding back people who have helped Americans in the fight. MCCONNELL: Well, obviously I’m against that. RADDATZ: A religious test then you’re opposed to certain parts of this. MCCONNELL: Look, the president has a lot of latitude to try to secure the country. And I’m not going to make a blanket criticism of this effort. However, I think it’s important to remember, as I said, a lot of Muslims are our best sources in the war against terror. RADDATZ: So, do you think this will have blowback in the world? I mean, are you sensing that already? You’ve seen the reactions. MCCONNELL: Yeah, well, we’ll see. And it’s important, however, to emphasize it’s important to keep America as secure as possible and we’ll see how it plays out. RADDATZ: Just tell me again how you would summarize what happened with this executive order. MCCONNELL: How I would summarize. RADDATZ: Yes, how would you  —   what would you say about it? Others are saying it’s devastating, others are saying it’s  . MCCONNELL: Well, I’m not saying either of those things, I’m saying what I just said a few minutes ago, which is to the extent they’re trying to improve the vetting process, I think that’s in order. We need to bear in mind that we don’t have religious tests in this country and we also need to remember that some of our best allies in the war against Islamic terrorism are Muslims.

6807,The Nation’s Zoos Know You Need to See Cute Animals Right Now - The New York Times,"The news can seem grim. Refugee crises, extreme weather and wars plague the globe. Cellphones have exploded. America is bitterly divided. Mary Tyler Moore died. Even the doomsday clock has been reset. But we thought you could use a break, whatever your politics, your fears, your troubles. The nation’s zoos agree. Welcome to the Great National Cute Animal   of 2017. Over the past two days, zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals. And the world cracked a smile. It all started, according to  The   with a Smithsonian National Zoo announcement on Wednesday of the birth of a female gray seal on Jan. 21, a pup described as “nursing, moving and bonding well with mom. ” The baby’s mother, a    gray seal named Kara, set a record for being the oldest seal of her kind to give birth in a zoo. (The Washington Post even had a Facebook Live presentation of her ultrasound in December.) The seal’s birth was a reminder that gray seals moved from the endangered list to being a species of least concern in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Their numbers rose to more than 600, 000 worldwide. The Smithsonian birth announcement set off a ripple online, and generated a hashtag  —   #CuteAnimalTweetOff  —   which grew into a viral phenomenon as zoos posted photos of cute and fuzzy pandas, otters, orangutans and tiger cubs. There is even a baby turtle, as well as a pun or two, in the fray. “Here we have an otterly adorable submission to #CuteAnimalTweetOff,” the Aquarium of the Pacific said on Twitter with a photo of otters. “Leapin’ Lemurs the #cuteanimaltweetoff is going strong,” the Maryland Zoo wrote with a photo of a lemur. The postings have gone international, suggesting that maybe, just maybe, we can find common ground across borders by looking at cute animals. The ZSL London Zoo raised the bar with a few seconds of video of its tiger cubs Karis and Achilles, born in June. Sarah Janet Hill, a host at Radio Free Radio in Hampton, Va. has been credited with giving the Smithsonian announcement the online bump it needed to spread. “I thought, ‘Our seals are cuter than that,’ ” Ms. Hill is quoted as saying in The  . So she retweeted the announcement to the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center, which took up the challenge. The viral response to the pup’s birth announcement has been a pleasant surprise for the Smithsonian Zoo. Annalisa Meyer, a spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the seal pup had not yet been given a name, a process that includes taking suggestions from the public or giving a sponsor the opportunity to come up with one. “We have never set off a cute animal challenge,” Ms. Meyer said. “Will it be the last? Maybe not. We are open to more cute  . ” But to what end? Maybe the point is just relief from the drumbeat of sober news. “It’s been a really fun day, and I’m just glad there was something light to talk about today,” Ms. Hill told The  . “There’s been some heavy news lately, and it’s been fun to distract people with this fun stuff. ” “Everyone wants their zoo to win,” she added, but really, there were no winners or losers in the standoff.

They created fake email accounts to sign up customers for online banking services. They set up sham accounts that customers learned about only after they started accumulating fees. On Thursday, these illegal banking practices cost Wells Fargo $185 million in fines, including a $100 million penalty from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the largest such penalty the agency has issued. Federal banking regulators said the practices, which date back to 2011, reflected serious flaws in the internal culture and oversight at Wells Fargo, one of the nation’s largest banks. The bank has fired at least 5, 300 employees who were involved. In all, Wells Fargo employees opened roughly 1. 5 million bank accounts and applied for 565, 000 credit cards that may not have been authorized by customers, the regulators said in a news conference. The bank has 40 million retail customers. Some customers noticed the deception when they were charged unexpected fees, received credit or debit cards in the mail that they did not request, or started hearing from debt collectors about accounts they did not recognize. But most of the sham accounts went unnoticed, as employees would routinely close them shortly after opening them. Wells has agreed to refund about $2. 6 million in fees that may have been inappropriately charged. Wells Fargo is famous for its culture of   products to customers  —   routinely asking, say, a checking account holder if she would like to take out a credit card. Regulators said the bank’s employees had been motivated to open the unauthorized accounts by compensation policies that rewarded them for opening new accounts many current and former Wells employees told regulators they had felt extreme pressure to open as many accounts as possible. “Unchecked incentives can lead to serious consumer harm, and that is what happened here,” said Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells said the employees who were terminated included managers and other workers. A bank spokeswoman declined to say whether any senior executives had been reprimanded or fired in the scandal. “Wells Fargo is committed to putting our customers’ interests first 100 percent of the time, and we regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request,” the bank said in a statement. One Wells customer in Northern California, Shahriar Jabbari, had seven additional accounts that he did not consent to, according to a lawsuit he filed against the bank last year in federal court. When Mr. Jabbari called the bank asking what he should do with three new debit cards he did not authorize, a bank employee told him to dispose of them, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Jabbari said in the lawsuit that his credit score had suffered because unpaid fees on the unauthorized accounts had been sent to a debt collector. Banking regulators said the widespread nature of the illegal behavior showed that the bank lacked the necessary controls and oversight of its employees. Ensuring that large banks have tight controls has been one of the central preoccupations of banking regulators after the mortgage crisis. Such pervasive problems at Wells Fargo, which has headquarters in San Francisco, stand out given all of the scrutiny that has been heaped on large, systemically important banks since 2008. “If the managers are saying, ‘We want growth we don’t care how you get there,’ what do you expect those employees to do?” said Dan Amiram, an associate business professor at Columbia University. It is a particularly ugly moment for Wells, one of the few large American banks that have managed to produce consistent profit increases since the financial crisis. Wells has earned a reputation on Wall Street as a tightly run ship that avoided many of the missteps of the mortgage crisis because it took fewer risks than many of its competitors. At the same time, Wells has managed to be enormously profitable, as other large banks continued to stumble because of tighter regulations and a choppy economy. Analysts have marveled at the bank’s ability to   mortgages, credit cards and auto loans to customers. The strategy is at the core of   banking: Rather than spend too much time and money recruiting new customers, sell existing customers on new products. Wells Fargo markets itself as the quintessential Main Street lender, stressing the value of creating   relationships with customers over earning a quick buck. But that   approach was undercut, regulators say, by a compensation program that encouraged employees to push the limits. “It is way out of character for one of the cleanest banks around,” said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. “It’s a   why so many employees felt comfortable crossing the line. ” In many cases, customers took notice only when they received a letter in the mail congratulating them on opening a new account. Many of the questionable accounts were created by moving a small amount of money from the customer’s current account to open the new one. Shortly after opening the sham account, the bank employee closed it down and moved the money back, according to regulators. But Wells employees were still most likely able to get credit for opening new accounts in meeting their sales goals, the regulators said. In addition to the fine from the consumer protection bureau, Wells paid $35 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and $50 million to the City and County of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles city attorney worked with banking regulators on the case. On Thursday, the bank stressed that the refunds have been relatively small  —   averaging about $25. The bank hired an independent consultant that reviewed tens of millions of accounts from May 2011 through July 2015. The bank said it refunded money to customers if there was even the slightest possibility they were charged improperly because of unauthorized accounts. “As a result of our   methodology, we believe we included accounts that were actually appropriately opened and authorized by a customer,” the bank said in a statement. Even regulators concede that the financial harm to consumers was not large. But the more troubling aspect, they said, was how the behavior reflected a broader culture inside Wells’s retail operations. “Consumers must be able to trust their banks,” said Mike Feuer, the Los Angeles city attorney. “Consumers must never be taken advantage of by their banks. ” Stock of Wells Fargo, which is the largest bank in the country by market capitalization but   by assets, rose 13 cents on Thursday, to $49. 90 a share.",0
6809,Comment on New breed of crisis actors: Fake political protesters by Clinton Election Cheating: Will Trump Muster The Courage To Catcall Democrat Disqualification? – moralmatters.org,"Posted on April 4, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 34 Comments 
Americans didn’t know about a curious species of fakery called Crisis Actors until the Dec. 14, 2012 Sandy Hook false-flag shooting massacre. (See “ Remarkable resemblance of Sandy Hook victims and professional crisis actors “) 
Located in Denver, Colorado, a business that calls itself VisionBox Crisis Actors provides professionals (“trained players and actors”) who impersonate real-life people in simulations of mass casualty events, such as government drills, shootings and bombings, to help “schools and first responders create realistic drills, full-scale exercises, high-fidelity simulations, and interactive 3D films.” As an Oct. 31, 2012 feature story on the Crisis Actors website which I found on January 1, 2013, once boasted: 
A new group of actors is now available nationwide for active shooter drills and mall shooting full-scale exercises, announced Visionbox, Denver’s leading professional actors studio. 
Visionbox Crisis Actors are trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places. 
The actors’ stage acting experience , ranging from Shakespeare to contemporary American theater, enables them to “stay in character” throughout an exercise, and improvise scenes of extreme stress while strictly following official exercise scenarios. […] 
Visionbox Crisis Actors can also play the role of citizens calling 911 or mall management, or posting comments on social media websites. 
For more, see my post “ Professional crisis actors simulate mass casualty events “. 
Curiously, since the phenomenon of crisis actors was uncovered after the Sandy Hook false-flag, crisis actors seem to have gone underground. VisionBox revised its website, removing any mention of crisis actors. But this video that was uploaded to YouTube on Dec. 23, 2012, says the same things about VisionBox which I had reported: 
Professor James Tracy also recently discovered that Crisisactors.org , the website established to represent the collaboration between the Visionbox professional actors studio and FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute , went dormant after August 2014. (See “ Where Have All the Crisis Actors Gone? “) 
To add to the insanity, there are even amputee crisis actors, such as those from a business called Amputees in Action , which provides “trained professional amputee actors” who promise to “remain in character”“for the film and screen industries and for emergency and military services training simulations” with “special effects (SFX) make-up, moulage and prosthetic artists use cutting edge technology to enhance and extend the appearance and function of limb-loss scenarios.” (For more, see my post “ Did you know there are AMPUTEE crisis actors? “) 
Alleged victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Jeff Bauman, is an example of an amputee crisis actor. See the reasons why in “ Hollywood producer Nathan Folks says Boston Bombing’s a false flag ”. 
Now add fake political protests and protesters to the things that crisis actors do. 
Jamie Taete reports for Vice , Aug. 6, 2013, that Crowds on Demand is a company that will organize a crowd for you, on demand. The crowd can be fake fans for some celebrity or aspiring celebrity, or fake protesters for a cause. 
Since the company’s fake fan events are “super secret,” Taete attended instead “a fake protest” called “Purge Day USA” (to purge mental health problems) which the company organized in Los Angeles “in coordination with a charity” to “raise awareness about mental health issues”. Here’s a photo of the fake protesters: 
Crowds on Demand’s founder and CEO Adam Swart said that there were about 20 protesters at the fake protest and all of them were “provided by me”. The fake protesters were paid $15 an hour. Swart charges “a couple thousand dollars” to organize a fake protest with about 20 actors, but he gives discounts to charities. 
To critics who say Crowds on Demand is unethical, Swart , who is only 24 years old , openly and brazenly admits: “Is it misleading? Yes. That’s the idea.” 
A more recent example of fake protesters is an ad on Craig’s List soliciting actors to impersonate protesters at Trump rallies. 
As reported by ZeroHedge on March 30, 2016, the ad was placed by “I’m feelin’ the Bern” Bernie Sanders supporters who promise to provide shuttle buses, parking, and protest signs, as well as $15/hour to the actors. Here’s a screenshot of the Craig’s List ad: 
The above ad has since been removed by its author , but the Daily Caller points out the ad is part of a recurring pattern of anti-Trump Craigslist ads soliciting and paying people to protest at Trump rallies. But Daily Caller claims that the fake protesters are hired not by Sanders, but by Hillary Clinton’s people, and paid for by the usual suspects George Soros, MoveOn.org, and Progressive Auto Insurance ‘s Jonathan Lewis : 
The Establishment on both the left and the right, who want to disenfranchise the millions of Republican voters who support Donald Trump, have blamed the staged riots near Trump rallies on Trump or on Bernie Sanders. That’s like blaming the Russians for the Reichstag Fire. Bernie has little to do with these manufactured protests. This is a Clinton operation, a faux protest. 
False flag operations have long been common in politics, but these riots are poisonous to the electorate, intentionally designed to turn violent and stifle free speech. 
This free speech-busting goon squad operation is directed by supporters of Hillary Clinton. It is paid for mostly by George Soros and MoveOn.org and pushed by David Brock at Media Matters for America. It’s also funded by reclusive billionaire Jonathan Lewis, who was identified by the Miami New Times as a “mystery man.” He inherited roughly a billion dollars from his father Peter Lewis (founder of Progressive Insurance Company). 
A march and demonstration against Trump at Trump Tower essentially fizzled Saturday when only 500 “protesters” of the promised 5000 showed up. Infiltrating the crowd, I learned most were from MoveOn or the Occupy movement. Soap was definitely in short supply in this crowd. Several admitted answering a Craig’s list ad paying $16.00 an hour for protesters. 
Hillary understands that Trump would lose the votes of certain establishment Republicans if he were the nominee. On the other hand, it doesn’t matter, because of his crossover outreach. In Michigan, Democrats and independents who have lost their jobs because of disastrous globalist trade deals like NAFTA are lining up to vote for Donald. 
And so, when you see an anti-Trump protest or another mass shooting, don’t believe your eyes. The “protesters” and “victims”— including amputees! — you see may just be acting.

6810,"Prerequisite for Key White House Posts: Loyalty, Not Experience - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s point man on   negotiations is a longtime Trump Organization lawyer with no government or diplomatic experience. His liaison to   leaders is a former   villain with a penchant for résumé inflation. And his Oval Office gatekeeper is a   former New York City cop best known for smacking a protester on the head. Every president sweeps into office with a coterie of friends and   who sometimes have minimal experience in the arcana of the federal government. But few have arrived with a contingent more colorful and controversial than that of Mr. Trump, whose White House is peppered with assistants and advisers whose principal qualification is their long friendship with Mr. Trump and his family. There is Jason Greenblatt, the former Trump Organization lawyer, whose portfolio now includes peace in the West Bank, international trade deals and relations with Cuba. Omarosa Manigault, whose star turn on “The Apprentice” propelled the show’s breakout first season, is now among about two dozen aides with the rank of assistant to the president  —   and one of the few with   privileges for the Oval Office. Most other staff members must go through Keith Schiller, who rose from   security guard at the Trump Organization to its director of security. Mr. Schiller is now the director of Oval Office operations, controlling physical access to a president whose whims and frustrations routinely send aides throughout the building scurrying to deflect, defend and justify. The influence of longtime Trump friends and associates  —   some of them with vague portfolios  —   comes as a leadership void has been created by the Trump administration’s slow pace in filling top jobs in many agencies. It has also added to the confusion of a West Wing already legendary for its power struggles, while bewildering Washington policy hands. “Titles do matter,” said Paul C. Light, a presidential scholar at New York University. “You don’t say: ‘You are my buddy you are my friend you were with me on my television show. I’m going to give you a really great title.’ These are not things to be handed out like candy. ” To help him wrangle Silicon Valley chief executives and modernize United States government technology systems, Mr. Trump has hired Reed Cordish, the scion of a Baltimore real estate dynasty who is married to a close college friend of Ivanka Trump, who set them up. In a statement, Mr. Cordish said his real estate experience had taught him how to successfully meld public and private interests. The president also recently hired Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a Trump family friend, to work in the White House Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mr. Giuliani, 31, who made headlines after he sued Duke University for kicking him off the college golf team, previously worked in sales and marketing at a small suburban New York financial firm. Personal relationships with the president often bestow a power exceeding official West Wing job titles. Valerie Jarrett, a businesswoman, former city official in Chicago and longtime friend of the Obamas, was renowned for her unmatched access to President Barack Obama and reach into policy matters far beyond her official portfolio. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House press spokeswoman, said Mr. Trump had recruited highly skilled advisers with refreshingly different backgrounds. “Even though some of the staff doesn’t have government experience it doesn’t mean they are amateurs,” she wrote in an email. “President Trump has promised to change Washington and you can’t do that by putting Washington bureaucrats in charge of everything. ” If Mr. Trump appears more eager than past presidents to bring in longtime associates with limited Washington experience, friends said, it stems partly from his background of four decades at the helm of a closely held family business, with no experience in public service. He has had to assemble a White House team largely from scratch, tapping a party apparatus he believed had tried to deny him the nomination and a Republican policy elite that had largely opposed him. The bulk of his senior White House aides were unknown to him until two years ago. ”Trump doesn’t have a longtime staff of political aides these loyalists fill that vacuum,” said Christopher Ruddy, a friend and chief executive of Newsmax Media, the conservative news site. “He is figuring out who he can depend on. ” Mr. Schiller, 58, a    former narcotics detective, has protected Mr. Trump for 18 years. The head of a Praetorian Guard of private security detectives, Mr. Schiller occupied a Trump Tower office on the same floor as his boss and learned, he said, to anticipate his wishes. A fierce protector of Mr. Trump’s image and interests, he physically removed a reporter from a 2015 news conference on the campaign trail after he repeatedly questioned Mr. Trump without being called on. Five activists later sued Mr. Schiller, the Trump Organization and other Trump security guards, claiming they had been assaulted during a protest outside Trump Tower in September 2015. Mr. Schiller has acknowledged hitting one man but said the man attacked him first. No longer responsible for Mr. Trump’s physical safety, he is now a combination gatekeeper, valet and security blanket  —   a familiar face for a president who detests solitude and whose wife and youngest son have remained at Trump Tower. But Mr. Schiller has not entirely shed his role as Mr. Trump’s enforcer. During a briefing on health care legislation on Friday, he shouted at reporters to clear out of the Roosevelt Room after they tried to question Mr. Trump about continuing controversies. Mr. Greenblatt’s ties to Mr. Trump have translated into more striking levels of power and prestige. A lawyer who helped Mr. Trump negotiate business deals for two decades, Mr. Greenblatt rose to become the Trump Organization’s chief legal officer and executive vice president. Now, as special representative for international negotiations for the White House, Mr. Greenblatt, 49, is charged with negotiating trade agreements and overseeing the   conflict and United   relations. Mr. Trump has called him “brilliant. ” But experts say it is hard to imagine how anyone, no matter how intelligent, could handle three such sensitive and complex assignments without previous experience. “Our sense is that the Trump White House views the foreign policy establishment as pretty feckless. They seem to think that applying a business approach can work better,” said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution, who was President Obama’s special envoy to the Middle East. “Not to have experience or knowledge of the issues in dispute, nor any relationship with the Palestinians, will be a challenge,” he said. In announcing his appointment, Mr. Trump said Mr. Greenblatt’s success in negotiating complex transactions and building consensus made him the ideal roving global negotiator. Mr. Greenblatt has told reporters that after so many years at Mr. Trump’s side, “I know how he thinks I know how to get his bidding done. ” In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Greenblatt suggested calling back later when “I’ll have something to actually say that’s meaningful. ” Through the press office, he addressed the trade aspect of his portfolio, saying that working with Mr. Trump taught him how government can impede job creation. Still, C. Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a member of the president’s Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, said he had never known a White House official “outside of the trade policy network who has been assigned negotiation of trade issues. ” By law, the Office of the United States Trade Representative is charged with negotiating trade deals. Various   secretaries also weigh in on policy. “So what would that leave for this guy?” Mr. Bergsten asked. “It’s very mysterious. ” A sign of Mr. Greenblatt’s expansive role came last month, not long after he traveled to Capitol Hill with Peter Navarro  —   a   economist who is head of Mr. Trump’s newly created National Trade Council  —   to discuss trade policy with staff aides of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Greenblatt missed a   session with senators because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was visiting the White House that day. “He’s got to negotiate Middle East peace,” Mr. Navarro quipped to the senators, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “So he can’t be here today. ” Although Mr. Greenblatt has not been given the title of special envoy to the Middle East, he appears to be acting in that role too. Visiting the region this week, he met Mr. Netanyahu in Israel on Monday and is scheduled to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. A State Department spokesman said Monday that a senior National Security Council official was accompanying Mr. Greenblatt, but was unsure whether a State Department official had been included. Mr. Greenblatt appears more independent of the State Department than at least some previous envoys he has told others he reports not to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but to the president’s    Jared Kushner, 36, one of the most senior White House advisers. And where past envoys were foreign policy specialists, Mr. Greenblatt told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in April that his main sources of information were daily email alerts, material supplied by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and a weekly Jewish radio program. “There’s just a tremendous amount of literature out there, emails and all that, so I read all of those as often as I can,” he said then. Still, Mr. Greenblatt seemed at that point somewhat taken aback that Mr. Trump had identified him to the news agency as his principal adviser on Israel, telling reporters that Mr. Greenblatt was so passionate that “when he goes on vacation, he goes to Israel. ” “I knew that he was relying on me for certain aspects of Israel, but I didn’t know I was his top adviser,” he said. Ms. Manigault, 43, has no policy experience, a spotty history in her previous federal positions and a résumé that has cast her  —   inaccurately  —   as a university professor and a former top aide to Vice President Al Gore. Yet, to the consternation of the president’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and others, Mr. Trump has given her the same title of presidential assistant as Mr. Priebus and other senior aides  —   and regularly includes her in   strategy sessions on the budget and other matters. She said in a January interview in Variety that Mr. Trump “really wanted me to have the freedom to work on many different things. ” In a statement from the White House press office, Ms. Manigault said that “while some people try to tear me down,” she was focused on giving women, minorities and other groups a voice in the White House. Nominally, Ms. Manigault directs the office of communications in the White House’s public liaison office, a midlevel post. She is also a bridge to   groups, including the heads of more than 60 historically black colleges and universities who met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last month. She also joined a State Department delegation to the inauguration of Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse. She said Mr. Moïse had invited her because of her previous hurricane relief work in the country. “She is the     in the White House, and she has the ear of the president,” said Paris Dennard, a White House director of   outreach under President George W. Bush. “That is a good thing. ” During the presidential campaign, Ms. Manigault cast herself as an insider, saying Mr. Trump has called her “his Valerie Jarrett. ” In an interview published last June in Essence magazine, she said, “I’m the person who pulls him back when he goes too far. ” In her White House post, she has already had a few   reminiscent of her     role on “The Apprentice,” including a much publicized confrontation with a veteran White House reporter. (Mr. Trump also sponsored a   dating show called “The Ultimate Merger” in which she starred.) Ms. Manigault has told others that she earned her way to a White House position. She grew up on welfare in a housing project in Youngstown, Ohio, and lost her father to violence at age 7, but went on to earn a college degree and, at age 24, a job in the office of Vice President Al Gore. But while her ascent is impressive, it is not quite as she has described it. On a 2005 résumé provided by a former employer, she described herself as Mr. Gore’s “senior scheduling and advance coordinator” overseeing all aspects of his schedule. She continues to maintain that description is accurate and that she succeeded at the job. But numerous former staff members in that office said that she was pushed out of an   $   job replying to invitations to Mr. Gore after 13 months, leaving a pile of unanswered correspondence under her desk. “She was the worst hire we ever made,” said Mary Margaret Overbey, Mr. Gore’s former office administrator. Ms. Manigault transferred to a job as deputy associate director of presidential personnel, then eight months later moved to the Commerce Department. In her statement, she said she performed well in that job. But Cheryl Shavers, then the agency’s under secretary for technology administration, disagreed, saying Ms. Manigault “was unqualified and disruptive,” so “I had her removed. ” On her official website and elsewhere,  Ms. Manigault also has identified herself as a professor at Howard University in Washington. But Anthony D. Owens, a university spokesman, said she actually was a “facilitator and presenter. ” A letter from the university that Ms. Manigault provided states that she was an instructor, a temporary position. Ms. Manigault also maintains that the only requirement left for her to complete a doctorate at Howard is to defend her dissertation. But Carolyn M. Byerly, chairwoman of the university’s communications department, said that according to the university’s rules, the   period for her to do that expired more than a decade ago. Ms. Manigault tweeted her support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2014, but when Mr. Trump decided to run for president she joined his campaign and defended him vigorously. At an   victory party in November, she gave a television interview during which she warned that Mr. Trump’s campaign was keeping an “enemies” list. Her “Apprentice”  pugnacity notwithstanding, Mr. Trump insists there is a side of her that she keeps well hidden. “Omarosa’s actually a very nice person,” he joked at a Roosevelt Room breakfast that she helped organize last month to celebrate Black History Month. “Nobody knows that. ”",0
6811,"American Tourist Can’t Get Over Dirty, Decaying & Dangerous Charm Of Dublin City","0 Add Comment 
A VISITING American tourist has heralded the charm of Dublin, particularly the areas which seem to be boarded up, in disrepair and completely neglected, WWN can confirm. 
“I tried one of your pints of the black stuff in the Guinness storehouse and was struck by how you don’t seem to give a shit about the bits of the city I’m not supposed to visit,” Gary Mackey, a Boston native shared when talking to WWN. 
Sticking to the designated ‘tourist zones’ of the city on the first day of his trip, Mr. Mackey was struck by the city’s vibrancy and understated charm but spoke warmly of the lesser spotted parts of the city. 
“I like how you guys just let buildings decay, it’s a great look, so quaint. And don’t get me started on that adorable thing you do, pretending people living in squalor openly on the streets and down lanes just don’t exist,” Mr. Mackey added, full of effusive praise. 
As dictated by the ‘America is better than us’ provision in the constitution, the Irish media are obligated to report en masse when an American is praising Ireland in any shape or form, which has resulted in huge coverage of Mr. Mackey’s thoughts on the unique charm of Dublin city’s degradation and poverty. However, there is no obligation to mention the fact Mr. Mackey has been robbed three times during his visit. 
Tourism Ireland has yet to confirm if they will fine the American for straying outside the designated tourist zones. Each street thought to contain anything unpalatable which approaches conveying the reality of Dublin in 2016 is marked by a no tourist sign which consists of a large X through an image of an overweight American clutching money. 
“We have no idea what Mr. Mackey is talking about, has he visited the Leprechaun Museum yet?” A Dublin tourism spokesperson confirmed.",0
6812,Corruption Scandals With Brazilian Roots Cascade Across Latin America - The New York Times,"LIMA, Peru  —   A former Peruvian president is a fugitive, charged with taking bribes. In Colombia, prosecutors say its president’s   campaign accepted dirty money. And intelligence agents in Venezuela arrested journalists and researchers looking into scandals there. Latin America’s biggest corruption scandal is shaking the continent’s political establishment. It can all be traced back to Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction company, which has built major projects throughout the region and late last year settled with the United States, Brazil and Switzerland for up to $4. 5 billion under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for an elaborate bribe scheme involving $800 million in payoffs in exchange for lucrative contracts. It was the largest anticorruption settlement in history. Prosecutors said the company paid bribes on 100 projects in more than a dozen countries, from Mexico to Angola, in one case buying a local bank branch to hide the transactions, and even opening a division specifically dedicated to payoffs. Throughout Latin America, the company built bridges, dams, power plants, roads and stretches of a highway to link Brazil and Peru that went more than four times over budget. Nearly three years of investigations have resulted in 77 Brazilian Odebrecht executives signing plea deals, and the company’s former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, is in prison. Now the charges are cascading across the region. “Once you start opening these cases, it’s a Pandora’s box  —   it could go on for years,” said Shannon K. O’Neil, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. Yet she called it a positive development for the region, showing “the anticorruption movement in Latin America is gaining ground. ” Perhaps the most spectacular case so far involves Alejandro Toledo, the president of Peru from 2001 to 2006, and a wanted man since a judge issued an arrest warrant last week on charges that he had accepted up to $35 million in bribes. Mr. Toledo’s whereabouts was unknown, and Peruvians have been captivated. On Sunday night, he surfaced on Twitter, where he posted a statement attesting to his innocence and denied that he was hiding out. “I never fled from anything. When I left Peru, there were no Odebrecht charges against me, but they call me a ‘fugitive,’ ” he wrote, saying nothing of his location. The current Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has asked President Trump to extradite Mr. Toledo should he be found in the United States. In Lima, the capital, the legacy of Odebrecht is hard to miss. A statue of Christ with arms outspread that overlooks the city’s coast was donated by the company. But Odebrecht has also reaped the benefits of its connections to the country. The Interoceanic Highway, for example, begun under Mr. Toledo’s administration, cost $4. 5 billion, four times over budget. The overruns were approved by an official who is also under investigation by prosecutors. Under Ollanta Humala, Mr. Kuczynski’s predecessor, Odebrecht began a   $7 billion natural gas pipeline to connect the Amazon to the coast by cutting through the Andes Mountains. Another former president, Alan García, oversaw the bidding for a subway line in Lima, which Odebrecht won and constructed. If Mr. Toledo is apprehended and convicted, he would be the second Peruvian president behind bars, after Alberto K. Fujimori, the country’s former dictator, who was convicted of human rights abuses. “For Peru, like any other country, even the possibility of having two presidents as prisoners is an embarrassment,” Marisol Pérez Tello, the country’s justice minister, said in an interview. But she added, “I think this is an important moment to think about our ability to institutionalize the fight against corruption. ” Farther north, in Colombia, leaders were on the defensive as prosecutors said they had evidence that Odebrecht had donated $1 million to President Juan Manuel Santos’s   campaign in 2014. Speaking to reporters last week, the country’s attorney general said a former lawmaker, Otto Bula, had funneled Odebrecht money through an intermediary to the campaign. Mr. Bula is currently under arrest on charges of having paid about $4. 6 million in bribes for various projects in Colombia, including a road linking the country’s interior to the Magdalena River and Caribbean highway known as the Ruta del Sol. Mr. Santos had said he did not do anything wrong and is interested in a full investigation of the case. Roberto Prieto, Mr. Santos’s campaign manager, said in a statement last week he had not met Mr. Bula, “not even for a coffee. ” Investigators are also looking into dealings involving other politicians’ campaigns, including Oscar Iván Zuluaga, a   candidate for president in the 2014 election. Ivan Garzón, a political scientist at Colombia’s University of La Sabana, said Odebrecht had shown how easy it was to hijack the country’s elections for its own gain. “It shows that the problems of exorbitant campaign costs, ones so high the candidates are ready to make a pact with the devil,” he said. In Venezuela, the authorities seem to be taking a different tack toward the revelations: cracking down on outsiders trying to investigate them. Hugo Chávez, the former president of Venezuela, was one of Odebrecht’s principal patrons, steering $11 billion toward Odebrecht for infrastructure projects, including public housing, that undergirded his   revolution. But many of the projects, from bridges to agricultural buildings, were never finished. On Saturday, two researchers from Transparency International and two Brazilian journalists were arrested by Venezuelan intelligence agents while looking into an unfinished bridge Odebrecht was meant to construct over Lake Maracaibo, one of the company’s biggest projects. Jesús Urbina, one of the researchers, said they were questioned but not harmed. The Brazilian journalists were later deported.

6814,Judicial Watch: House Republicans ‘Trying to Destroy’ Office of Congressional Ethics - Breitbart,"Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton is thundering against the House Republican effort to dismantle the Office of Congressional Ethics. [In a strongly worded statement, Fitton says: “It is shameful that House Republicans are trying to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics, the most significant ethics reform in Congress when it was established nearly a decade ago. ”  Judicial Watch focuses on the transparency, accountability and integrity in government and politics and remained a thorn in the side of the Obama administration, the Clintons, and Democrats for many years. “This   effort to eliminate the Office of Congressional Ethics, which provides appropriate independence and transparency to the House ethics process, is a poor way for the Republican majority to begin ‘draining the swamp,’” Fitton says. Although the office was created under then Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2008, Judicial Watch worked with her to create an investigative body with independent power. “The American people will see this latest push to undermine congressional ethics enforcement as shady and corrupt,” Fitton said. “The full House should seriously consider whether it wants to bear the brunt of public outrage and go through with the rule change this afternoon. ” Although House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy reportedly opposed the rule changes, they allowed the vote to take place.",0
6815,Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh to Be Relocated to Remote Island - The New York Times,"DHAKA, Bangladesh  —   Bangladesh’s government is moving forward with a plan to relocate Rohingya refugees staying in camps near the country’s largest tourist resort towns to a remote island that is underwater for much of the year. A cabinet order on Thursday directed officials to have the refugees transferred to Thengar Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal that is lashed by high tides   and submerged during the monsoon season. The suggestion that they be moved to the largely uninhabitable marshland several hours by boat from the mainland drew criticism from around the world. The relocation plan was last proposed in 2015, but the government quietly suspended it after criticism from international aid groups and rights activists. Its reinstatement follows the arrival of about 65, 000 Rohingya from Myanmar in October and November, after a crackdown by Myanmar’s army and attacks on security forces by Islamic insurgents. The United Nations has called the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group denied citizenship in Myanmar, the world’s most persecuted minority. John McKissick, head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the Bangladeshi city of Cox’s Bazar, near the Burmese border, said in November that Myanmar’s government was trying to achieve an “ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority. ” Since 1992, about 32, 000 registered Rohingya have been living in two United Nations camps near Cox’s Bazar, but estimates of unregistered refugees range from 200, 000 to 500, 000. Many of them live in two sprawling makeshift shelters close to the official camps, while others are scattered across southeast Bangladesh. Talk of forced relocation worries refugees who have lived in the Cox’s Bazar area for more than two decades. “We have been here for a long time,” one of them, Shafiul Mostafa, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday from one of the camps. “We have gotten to know our neighbors, and we can speak the local dialect, which is similar to our language. If we are taken to a new place, it will be very difficult for us. We won’t be able to communicate with anyone. ” The United Nations refugee agency, which runs the camps, criticized the relocation proposal in 2015, calling it “complex and controversial” and saying that departures would have to take place with the migrants’ consent. Now, the return of the plan has taken aid groups by surprise. “U. N. H. C. R. is concerned about this news and seeking details from the authorities,” Shinji Kubo, a representative of the United Nations refugee agency in Bangladesh, said by email. “Any move must be carried out through a consultative and voluntary process, and the feasibility of the proposed site must be assessed. ” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say a recent crackdown in Myanmar indiscriminately targeted the Rohingya, citing satellite imagery showing 1, 500 Rohingya homes burned down and widespread reports of mass killings and rapes. The cabinet in Bangladesh has directed officials to take steps to stop further “illegal entry of Myanmar nationals” and to prevent existing refugees from “mixing in with local populations. ” It also ordered officials to keep all illegal immigrants from Myanmar in designated areas, and to arrest them or push them back into those areas if they tried to leave. The order, which was posted on the cabinet’s website, said the arrival of Rohingya in recent months had raised tensions, created “physical risks” for local people, and caused social and economic problems in Cox’s Bazar. Critics of the relocation say the order has more to do with a desire to develop Cox’s Bazar, home to what the government promotes as the longest beach in the world, into a booming tourism destination to rival others in Asia. “Right now, people here are only building hotels and guesthouses,” said Hayat Khan, an executive at the Ocean Paradise Hotel in Cox’s Bazar. “You go to the beach for half an hour, and then there’s nothing more to do. You need cable cars, and theme parks like the Window of the World in Shenzhen,” he added, referring to a city in southern China. “For that, you will need a lot of investment, and a lot of land. ” Rohingya refugees and their leaders say that they were not consulted about the plan. “If the government wants something, we will have to obey them,” said Mr. Mostafa, the refugee. “At the end of the day, what we want or don’t want is not going to matter to anyone. ”",0
6816,Iraqi Elite Forces Stretched Thin by ISIS Tactics Around Mosul,"Bombings, Surprise Attacks Force 'Golden Division' to Spread Out   
Iraqi officials are never shy about talking up their military successes, and that has been especially true in the Mosul offensive, where they have regularly noted they are far ahead of schedule. The arrival of the first Iraqi troops into the outskirts of Mosul’s city limits was heralded as the start of the “true liberation.” 
Iraq’s most elite fighters, the so-called Golden Division, has talked up their high morale, bragging that ISIS forces seem to be in full retreat as soon as they see them. That may, however, be the plan for ISIS, with reports that the fast advances and staggered pockets of resistance are stretching the forces thin . 
ISIS is letting the Golden Division advance rapidly in some areas, and slowing their progress with IEDs and suicide car bombers in others. In some places, ISIS forces have hidden in tunnels and appeared behind the advancing troops. The Golden Division’s limited numbers have forced them to rely on the national police to hold territory that they have captured. 
This is a familiar strategy for ISIS forces, particularly in Iraq, where previous offensives and counter-offensives have seen them withdrawing from some areas and reinforcing others specifically to widen the front lines, forcing the other side to spread themselves around. 
And while there are a lot more troops attacking Mosul than in most previous cases, the number of actually well-trained, highly disciplined troops is relatively small. Indeed, Iraqi officials are already saying they are counting on local civilians to rise up against ISIS when they arrive, which has happened in some cases, but notably did not happen in other offensives against major cities, where the locals were more concerned with surviving in a warzone than convincing their “liberators” of their loyalty.

6817,John McCain to Donald Trump: 'Don’t You Dare Make Peace with Russia!',"http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/john-mccain-to-donald-trump-dont-you.html Sit down. This is going to shock you. (Not). We reported yesterday on the telephone call between US president-elect Trump and Russian president Putin, where the current and future presidents discussed the need to set aside differences and look to more constructive future relations. With serious observers of this past year's increasing tensions between US and Russia openly worrying about a nuclear war breaking out, with some 300,000 NATO troops placed on Russia's border, with sanctions hurting average businesspersons on both sides, a normal person might look at the slight thaw in Cold War 2.0 as an early positive indicator of the end of the Obama Era.Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) begs to differ.In a blistering statement he released today responding to the Trump/Putin telephone call, Sen. McCain condemned any efforts by President-elect Trump to find common ground with Putin. Any claim by Putin that he wants to improve relations with the US must be vigorously opposed, writes McCain. He explains: ""We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America’s allies, and attempted to undermine America’s elections."" Interesting that Republican McCain has taken to using the Hillary Clinton campaign line (the one that lost her the election) that somehow the Russians were manipulating the US electoral process. The claim was never backed up by facts and Hillary's claim that some 17 US intelligence agencies agreed with her was shown to be a dangerous and foolish lie.Why is Putin not to be trusted, according to McCain? ""Vladimir Putin has rejoined Bashar Assad in his barbaric war against the Syrian people with the resumption of large-scale Russian air and missile strikes in Idlib and Homs. Another brutal assault on the city of Aleppo could soon follow."" What McCain doesn't say is that unlike US troops in Syria, the Russians are invited by the Syrian government and operate according to international law . Oh yes, and they are also fighting al-Qaeda and ISIS , which has sought to overthrow Assad for the past five years. Maybe McCain is just really sensitive after meeting with al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria? As rumors swirl from Washington about neocons sniffing out top jobs in the incoming administration, it would serve president-elect Trump well to reflect on he true nature of the neocon beast...

6818,Report Accuses Mexico of Crimes Against Humanity in Drug War - The New York Times,"MEXICO CITY  —   Two days after Jorge Antonio Parral Rabadán was kidnapped by a criminal gang, the Mexican Army raided the remote ranch where he was a prisoner and killed him. As he instinctively raised his hands in defense, the soldiers fired over and over at   range. A brief army communiqué about the event asserted that soldiers had returned fire and killed three hit men at the El Puerto ranch on April 26, 2010. But Mr. Parral had fired no weapon. He was a government employee, the supervisor of a bridge crossing into Texas, when he and a customs agent were abducted, according to a 2013 investigation by the National Human Rights Commission. The case, which is still open, has volleyed among prosecutors, yet his parents persist, determined that someone be held accountable. “Tell me if this looks like the face of a killer to you,” said Alicia Rabadán Sánchez, Mr. Parral’s mother, pulling a photograph of a happy young man from a plastic folder. In the years since the Mexican government began an intense military campaign against drug gangs, many stories like Mr. Parral’s have surfaced  —   accounts of people caught at the intersection of organized crime, security forces and a failing justice system. They are killed at military checkpoints, vanish inside navy facilities or are tortured by federal police officers. Seldom are their cases investigated. A trial and conviction are even more rare. But are these cases just regrettable accidents in the course of a   government battle against drug violence? A new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative, which works on criminal justice reforms around the world, argues that they are not. Instead, the study says, they point to a pattern of indiscriminate force and impunity that is an integral part of the state’s policy. And in the framework of international law, the study argues, the killings, forced disappearances and torture constitute crimes against humanity. The evidence is “overwhelming,” said James A. Goldston, the executive director of the New   Justice Initiative, which will release the report on Tuesday. “In case after case, army actors and federal police have been implicated. ” But in all but a few cases, the allegations languish, are dismissed or are reclassified. “The impunity is a loud signal that crimes against humanity are being committed,” Mr. Goldston said. The Justice Initiative report is the first time an international group has made a public legal argument that the pattern of abuses amounts to crimes against humanity. The finding is significant, Mr. Goldston said, because under the lens of international law, an investigation would seek to determine the chain of command behind the policy. The government of President Enrique Peña Nieto rejected the conclusions. “Based on international law, crimes against humanity are generalized or systematic attacks against a civilian population which are committed in accordance with a state policy,” the government said in a statement. “In Mexico the immense majority of violent crimes have been committed by criminal organizations. ” The report does not dispute that last point. Its analysis, which covers the   administration of former President Felipe Calderón and the first three years of Mr. Peña Nieto’s government, also looks at the Zetas, the most violent of Mexico’s drug gangs. Their brutal actions constitute crimes against humanity as well, the report concludes. The government said that in the “exceptional cases” in which public officials have been shown to be involved in the use of excessive force, human rights abuses or torture, they have been tried and sentenced. But human rights and international organizations have argued for years that these cases are not exceptional. Rather than ask the International Criminal Court to begin an investigation, the Justice Initiative proposes that the crimes be investigated at home. “One of the things that we have learned is that Mexico is rich in financial resources and human capital in these issues,” Mr. Goldston said. The Justice Initiative has been working in Mexico for more than a decade. But the investigations “simply haven’t happened because in our view the political will is not there,” Mr. Goldston said. The report “explains how we have reached this state of impunity,” said José Antonio Guevara, the director of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights. The government’s “understanding at the highest level is that what they’re doing is the right thing to weaken organized crime,” he said. The commission was one of five Mexican groups that helped prepare the Justice Initiative report. To break that impunity, the report proposes that Mexico accept international help from outside prosecutors with the authority to investigate and prosecute atrocities and corruption cases. Mexico’s human rights crisis has commanded international attention since 43 students from a local teachers’ college were abducted by local police officers working with a drug gang in the southern city of Iguala in September 2014 as the federal police and military stood by. “The impunity in Mexico and the circuits of corruption are such that they generate pacts so solid that international intervention is needed,” said Santiago Aguirre, the deputy director of the Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez Center for Human Rights. One model for what the report suggests is in neighboring Guatemala, where independent prosecutors uncovered a customs fraud scheme that brought down the president last year. The Mexican government rejected the idea. “Our country has the capacity and the will to meet human rights challenges,” it said. The government pointed to the drop in complaints to the National Human Rights Commission, to 538 last year from 1, 450 in 2012. It also described recent changes designed to reduce abuses, including proposed laws and protocols to prevent torture and investigate disappearances. A new law for victims is in effect, and this month courts will begin to switch from written to oral trials. Critics are skeptical that the changes will make much of a difference unless they are carried out effectively. As long as prosecutors in Mexico remain subject to political power, said Mr. Aguirre, the impunity will continue. “What’s the incentive for a prosecutor to be independent? None,” he said. Without real investigations, there are thousands of parents like the Parrals, who trudge from one government office to another in search of answers. It was only through a case file number that appeared on an army document 10 months after their son disappeared that they found his body. Tucked into the archives at the state prosecutor’s office was their son’s government ID, which had been found at the ranch. But his body had been tossed into a common grave. An army investigation dismissed the case, and it languished with federal prosecutors before it was turned back to state prosecutors. “We think the army is hiding something to protect the commanding officers from the atrocities they carry out,” said Mr. Parral’s father, Jorge Parral Gutiérrez. “We can see that the prosecutors are not free to act. ” “The message is that the army   …   ” began Mr. Parral. His wife finished the sentence: “   …     has obstructed justice in every way. ”",0

6820,"Attack in Nice, France, Represents Terrorism’s New Reality - The New York Times","For all the years of worry that terrorists would develop more sophisticated methods, Thursday’s attack in Nice realized a fear that turned out to be far worse: a form of violence so crude that it renders many of our usual defenses useless. The attacker, in ramming a plain white truck through crowds of holiday revelers, killed 84 people and remade an everyday vehicle, a familiar sight on streets around the world, into an object of menace and fear. No group has claimed the attack. The attacker’s motivation remains unknown, as do questions of whether he acted alone. And yet this act, whatever its particulars, represents the culmination of   trends, in which terror tactics become more rudimentary and the targets more random. It is forcing a recognition that security and intelligence measures, long the core of Western thinking, are of limited utility and can never provide total safety from an individual who decides to kill. This is shifting pressure onto more abstract and unproven counterterrorism methods that do not promise to halt violence but merely ameliorate underlying political or social drivers. And it is straining the politics of Western countries, where leaders have spent the past 15 years describing terrorism as a war that could be won. The populations targeted by terrorism are confronting a difficult new reality, in which the danger can be managed or policed but perhaps never entirely overcome. The attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, established a narrative that has shaped Western thinking on terrorism ever since, even as many analysts consider that view obsolete. The enemy, whether Al Qaeda or some other group, became seen as a cohesive group that operated from far away. That enemy coordinated complex,   assaults against a subset of targets that, while civilian, held symbolic or political value. Governments could anticipate and defend the targets, monitor or disrupt the groups, and ultimately defeat them by targeting their leaders and seizing their territory. But the threat has evolved into something much harder to counter. Insurgent groups in   Iraq, unable to defeat the   occupation force, instead targeted Iraqi civilians wherever they gathered, establishing a method that terror groups now deploy internationally. In 2008, Pakistani militants killed 166 people in Mumbai, India, attacking what experts call “soft” targets: places such as hotels and train stations that are populated but, because of their seeming randomness, rarely defended. At security conferences in Western capitals, officials and analysts began to worry about whether they could prevent a “  attack” in their own countries. Then came the rise of “lone wolf” attackers who acted on their own, without training from or often even contact with the terrorist groups they claimed to serve. Attacks are planned within the minds of individuals whose intentions remain hidden until the shooting begins. Such attacks predate the Islamic State, though the group emphasizes them, disseminating propaganda that provides tactical guidance and ideological justification available to anyone with an internet connection. The use of a truck in Nice was new only in the specifics and in the degree to which it has forced a realization increasingly difficult to ignore: In the world of lone wolves and   attacks, more barricades and metal detectors and monitoring programs can improve security, but can’t guarantee it absolutely. As terrorism itself becomes harder to prevent or defend against, policy experts say that governments should instead address two deeper but murkier problems: the ideology that calls for such violence and, even harder, the social and political factors that drive an individual to accept that ideology. But how do you defeat an ideology? Destroying the Islamic State’s   “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria, some argue, would undercut its grandiose claims and dampen its appeal. It would also limit the group’s ability to coordinate   attacks, which in turn help inspire lone actors who may, or may not, be driven by ideology. Still, even as the group loses territory, its propaganda would survive online. And the problems that contributed to that ideology’s rise in the Middle East would remain: authoritarian states that often use violence themselves, religious institutions often seen as complicit, stifled economies that grant young people few opportunities, and a cycle of conflict that encourages tribalism and extremism. This is why many analysts are urging Western governments to look at their own populations and ask not whether terrorist ideologies can be eradicated, but why individual citizens might become susceptible to messages telling them to kill on behalf of a foreign terrorist group. “It’s a social and political problem,” said Peter Neumann, a professor at King’s College London and the director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization. Mr. Neumann said that, increasingly, Western citizens who turn to terrorism “are not deeply ideological or even religious.” Rather, such individuals often seem to come to terrorism as a way to bring meaning to their lives or to explain their own sense of helplessness or isolation. Muslim or migrant populations have struggled to integrate into Western European countries, often left feeling excluded from national identities that stress secularism and are rooted in specifically European heritage. “Ghettoization, polarization, and alienation in a country like France are profound,” Mr. Neumann said. “Bottom line is: it’s about feeling like you belong. ” Western governments have tried to address this by providing greater welfare programs to disadvantaged communities or, often, by more forcefully policing them. But these, Mr. Neumann said, risk deepening the polarization between communities, which can be bridged only by building an “inclusive sense of national identity. ” European societies have resisted this, instead giving rise to   politics that emphasize ethnic and religious heritage. “I think this will be with us for a long time, sadly,” he said. Since Sept. 20, 2001, the day that President George W. Bush declared a “war on terror,” Western leaders have used the terminology of war both to explain the threat and to articulate their response. “It is a war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam,“ Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, said after a terrorist attack in the Paris area in January 2015. A decade and a half of war has not delivered Western populations to safety, highlighting the gap between rhetoric and reality. But politicians have been constrained by this language, unable to acknowledge that, while war is a struggle that pulls a nation together and can eventually be won, the realities of terrorism can only be managed and the threats, at some point, merely endured. But political leaders, compelled to promise an answer to this week’s violence in Nice, returned to the familiar formulations. “We have an enemy that will continue to strike all people, all countries that have liberties as essential values,” France’s president, François Hollande, said. Hillary Clinton told CNN on Thursday that “we are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent. ” Though she urged enhanced intelligence gathering to combat terrorism, she has previously called for more aggressive use of force against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Donald J. Trump, in an interview with Fox News, said he would ask Congress to declare war on terrorism. While this framing might reassure, it raises a question: Why does the war never feel as if it is approaching victory? This question’s unanswerability perhaps contributes to the fear that is increasingly destabilizing Western politics. And it creates space for   populists, rising throughout Europe, to present more aggressive policies as the answer. “Nothing that we have proposed has been put in place,” Marine Le Pen, who leads the   National Front party, told the French newspaper Le Figaro, calling for measures to revoke citizens’ nationality, close certain mosques and ban organizations. Mr. Valls, the French prime minister, perhaps sought to break this cycle on Friday when he said, “The times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism. ”",0

6822,A Long History of Heart Healing,"October 27, 2016 
By Dr. Mercola 
A dense bush bearing tiny red berries, hawthorn bushes are common in wooded areas and fence rows across the U.S. and throughout the world. Many parts of the hawthorn (with the botanical name Crataegus), including its berries and flowers, have been used by traditional healers for centuries. 
Resembling tiny sweet cherries, hawthorn berry “haws” have been used to make wine, jelly and flavored brandy for years, but not many people are aware of the impressive ways it remedies heart problems and many other physical ailments as well. 
Increasingly, modern studies are pointing to the hawthorn plant as a valuable therapy for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states is the most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. In fact, more than 2.6 million people died of it in 2015. 1 Pharmacognosy Review reported: 
”Results recorded from clinical trials, experiences of professionally qualified medical herbalists and the low/negligible incidence of side effects experienced by patients would indicate that Crataegus preparations hold significant potential as a useful remedy in the treatment of CVD.” 2 
More About the Hawthorn Plant 
The hawthorn berry bush belongs to the same family of plants as apples and roses, so it’s fitting that the fruit is usually brilliant red. Like roses on steroids, the berries are accompanied by long, woody thorns that can do a lot of damage if you’re not cautious. 
One reason hawthorns are so common is because they send up suckers, so they get larger and denser as they age. Varieties crossbreed easily. They often grow into hedges as high as 25 feet, bearing small white, pink or red flowers with rose-like petals. 
As a food, it was at one time known as the “bread and cheese tree” because the flowers, berries, and leaves are all safe to eat, so it was a lifesaver during famines. 3 
Also known as mayblossom, hedge thorn, maybush, mayflower and whitethorn, there are hundreds of hawthorn species, and each has its own set of valuable healing compounds. Every part of the hawthorn bush was used to make medicines in ancient Greece and Asia: the flowers, berries, leaves, stems and even the bark. 
Commission E, a branch of the German government that studies and approves herbal treatments, has endorsed the use of hawthorn as an herbal treatment. 4 
Hawthorn Berries: A Long History of Heart Healing 
One of the oldest known medicinal plants, hawthorn was first recorded as good for heart health in the first century by Greek herbalist Dioscorides. Later, Swiss physician Paracelsus (1493–1541) recorded similar observations. 5 French physician Henri Leclerc used it to treat heart conditions in the 17th century. In 1901, The British Homeopathic Review revealed that a Dr. Green, from Ennis, Ireland: 
” … For many years had a reputation for the cure of heart disease that caused patients to flock to him from all parts of the United Kingdom. He cured the most of them and amassed considerable wealth by means of his secret. 
For, contrary to the code, he, though a physician in good standing, refused to reveal the remedy to his professional brethren. After his death … (in 1894), his daughter, a Mrs. Graham, revealed the name of the remedy her father had used so successfully. It is Crataegus oxycanthus …” 6 
Subsequently, homeopathic and alternative medical practitioners all over Europe used hawthorn very successfully for heart ailments in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Its use reached the U.S. by 1896, but it reportedly diminished in popularity in the 1930s. 
Modern Uses of Hawthorn 
Today, botanist, research scientist, and author Christopher Hobbs says hawthorn is an official herbal pharmaceutical in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Russia and Switzerland. It’s even an ingredient in 213 commercial European herbal formulas, mostly for the treatment of cardiovascular problems. 7 
Herbalists in England, Eastern Europe, Poland and the U.S., as well, use the leaves and flowers from the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and English hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata), but the entire plant is loaded with valuable phytonutrients. Herbal Supplement Resource notes several active ingredients and how they’re used: 
“Hawthorn contains around 1 [to] 2 [percent] flavonoids, oligomeric proanthocyanidins (1-3%), saponins, phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid), 2-(2-Phenylethyl) chromone derivatives (in the flowers, leaves and buds), amine (phenethylamine, metoksyfenetylamin, dopamine, acetylcholine and tyramine) and triterpenes based on ursolic acid and oleanolic acid. 
Hawthorn is also believed to improve circulation in the arms and legs by reducing resistance in the arteries. This is partly due its ability to inhibit a substance in the body known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). 
ACE is related to the formation of angiotensin II, a substance that has strong astringent effect on the blood vessels.” 8 
Studies and Tests on Hawthorn Constituents 
A study in 2009 reported that when volunteers took 900 milligrams (mg) per day of hawthorn extract for two months, it was as effective as low doses of captropril, a popular heart medication, particularly in improving symptoms of congestive heart failure. 9 
In tests on hawthorn preparations, Pharmacognosy Review identified bioflavonoids and proanthocyanidins as two of their most important compounds due to their powerful antioxidant activity; some had more than others: 
“Of 28 fruit pulps tested, the hawthorn pulp (Chinese hawthorn) produced the highest measure of antioxidant activity. A similarly high antioxidant activity in Crataegus aronia, a hawthorn indigenous to Israel, Jordan and the Palestine, has been found.” 10 
Further, epicatechin and hyperoside in hawthorn extracts were found to be significantly more effective than those of established drugs. Herbal Supplement Resource noted: 
“Several double blind tests have shown that patients with early stages of cardiovascular disorders have increased physical endurance and improved cardiac function (as measured by ECG) after using standardized hawthorn extracts for few weeks.” 11 
In addition, hawthorn may be useful for angina, or chest pain caused by decreased oxygen to your heart muscle. A review in 1983 indicated that hawthorn extract could successfully treat patients suffering from angina. 
Sixty patients were given either 180 mg extract or a placebo every day for three weeks. Those who took hawthorn showed better blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart in their ECGs and could train for longer periods without attacks than those taking the placebo. 12 
Hawthorn Benefits More Than Just Your Heart 
Your heart isn’t the only part of your body to profit from taking hawthorn berry. It’s used as a diuretic, which is commonly needed for symptoms of heart failure. It’s reported to be effective in other areas of your body and for other health complaints as well, including: 
The phytonutrients of the hawthorn plant are the key to the way it helps your heart. It’s particularly valuable in the early stages of heart disease, from improving blood flow to the blood vessels around your heart and brain, to increasing tolerance to the heart muscle due to a lack of oxygen. 
Related physical problems may also be alleviated, such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). In fact, taking hawthorn may offset more serious heart disease and postpone prescriptions for stronger heart medications. 
The Epoch Times suggested that when looking for a hawthorn supplement, you’ll likely get something similar to what researchers found effective in clinical studies with a combination of at least 1.8 percent vitexin and 10 percent procyanidins. Combining Hawthorn With Supplements for Greater Effect 
Hawthorn is sometimes combined with other herbs for heightened effectiveness, according to Herbal Supplement Resource: Using hawthorn supplements with Coenzyme Q10 may curb early stages of heart disease. Hawthorn can be combined with ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) to improve blood circulation so more oxygen is transported to your brain. Used with garlic (Allium sativum) and arnica (Arnica montana) Hawthorn may remedy angina and low blood circulation. An herbal tea of hawthorn is said to calm your nerves and induce sleep, especially when used with lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and St. Johns wort. 
Recommended dosages of hawthorn are typically 160 to 900 milligrams two or three times a day. You can also use it as an herbal tea from 4 to 5 grams of the dried berries or 1 to 2 grams of the dried leaves and flowers. Liquid extracts are also available, with recommended dosages of 20 to 30 drops in a small glass of water. 
As a side note, the effectiveness of hawthorn supplements may be lowered by asthma medications, Viagra, Clonidine (a blood-pressure-lowering drug) and other herbs for your heart. 
The People’s Pharmacy reports that pregnant women should not take hawthorn. 19 Additionally, hawthorn may increase the effects of heart medications such as digitoxin, so it should not be used with herbs containing cardiac glycosides like foxglove and lily of the valley. 20

N. officials suspended all humanitarian convoys in Syria, a day after a deadly aerial attack on a convoy of 31 aid trucks authorized to travel in the   country. “Just when we think it cannot get any worse, the bar of depravity sinks lower,” the United Nations secretary general, Ban   said at the opening of the General Assembly in New York. Syria, Russia and the United States denied responsibility, but the U. S. officials said Russia may have carried out the attack. _____ 2. New details emerged about Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey, including that he was turned in as a terrorist to the F. B. I. two years ago  —   by his father, an Afghan immigrant, above. But officials said that the father had recanted, and that agents did not interview Mr. Rahami himself, who was in jail, accused of stabbing his brother. Friends said Mr. Rahami seemed to change after traveling abroad. He went to Pakistan several times, staying for nearly a year in Quetta, the headquarters of exiled Afghan Taliban leaders as well as generations of Afghans who fled the violence in their country. The woman he married there has been detained. Our reporter retraced his likely path from the train station in Elizabeth, N. J. to the doorway of a bar where he was found sleeping on Monday morning. _____ 3. The bombings came at a critical point for the presidential campaign, pushing national security to the forefront with the first presidential debate a week away and Election Day in just seven weeks. But it’s likely that neither Hillary Clinton’s counterterrorism plan nor Donald Trump’s would have prevented the attacks, and neither addresses the most common trajectory of radicalization in the U. S.: personal demons that morph into ideologically driven violence. At a time when polls are being intensely scrutinized, our statistical expert examines how different pollsters starting with the same data can make very different conclusions. _____ 4. Donald Trump’s campaign once again drew derision from critics, this time for Donald Trump Jr. ’s comparison of Syrian refugees to a bowl of skittles with a scattering of poisoned candies. And Samantha Bee clobbered NBC and her fellow   TV host Jimmy Fallon for a friendly interview with Mr. Trump. “Network execs, and a lot of their audience, can ignore how very dangerous Trump is because to them, he isn’t,” Ms. Bee said. “They’re not going to be deported. ” _____ 5. President Obama, making his final address to the U. N. Nations General Assembly, said that globalization needed to make a “course correction. ” “A world in which 1 percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable,” he said. He also cautioned against insularity, saying, “Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself. ” Here is our full coverage of the General Assembly. _____ 6. Our book reviewer got an advance copy of Bruce Springsteen’s memoir, “Born to Run,” which he compares to one of Mr. Springsteen’s shows: “long, ecstatic, exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys” and “part séance and part keg party. ” And there’s even news: The singer has suffered depressions so deep that he’s turned to the powerful   drug Klonopin. _____ 7. Senator Elizabeth Warren led a bipartisan chorus of censure against John Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, for protecting senior managers’ jobs and his own compensation after revelations that workers had opened millions of unauthorized accounts in customers’ names. She accused him of driving workers “to the breaking point” with aggressive goals of “ ”  —   persuading customers to avail themselves of more bank services. “And when it all blew up,” she said, “you kept your job, you kept your   bonuses. ” _____ 8. Video of the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Okla. has prompted federal and local investigations. The victim, Terence Crutcher, was shot after walking to his vehicle with his hands up. The view from a patrol car’s dashboard camera and a helicopter flying overhead was obstructed in the moments before he was Tasered and then shot. His family held a news conference, calling for charges to be filed against the white officer who shot him, Betty Shelby. _____ 9. We’ve been following the uproar over extrajudicial killings in the Philippines in the weeks since the new president, Rodrigo Duterte, inaugurated a war on drugs. One of Mr. Duterte’s most outspoken critics, Senator Leila de Lima, above, was just stripped of her post as head of a panel investigating the hundreds of killings and put under investigation over allegations that she had received payoffs from drug lords.

What does this do, Howard Dean, to the question of a filibuster on the Democratic side? DEAN: Nothing. That’s baked n. I expect two or three or four Democrats to vote for Judge Gorsuch. That is what their constituency wants. I can tell you right now if Judge Gorsuch if he’s confirmed by Democrats  —   that is unless we force McConnell to exercise the nuclear option  —  if he’s confirmed straight up with 60 votes, 10 of which are Democratic, the Democratic Senatorial committee might as well hang it up ’cause they’ll never raise any money from our base.

6825,Chicago Cubs go 24 hours without winning a World Series,"Thursday 3 November 2016 Chicago Cubs go 24 hours without winning a World Series 
Fans are blaming ‘some kind of curse’ for the Cubs’ failure to win a single World Series since yesterday. 
The team, which has now not won a Series in as long as many of their severely drunken, staggering fans can remember, is worried that their failure to buy some lucky white heather from a mysterious gypsy who called at Wrigley Field in the early hours of this morning has in some way jinxed their success. 
Infielder Chris Bryant, who answered the door to the peculiar crone, reported that he told her he felt they’d got enough good luck already – and then the witch told him ‘A curse be on this place and all within!’ before vanishing in a cloud of stale, brimstone-scented smoke. 
“And we’ve not won a World Series since,” he concluded in a worried tone. “What have I wrought upon the club?” 
Board chairman Thomas Ricketts has apologised to the people of Chicago for the lack of trophies in the last day, but pledged he was doing his hardest to bring ‘some kind, any kind’ of award to the city to placate concerned supporters. 
When told of the club’s failure to bring home any silverware in almost 24 hours, fan Simon Williams looked up groggily and replied “What? Uh, oh God, here we go again.

6826,Лидер иракских курдов рассказал о сроках операции в Мосуле,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
""Мы смогли быстро отвоевать приступы к городу, неизвестно, насколько сильно ИГ будет обороняться в самом городе. Но мы видим, что у них есть сотни смертников, должно быть, там целые фабрики по производству взрывчатки. При штурме это создаст большую опасность. Если все и дальше пойдет хорошо, я рассчитываю, что город удастся освободить самое позднее через три месяца"", - сказал Барзани в интервью таблоиду Bild . 
По его слвоам, отряды курдских сил самообороны ""пешмерга"" не участвуют в штурме самого города, так как связаны соглашением с Багдадом и международной коалицией. ""Будет лучше, если в город войдет иракская армия, чтобы избежать конфликта среди населения между арабами и курдами. Но если нас попросят, и будет новое соглашение, мы, конечно, поможем, мы к этому готовы"", - добавил президент. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, на территории Иракского Курдистана находится 1,8 миллиона беженцев, в дополнение к этому еще до миллиона человек могут прийти из Мосула. 
Напомним, 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город. 
Однако это наступление может обернуться катастрофой на Ближнем Востоке. Об этом заявил, к примеру, кандидат в президенты США Дональд Трамп. Или вот мнение отставного полковника США Дэниэла Дэвиса, которое он изложил в статье, опубликованной в The National Interest : Америке и силам коалиции стоит поторопиться с проведением операции в Мосуле, в противном случае террористы могут разорвать этот альянс Чем дольше продержится ИГ и чем больший урон нанесет коалиции, тем более вероятно, что религиозные и политические различия между освободительными силами будут проявляться все сильнее"", - пишет Дэвис. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила военного эксперта Бориса Подопригору. 
В последние несколько месяцев официального пребывания американского президента в Белом доме, им захотелось организовать такой политический спектакль на тему американской приверженности в борьбе с терроризмом. Я так это вижу. 
Что из этого получится, мне сказать сложно. Самое плохое, что я ожидаю, это новое столкновение по линии сунниты-шииты. Вот в чем самая большая проблема. 
Если начнется резня, а такое исключать нельзя, то мало никому не покажется, хотя бы потому, что и Иран, и Саудовская Аравия в стороне от этого конфликта не будут. Можно лишь пожалеть, что в американском практическом востоковедении немного людей, которые задумываются о последствиях межрелигиозного столкновения.

6827,Cubans Stranded at Border Hope for Trump Welcome,"NUEVO LAREDO, Tamaulipas  —   The dream of arriving to the U. S. under the Wet   Foot policy has turned into a nightmare after hundreds of Cubans have been left stranded at the   border. The islanders have a   permit from the Mexican government to travel north that leaves them subject to deportation thereafter. [More than 50 Cubans currently stuck in this border city are left only to hope that   Donald Trump shortly reverses the recent decision imposed by President Barack Obama that ended the   naturalization process for Cuban refugees. Some of the Cubans who spoke with Breitbart Texas expressed their surprise and disappointment upon learning that U. S. authorities would not let them enter the country legally.   “A new president that wants to help the oppressed people of Cuba is our only hope,” said Carlos Martin, a stranded Cuban refugee. “We have nothing and we can not go back it was a very radical decision. ”  Similar to the situation in Nuevo Laredo, in the border state of Nuevo León local authorities are preparing for hundreds of Cuban families to arrive with underage children as they attempt to reach Tamaulipas and eventually pass to Texas before their permits expire. The   permits are given to the Cubans by Mexico’s National Immigration Institute, granting them a temporary stay in the country after which they must leave the country. The permit has generally been used by migrants from a variety of nations to make their way to a northern border checkpoint.  “Many here think that the new Trump government will open the doors to the Cubans who arrive at the international bridges,” a Mexican immigration agent from Nuevo León told Breitbart Texas, “For them this is their only option, they don’t have money and they can’t return to Cuba. ”  As Breitbart Texas reported, the new immigration policy by Obama paints a target on the Cubans who will likely be sought by criminal organizations or law enforcement once their permit expires.

6828,AT&T Secret Spy Program Unveiled: Project Hemisphere,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Ryan Banister 
Project Hemisphere, a secretive program developed by AT&T, searches trillions of call records in order to analyze cell phone data, spying on the activity of private individuals in order to identify who they are speaking with and why, as well as GPS tracking on the location of each individual connected to the call, and it transmits this information to the Department of Justice (DOJ). 
In 2013, Project Hemisphere was shown in a Powerpoint presentation produced by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The New York Times reported this as a partnership between AT&T and the DOJ, primarily deployed for drug-enforcement task-forces. All information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the DOJ. 
AT&T specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the DOJ, who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers, using the taxpayers’ own money to spy on their every move. This is an invasion of privacy without a warrant. This is a federal spy program by proxy, working through corporations. 
AT&T promises law enforcement that it will not disclose Project Hemisphere’s involvement in active investigations that are made public. AT&T is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network. 
While it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you, there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private. 
News flash! It’s never been private. They have always wanted to use your information as a product to sell to the highest bidder. Your data is their product, and you are paying them to take it from you.

6829,Iraq Report Prompts More Defensiveness Than Regret From Tony Blair - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   His voice sometimes close to cracking, his expression strained and grim, former Prime Minister Tony Blair spent much of the past two days responding to the damning judgment of an inquiry into how he led Britain into the Iraq war, engaging in an extraordinary public mix of soul searching, regret and defensiveness. Judging by much of the media reaction, he would have done better to save his breath. “A Monster of Delusion,” read the headline over a picture of Mr. Blair in The Daily Mail on Thursday. The Sun, another British tabloid, described him as a “Weapon of Mass Deception,” a reference to the incorrect assertions by Mr. Blair and President George W. Bush before the invasion that Iraq had an arsenal of unconventional weapons. Nine years after stepping down from office, Mr. Blair  —   the most successful politician of his generation, who led the Labour Party to three consecutive general election victories with a centrist message  —   is widely loathed in Britain, his legacy defined overwhelmingly by the Iraq war and its bloody aftermath. He has few defenders, especially within his own party, which was split at the time by his support for the war and has since shifted leftward again, repudiating much of what he stood for. Mr. Blair is such a pariah on the left, said Steven Fielding, director of the Center for British Politics at the University of Nottingham, that “if he says ‘black,’ almost everyone else will say ‘white.’ ” Mr. Fielding added, “In the party he once led, to be described as Blairite is the greatest insult that can be leveled. ” More broadly, Mr. Blair has failed to rehabilitate his image since leaving office, and in some ways has added to his problems. Though he set up the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, intended to counter religious conflict and extremism, its work has been overshadowed by his business interests. Mr. Blair’s wealth, and his willingness to advise nations with poor human rights records such as Kazakhstan, has fueled another strand of criticism: that he was always too impressed by those with power and money. And his diplomatic work, trying to bring peace to the Middle East, ran up against the intractability of the conflicts in that region. “There will not be a day of my life where I do not relive and rethink what happened,” Mr. Blair said, referring to the Iraq war. “People ask me why I spend so much time in the Middle East today. This is why. This is why I work on Middle East peace, on the dialogue between faiths on how we can prevent young people growing up with hatred in their hearts towards those who look, think or believe differently from them. ” The 2.   report released on Wednesday was a savage indictment of Britain’s involvement in Iraq, condemning it as ill prepared and poorly executed, and concluding that it was based on flawed and unchallenged intelligence. In confronting the charges against him, Mr. Blair spoke sometimes in confessional terms, acknowledging those failings with “more sorrow, regret and apology and in greater measure than you can know or may believe. ” But what he did not do was to accept the fundamental premise of many of his critics: that he had been wrong to sanction military action against Saddam Hussein. The view of many of the protesters who gathered on Wednesday waving placards reading “BLIAR,” and of relatives of some of those who died in the conflict, is that he is culpable for taking Britain into a disastrous war on false pretenses. There have been attempted citizens’ arrests of him on war crimes charges. As one of his Labour Party critics, Diane Abbott, said on Thursday, Mr. Blair’s reputation had “bled to death in the sands of Iraq. ” Mr. Blair was always unpopular among the left of the party, who felt he had gone too far in abandoning core principles for the center ground while embracing central elements of Thatcherism. Even they would admit that he was good at winning elections: He scored his third victory in 2005, after the invasion of Iraq. Mr. Blair presided over a generally healthy economy and helped build peace in Northern Ireland. But many Britons found it inexplicable that he chose to go to war alongside Mr. Bush. In 2003, Mr. Bush was unpopular in Britain, and so was going to war in Iraq. Mr. Blair has sought to address his critics previously, but not at such length and with such public emotion as he has since the publication of the new report on Wednesday. The gist of his response was that his job as prime minister was to make tough decisions and that while he regretted many of the consequences of this one, he stood by it as the best available option at the time. “The world is better off without Saddam,” Mr. Blair told reporters in London, adding that had the Iraqi leader been left alone, he would have remained a threat to peace. And, had Mr. Hussein survived until the Arab Spring of 2011, he would have clung to power “with the same deadly consequences as we see in the carnage of Syria,” Mr. Blair suggested. “I will never agree that those who died or who were injured made their sacrifice in vain,” said Mr. Blair, while acknowledging that some of the families of those casualties “cannot and do not accept this is so. ” In that he is correct. After the report’s publication, Sarah O’Connor, the relative of one victim, called Mr. Blair “the world’s worst terrorist. ” Reg Keys, another victim’s relative, described Mr. Blair as a “consummate actor” and said that his long public statement resembled “the ramblings of a madman. ” While the report, seven years in the making, provides a damning indictment of sloppy   cataloging a host of policy and other failings, it does not accuse Mr. Blair of lying  —   a point to which the former prime minister returned frequently. Over the years, Mr. Blair has been accused by critics of deceiving Parliament and the public, and on Wednesday he said accusations of “bad faith, of lying or deceit or deliberate misrepresentation” should be laid to rest. “I did not mislead this country,” Mr. Blair said. “I made the decision in good faith on the information that I had at the time. ” His unequivocal support for Mr. Bush was essential to prevent the United States from pursuing a unilateral foreign policy, Mr. Blair argued, rejecting the characterization of himself as the president’s “poodle. ” He defended a message sent to Mr. Bush, before the decision to invade, including the phrase: “I will be with you, whatever. ” That statement was, Mr. Blair said, “not a blank check. ” Yet 13 years after Mr. Blair ordered British troops into action, his response to the latest inquiry is unlikely to bring closure because he is not budging on one central point. “What I cannot do and will not do,” Mr. Blair said, “is say we took the wrong decision. ” Mr. Fielding said history’s judgment on Mr. Blair’s premiership may be more positive, but that Mr. Blair has refused to do the one thing that might soften the damning verdict of his contemporaries. “If he was ever going to, this was the moment for him to apologize and say, ‘We should not have done this,’ ” Mr. Fielding said. “If he isn’t going to say this now, he will take this to his grave. ”",0
6830,"Hope Moves In Shadowy And Offbeat Places: Bob Dylan, Death, And The Creative Spirit","=By= Edward Curtain Editor's Note This article is so much more than just another paean for Dylan. It is an exploration of life and the hope than drives it. Curtain says in the following piece: “The news of one creative spirit’s death gave birth to another creative spirit’s gift to life.” And a recognition of the creative contribution of one has inspired an examination of creativity itself. “The song ‘Political World’ could have been triggered by current events. There was a heated presidential race underway …. But I had no interest in politics as an art form….The political world in the song is more of an underworld….With the song I thought I might have broken through to something. It was like you wake up from a deep and drugged slumber and somebody strikes a little silver gong and you come to your senses.” Bob Dylan, Chronicles W e live in dark times when the prison gates of seeming hopelessness clang shut around us. Endless U.S. led and sponsored wars, a New Cold War, nuclear threats, economic exploitation, oligarchical rule, government spying, drone killings, loss of civil liberties, terrorism, ecological degradation, etc. – the list is long and depressing. Awareness of a deep state hidden behind the marionette theatre of conventional politics has grown, even as the puppet show of electoral distractions garners the headlines. Readers of the alternative media learn the truth of government conspiracies involving assassinations – JFK, MLK, RFK, et al. – and countless other evil deeds without cessation. Excellent writers uncover and analyze the machinations of those responsible. Anger and frustration mount as people listen to a litany of bad news and propaganda spewed out by the mainstream corporate media. It is easy to be overwhelmed and disheartened. Despite the mute despair and apathy that fill the air, hope is needed to carry on and resist these destructive forces. Sometimes in such a dark time the eye begins to see and the ear hears hope in unexpected places. Doing so necessitates a bit of a sideways move to discover pockets of resistance hiding in the shadows. There are torches of illumination in the underworld, but we need to come to our senses to get there. “Emotion is the chief source of all becoming-conscious. There can be no transforming of darkness into light and of apathy into movement without emotion.” Carl Jung If you’ve ever played music or basketball, fell dizzyingly in love, or lapsed into a spell writing words or being engrossed in a passionate pursuit, you’ll easily grasp what follows. But maybe these specific experiences aren’t necessary. You’ve lived, you’re alive, and you can hear the pitter-patter beat of your dribbling heart. That’s probably plenty. You know the game can be a roller-coaster ride with all its ups and downs, and when it ends you will have won or lost something, exactly what being of the essence. Rhythm, melody, and movement: from these life is born and sustained. They are also integral to sports and art – music, writing, painting, sculpture, dance, etc. – even when they are apparently absent. Tall Walking Figure by Alberto Giacometti. (Credit: Billy Liar .) If, for example, one looks at Alberto Giacometti’s sculpture, Tall Walking Figure, its immobility implies movement. Such paradoxical inclusiveness pertains to still-life painting as well. While seemingly immobile, and defined by some as dead life, such paintings are encompassed by the presence of the absence of movement and change, the essence of all living things. To grasp the paradoxical nature of art – and life – one must approach them as an artist and see the wholeness in broken pieces. “Everything is broken,” Bob Dylan sings, “take a deep breath, feel like you’re choking.” “Life is the best play of all.” Sophie Michel, a 7 year-old musician I think it is fair to say that living is the ultimate art and as the artists of our lives our medium is time and space. And that it is in sound that time and space are epitomized. Musical sounds carry us through time and space in a reverberating vital impulse. Music brings us to our senses. Being emotional, it sets us in motion. We are moved. Sports, as the etymology of the word suggests (desporter – to divert), is a diversion from something. Sports involve us in movement through time and space to an unnecessary goal where someone wins and someone losses. In sports we choose to overcome superfluous obstacles for fun and for deeper reasons we may not realize. Sports only matter because they don’t. “What we play is life.” Louis Armstrong A few years ago my friends and I were playing in basketball tournaments for men over fifty and we qualified for the Senior Olympics at the University of Pittsburgh. We acquired a sponsor, a local funeral home that made warm-up jerseys for us. Being used to dealing with bodies at rest, these comedians knew we were a bunch of aging hoopsters intent on keeping our bodies in motion for as long as we could. So they had shirts made with that up-beat and adolescent cliché printed on the front, “Basketball is Life.” Lest we forgot, and being in the trade of taking bodies at rest to the underworld, on the back they had printed “Leave the Rest to Us: Flynn and Dagnoli Funeral Home.” Most of us found the juxtaposition hilarious (including one funny Irishman who ended up dead at the funeral home), but one teammate found it disturbing, which gave the rest of us additional sardonic laughs. Sex and death and one’s ongoing vitality are the stuff of uneasy laughter in the locker rooms of aging men. It’s a place for essentials. “He was like a great singer with a style all his own, a pacing that was different, a flair for the unusual.” Chick Hearn, play-by-play announcer for The Los Angeles Lakers about Pete Maravich I was reminded of this as I was rereading bits of Bob Dylan’s fascinating and poetic memoir, Chronicles: Volume I, and came upon his recounting of hearing of the news of the death of “Pistol” Pete Maravich, the greatest scorer in college basketball history and a magician without par on the court. It was January 5, 1988. 
My aunt was in the kitchen and I sat down with her to talk and drink coffee. The radio was playing and morn- ing news was on. I was startled to hear that Pete Maravich, the basketball player, had collapsed on a basketball court in Pasadena, just fell over and never got up. I’d seen Maravich play in New Orleans once, when the Utah Jazz were the New Orleans Jazz. He was something to see – mop of brown hair, floppy socks – the holy terror of the basketball world – high flyin’ – magician of the court. The night I saw him he dribbled the ball with his head, scored a behind the back, no look basket – dribbled the length of the court, threw the ball up off the glass and caught his own pass. He was fantastic. Scored something like thirty-eight points. He could have played blind. Pistol Pete hadn’t played professionally for a while, and he was thought of as forgotten. I hadn’t forgotten about him, though. Some people seem to fade away but then when they are truly gone, it’s like they didn’t fade away at all. Dylan has the poet’s touch, of course, a hyperbolic sense of the fantastic that draws you into his magical web in the pursuit of deeper truth. In ways he’s like the Latin American magical realist writers who move from fact to dream to the fantastic in a puff of wind. He goes on to write that after hearing the news of Pistol Pete’s sad death playing pickup basketball, he started and completed the song “Dignity” the same day, and in the days that followed song after song flowed from his pen. The news of one creative spirit’s death gave birth to another creative spirit’s gift to life. (I am reminded of Shakespeare writing Hamlet after his father’s death.) “It’s like I saw the song up in front of me and overtook it, like I saw all the characters in this song and elected to cast my fortunes with them …. The wind could never blow it out of my head. This song was a good thing to have. On a song like this, there’s no end to things.” One can hear echoes of Hemingway, another artist obsessed with death, in those last few sentences. Unlike Hemingway, however, Dylan’s focus on death is in the service of life and hope. For him there is no end, while Hemingway is all ending – nada, nada, nada – nothing, nothing, nothing – “it was all a nothing and a man was nothing too,” he writes in his haunting story, “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.” Dylan’s focus on the shadow of death is seen within the light of life – todo – all or everything. The darkness is there but is encompassed by the light. Nada within todo. As he told the AARP magazine last year in a fascinating interview, he’s been singing about death since he’s been twelve. And out of that singing – year after year for fifty plus years and counting – he has found and expressed the light of hope. Bob Dylan (Credit: Moderate Voice ) Dylan is our Emerson. His artistic philosophy has always been about movement in space and time through song. Always moving, always restless, always seeking a way back home through song, even when, or perhaps because, there are no directions. “An artist has got to be careful never to arrive at a place where he thinks he’s at somewhere,” he’s said. “You always have to realize that you are constantly in a state of becoming and as long as you can stay in that realm you’ll be alright.” Sounds like living, right. Sounds like Emerson, also. “Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. Thus one fact the world hates, that the soul becomes.” It was about ten years ago when we traveled to that Senior Basketball Olympics at the University of Pittsburgh. We drew many uneasy smiles as we paraded around with the backs of our shirts announcing the services of the men who take us to the underworld. We won a few games and lost others; were eliminated and left for home disappointed, some of us more than others, depending on each man’s competitive fire to defeat the foe. Like all athletes, losing felt like a small death. Even small deaths are hard to swallow, however, especially when knowing how way leads on to way and you doubt you will ever come back. As evening was darkening the Amish countryside, we departed east through country roads in silence, each lost in his interior monologue on the journey ahead. Playing low on the radio, from my back seat I could barely make out Dylan singing, “It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there.” Two years ago there was a short Grantland documentary, “The Finish Line,” about Steve Nash, the latest Pistol Pete. An uncanny player, Nash was battling injuries and age, and the documentary shows him pondering whether or not to retire or continue his rehabilitation and attempt a comeback. In the opening scene Nash goes out with his dog into the shadowy pre-dawn where he muses on his dilemma. His words are hypnotic. “I feel,” he said, “that there’s something that I can’t quite put my finger on that – I don’t know – I feel that it’s blocking me or I can see it out of the corner of my mind’s eye, or it’s like this dark presence ….is it the truth that I’m done?” Hobbled by a nerve injury that severely limited his movement, he played a few more games and retired within a year. Like Pete Maravich, he had brought an infectious joy to his playing, but he left without fulfilling his dream of winning an NBA championship. Of his retirement he said, “It’s bittersweet. I already miss the game deeply, but I’m also really excited to learn to do something else.” Unlike many athletes, Nash was moving on; his “dark presence” wasn’t a final death but a step on the road to a hard rebirth. It was a Dylanesque restless farewell: “And though the line is cut/It ain’t quite the end/I‘ll just bid farewell till we meet again.” “A song is like a dream, and you try to make it come true. They’re like strange countries that you have to enter. You can write a song anywhere …. It helps to be moving. Sometimes people who have the greatest talent for writing songs never write any because they are not moving.” Bob Dylan, Chronicles Dylan has long been accused of abandoning his youthful idealism and protest music. I think this is a bum rap. He was never a protester, though his songs became anthems of the civil rights and anti-war movements. There is no doubt that those songs were inspirational and gave people hope to carry on the good fight. But in turning in a more oblique and circumspect musical direction, following his need to change as the spirit of inspiration moved him, Dylan’s songs have come to inspire in a new way. You know his sympathies lie with the oppressed and downtrodden, but he doesn’t shout it. A listener has to catch his drift. If you go to the music, and dip into his various stylistic changes over the decades, you will find a consistency of themes. He deals with essentials like all great poets. Nothing is excluded. His work is paradoxical. Yes, he’s been singing about death since twelve, but it has always been countered by life and rebirth. There is joy and sadness; faith and doubt; happiness and suffering; injustice and justice; romance and its discontents; despair and hope. His music possesses a bit of a Taoist quality mixed with a Biblical sensibility conveyed by a hopelessly romantic American. He has fused his themes into an incantatory delivery that casts a moving spell of hope upon the listener. He is nothing if not a spiritual spell-binder; similar in many ways to that other quintessential American – the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, whose best work was a poetic quest for an inspired salvific poetry. If the listener is expecting an argument, a thesis, inductive reasoning, or a didactic approach from Dylan, he is out of luck, and rather than be inspired he will be disappointed. This is art, not theory, and art of a special kind since Dylan is an artist at war with his art. His songs demand that the listener’s mind and spirit be moving as the spirit of creative inspiration moved Dylan. A close listening will force one to jump from verse to verse – to shoot the gulf – since there are no bridges to cross, no connecting links. The sound carries you over and keeps you moving forward. If you’re not moving, you’ll miss the meaning. “A bird does not sing because it has an answer. It sings because it has a song.” Chinese Proverb So if the world is getting you down and all the news is bad to your ears, don’t lose hope. Step to the side, out of the glare of the sun, the blare of the headlines where lies and fears shout in our ears and echo down our days like a repetitive nightmare. Give Dylan a listen. As he has said of spiritual songs, “They brought me down to earth and they lifted me up all in the same moment.” His songs have the same paradoxical power because he excludes nothing. That is why they are truthful. It is fitting that his latest album, “Shadows in the Night,” comprised of ten beloved old ballads sung by Frank Sinatra, from “The Night We Called it a Day” to “Some Enchanted Evening,” has him changing again, going back to go forward. He is full of surprises, which any child will tell you bring joy because surprises and change are the core of living. To change this crazed world, we must change and find hope and joy along the way. Repetition will kill us. Dylan’s artistic metamorphoses and ingenious song writing offer offbeat sources of hope. Just listen. Having been compared to Frank Sinatra with these songs, he’s said, “You must be joking. To be mentioned in the same breath as him must be some sort of high compliment. As far as touching him goes, nobody touches him. Not me or anyone else …. But he never went away. All those things we thought were here to stay, they did go away. But he never did.” Sinatra, like Pistol Pete, didn’t fade away because he too inspired Dylan to inspire us to hope and carry on. If it feels dark and night-like to you, move sideways into the shadows. Look away and you’ll see the light. Or if you like basketball or dancing, like to move to the beat, listen to Dylan singing “Hurricane,” a long narrative song about the framing of the boxer Ruben “Hurricane” Carter. It will get your blood flowing, your passions riled, and your body moving. It’s perfect for practicing all the dribbling tricks Pistol Pete performed. I thought of using it at the Senior Olympics, but the beat seemed a little too rapid and excitable for the over fifty AARP crowd. The shirts were sending an undertaking message that I didn’t want made real. Hope is one thing, but traveling too fast is another. Anyway, one of my teammates was in swift pursuit of a woman there whom he described as a twin of his ideal woman – Pamela Anderson. He didn’t need any more excitement.

6831,Election Shows Many South Africans Losing Faith in ‘Pompous’ A.N.C. - The New York Times,"CHANTELLE, South Africa  —   A week before South Africa’s local elections on Wednesday, the Zithas held a family meeting inside their entertainment room to decide how to vote. Loyal backers of the African National Congress in every election since the end of apartheid, the family decided it was time for a change. Now, on a leisurely Sunday morning, as his wife and daughter got ready for church, Danny Zitha, 61, a former high school teacher, said the   A. N. C. had left him disillusioned because of its corruption, arrogance and incompetence. He will never go back, he said. “Not at all, as long as I’m alive, sorry,” he said, adding with a laugh, “Maybe after death. ” The A. N. C. which was the party of Nelson Mandela and helped free South Africa from   rule, suffered its worst losses ever at the polls in the municipal elections last week. Unrivaled for the past two decades, the party lost control of two   cities, including the capital, Pretoria, in what many believe is a profound change in how race and the legacy of apartheid influence South African politics. The party’s decline was especially steep in the biggest cities, with many black,   voters in places like Chantelle, a suburb of Pretoria, turning against it.   years after the end of apartheid, such voters appeared more concerned with mundane matters like good governance and taxes than with the party’s heroic liberation past. The emergence of real alternatives for voters, and possibly the growing accountability of political parties, are positive steps for South Africa’s democracy, analysts and even A. N. C. officials have said. In Pretoria, the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, defeated the A. N. C. by two percentage points. The A. N. C. ’s share of the vote fell to 41 percent from 55 percent in the last local elections, in 2011. In the voting district including Chantelle, once an   community that is now about 90 percent black, the A. N. C. ’s share of the vote plummeted to 40 percent from 69 percent in 2011. In many ways, the shifting dynamics inside Chantelle reflect larger forces  —   a growing black middle class in a rapidly urbanizing country  —   that are detrimental to the A. N. C. which, especially under President Jacob G. Zuma, has relied on patronage to maintain power. As the election results began trickling in last week, A. N. C. officials said they would engage in “introspection. ” But examples from the rest of the continent are not encouraging: Few liberation movements that assumed power have been able to transform themselves with the changing times and needs. Mr. Zitha and his wife, who is also a high school teacher, moved to Chantelle from Mamelodi, an impoverished township, in 1994. They were one of the first black families in an area that had been restricted to whites under apartheid. Now, Mr. Zitha points to his immediate neighbors on his block of detached homes: a government worker and a prison warden on one side a government worker, a lawyer and a high school teacher on the other side  —   all solid members of the black  . Sensible cars like Toyotas are parked in his garage and those of his neighbors, though some   can also be spotted in Chantelle. “It’s a popular car here, even though I feel it’s quite heavy to maintain a   for a   person like myself,” Mr. Zitha said. ”You’re just pretending to be what you’re not supposed to be. ” In all the previous national and local elections since 1994, Mr. Zitha, his wife and their two older children, after they came of age, voted for the A. N. C. Even so, Mr. Zitha became increasingly dissatisfied with the party’s stewardship of the economy, its upkeep of Chantelle and its culture of corruption under Mr. Zuma. “They’re driving 4x4s, Range Rovers, all those fancy cars,” he said of A. N. C. officials. “Those guys are pompous. They’re just working for themselves and their close relatives. ” Perhaps not surprisingly, it was the Zithas’ youngest child who began questioning the family’s loyalty to the A. N. C. Tshegofatso Zitha, 21, an electrical engineering student, is a “” as black South Africans born after the end of apartheid are called. When she was 15, Ms. Zitha recalled, she learned in school about rape, and began worrying about the large, open field next to her street. Criminals often hid in that field, robbing people of their cellphones. Burglars broke into the Zithas’ house five times over the years. Finding the local A. N. C. official unresponsive, she and some other young women in the area began to carry whistles. “I thought it wasn’t fair because we voted the A. N. C. into leadership here, but we had to find other ways to stay safe,” Ms. Zitha said. She also looked at the adjacent ward, which had been led for some time by the Democratic Alliance. “That place, it’s clean, it’s safe,” she said. “That’s what we want. ” Voting for the first time in 2014, Ms. Zitha backed the Economic Freedom Fighters, a leftist group that finished third in last week’s voting. The rest of her family voted that year for the A. N. C. She waited until   before going to work on her parents and older siblings. “I wanted to see if the A. N. C. would do anything that would benefit any of us in any way,” she said. “So I asked my family, ‘Do you see any difference?’ And they said, ‘No. ’” And so by the time the family got together before the latest election, the Zithas had made up their minds. Mr. Zitha was particularly upset, because he thought the local A. N. C.  government had failed to provide good services despite rising property taxes. “Look at it  —   this is too much,” he said, holding a monthly bill for about $80 in taxes and municipal fees. The Zithas decided to vote for the Economic Freedom Fighters, though they also liked the Democratic Alliance, as did many of their neighbors. One of them, Bongo Matjila, 58, who is also a high school teacher, drove by in his Ford pickup. “We’re friends, we’re brothers, even though we voted for different parties,” Mr. Zitha said, as the two neighbors bantered in his driveway. “We’ve got a common enemy” Mr. Matjila said. “Yeah, if the enemy is this man, we must try hard to get him out of the city,” Mr. Zitha said. “And we got him out. ” An hour later, just a few blocks away, a black Mercedes van pulled into a driveway, containing three A. N. C. supporters active in ward politics. All were from families with deep ties to the A. N. C. and they said they would never quit the party. “I’m used to eating pap,” said one of them, Mogomotsi Mogomotsi, 21, who owns a construction and supply company, referring to the ground corn that is South Africa’s staple. Goms Matabane, 24, who was wearing an A. N. C. baseball cap, said he was extremely disappointed by the election results. “But I’m not really surprised,” he added, “because I’ve been hearing a lot of people saying they’ve lost faith in the A. N. C. ”",0

6833,Kurtz: ’Establishment Media’ Hyperventilation Over Trump Selection of Press Conference Questioners ’Whiny’ - Breitbart,"Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Howard Kurtz, anchor of the network’s “MediaBuzz” program took aim at critics in the “establishment media” that have bemoaned President Donald Trump’s selection of reporters at press conferences with foreign leaders, which have been mostly members of what they deem to be the conservative media.  Kurtz called those critics “whiny” when asked by anchor Shannon Bream to react to CNN’s Jim Acosta, who took to the airwaves to criticize Trump for those selections. “It’s not just Jim Acosta,” Kurtz replied. “The establishment media as a whole is engaging in a lot of   and hyperventilation over the president’s selection of questioners. And frankly, it’s sounding a little bit whiny. But here are the facts: Eight questions from American reporters at the four news conferences the president has held with foreign leaders.

He hasn’t called on any of the broadcast networks or major newspapers. Some of the questions have been good and some questions not so good.

6835,Former DEA Prescription Head Drops a Bombshell — Congress Protects Big Pharma & Fuels Opioid Crisis,"
By Claire Bernish
Congress would rather protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies than the health of those addicted to dangerous opioid drugs, says a former head of the DEA responsible for preventing abuse of medications.
Joseph Rannazzisi, former Deputy Assistant Administrator at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, asserts Big Pharma and its lobbyists have a “stranglehold” on legislators in Congress and have engineered the protection of a $9 billion per year industry over the health of American citizens, according to a report from the Guardian .
“Congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive,” he said, according to the outlet. “As long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists, nothing’s going to change.” 
Rannazzisi explained lobbyists have spent millions thwarting legislative and policy efforts to provide guidelines for reducing the prescribing of opioid medications closely related to heroin — and helped limit the DEA’s powers to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosages of the same.
A pharmacist himself, Rannazzisi severely criticized lawmakers he claims hold a double standard — publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic, while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the industry’s profits.
“These congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for re-election, it’s a sham,” he told the Guardian . “The congressmen and senators who are championing this fight, the ones who really believe in what they’re doing, their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence.” 
With the unique insight of having been an insider, Rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislators’ public lamentation of addiction and deaths from the opioid crisis during election years, and private efforts to protect drugmakers from liability.
And he would know. According to Rannazzisi’s LinkedIn profile, as Chief of Diversion, he had been tasked with “oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 1.6 million DEA registrants” — but if the standards are lowered by Congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids, the threshold of criminality is raised.
As the Guardian points out, legislation to fight the opioid epidemic, Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act , did, in fact, pass in July — but partisan controversy erupted when Republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth. Democrats then issued a report titled “ Dying Waiting for Treatment ” in response, which “likened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to ‘using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam.’” 
Indeed the report sharply criticized the bill, equating its policies to ‘empty promises’ for the lack of financial follow-through.
As the Washington Post detailed in a report earlier this month, the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal ‘pill mills’ and corrupt pharmacies, who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets.
Headed by Rannazzisi, the Office of Diversion Control sent investigators into the field, and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets.
But the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry — fearing a potential significant loss in profits — fought back. Hard.
According to the Post , the deputy attorney general summoned Rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012, concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies.
“That meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and that’s all that meeting was about,” the now-retired DEA official told the Post .
Then, in 2014, came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the Department of Justice and congressional legislators: the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act — legislation initiated by the Healthcare Distribution Management Association — the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy.
An analysis of lobbying records by the Post found “the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, spent $13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016.” 
Rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in July 2014, and recalled telling them, “This bill passes the way it’s written we won’t be able to get immediate suspension orders, we won’t be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations.” 
Stunned at the massive — and ultimately successful — effort to take the bite out of DEA attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19,000 lives every year, Rannazzisi likened the legislation to a “free pass” for legal drug pushers.
“This doesn’t ensure patient access and it doesn’t help drug enforcement at all,” he told the Guardian. “What this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. What this bill does is take away DEA’s ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor.” 
“This was a gift. A gift to the industry,” he added.
After heading the diversion office for a decade, Rannazzisi retired in 2015 — likely disgusted over legislators’ dedication to the legal drug industry, rather than the people whose interests they’re ostensibly obligated to protect.
“The bill passed because ‘Big Pharma’ wanted it to pass,” he told the Guardian in no uncertain terms. “The DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and they’re not going to like being regulated.” 
Big Pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation. As the Center for Public Integrity found , the Guardian noted, Purdue Pharma — at the heart of the epidemic for its highly-addictive drug introduced in the late 1990s, OxyContin — spent a breathtaking $740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts.
However, Big Pharma’s power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying — the government-run Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) has been accused by Sen. Ron Wyden of being a tool to “weaken” CDC guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids.
Wyden wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell of his concerns the IPRCC had been staffed with ‘experts’ with conflicts of interest for their close ties to Big Pharma, including a scientist with a $1.5 million endowment from Purdue, reported the Guardian .
“You’ve got a panel that’s certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. That’s something you’ve got to root out,” Wyden asserted . “The role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests.” 
Families of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of Big Pharma’s pro-opioid cash appalling — yet it continues to this day. Policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem, which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap blood-tainted profits.
“Corporations have no conscience,” Rannazzisi flatly told the Guardian . “Unfortunately, with my job, I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, I’d bet you they’d change their mind. 
“When you sit with a parent who can’t understand why there’s so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isn’t the government doing anything, well the DEA was doing something. Unfortunately what we’re trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws.” Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

6836,Elon Musk Warns Deep A.I. Could Be ’Dangerous’ to an Already-Cyborg Human Race - Breitbart,"Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk warned that deep A. I. could potentially be dangerous to the human race, who he described as already   should it overtake us in intelligence. [“One of the most troubling questions is artificial intelligence. I don’t mean narrow A. I   —   deep artificial intelligence, where you can have AI which is much smarter than the smartest human on earth,” proclaimed Musk during the World Government Summit in Dubai. “This is a dangerous situation. ”  “Pay close attention to the development of artificial intelligence,” he continued. “Make sure researchers don’t get carried away. Scientists get so engrossed in their work they don’t realize what they are doing. ” Musk continued to claim that humans are already   citing the range of digital applications that people now depend on every day. “To some degree we are already a cyborg  —   you think of all the digital tools that you have  —   your phone, your computer,” claimed Musk. “The applications that you have. The fact that you can ask a question and instantly get an answer from Google and other things. ” “You already have a digital tertiary layer. Think of the limbic system  —   the animal brain and the cortex as the thinking part of the brain, and your digital self as a third layer,” he added. “If you die your digital ghost is still around. All of their emails, and social media, that still lives if they die. ” “Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence  …     It’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output,” Musk concluded. “Some high bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem. ” In November, Musk predicted that automated robots would lead to mass unemployment, which could eventually create a universal wage from the government. In June, the billionaire tech entrepreneur claimed it likely that mankind is living in a   computer simulation. Musk was also one of the Silicon Valley billionaires, along with fellow PayPal Mafia members Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, who invested $1 billion into an artificial intelligence center in 2015.

6839,Vegan Custard Stuffed Pumpkin Recipe,"in: General Health , Organic Market Classifieds , Organics This vegan custard recipe was inspired by the Cambodian recipe for sangkya , also known as songkya . Traditional sangkya is an eggy custard with a strong coconut flavor. Most recipes call for quite a bit of sugar, so this recipe is a loosely adapted interpretation of the original. It’s much healthier, completely vegan, and is a great alternative to flour-based holiday treats. This seasonal dessert does need to chill for several hours before serving, so plan ahead. The coconut yogurt and soaked cashew base are held together with coconut, garbanzo, and chia seed flour. The sweetness of the maple syrup is balanced with lemon zest and juice. You can adjust the amount of lemon, or add more coconut flakes if you want a less tart or more coconutty flavor. Kabocha, or Japanese pumpkin, is the best choice for this recipe. Similar to butternut squash, the kabocha has fewer calories and many people say it tastes better. It’s a great source of beta-carotene, iron, vitamin C , and fiber. You can substitute pie pumpkins if you have trouble finding kabocha. When selecting your kabocha squash, choose a squat, wide shape over a taller, round one. This will give the top of the custard a better chance to brown while baking. You can also skip the pumpkin entirely if you’re just looking for a vegan baked custard recipe. If you choose this route, make sure to bake the custard for only twenty minutes. One item to note… This recipe makes enough custard to fill a pumpkin with a 25 in. (63 cm) circumference. If you’re using a smaller pumpkin, you may want to halve this recipe. I recommend keeping a small (5”) springform pan ready for any leftover custard. Just bake it along with your pumpkin for twenty minutes and allow to cool. How Did Pumpkins Get to Japan? If you thought pumpkin and squash came from the Americas, you are absolutely correct. Portuguese traders and explorers originally brought squash and pumpkins from Brazil to Japan in the 16th century [ 1 ] while the Portuguese Empire was expanding into South Asia. The kabocha squash is simply a variety of Cucurbita maxima —the same species that produces the gigantic pumpkins that win ribbons at state fairs. I don’t recommend you try to make this recipe with one of those monsters, though. It could feed an army, but the cooking time would take days! Their smaller Japanese cousins, however, do quite nicely. In Japan, the squash is called Kuri Kabocha , or “nutty pumpkin”. [ 2 ] If you’ve ever tasted kabocha you’ll understand the “nutty” moniker. The texture is fluffy and reminiscent of chestnuts, but the flavor is sweet, like a butternut squash crossed with a sweet potato. Kabocha squash have dark, forest-green skin, a slightly squished or flattened shape, and brilliant orange flesh. [ 3 ] You can actually leave your kabocha out as a decoration if you’re going to use them within a few days. Otherwise, store them in a dark, cool area for up to a month. [ 4 ] Vegan Custard Stuffed Pumpkin Recipe Pre-prep: soak the cashews in lukewarm water for 2-4 hours Prep time: 20 minutes to hollow the pumpkin and prepare the filling Bake time: 45 minutes at 400°F (250° C) Chill time: 3-4 hours or overnight Servings: 10 Sharp spoon to hollow out pumpkin Citrus reamer (optional) Food processor or powerful blender Silicone baking mat or parchment paper Baking sheet 1 medium organic kabocha squash (about 25” in circumference) 2 cups raw cashews, soaked and strained 2 cups organic vanilla coconut vegan yogurt (try our vegan yogurt recipe , just add 1 tbsp maple syrup and 1 tsp vanilla) 2 tbsp organic coconut flour 1 tbsp organic chia seed flour 1 tbsp organic garbanzo bean flour ⅔ cup organic maple syrup Zest and juice of 2 large organic lemons (about 5 tbsp) 3 tsp pure, organic vanilla extract ½ cup organic coconut flakes, plus extra (optional) 1 tsp Himalayan crystal salt Instructions Start by preparing the custard. Drain excess water from the soaked cashews. Add cashews, yogurt, coconut flour, chia seed flour, garbanzo bean flour, vanilla extract, and Himalayan crystal salt to the food processor and pulse until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add half the maple syrup and lemon juice and pulse for 15 seconds to combine. Taste custard to determine how much of the remaining maple syrup, lemon juice, and coconut flakes to add. Continue pulsing to mix ingredients. Once the taste suits your preference, allow the custard to remain in the food processor while you carve the squash. Preheat oven to 400°F. Use a serrated knife to cut the crown off the squash. Start a cut a couple inches from the woody stem of the squash. Continue to cut in a circle around the stem. Pull the crown off the squash and set aside. With a sharp spoon, thoroughly remove the seeds and sinew from the inside the pumpkin and discard. Using a spatula, slowly pour the custard into the pumpkin. Do not overfill. Leave enough room to replace the crown. The custard will rise slightly as it cooks and it will need this space to expand. You can either discard the crown or bake it alongside the custard. Add any remaining custard to the springform pan and smooth flat with a spatula. Line a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Place the filled squash, crown, and springform pan on the cookie sheet and place in the oven. If baking the crown, set it next to the squash for baking. Do not put it back on top yet. After twenty minutes, remove the springform pan and place on the counter to cool. You can eat this mini custard while you’re waiting for the main attraction to chill in the fridge. After the squash has been cooking for 40 minutes, check its status. Using the tip of a small knife or fork, poke a small hole in the squash. If it easily cuts into the flesh, congrats! It’s done! If the squash isn’t soft enough, bake at 400°F for another 15 minutes. Let the squash cool on the counter for about ten minutes, then transfer to a plate or large glass bowl to chill in the fridge. If you baked the crown you can put it back on the squash. Chill the custard for at least 3 hours before serving. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut thin slices. Enjoy! The Difference Between Squash and Pumpkin Because their genetic history is intertwined, squash , pumpkin , and gourd are often used interchangeably. [ 5 ] As a general rule, you carve pumpkins, cook squash, and decorate with gourds. [ 6 ] If you let that sink in, you might wonder how it is that we have so many pumpkin-imbued treats every fall. Well, the truth is, our traditional “pumpkin” pies and other tasty dishes are actually made with squash. [ 7 ] Pumpkin ice cream, pumpkin lattes, pumpkin cookies, even canned pumpkin actually contain squash. Don’t despair, it’s just a quirk of taxonomy. Autumnal pumpkin delicacies are usually made using winter squash that resembles carving pumpkins, they’re just not officially classified as pumpkins. Proper pumpkins aren’t eaten because they’re watery, stringy, and don’t taste that good. Winter squash is smaller, softer, and sweeter than its pumpkin cousin. If you feel lost and confused, don’t worry—even the FDA has trouble deciding whether or not you’re eating a pumpkin or a squash.

6840,Donald Trump Questions ‘Sick Guy’ Barack Obama for ‘Wire Tapping’ His Campaign - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his campaign headquarters during the election in a series of messages on Twitter. [“Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory,” he wrote on Twitter. “Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!”  Trump questioned whether it was legal for Obama to be wiretapping a presidential candidate while he was still in office. “How low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process,” he wrote. “This is  . Bad (or sick) guy! Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping’ a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!” Trump is likely referring to calls from talk radio hosts Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh to investigate the nature of the Obama administration’s investigations of his campaign aides for their communications with Russia, as Breitbart News editor Joel Pollak reported.  As former Heat Street editor Louise Mensch reported the day before the election, “sources with links to the   community” confirmed that a FISA court had granted a FISA court warrant in October to monitor activities in Trump tower. They were previously denied a request in June, according to the report as well as a report in the Guardian.  The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the Obama team classified the investigation at the lowest possible level, allowing the data gathered from the investigation to be shared and leaked widely within the administration. In January, The New York Times reported that intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the Obama White House even though there was “no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing” between Russian officials and associates of Trump. On Twitter, Trump suggested that he might even have legal options against the former president. “I’d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” he wrote.",0
6841,Vice President Pence Appears to Support EU Freedom of Movement,"U. S. Vice President Mike Pence held a joint press conference with European Council President Donald Tusk on Monday in which Pence affirmed United States commitment to the European Union while also raising questions as to whether the U. S. supports the European Union’s “freedom of movement. ”[In the joint press conference with Tusk, Vice President Pence stated in part:  Saturday, as President Tusk said, I was pleased to address the Munich Security Council to speak about the importance of the strategic alliance [inaudible]   …     entered the bond so many years ago in the North American Treaty Organization. But the president did ask me to come here, to Brussels, to the home of the European Union, and deliver an additional message, so today it is my privilege on behalf of President Trump to express the strong commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union. Whatever our differences, our two continents share the same marriage, the same values, and above all, the same purpose  —   to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. And to those objectives, we will remain committed. This has been European Union’s goal since before its formal founding in 1993. What began as a modest Western European trade agreement in 1951, freedom of movement, has grown into a commitment to the four freedoms  —   the freedom of movement, goods, capital, services and people, the common currency, and common approach to foreign and security policy. Pence continued speaking of the history of the European Union (EU). He moved to speak of U. S. and EU economies and “reaffirm our commitment to a free, fair and flourishing economies that undergird our success and a cooperation in achieving that. Maintaining and strengthening our economic vitality will require hard but necessary choices. ” Pence also reaffirmed the U. S. commitment to fighting terrorism, mentioned the Islamic terror bombings on Brussels that killed more than 30 people, then called on the European community to intensify efforts to fight radical Islamic terrorism alongside the United States. “This will require greater coordination and   among EU member states and between the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,” he said. Speaking of Russian aggression, Pence said, “In addition to confronting terrorism together, clearly, we must stand strong in defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nations in Europe. ” On Tuesday, Reuters reported that in the week leading up to the vice president’s meetings in Brussels and affirmation of U. S. commitment to the EU, in a conversation with a German diplomat, White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon described the EU as a flawed construct. He cited three confidential sources that had been briefed on the meeting. The sources stated that Bannon conveyed favor for bilateral relations with Europe. One White House official claimed to Reuters a more brief version of the interaction between Bannon and German ambassador to Washington Peter Wittig than the three other sources. The three sources reportedly described Bannon’s message to the diplomat as favoring strong nationalist movements. One of the three described the White House position on the EU as not seeing an unraveling of the EU as having grave consequences. The vice president spoke at the Munich Security Conference in the days before his visit to Brussels as part of his first trip abroad since taking office. Last week, the conference chairman, French Foreign Minister   Ayrault, called on Pence to affirm during his visit that the U. S. supports the EU and was not aiming to break up the organization, according to Reuters. Pence made the trip to the security conference on behalf of President Trump. A senior White House policy adviser previewed the trip last week, promising an overarching message of reassurance. In his speech to conference participants, he brought this promise from President Trump: “We will stand with Europe today and every day we are bound together by the same noble ideals  —   freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law. ” At Monday’s joint press conference, Pence stated, “The United States commitment to the European Union is steadfast and enduring. President Tusk, President Trump, and I look forward to working together with you and the European Union to deepen our political and economic partnership. ” During his presidential campaign,   Donald Trump made clear that he supported the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” vote to leave the European Union. The day after the June 23 Brexit vote,   Trump compared the vote to the upcoming presidential election in the U. S. and attributed the U. K. vote to leave the EU, and prospectively the U. S. presidential vote, in large part to people’s desire to control borders and block illegal immigration. USA Today quoted Trump as stating, “All over the world [people are] angry. They are angry at the borders. They are angry over people coming into the country and taking over. ” In late January, European Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, who vehemently opposes Brexit, said, “We have a third front undermining the European Union, and it is Donald Trump, who has joined [the   parties] from across the Atlantic. He has talked fairly favorably of other countries wanting to break away from the EU and that he hoped for disintegration from European Union,” according to the Telegraph. In the Monday press conference, President Tusk emphasized a particular portion of his meeting with Vice President Pence, saying, “I asked the vice president directly if he shared my opinions on three key matters: the international order, security, and the attitude of the new American administration towards the European Union. ” Tusk continued, “In reply to these three matters, I heard today from Vice President Pence three times ‘yes.’ After such a positive declaration, both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach. ” Request for comment from the vice president on whether the State Department had a role in statements made at Monday’s joint   press conference returned no comment by the time of this report.

6842,Texting and Driving? Watch Out for the Textalyzer - The New York Times,"Over the last seven years, most states have banned texting by drivers, and public service campaigns have tried an array of tactics  —   “It can wait,” among them  —   to persuade people to put down their phones when they are behind the wheel. Yet the problem, by just about any measure, appears to be getting worse. Americans confess in surveys that they are still texting while driving, as well as using Facebook and Snapchat and taking selfies. Road fatalities, which had fallen for years, are now rising sharply, up roughly 8 percent in 2015 over the previous year, according to preliminary estimates. That is partly because people are driving more, but Mark Rosekind, the chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said distracted driving was “only increasing, unfortunately. ” “Radical change requires radical ideas,” he said in a speech last month, referring broadly to the need to improve road safety. So to try to change a distinctly modern behavior, legislators and public health experts are reaching back to an old strategy: They want to treat distracted driving like drunken driving. Harvard’s School of Public Health, for example, is developing a new push based on the effective designated driver campaign it orchestrated in the United States beginning in the late 1980s. Candace Lightner, the founder of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, has helped found a new group this year, Partnership for   Driving, which is circulating a petition to pressure social media companies like Facebook and Twitter to discourage multitasking by drivers, in the same way that Ms. Lightner pushed beer and liquor companies to discourage drunken driving. The most provocative idea, from lawmakers in New York, is to give police officers a new device that is the digital equivalent of the Breathalyzer  —   a roadside test called the Textalyzer. It would work like this: An officer arriving at the scene of a crash could ask for the phones of any drivers involved and use the Textalyzer to tap into the operating system to check for recent activity. The technology could determine whether a driver had used the phone to text, email or do anything else that is forbidden under New York’s   driving laws, which prohibit drivers from holding phones to their ear. Failure to hand over a phone could lead to the suspension of a driver’s license, similar to the consequences for refusing a Breathalyzer. The proposed legislation faces hurdles to becoming a law, including privacy concerns. But Félix W. Ortiz, a Democratic assemblyman who was a sponsor of the bipartisan Textalyzer bill, said it would not give the police access to the contents of any emails or texts. It would simply give them a way to catch multitasking drivers, he said. “We need something on the books where people’s behavior can change,” said Mr. Ortiz, who pushed for the state’s 2001 ban on   devices by drivers. If the Textalyzer bill becomes law, he said, “people are going to be more afraid to put their hands on the cellphone. ” If it were to pass in New York, the first state to propose such an idea, it could well spread in the same way that the   rules did after New York adopted them. Ms. Lightner said the intensifying efforts around distracted driving “are the equivalent of the early ’80s” in drunken driving, when pressure led to tougher laws and campaigns emphasizing corporate responsibility. Distracted driving “is not being treated as seriously as drunk driving, and it needs to be,” she said. “It’s dangerous, devastating, crippling, and it’s a killer, and still socially acceptable,” she added. The safety administration plans to release the final fatality numbers as early as Thursday but previously announced that the numbers appeared to be up sharply. Jay Winsten, an associate dean and the director of the Center for Health Communication at Harvard’s School of Public Health, said, “We’re losing the battle against distracted driving. ” Dr. Winsten is developing a   campaign based on   efforts that were ultimately backed by major television networks and promoted by presidents, sports leagues and corporations. He said the new campaign would urge drivers to be more attentive, rather than scold them for multitasking, and would encourage parents to set a better example for their children. The campaign, though still in development, has already garnered support from YouTube, which has agreed to recruit stars on the website to create original content involving the message. Dr. Winsten said he had also been in talks with ATT, Nascar, a major automaker and potential Hollywood partners. Dr. Winsten said the new campaign could be a kind of carrot to encourage better behavior by drivers, but he added that a stick was also needed. While the Textalyzer raises potential privacy concerns, it might help enforce texting bans that have so far proved ineffective, he said. “Right now, we have a reed, not a stick,” Dr. Winsten said, adding that the Textalyzer would “make enforcement that much more credible. ” Now, the police can obtain a warrant for cellphone records, but the process takes time and resources, limiting the likelihood of investigation, Mr. Ortiz said. But those protections are there for good reason, according to privacy advocates, who oppose the New York bill. “It really invites police to seize phones without justification or warrant,” said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. A unanimous decision by the Supreme Court in 2014 ruled that the police could not search a cellphone without a warrant, even after an arrest, suggesting an uphill fight on the New York legislation. But the bill’s authors say they have based the Textalyzer concept on the same “implied consent” legal theory that allows the police to use the Breathalyzer: When drivers obtain a license, they are consenting in advance to a Breathalyzer, or else they will risk the suspension of their license. Matt Slater, the chief of staff for State Senator Terrence Murphy of New York, a Republican and a sponsor of the bill, said the constitutional concerns could and should be solved. “It’s monumental if we can get this done,” he said. Mr. Slater said he hoped it could happen this session, which ends in June, but, he added, it may take several tries and may require broader public support. “We’re facing the same hurdles we faced with drunk driving,” he said. “We’re trying to make sure safety and civil liberties are equally protected. ” Fourteen states prohibit the use of   devices by drivers, and 46 ban texting, with penalties ranging from a $25 fine in South Carolina to $200 fines elsewhere, and even points assessed against the driver’s license. A handful of states have strengthened their original bans, including New York, which in 2014 adopted tougher sanctions that include a   suspension of a permit or a license suspension for drivers under 21, while a second offense calls for a   suspension. Deborah Hersman, the president of the nonprofit National Safety Council and a former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said she liked the Textalyzer idea because it would give the police an important tool and would help gather statistics on the number of crashes caused by distraction. She said the   comparison was apt because looking at and using a phone can be as dangerous as driving drunk. “Why are we making a distinction between a substance you consume and one that consumes you?” Ms. Hersman said. The Textalyzer legislation has been called Evan’s Law for Evan Lieberman, who was asleep in the back of a car on June 16, 2011, when the vehicle, driven by a friend, lost control. Mr. Lieberman, 19, died from his injuries, and his father, Ben Lieberman, spent months trying to gain access to phone records, which ultimately showed that the driver had been texting. Ben Lieberman became an advocate for driving safety, and in December, looking to develop the Textalyzer concept, he approached the mobile forensics company Cellebrite, which was involved in helping the government find a way into a locked iPhone, and which works with police departments around the country. Jim Grady, the chief executive of Cellebrite U. S. A. said that the Textalyzer software had not been fully built because it was not clear what a final law might require, but that it would not be too technologically challenging. “I hope it will have the same effect as the Breathalyzer,” he said.",0

6844,Obama's Victory Lap?,"Written by Philip Giraldi Tuesday November 1, 2016 In between nearly daily campaign stops shilling for Hillary, President Barack Obama has been promoting his record as Head of State. To Obama’s credit, he talks nice and appears to be both thoughtful and rational, qualities that were not always evident in his predecessor in office. But the hype about what was achieved in his eight years appears to be more than a bit overblown, particularly if one considers the flagship domestic project, Obamacare. It is a program in which the government forces individuals to buy a product that has been crafted together by private, for profit companies. If the people do not buy, they will be penalized by the government. The companies in turn have learned that it is tough to make money insuring people who are actually sick so they are leaving the program while those individuals who have to buy their own coverage without government subsidies are discovering that the significant annual price increases mean that they cannot afford insurance at all. Donald Trump is right that the program is in crisis, is “over,” and should be repealed. Against that, what has Obama accomplished domestically? I will not consider the constant pandering on gender and race because that is, after all, what Democrats do. But if one considers immigration a part of domestic policy, he is responsible for refusing to enforce immigration law, letting Haitians stay illegally in the US as compensation for a hurricane that occurred in 2010, while also failing to deport whole categories of Hispanics who are in the country without visas or residency permits. Domestic would also include the continuation of several types of surveillance of citizens by the NSA and FBI, the hounding and prosecution of whistleblowers, and the increased reliance on the State Secrets privilege to derail the use of the judicial system to pushback against government overreach. And in a just concluded parole hearing involving a Guantanamo detainee who had been repeatedly tortured, the Obama Administration has now determined that some individuals can be held in prison forever without ever being charged with a crime or convicted. But it is in the foreign and national security policy areas that Obama has been most visibly active as he has a relatively free hand based on what he considers to be his own “unitary executive” authority. In his famous Cairo speech delivered to the Muslim world in 2009 he promised change but basically did not deliver, though there have actually been several successes in foreign policy that date to the past year. He should get full credit for confronting the Israel Lobby and Congress (essentially the same thing) to obtain a nuclear program agreement with Iran. Likewise, he went against the Cuban Lobby and GOP in Congress (also essentially the same thing) to ease relations with Havana. He still might do the right thing by the Palestinians and allow the US to recognize their statehood at the United Nations later this month or even support the French plan for a multinational conference to create a Palestinian state but I wouldn’t want to bet on it, particularly as the incoming Administration headed by Hillary Clinton will be firmly in the Israeli pocket and Obama would presumably defer to her before doing anything dramatic. And Obama should also get credit for some things that he didn’t do. He did not exacerbate tensions with Russia by arming Ukraine with game changing offensive weapons in spite of intense pressure from Congress and the media and he did not get involved in a new land war involving tens of thousands of American soldiers in Asia even though some of his advisers were urging him to do so in Syria. But by the same measure starting yet another war by proxy, in Libya, was a complete failure, though it did not involve American boots on the ground. It was a war that might in part be attributed to the aggressive advocacy of Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time. And while it should also be recalled to Obama’s credit that he made no effort to maintain a troop presence in Iraq, he was unable to extricate US forces from America’s longest war in Afghanistan, which continues and is likely to be on the presidential agenda for the next decade or even longer. Nor could he dissuade the Saudis from initiating their brutal and senseless war on Yemen, which has had devastating consequences with more to come for the entire region. And President Obama has also failed to closed Guantanamo prison in spite of promises made eight years ago to do so. President Obama has also changed the actual mechanics of America’s intervention in the world, using drones and aerial bombardment instead of soldiers on the ground to enforce Washington’s diktat. A Pentagon press release in September boasted how over Labor Day weekend US warplanes attacked targets in six countries. The United States was not at war with any of them. And then there is Anwar al-Awlaki and his son, American citizens who were executed in Yemen by drone without any legal process, by executive order, after they were placed on a “kill list” compiled by the White House. But Obama’s poorest grades relate to his handling of Russia, Syria and Israel, all three of which might plausibly be seen as linked issues as Secretary Clinton once commented that Syria’s government would have to be brought down to benefit Israel while Russia is Syria’s most important ally. The problem with Syria is the policy itself. The only serious direct threat emanating from the country is ISIS, which has the capability to send suicide bombers and other dedicated terrorists to strike targets in the United States and Europe. To be sure, Washington is operating against ISIS, providing intelligence, equipment and training to its proxies and the “moderate” rebels that it supports in the country, but the effort is a mish mash, involving as it does feckless allies and clashing loyalties. The Pentagon and CIA have meanwhile been training batches of dubious recruits, some of whom turn their weapons over to the crazies at first opportunity. The Defense Department deflected completely accurate charges that it was supporting terrorists by changing the names of the groups involved. Amid the chaos, President Obama has even conceded that there are no moderate rebels. Defeating ISIS would be relatively simple if everyone were on the same page, but the White House persists in seeing the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad as the top priority, as if creating a power vacuum in Damascus would be a solution to what ISIS has been doing. And pressuring al-Assad also creates and feeds the ongoing problems with Russia. As the beltway groupthink goes, Syria minus al-Assad and Vladimir Putin would magically become a place where all the moderate, nation-building and democratically inclined forces would be able to come together and form a new government that would immeasurably benefit the Syrian people. That formulation is, of course, complete nonsense and it is Moscow that has a clear understanding of what is at stake, not Washington. The reality is that creating a power vacuum is precisely what provides the opportunity for militant groups to settle in and expand their authority. It is how al-Qaeda and ISIS both came into prominence. It happens because, as in Iraq and Libya, the Washington interventionists have no idea what might succeed as a post-civil war political system in Syria. Nor do they have any real plan for achieving a functioning polity. US administrations have already tried decapitation of existing leadership in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya with catastrophic results but one of the delights of the American political system is that all the key policy players change every four to eight years meaning that lessons learned are lost and have to be discovered a second time around, repeating as necessary. That regime change would work any better in Syria defies belief but it is nevertheless what Washington chooses to believe and by seeing al-Assad as an enemy it is hampering the effort against ISIS’s most effective asset: the Syrian Army backed up by Russian air support. And then there is Israel. Israel is, according to many Congressmen and the media, America’s best friend and greatest ally. It is a judgment that also defies belief as Tel Aviv and more particularly its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been persistently pursuing policies that are nominally opposed by the United States government, most particularly the expansion of its settlements. It has also interfered in US internal politics during elections and did not hesitate to exploit political divisions in Congress when Netanyahu was invited by GOP leaders to speak to a joint session to provide his perception of President Obama’s “misguided” negotiations with Iran. Israel is no friend of the United States even if it does receive an annual handout currently running at in excess of $3 billion and unlimited political cover in international bodies. Obama reportedly hates Netanyahu but did not have the courage to do anything about him. So the Obama record is a mixed bag, but mostly a disappointment. His presidency will be somewhat untouchable by those who do retrospectives, as least for a while, protected by Obama’s status as America’s first black president. It would have been nice to see real health care reform, a backing off from police state norms in the war on terror, and less lethal engagement in other people’s quarrels overseas, but I suppose Obama would argue that GOP obstruction and the Establishment consensus caused him to support policies and engage in compromises that he really wanted to avoid. There may be some truth to that but ultimately Obama comes across as yet another morally deficient head of state who presumably saw the folly in the status quo but ultimately decided that loyalty to his party and dedication to its continuation in power was more important than doing what was right. Ultimately, the acquisition of money and power are everything in our system of government and the brief trajectory of Barack Hussein Obama is no exception to that rule.

6845,WikiLeaks Releases Trove of Alleged C.I.A. Hacking Documents - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In what appears to be the largest leak of C. I. A documents in history, WikiLeaks released on Tuesday thousands of pages describing sophisticated software tools and techniques used by the agency to break into smartphones, computers and even   televisions. The documents amount to a detailed, highly technical catalog of tools. They include instructions for compromising a wide range of common computer tools for use in spying: the online calling service Skype   networks documents in PDF format and even commercial antivirus programs of the kind used by millions of people to protect their computers. A program called Wrecking Crew explains how to crash a targeted computer, and another tells how to steal passwords using the autocomplete function on Internet Explorer. Other programs were called CrunchyLimeSkies, ElderPiggy, AngerQuake and McNugget. The document dump was the latest coup for the antisecrecy organization and a serious blow to the C. I. A. which uses its hacking abilities to carry out espionage against foreign targets. The initial release, which WikiLeaks said was only the first installment in a larger collection of secret C. I. A. material, included 7, 818 web pages with 943 attachments, many of them partly redacted by WikiLeaks editors to avoid disclosing the actual code for cyberweapons. The entire archive of C. I. A. material consists of several hundred million lines of computer code, the group claimed. In one revelation that may especially trouble the tech world if confirmed, WikiLeaks said that the C. I. A. and allied intelligence services have managed to compromise both Apple and Android smartphones, allowing their officers to bypass the encryption on popular services such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. According to WikiLeaks, government hackers can penetrate smartphones and collect “audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. ” Unlike the National Security Agency documents Edward J. Snowden gave to journalists in 2013, they do not include examples of how the tools have been used against actual foreign targets. That could limit the damage of the leak to national security. But the breach was highly embarrassing for an agency that depends on secrecy. Robert M. Chesney, a specialist in national security law at the University of Texas at Austin, likened the C. I. A. trove to National Security Agency hacking tools disclosed last year by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. “If this is true, it says that N. S. A. isn’t the only one with an advanced, persistent problem with operational security for these tools,” Mr. Chesney said. “We’re getting bit time and again. ” There was no public confirmation of the authenticity of the documents, which were produced by the C. I. A. ’s Center for Cyber Intelligence and are mostly dated from 2013 to 2016. But one government official said the documents were real, and a former intelligence officer said some of the code names for C. I. A. programs, an organization chart and the description of a C. I. A. hacking base appeared to be genuine. The agency appeared to be taken by surprise by the document dump on Tuesday morning. A C. I. A. spokesman, Dean Boyd, said, “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents. ” In some regard, the C. I. A. documents confirmed and filled in the details on abilities that have long been suspected in technical circles. “The people who know a lot about security and hacking assumed that the C. I. A. was at least investing in these capabilities, and if they weren’t, then somebody else was  —   China, Iran, Russia, as well as a lot of other private actors,” said Beau Woods, the deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington. He said the disclosures may raise concerns in the United States and abroad about “the trustworthiness of technology where cybersecurity can impact human life and public safety. ” There is no evidence that the C. I. A. hacking tools have been used against Americans. But Ben Wizner, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said the documents suggest that the government has deliberately allowed vulnerabilities in phones and other devices to persist to make spying easier. “Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world,” Mr. Wizner said. “Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone’s digital life safer. ” WikiLeaks did not identify the source of the documents, which it called Vault 7, but said they had been “circulated among former U. S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. ” WikiLeaks said the source, in a statement, set out policy questions that “urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C. I. A. ’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. ” The source, the group said, “wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. ” But James Lewis, an expert on cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, raised another possibility: that a foreign state, most likely Russia, stole the documents by hacking or other means and delivered them to WikiLeaks, which may not know how they were obtained. Mr. Lewis noted that, according to American intelligence agencies, Russia hacked Democratic targets during the presidential campaign and gave thousands of emails to WikiLeaks for publication. “I think a foreign power is much more likely the source of these documents than a   C. I. A. ” Mr. Lewis said. At a time of increasing concern about the privacy of calls and messages, the revelations did not suggest that the C. I. A. can actually break the encryption used by popular messaging apps. Instead, by penetrating the user’s phone, the agency can make the encryption irrelevant by intercepting messages and calls before their content is encrypted, or, on the other end, after messages are decrypted. WikiLeaks, which has sometimes been accused of recklessly leaking information that could do harm, said it had redacted names and other identifying information from the collection. It said it was not releasing the computer code for actual, usable weapons “until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C. I. A. ’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should be analyzed, disarmed and published. ” The codes names used for projects revealed in the WikiLeaks documents appear to reflect the likely demographic of the cyberexperts employed by the C. I. A.  —   that is, young and male. There are numerous references to “Harry Potter,” Pokémon and Adderall, the drug used to treat hyperactivity. A number of projects were named after whiskey brands. Some were   single malt scotches, such as Laphroaig and Ardbeg. Others were from more pedestrian labels, such as Wild Turkey, which was described by its programmers, in mock dictionary style, as “(n.) A animal of the avian variety that has not been domesticated. Also a type of alcohol with a high proof (151). ” Some of the details of the C. I. A. programs might have come from the plot of a spy novel for the cyberage, revealing numerous highly classified  —   and, in some cases, exotic  —   hacking programs. One program,   Weeping Angel, uses Samsung “smart” televisions as covert listening devices. According to the WikiLeaks news release, even when it appears to be turned off, the television “operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a covert C. I. A. server. ” The release said the program was developed in cooperation with British intelligence. If C. I. A. agents did manage to hack the smart TVs, they would not be the only ones. Since their release,   televisions have been a focus for hackers and cybersecurity experts, many of whom see the sets’ ability to record and transmit conversations as a potentially dangerous vulnerability. In early 2015, Samsung started to include in the fine print terms of service for its smart TVs a warning that the television sets could capture background conversations. “Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition,” the warning said. Another program described in the documents, named Umbrage, is a voluminous library of cyberattack techniques that the C. I. A. has collected from malware produced by other countries, including Russia. According to the WikiLeaks release, the large number of techniques allows the C. I. A. to mask the origin of some of its attacks and confuse forensic investigators. The WikiLeaks material includes lists of software tools that the C. I. A. uses to create exploits and malware to carrying out hacking. Many of the tools are those used by developers around the world: coding languages, such as Python, and tools like Sublime Text, a program used to write code, and Git, a tool that helps developers collaborate. But the agency also appears to rely on software designed specifically for spies, such as Ghidra, which in one of the documents is described as “a reverse engineering environment created by the N. S. A. ” The Vault 7 release marks the latest in a series of huge leaks that have changed the landscape for government and corporate secrecy. In scale, the Vault 7 archive appears to fall into the same category as the biggest leaks of classified information in recent years, including the   diplomatic cables taken by Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst, and given to WikiLeaks in 2010, and the hundreds of thousands of National Security Agency documents taken by Mr. Snowden in 2013. In the business world, the   Panama Papers and several other   leaks have laid bare the details of secret offshore companies used by wealthy and corrupt people to hide their assets. Both government and corporate leaks have been made possible by the ease of downloading, storing and transferring millions of documents in seconds or minutes, a sea change from the use of slow photocopying for some earlier leaks, including the Pentagon Papers in 1971.",0
6846,Target Raises Free Shipping Purchase Amount for Online Shoppers as Other Retailers Lower It,"As other retailers have begun lowering the threshold for online shoppers to qualify for free shipping, retail giant Target is now raising its limit, according to reports. [Target quietly and without fanfare raised its minimum purchase requirement from $25 to $35 on May 7. The company had offered free shipping to purchases of $25 and above since 2015, according to CNBC.  “Target regularly reviews and adjusts our online shipping policies and practices to better serve guests and enhance our business,” the retailer said to a query from CNBC. Target credit and debit card holders will continue to get free shipping on any purchase, the company said. The hike in the minimum purchase comes after retailers like Amazon. com and Walmart had lowered their threshold for the perk. Amazon recently moved from $35 down to $25 while Walmart moved from $50 down to $35 in January. The unannounced change in shipping fees came only a week after news broke that company CEO Brian Cornell’s compensation was slashed by nearly   falling to $11. 3 million due to the company’s poor performance. Target has been beset by financial loss after a year of declining sales, tumbling share prices, and a major slide in its brand name. The company has seen four quarters of sales declines in a row and has a loss of over $15 billion year over year. And since April of last year, the company’s brand name has also taken a drubbing. The fall was bad enough that many investment advisers downgraded Target to a “strong sell” even as its falling price might seem to make it an attractive buy. The recommendations against Target were renewed this month when Gordon Haskett Research also advised customers to dump Target stock and replace it with Walmart stock. The investment advisor said Target is “moving too slow” to fix the problems leading to its precipitous decline. Target has seen falling fortunes since its April 2016 announcement that men pretending to be transgender women entering a Target location would be allowed to use any bathroom or changing room they felt like using at any given time. By February of this year the company lost $15 billion since its   announcement and had lost over $30 per share since its high last year. The chain also suffered a massive, organized boycott that earned over a million signatures in only a few weeks.

6847,The Tyranny of Other People’s Vacation Photos - The New York Times,"Chief among my favorite Facebook memories is the time that a   journalist of my acquaintance breezily informed us all that he was at the Grill Room of the Four Seasons with Ted Danson, tucking into some sea urchin. To which one friend responded, “That’s funny, because I’m at the Midtown tunnel with Rhea Perlman, eating shawarma. ” While some frequent users of social media are merely fabulous, others savvily buff their fabulousness to a dazzling gleam, becoming fahvolous. At no point in the year is this more evident than in August and early September, when Facebook and Instagram swell with the plump, juicy,   harvest of summer: vacation photos. What prompts the excessive posting of these pictures? William Haynes, a    comedian who hosts the SourceFed show “People Be Like,” said: “I like how my generation is all about sharing. What’s the point of having a vacation unless you can tell people about it immediately? If you can get a few Instagram photos out of it, you’ve made your money back. ” Indeed, the motivation behind many fahvolous vacation photos would seem to be a rationalization of large expenditures for the purpose of recreation: a $6, 000 beach rental ought to bring you $6, 000 worth of pleasure, and maybe posting a photo will get the dopamine flowing. But one can detect other motives, too: a   attempt at   a neurotic attempt to thank your host, a need for constant scrutiny. Noxious selfie sticks now seem like nothing compared to the sophisticated camera filters that can turn an   strawberry patch into a brooding welter of   chiaroscuro. Some people even hire professional photographers to take their vacation snaps for them. In the future, it may be unsurprising at a lakeside picnic to hear a   nephew turn to his Aunt Marjorie and ask: “What’s your day rate?” Equally jarring, some Instagram and Facebook users seem to want us to know that their summer is more inherently summery than ours: more barefoot, more glistening, more  . These folks are biting into the fresh fig of life, and this biting produces carefree laughter. My natural habitat is an oceanside bonfire where a Viggo Mortensen   strums a weathered guitar! All backyards are enlivened by a spray of    girls in sundresses! Everything I eat in August is cooked on a stick! While it’s fairly easy to categorize the photographically incontinent under the headlines Narcissistic and Insecure, or some combination thereof, the   folks may not have the same clarity about themselves. “People often don’t know that they’re the culprit,” said Marla Vannucci, a clinical psychologist who is an associate professor at Adler University. “I have a client who really wants Likes, so he posts a lot of photos,” Dr. Vannucci said. “When people don’t respond to them, he feels very alone. So he posts more. It’s a cycle like any interpersonal cycle in which we’re doing something that people hate but we’re doing it to try to make people like us. With that type of client, I try to find out what the motivation for posting is: What are the feelings around it? What is he looking for? Then I try to help him find other outlets. ” For those on the receiving end of such founts of images, the critical factors are frequency and tone. On the frequency front, young Mr. Haynes had a good suggestion: “I think you get three photos per location. ” If you can’t remember whether you already posted a picture of that covered bridge, you are in danger of overestimating other people’s interest in covered bridges. The question of tone is more nuanced. In 2014, the software company CyberLink sponsored a poll of 2, 268 adults in the United States, “with the hypothesis,” the company’s senior vice president for global marketing, Richard Carriere, told me, “that some people have a tendency to post photos on social media just to gloat and annoy their friends and colleagues. ” The study found that one in seven who own a smartphone and who use social media would unfollow or block someone who posts what they perceive as boastful vacation pictures. Moreover, one in four will attempt to share a photo within one hour of arriving at their destination  —   which makes many of us want to summon from deep within us the   drama teacher who gets two syllables out of “Breeeeathe. ” The top reasons that those sampled said they would Like or Favorite a picture were: if it showed friends and family sharing a special moment (63 percent) they look happy (58 percent) or they look genuine and natural (48 percent). I expressed surprise to Mr. Carriere that the poll didn’t break down the specifics of bothersome photos. I said, “I’m going to guess that the most troublesome one would be a vacation photo in which your ex is dating someone who’s essentially you, but 15 years younger, and it’s a picture of the two of them in the tiny fishing village in Portugal that you turned your ex on to in the first place. ” Mr. Carriere said, “I would definitely unfriend my ex for that. ” In some instances, people exposed to what they perceive to be a surfeit of photos will express their ire offline. In 2014, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published an article about a couple who received an anonymous letter in the mail about their Facebook posts. The letter read, in part, “It’s a little upsetting seeing, hearing and reading about someone’s vacations all year while we all can’t afford one. ” The letter concluded with: “Go have some kids and don’t be so selfish as to only think of yourselves all the time. ” Yet one of the trips the couple had taken was a trip to New York that they had bought at a breast cancer benefit, not to mention the fact that the wife of the couple works as a psychotherapist who specializes in helping sexually and physically abused children. Equally odd were the facts that the letter’s envelope was emblazoned with a bright yellow smiley sticker and that the postmark was Miami, a city that none of the couple’s friends live in. So maybe the letter writer was on vacation at the time. The wife of the couple put the letter on Facebook with the instruction: “Please feel free to unfriend us from Facebook as we clearly are not ‘friends.’ If you’re unsure how to unfriend someone, go to the ‘Help’ menu. ” The couples’ friends rallied with support in the post’s comments section. “Maybe if they spent less time on FB stalking you,” one wrote, “they could work more, make more money and go on a vacation, too. ” In certain rare instances, too many vacation photos are not enough. Dr. Vannucci said that after one of his clients had his wedding canceled at the last minute, he “was really struggling. ” He posted that it was called off but that he was still going to “enjoy the honeymoon. ” On came a cavalcade of photos of one man’s painful efforts at readjustment, all of them captioned, Dr. Vannucci said, “with funny, raw but heartbreaking comments. ” One groom’s Stations of the Cross. Conscious that my own trickle of   emotionally stifled summertime photos on Facebook is its own version of fahvolousness, I spent a recent trip to Spain   myself. While, yes, I did share a picture of an outpost of the restaurant chain Museo del Jamon, I did not post a slew of others. Not the stylish dog walker and her dachshund that I intended to caption “Tiny pants, tiny dog: Madrid. ” Not the gorgeous   ceilings of the Alhambra. Not the   trip home when my boyfriend clutched his   neck pillow to his chest and referred to it as “comfort bosoms. ” But am I being immodest when I tell you that I now see these omissions as a disservice to my friends and colleagues, who may have loved them. I am trying to calibrate my photographic output. As we all should. In the meantime, let us all delicately start a conversation about one of this topic’s thorniest issues. Indeed, let us try to find some common ground with respect to photography’s one essential verity. I’ll start us out here: All sunsets are kitsch.",0
6848,Trump To Clear Way For Oil Pipelines,"by Yves Smith 
By Nick Cunningham, a Vermont-based writer on energy and environmental issues. You can follow him on twitter at @nickcunningham1. Originally published at OilPrice 
Donald Trump’s victory could ultimately lead to a lot more oil pipelines moving forward, one sector of the fossil fuel industry specifically targeted by environmentalists. 
The most controversial project right now, the Dakota Access Pipeline, received a jolt from Tuesday’s result. The more than 1,100-mile pipeline, valued at $3.7 billion, would carry oil from North Dakota to refineries in Illinois. The Obama administration has requested a temporary halt to construction, although the company behind the project, Energy Transfer Partners, has pressed forward, ignoring the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps reiterated a request for a stoppage this week, but the outcome is up in the air. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline has been reeling from protests, work stoppages, bad press and a federal government willing to listen to the grievances from the Native American community affected. Trump has shown little inclination of being as accommodating, so the Dakota Access Pipeline has gone from being a project on the ropes to one with a great deal of momentum. Unless the Corps rescinds a permit in the next few months, the project will move forward. Even if it is blocked, however, it would likely be revived under a Trump administration. Energy Transfer Partners’ stock price surged as much as 9 percent on Wednesday and was up more than 3 percent on Thursday. The company hopes to complete construction by the first quarter of 2017. 
And Dakota Access’ predecessor, at least in terms of a national flashpoint, could also be coming back from the dead. TransCanada issued a statement on Wednesday, telegraphing the company’s interest in reviving the defunct Keystone XL Pipeline, which would take Alberta tar sands to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. “TransCanada remains fully committed to building Keystone XL,” spokesman Mark Cooper said in the post-election statement. “We are evaluating ways to engage the new administration on the benefits, the jobs and the tax revenues this project brings to the table.” TransCanada’s stock price jumped more than 2 percent on Wednesday. 
During the campaign Trump said that he supported the pipeline, but wanted the U.S. to get a “better deal.” His words are often conflicting and contradictory – he has also said that he is for an “America First” energy plan that would remove “all barriers to responsible energy production.” So there is no reason to think that he wouldn’t simply revive the project as is, especially given that he is surrounding himself with advisors from the oil and gas industry. 
Beyond these two projects, the oil industry is hoping for broader easing of permitting and regulations on pipeline construction. The Army Corps under Trump could clear the way for energy infrastructure, downgrading its scrutiny of the effects on rivers and lakes from oil pipelines. “We’re hopeful the pipeline approval process will now be allowed to work without political interference,” John Stoody, vice president of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, told E&E News. And with plans to dismantle much of the EPA, the ability to break ground and lay down pipeline could get a whole lot easier. 
While Trump supports the Keystone XL Pipeline, his presidency complicates things for Canada a bit. For one, he wants to renegotiate NAFTA. But leaving that aside, the resuscitation of Keystone XL could create problems for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was thought to be nearing an approval for the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, which would take Alberta oil to the Pacific Coast. It is not obvious that both the Keystone XL Pipeline and Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Pipeline both need to be built.

Alberta’s Premier is not ready to put all her eggs in one basket by trusting that the pathway to Canada’s south for oil will be cleared up. “We must continue to work to diversity Canada’s energy markets, and to build trading relationships with more than one buyer,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement following Trump’s victory. “For that reason, a Canadian pipeline to tidewater remains an important priority for Alberta.” 
Finally, the environmental movement has been left shocked and terrified over what a Trump administration would mean for the environment, but they have vowed not to give an inch. “I think they will greenlight lots of fossil fuel projects,” Jane Kleeb, a key activist fighting the Keystone XL Pipeline in Nebraska, told E&E News . “And we’ll fight all of them.” 0 0 0 0 0 0",0
6849,Reflections From Rio - The New York Times,"Two weeks ago, Pita Taufatofua gained a sudden, if fleeting, international fame. At the opening ceremony of the Rio Games, Taufatofua carried the flag of the tiny South Pacific nation Tonga while shirtless and covered in coconut oil, his sculptured torso gleaming. Besides lighting up the internet, his   appearance earned him a segment on the “Today” show, in which the hosts enthusiastically, and to some controversy, oiled him up. But Taufatofua is fundamentally an athlete. And with the Olympics almost over, he finally got his chance to be an athlete on Saturday morning, in the heavyweight taekwondo competition. Taufatofua was up against it. At 32, he was fighting in his first Olympics after three failed attempts to qualify. His opponent, Sajjad Mardani of Iran, had won a silver medal at the 2013 world championships. Taufatofua saluted the fans when he arrived at the mat. They quickly adopted him, chanting, “Tonga, Tonga. ” Mardani struck quickly. The score was   and then  . Taufatofua gamely attacked, trying punches and spinning kicks. When he scored his one and only point, the crowd exploded, and he raised a fist in triumph. Final score:  . “I lost, and I’m smiling,” Taufatofua said afterward. “I got a point, and it was the happiest point I ever got in my life. ” It is easy to be cynical about the pieties of the Olympics, and some in the skeptical press corps may have found Taufatofua, who works as a counselor for homeless children, too good to be true. But why not end the Games with a dose of Tongan idealism? Taufatofua says his goal is to “bring the world closer together. ” A sincere good luck to him. VICTOR MATHER I was moving around the Maracanã stadium during the opening ceremony when I bumped into performers dressed in   critter costumes in a hall leading to the stands. They had left the field a few minutes before, and with a sign warning cast members not to go into the stands, they were essentially forbidden to watch the opening ceremony that they had helped to make. Still, they seemed enchanted and proud of the ceremony some had teary eyes. I was happy that they broke the rule and got to see a bit of the beautiful show they had helped put on. As it turned out, it was common to see the work force trying to sneak a peek at the Olympics. Ticket prices kept the Games out of reach for   Brazilians, and workers at the Games, well, had to work. But I saw cleaning people off to the side, trying to watch the judoka Rafaela Silva win Brazil’s first gold medal of the Games. SERGIO PEÇANHA I arrived late to a men’s basketball game between Argentina and the United States, and the press section was filled to overflowing. So much the better. I wandered out into the stands and found a seat among the Argentines, who had descended on Rio de Janeiro by the many thousands for this game. I am a lifetime Mets fan, which describes its own sort of insanity, and I found gloriously lunatic and recognizable companions. For two hours, they jumped up and down in unison and sang. They screamed they whistled they cried. And I can say with clinical accuracy that for the first time in my life, as the far bigger American squad asserted its writ and the game slipped away from Argentina, I saw men trying to pull their hair out. Sitting among fans is one of the great joys of the Olympics. In Manaus, in heat so radiant you could all but touch it, I sat among Colombian soccer fans who rained wonderfully creative chants on Hope Solo, the        American goalkeeper. The Brazilians joined in  —   Solo had earlier implied that Brazil could be enjoyed only with a mosquito net and a scarf over the face  —   with chants of “Zika! Zika!” (My interpreter told me of many other wondrously creative insults, almost all of which, unfortunately, cannot be published here.) MICHAEL POWELL News conferences are always overstuffed with reporters and prone to zaniness when Usain Bolt is involved. Just before the Games began, Bolt held a media event in Rio de Janeiro featuring   dancers and a journalist who rapped a question. Late Thursday, after he had won the gold medal in the   dash, Bolt arrived at a news conference room and plopped into a chair between Andre De Grasse of Canada and Christophe Lemaitre of France, who had won silver and bronze. Before the athletes had stepped onto the stage, a press officer for the Olympics had suggested to the dozens of reporters that they play a prank on Bolt by directing questions only to the other runners. The lark lasted for about three questions before a local journalist, who had apparently missed the directive, started to ask Bolt something. The room filled with boos, and then laughter, leaving Bolt with a confused smile. Moments later, another reporter took the microphone. “Usain, let’s imagine Bob Marley is alive,” he began. The reporter wanted to know what Marley, a Jamaica native like Bolt, would have named a song had he written one about Bolt. The crowd broke up again with laughter, but Bolt grinned and took the question in stride. “‘Greatest of All Time,’” he said. ANDREW KEH The Olympics are a realm where displays of grace and boorish behavior occur one after another, and sometimes simultaneously. To wit, the   men’s badminton match between Scott Evans of Ireland and Ygor Coelho de Oliveira of Brazil. Even before a point was scored, history was made: De Oliveira was the first Brazilian man to compete at the Olympics in the sport. He had learned at an academy,   by his father, in a favela not far from where the competition unfolded. Naturally, the stands were chockablock with de Oliveira’s fans. Chants of “Ygor, Ygor” might have been among the most joyful noises made in the last three weeks. But much of the glee was drained from the arena in the first game, which de Oliveira lost,  . Evans’s overhead smash seemed unreturnable. De Oliveira made a few unforced errors. It looked hopeless. But in the second game, de Oliveira elevated his game. He stopped making mistakes and started putting away the shuttlecock with dink shots that barely cleared the net. When he took a commanding lead and then eked out a   win in the second game, his fans were in a state of near hysteria. That proved to be the peak of de Oliveira mania. He lost the third and final game, and it was not close. When the match ended, Evans acted as if he had won the gold and the lottery. He ran in circles. He took off his shirt. He left de Oliveira at the net, waiting for a handshake. It was the kind of obnoxiousness usually seen only in professional wrestling, where performers want to be booed. The Brazilian crowd obliged, of course. But de Oliveira kept his poise, a    mature beyond his years  —   and perhaps already plotting his path to the next Olympics. DAVID SEGAL Soldiers and police officers provided a constant backdrop at the Rio Olympics, and after a while you didn’t pay much attention to their presence. Still, an armed escort for a news media bus was out of the ordinary. When one did appear late on a Saturday night while I was riding back to the press center from an outlying venue, I took notice. What was striking, though, at least to me, was that none of the other two dozen journalists aboard seemed to notice. And what were my fellow members of the news media doing while we traveled along a highway with a soldier or a police officer (hard to say which) on a motorcycle in front of us and a truck filled with soldiers bringing up the rear? Well, some were dozing. (Covering the Olympics is a grind, and it was late.) All the others were looking at their phones. This was the bus line that had gained attention when a window was shattered by something  —   perhaps a bullet, more likely a rock. That may have explained why, days later, we were suddenly getting an escort. It doesn’t explain, of course, why no one else noticed. But did I mention it was late? JAY SCHREIBER Badminton players take their shuttlecocks seriously. The little feathery birds, after all, are critical to the game. I got a sense of this when I wrote about how they are made. Olympic referees and representatives of Yonex, which made the shuttles used in Rio, talked lovingly about them. So I asked where they were kept, assuming they would be in a special   secret vault. I was led behind a giant black curtain that separated the three main courts and the fans from the event organizers and the athletes. Within 50 feet, I came upon a door to a temporary office. I could have scaled the flimsy walls, and there was no roof. Inside was a storage space with a bunch of cardboard boxes holding the shuttlecocks. How dull is that? Still, the sneak peek made me realize how finicky athletes are about their pursuits and their equipment, and how the rest of the world will never fully understand. KEN BELSON Crowds of ticket buyers swelled in one area Wednesday night, but no sporting events were taking place there. Far from the Olympic Park, in the Botafogo neighborhood, a   neoclassical mansion sparkled. Security personnel, some wearing thobes, traditional Qatari men’s tops, directed gawkers to the ticket window. For 20 reais  —   a little more than $6  —   they could find out why so many people had flocked there during the past two weeks. This was part of an entirely separate competition, carried out by large multinational companies and foreign governments looking to promote their causes with hospitality suites. In scale, the Qatari government left all others in the dust, renting a    site that the   Daros Latinamerica Collection, an art exhibitor, owned until last year. The collection sold what is still called Casa Daros to a Brazilian school backed by the billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, a friend of Warren Buffett’s. Inside, Brazilians donned abayas, a type of traditional Qatari women’s garb. A museum feel still prevailed, as several rooms displayed Qatar’s plans for, and the work it has done on, the 2022 World Cup, which it will host. Given the struggles of FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, Qatar is under pressure to defend itself. It was making a hard sale.   guides walked multiple groups of more than a dozen Brazilians through the exhibits. One room even showcased Qatar’s antidoping lab. In the main hall, hundreds of Brazilians sampled Qatari clothes and calligraphy. One area, though, was  : the two fancy restaurants. They were reserved for International Olympic Committee and Qatar Olympic Committee officials and their families. Some things never change. VINOD SREEHARSHA Every morning in the Olympic Park, dozens of reporters gathered in a large meeting room, named Samba, for the daily news conference of the International Olympic Committee. It happened in English, and sometimes partly in Portuguese, with live translation into eight other languages. We collected a lot of facts that never made it into stories: the count of urine samples taken from Olympians (3, 491 as of Friday) the average number of daily visitors to the Olympic Park megastore (85, 000) and the   items there (a plush toy mascot,   and caipirinha shot glasses). Over the weeks, there were questions about the color of the diving pool water (why did it turn green?) the Ryan Lochte incident (why did official stories change?) transportation troubles at the Games (why the shortage of cars and buses?) and the splashy arrest of a top Olympic official who was accused of scalping tickets. Officials answered some of those questions directly. They skillfully deflected others, or declined to respond, they said, for legal reasons. Halfway through the Games, as we settled in for the morning ritual, a reporter turned to me and proclaimed the dodge ball event to be his favorite one of the Olympics. “Which venue is that in?” I asked. “It’s here,” he replied, “in Samba. ” REBECCA R. RUIZ Athletes’ comments are often scripted and anodyne, full of tedious platitudes. As with actors, sometimes you just don’t want to hear their earnest recitations about how they prepared for their roles. So how great it was to see (on TV, not in person) the O’Donovan brothers, Gary and Paul, of Ireland,   with excitement after winning their silver medal in the lightweight double sculls? It was their country’s first rowing medal, and its first medal in Rio. Interviewed by Irish television, the two mused on the novelty of the medal process  —   they got to wear “podium pants,” whatever those are, for the ceremony  —   and the strange exigencies of the postrace doping test. “I was trying to take a pee in a cup for them, and I drank about 10 liters of water,” Paul O’Donovan said. “I’m quite full, to be honest. ” They talked about how hungry they were. “We haven’t had anything to eat since two hours ago, when we had bread rolls and some Nutella,” Gary O’Donovan said. They said they were sorry not to be back home at the pub in Lisheen, in a rural part of County Cork, where their friends were celebrating their victory. Paul, who had caused earlier   delight by describing his rowing technique as “close the eyes and pull like a dog,” added that the two actually enjoyed giving interviews. In a competition too full of   preening egotists, this was the best comment of all. “We are just excited that we have other people to talk to apart from ourselves,” he said. SARAH LYALL On my way to interview an International Olympic Committee official in the organization’s luxury hotel on the beach, I hopped into an Uber. The car was nice. Leather seats. Little candies in the cup holder. The driver, who was wearing a suit, offered me water or juice from a cooler on the front seat. “Do you need anything to make the drive more comfortable?” he asked in nearly perfect English. I complimented him on his professionalism and service. Many Uber drivers in Rio, he explained, are businessmen who lost their jobs in the recession. Just before the Olympics, he said, he was laid off from his position at a global technology company. He had worked in the United States for several years. Now he was driving to make ends meet. His Uber car was actually his wife’s car because he considered his own vehicle too expensive to use. The windows on that car were bulletproof because his drive to work had been so dangerous. He would not be attending any Olympic events, he said. Not enough cash for that. He dropped me off at the hotel, where I had to go through tight security to enter the building. I. O. C. members are receiving $900 per diem payments, according to news reports. The dichotomy between life at the I. O. C. and life here was glaring. JULIET MACUR Olympic pin trading might someday become a medal sport at the Games, but for now it’s a great way to meet people from different countries and take on the adventure of haggling in different languages. And really, for me, the Olympics are all about meeting people. So when a young Brazilian was determined to give me an Estonia pin for my beautiful Canada pin (in the shape of a maple leaf) I had to say no. You see, there was a story behind the Canada pin, which I relayed to my potential new trading partner. The woman who had given me the pin had said she would do so if I did a handstand. I explained that my handstand days were long past (actually, they never existed). We had a good laugh, and we worked out a deal for a New York Times pin. That little interlude made the pin more valuable to me because I had that story to tell. I could see that the young man was disappointed, so I offered him a more bland Canada pin I had obtained earlier. He wasn’t interested, and off we went in opposite directions. A few minutes later, he tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Let’s make a story. ” JIM LUTTRELL Katie Ledecky was talking about Bruce Gemmell, her swimming coach since the fall of 2012, when her voice cracked and tears welled in her eyes. It was after her last race, the   freestyle, in which she had shattered her world record for her fifth medal, and her fourth gold. With her Summer Games finally done, Ledecky seemed to realize that the childhood chapter of her life was also coming to a close. In a few weeks, she would be leaving home in Bethesda, Md. for her freshman year at Stanford. The magnitude of the week that was behind her and the year that stretched in front of her  —   new coast, new coach, new school, new team, new friends  —   appeared to overwhelm Ledecky, who began to cry as she sat on the interview dais, flanked by the silver medalist Jazmin Carlin and the bronze medalist Boglarka Kapas. As Ledecky struggled to regain her composure, Carlin reached over and petted her arm, as if to console her. Never mind that Ledecky had beaten Carlin by 11 seconds at that moment, Ledecky had never looked less like a swimming machine. KAREN CROUSE",0
6850,"Report: San Francisco Considers Crackdown on Uber and Lyft, Demands Company Data - Breitbart","The city of San Francisco is demanding statistics and details from   companies Uber and Lyft to “assess their impact on traffic congestion, safety, pollution, and parking and ascertain whether they are accessible for disabled and   riders. ”[“City Attorney Dennis Herrera on Monday subpoenaed Uber and Lyft to disgorge records on four years of driving practices, disability access and service in San Francisco,” reported the San Francisco Chronicle this week. “The companies have steadfastly declined to share data other than that they have about 45, 000 drivers in the Bay Area. ”  The city is demanding information on “miles and hours logged by drivers, incentives that encourage drivers to ‘commute’ from as far away as Fresno or Los Angeles, driver guidance and training, accessible vehicle information, and the services provided to residents of every San Francisco neighborhood,” according to the Chronicle, and if they fail to comply within fifteen days, court penalties will be imposed. “No one disputes the convenience of the   industry, but that convenience evaporates when you’re stuck in traffic behind a   Uber or Lyft, or when you can’t get a ride because the vehicle isn’t accessible to someone with a disability or because the algorithm disfavors the neighborhood where you live,” said City Attorney Dennis Herrera, before also criticizing the effects of fatigued drivers who work for too many hours. “These fatigued drivers are not only a threat to themselves, but to San Francisco pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers,” Herrera claimed. “Policies that encourage or turn a blind eye to drowsy driving by drivers with little or no familiarity with San Francisco’s roads or weather conditions make our city less safe. They are a public nuisance. ” Both Uber and Lyft claim that releasing such information to the city could risk company secrets, and empower competition. “We’re more than happy to work with the city to address congestion, but it should be a comprehensive solution including construction, the city’s population increase, and the rise of online delivery services,” said Uber spokesman Eva Behrend. “In San Francisco, nearly 30 percent of rides take place in underserved neighborhoods and 20 percent of Lyft rides begin or end at a public transit station,” said spokeswoman Chelsea Harrison in a statement, addressing concerns about access to transportation. “We also have a track record of working collaboratively with policymakers who regulate us, including the (PUC) here in California, to ensure that our service complements existing transportation options. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

6851,Secrecy of Settlements at Fox News Hid Bad Behavior - The New York Times,"Like many companies confronted with sexual harassment in their executive ranks, Fox News and its parent, 21st Century Fox, say they do not tolerate such behavior and have strict policies prohibiting it. “As we’ve made clear, there’s absolutely no room anywhere at our company for behavior that disrespects women or contributes to an uncomfortable work environment,” a 21st Century Fox spokeswoman told The New York Times after the paper reported that about a dozen women at Fox News and Fox Business Network had experienced some form of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior. If that’s so, how could the former Fox News chief executive, Roger Ailes, have conducted what now appears to have been a   campaign of sexual abuse and harassment of subordinates? Mr. Ailes has denied any wrongdoing. But thanks to two women who were courageous enough to speak out  —   Rudi Bakhtiar (in The Times) and Laurie Luhn (in New York magazine)  —   we know now that Fox News had already paid millions to settle sexual harassment accusations years before the lawsuit by a former Fox News anchor, Gretchen Carlson, that led to Mr. Ailes’s resignation this summer. The bottom line? Neither Mr. Ailes nor any other Fox News executive suffered any consequences before Ms. Carlson’s lawsuit and the subsequent investigation. The previous victims who filed complaints left the company, their careers in ruins, and in return for money, signed agreements that muzzled them. A 21st Century Fox spokesman, Nathaniel Brown, said the company had no comment beyond its previous statements. “A lot of men have gotten away with sexual harassment with absolutely no consequences,” said Catharine A. MacKinnon, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and Harvard Law School who pioneered sexual harassment lawsuits. No matter what companies say, she added, “the real rule is that the more powerful a man is, the more he gets away with. ” Jon Bauer, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut who has written extensively about workplace discrimination, also says the issue goes well beyond Fox News. “Employees are rewarded for shielding powerful people in the organization,” he said. “That’s the culture in many workplace settings. ” The problem is compounded by settlements, like those at Fox News and most organizations, that impose silence on the victims. It’s certainly understandable that companies would want to avoid the bad publicity and put such matters behind them. But at the same time, they foster the perception that the settlements are really   especially when no disciplinary steps are taken against the perpetrators. Professor Bauer likened the situation to the sexual abuse scandal that engulfed the Catholic Church. “We’ve done thousands of confidential settlements,” said Gloria Allred, a civil rights lawyer who has probably handled more prominent sexual harassment cases than anyone. “We do them every day. Complete confidentiality is usually the condition for a settlement. This can be very difficult for our clients. They want to be compensated and they want to tell the world about it. I tell them that’s just not going to happen. ” (Full disclosure: The New York Times Company has also entered into confidential agreements in settling employment cases.) Victims of sexual harassment can see what happens to other victims who came forward. “It’s career suicide to come forward,” said Professor MacKinnon. “You’re roadkill. Women know this, yet some come forward. That’s what courage looks like. ” It’s not just women who may suffer the consequences. Last week, The Times reported that the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates had settled sexual harassment accusations by Christopher Tarui, who claimed that his boss had “caressed” his back in a hotel room and repeatedly propositioned him for sex. After he rebuffed his boss, Mr. Tarui’s complaint states, he received a poor performance review. Mr. Tarui said he had been discouraged from pursuing a claim, and when it became clear that he was filing one, he was escorted out of the office and placed on a paid leave of absence. He has since found another job. Terms of that settlement, too, are confidential. Bridgewater, in a statement, emphasized that Mr. Tarui had withdrawn his claims. Bridgewater said it had waived a noncompete clause so that Mr. Tarui could take another job and paid him no money as part of the settlement. A spokesman for the firm declined further comment. Most employment contracts, including Ms. Carlson’s, also require any sexual harassment claims to go to arbitration, where all evidence and proceedings are secret. “I’d love to see the end of the requirement to go to arbitration as a condition of employment,” Ms. Allred said. “If a claim can’t be resolved, an employee should have the right to file a lawsuit and have her day in court. ” That would require legislation, because courts have generally upheld such arbitration clauses. Even though the terms of the Luhn settlement were confidential, others at Fox News and 21st Century Fox should have known about it. And if so, they should have taken steps to investigate and, if warranted, discipline executives who violated company policy, not to mention federal law. Given the size of Ms. Luhn’s settlement  —   $3. 15 million, according to New York magazine  —   Fox News must have believed that the claim had some merit. “If that’s correct, it’s a serious number, and she must have had a serious claim,” Ms. Allred said. At Fox News, Dianne Brandi, executive vice president for business and legal affairs, handled Ms. Luhn’s claim. She presumably conducted an investigation, if only to assess the merits of Ms. Luhn’s claim. Fox News’s parent company has said no one there knew about the Luhn payment until recently, and a Fox News spokeswoman said previously that Mr. Ailes alone directed the settlement negotiations and agreed to the terms. Ms. Brandi would appear to have plenty to answer for. Not only should Mr. Ailes have had no involvement in disposing of the matter given that he was the subject of the claim, but ethical standards suggest that she should have told higher ranking executives and perhaps even Rupert Murdoch, who was 21st Century Fox’s chief executive at the time, or members of the company’s board. The New York State Rules of Professional Conduct require internal lawyers who know of behavior “substantially likely” to injure the corporation to take all steps “reasonably necessary” to protect the company, which may include notifying the company’s board. “It’s the obligation of the   lawyer to protect the company,” Professor MacKinnon said. “Unfortunately, when you’re dealing with a   executive like Ailes, there’s a tendency to see protecting the company as the same as protecting him. They should be protecting the company from him. ” A Fox News spokeswoman, Irena Briganti, declined to make Ms. Brandi available for comment. The upshot: Despite decades of E. E. O. C. enforcement proceedings and the widespread adoption of strict   policies in the workplace, most sexual harassment claims never get reported and most of those that do get swept under the rug. “Sexual harassment is still a massive problem,” Ms. Allred said. “It’s severe and it’s pervasive. ” But in the aftermath of Mr. Ailes’s resignation, there is hope for improvement. After Ms. Carlson filed her suit, Fox News and 21st Century Fox did what they should have done years ago when faced with similar accusations: They hired outside counsel for an investigation, and when overwhelming evidence mounted, demanded Mr. Ailes’s resignation. “It’s hard to overstate how important it is that even someone as powerful as Ailes was held accountable,” Professor MacKinnon said. “There have been a lot of situations where you’d come to the conclusion that the law doesn’t matter, and that what does matter is power, the rule of force. Then something like this comes along and you realize the law does matter. A lot of women are going to take heart from that. ”",0
6852,Kunitz’s Double-OT Goal Sends Penguins Back to Stanley Cup - Breitbart,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  —   Chris Kunitz spent a portion of the spring nursing a   injury and wondering if his time with the Pittsburgh Penguins was over. The veteran forward’s contract is up this summer and he’s been around long enough to know how these things go, particularly when you’re 37. [“It’s not fun thinking about the future,” Kunitz said.  He found a pretty compelling way to put it off for at least four more games and push his team to the brink of history in the process. Kunitz’s knuckling shot from outside the circle fluttered past Craig Anderson 5:09 into the second overtime to give the defending Stanley Cup champions a   victory over the Ottawa Senators in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference final Thursday night. Thrust alongside old linemate Sidney Crosby as the game wore on, the two reconnected for a goal that moved the Penguins closer to becoming the first team since the 1998 Detroit Red Wings to win    titles. Crosby sent a soft backhand pass from the right faceoff circle to Kunitz and for a moment, it seemed like old times. “With the way he was holding the stick you could tell he wanted it bad,” Crosby said. “I just tried to lay it there for him. I’ve seen him score from there pretty often. It was a huge goal for us, and a great reward for him for the way he played all night. ” Kunitz scored twice, his first two of the playoffs. Justin Schultz added the other in his return from an   injury, and Matt Murray stopped 27 shots on his 23rd birthday. The Penguins will host Western Conference champion Nashville in Game 1 on Monday night. Not bad for a team that watched so many of its core players  —   from defenseman Kris Letang to Evgeni Malkin to Crosby  —   deal with some serious bumps along the way. And yet here they are on the doorstep to a title once again. “If you look at the amount of guys who have played on this roster throughout the course of the year, it’s a lot of guys,” Crosby said. “The biggest step is ahead. ” Mark Stone and Ryan Dzingel scored for Ottawa. The Senators rallied twice to tie it, with Dzingel making it   with 5:19 left in regulation. Craig Anderson made 39 saves, but couldn’t get a handle on Kunitz’s shot as the Senators fell to   in Game 7s in franchise history. Just don’t call them cursed. A year ago, Ottawa didn’t even make the playoffs yet they found a way to push the Penguins to the 85th minute of Game 7 of the conference finals. “We wanted to make then earn it and they earned it, rightfully so,” said Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson, who assisted on both of Ottawa’s goals and played the entire postseason with a pair of hairline fractures in his left heel. “We got to give it to them. They were the better team. ” The Senators forced a return trip to Pittsburgh  —   where they lost   in Game 5 on Sunday  —   by leaning heavily on Anderson in a   Game 6 victory. Ottawa coach Guy Boucher told his team to not get caught up in the big picture but instead focus on the small ones, a recipe that carried the Senators throughout a bumpy transition under their   head coach to within a victory of the franchise’s second Cup appearance. The Penguins, trying to become the first defending champion to return to the Final since Detroit in 2009, came in confident they would advance if they could replicate their dominant Game 6, when they were undone only by Anderson’s brilliance. Pittsburgh has been nearly unflappable in the face of adversity under Mike Sullivan, and is now   in playoff games following a loss over the last two springs. “I couldn’t be more proud of our team for just its ‘sticktoitiveness,’” Sullivan said. “The last four games of this series, we found our game. ” Kunitz ended a   playoff goal drought when he completed a    with Conor Sheary  —   a healthy scratch in Games 5 and 6  —   by slipping the puck by Anderson 9:55 into the second period. The momentum lasted all of 20 seconds. Ottawa responded immediately with Stone  —   who stretched his left skate to stay onside  —   fired a wrist shot that handcuffed Murray . Pittsburgh kept coming. Schultz, returning after missing four games with an   injury, zipped a shot from the point through Kunitz’s screen and into the net with 8:16 left in the third. Once again, the Penguins could not hold the lead. Dzingel set up at the right post and banged home a rebound off Erik Karlsson’s shot that hit the left post and caromed off Murray’s back right to Dzingel’s stick . Unbowed, Pittsburgh continued to press. The Penguins pumped eight shots at Anderson in the first overtime before finally breaking through when Kunitz won just the fourth   Game 7 of a conference final in NHL history. The next step, the last step, awaits. NOTES: The home team is   in overtime Game 7s in NHL playoff history.   …     Pittsburgh F Patric Hornqvist skated during warmups, but was held out of the lineup for a sixth straight game with an   injury.   …     Karlsson had 16 assists in the playoffs to set a team record.   …     The Penguins are   in Game 7s.   …     It was the fifth   game of the series.",0
6853,Upcoming Horror Game ’Outlast 2’ Banned in Australia - Breitbart,"  survival horror game Outlast 2 has been denied classification by the Australian Classification Board, effectively banning it from sale in Australia. [While the original Outlast and its Whistleblower expansion contained numerous scenes of graphic violence, and Outlast 2 looks to follow that trend based on the demo that was released last year, that’s not the reason given for its ban. The game has reportedly been refused even the   R18+ rating due to “a depiction of implied sexual violence” in one part of the game (SPOILER WARNING):  In one   in the game   …     a female creature prepares Blake for a ritual. She says, “I want to see your true face. Your seed will burn this world. ” Shortly afterwards, he objects to having   dust blown into his face, yelling, “Nope! Nope!” before he stumbles into a forest clearing. His vision blurring, he witnesses what appears to a ritualistic orgy. His wife, Lynn, calls out for his help, saying, “It hurts! Oh god! ,” as she hangs from chains on a raised platform at the front of the clearing. Humanoid creatures, their skin grey, spattered with blood and scarred, implicity have sex as others pray, or chant, or gesticulate. One creature has another bent over a rock, thrusting as they implicitly have   sex, another sits astride the pelvic region of a creature prone on the ground, moving their hips rhythmically as they too implicitly have sex. Two other pairs of creatures in the clearing are also implicitly having sex. As Blake yells for the creatures to “Get away from her!” a female creature, her greyish breasts bared, pushes him onto his back, holds his arms to the ground and repeatedly thrusts her crotch against him. As Blake protests, saying “No! Stop that!” the creature thrusts again, before placing its face over his midsection and then sitting up and wiping its mouth. Their conclusion: Although much of the contact between the creature and Blake is obscurred, by it taking place below screen, the sexualised surroundings and aggressive behaviour of the creature suggest that it is an assault which is sexual in nature. The Board is of the opinion that this, combined with Blake’s objections and distress, constitutes a depiction of implied sexual violence. In the Board’s opinion, the above example constitutes a depiction of implied sexual violence and therefore cannot be accommodated within the R18+ classification category and the game is therefore Refused Classification. This is not the only content on which the refusal was based but seems to be the final straw for members of the board. Developer Red Barrels will be forced to decide between heavily censoring their game or being refused the opportunity to sell it to Australian consumers. While the sequence depicted above is undoubtedly horrific, it’s important to remember that Outlast 2 is, in fact, a horror game. Its content is roughly equivalent to what you would expect from any of the copious   horrors in books or films  —   areas in which the Australian Classification Board is decidedly more lenient. Games are no stranger to exceptional scrutiny and subjected to a broad spectrum of myths about their comparative effects on empathy and development, against all evidence to the contrary. For now, developers must regularly choose between delivering content as it was originally intended or being permitted to sell their products in countries with zealous media restrictions in place.

6854,"Dilbert creator Scott Adams endorses Trump, says Hillary is a bully","Dilbert creator Scott Adams endorses Trump, says Hillary is a bully 
Monday, October 31, 2016 by: Natural News Editors (NaturalNews) I've been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms.If you have a Trump sign in your lawn, they will steal it.If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car.if you speak of Trump at work you could get fired.(Article republished from Dilbert.com )On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message. They insult. They try to shame. They label. And obviously they threaten my livelihood.We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it.We also know Clinton's side hired paid trolls to bully online. You don't hear much about that.Yesterday, by no coincidence, Huffington Post, Salon, and Daily Kos all published similar-sounding hit pieces on me, presumably to lower my influence. (That reason, plus jealousy, are the only reasons writers write about other writers.)Joe Biden said he wanted to take Trump behind the bleachers and beat him up. No one on Clinton's side disavowed that call to violence because, I assume, they consider it justified hyperbole.Team Clinton has succeeded in perpetuating one of the greatest evils I have seen in my lifetime. Her side has branded Trump supporters (40%+ of voters) as Nazis, sexists, homophobes, racists, and a few other fighting words. Their argument is built on confirmation bias and persuasion. But facts don't matter because facts never matter in politics. What matters is that Clinton's framing of Trump provides moral cover for any bullying behavior online or in person. No one can be a bad person for opposing Hitler, right?Some Trump supporters online have suggested that people who intend to vote for Trump should wear their Trump hats on election day. That is a dangerous idea, and I strongly discourage it. There would be riots in the streets because we already know the bullies would attack. But on election day, inviting those attacks is an extra-dangerous idea. Violence is bad on any day, but on election day, Republicans are far more likely to unholster in an effort to protect their voting rights. Things will get wet fast.Yes, yes, I realize Trump supporters say bad things about Clinton supporters too. I don't defend the bad apples on either side. I'll just point out that Trump's message is about uniting all Americans under one flag. The Clinton message is that some Americans are good people and the other 40% are some form of deplorables, deserving of shame, vandalism, punishing taxation, and violence. She has literally turned Americans on each other. It is hard for me to imagine a worse thing for a presidential candidate to do.I'll say that again.As far as I can tell, the worst thing a presidential candidate can do is turn Americans against each other. Clinton is doing that, intentionally. Intentionally. As I often say, I don't know who has the best policies. I don't know the best way to fight ISIS and I don't know how to fix healthcare or trade deals. I don't know which tax policies are best to lift the economy. I don't know the best way to handle any of that stuff. (And neither do you.) But I do have a bad reaction to bullies. And I've reached my limit.I hope you have too. Therefore... I endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I don't defend Trump's personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Let's call that a tie, at worst.The bullies are welcome to drown in their own bile while those of us who want a better world do what we've been doing for hundreds of years: Work to make it better while others complain about how we're doing it.Today I put Trump's odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldn't win unless ""something changed.""Something just changed.",0
6855,The Loosening Grip of DC,"By Fred Reed October 28, 2016 
Oh good. The world reaches a crossroads, or probably a road off a cliff, just when I want to relax and watch gratuitous violence on the tube. To judge by the rapid drift of events aboard our planetary asylum, the talons of Washington and New York on the world’s throat are fast being pried a-loose. The Global American Imperium is dying. Or so it sure looks anyway. 
I say talons of “New York and Washington” because America’s foreign policy, forged in those two cities, belongs entirely to them. Americans have no influence on it. Further, none of what the Empire does abroad is of any benefit to Americans. Do you care at all what happens in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, or the South China Sea? Do you want to pay for it? America has been hijacked. 
And the Empire prospereth not. It prospereth very not. Consider the recent record of the world’s hyperpower: 
Washington does not have control of Afghanistan, and obviously is not going to. 
Washington does not have control of Iraq, and appears unlikely to. 
Washington did not back Iran down, and isn’t going to. 
Washington did not back Russia down in Ukraine and Crimea, and isn’t going to. 
Washington did not back China down in the South China Sea and, while this is perhaps not over, the Empire seems to be losing. 
Washington has not backed North Korea down and is not going to. 
In the Philippines, President Duterte has told Obama to “go to hell” as being “the son of a whore,” which may be taken to indicate latent hostility. He is vigorously seeking rapprochement with China. While Washington may have him murdered, it seems to be losing control of the Little Vassals of ASEAN. 
Turkey seems to be cuddling up to Russia–that is, looking East like Duterte. Maybe Washington can turn this around temporarily, but there-s a whole lot of wavering going on. 
Meanwhile Washington thrashes around impotently as per usual in Syria, and, though the jury remains out on this one, looks to have poor prospects. If Washington–AKA New York–loses here, after doing so in Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Afghanistan, the Empire will beyond redemption be on the downward slope. 
The United States is not in danger. The Empire is. This is not good. Empires, the Soviet Union notwithstanding, seldom go quietly. Either Washington gambles on war of some sort against Russia, or Russia and China, in the desperate hope of reversing things, or the Empire gets slowly eaten. Or not so slowly. Once one country pries itself loose, many may rush for the door. 
New York may go for calculated war against Russia–say, cyberwar expected not to turn into shooting war, shooting war in Syria not expected to turn into global shooting war, global shooting war not expected to turn into nuclear war. This will be a crapshoot. Note that America has badly misguessed the outcomes of every war since Korea. 
This is why the American election actually matters, unusual in Presidential contests. It is Blowhard against Corruption, a swell choice, but Trump is firmly against war with Russia, and Hillary for. Her military understanding is that of a fried egg. 
The woman is both a fool and a knave but, it seems, Trump has talked trash, and therefore she will likely be President. Weirdly, the future of the world depends on how an excited electorate of political middle-schoolers responds to one candidate’s dirty talk. From a curmudgeon’s point of view, it is pretty funny. It is funnier if one lives outside of the radiation footprint. 
But back to business. The seaboard Axis of Evil needs a war because almost every tide runs against it. Proximately, the Axis has pushed China, Russia, and Iran together against the Empire. (First rule of empire: Do not let the dissidents unite.) Many signs suggest that the world, or much of it, is beginning to see China as its future. The BRICS, the SCO, the NDB, the AAIB–all exclude the US. China becomes the major trading partner of country after country. The twilight deepens. 
Not all goes wrong for the Empire–not yet, but things are getting spooky. On the European Peninsula of Asia, countries remain docile, especially England and, much more importantly, Germany. Yet even among Washington’s European harem, there seem to be faint stirrings of a forgotten independence. As I understand it, Germany’s businessmen would very much like to end Washington’s sanctions on Russia and improve trade with China, which would be greatly to the benefit of the Peninsula. Washington won’t let them. It can’t. If the Europeans did what would be good for themselves, and looked to Eurasia, then the fat lady, already warming up, would burst into full bellow. 
Which, methinks, raises the likelihood that Washington will in desperation do something phenomenally stupid. At this writing Hillary’s camp seems to be prepping the public for war with Russia. The telescreen tells us day after day that Putin is Hitler, that Russia is expanding, that the Russkies are hacking the election, that they cause indigestion and falling hair. Is this just Hillary waggling her codpiece in the expectation that Moscow will demurely back down, as God intended? Or will she again send other people’s children to fight for her in somebody else’s country? 
The larger picture, assuredly obvious to New York, is truly grim–for New York, not for Americans. China has a huge population of a billion Han Chinese, versus two hundred million Caucasian Americans–these being the scientific, technological and entrepreneurial brains of the Empire. One must not notice this, but you can bet that New York and Beijing do. Economically China is growing hugely, advancing technologically at a high rate, building rail lines that now extend from the Chinese Pacific coast to Madrid. It will increasingly dwarf the Empire no matter what happens–short of a world war. 
The curtain falls in ways unnoticed. China recently launched a communications satellite, the world’s first employing quantum cryptographic links, which cannot be intercepted. The intention of this, as well of the QC link from Beijing to Shanghai, is to keep the NSA off China’s back. A small thing, perhaps. Yet if successful and adopted en masse by other countries weary of Washington’s meddling, the result will be a loosening of the Empire’s grip on everybody’s communications. 
For the Empire it is, as Elvis sang, “now or never.” Lenin spoke of “useful idiots.” Ours aren’t even useful, but they call the shots. The Best of Fred Reed Tags:",0

6857,Brexit Ruling Just Latest Tactic to Block Will of the People,"Brexit Ruling Just Latest Tactic to Block Will of the People November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
After the referendum made Brexit possible, I warned that the establishment would do everything possible to stop it. That should not come as a surprise to anyone. Brexit was very much a popular rebellion whose centers were well outside the centers of power. The establishment is culturally and politically hostile to it. And one of the most basic ways that the system has of sabotaging policies it doesn't like is to swamp them in procedural red tape and as much politicking as possible so as to make them unviable. Doing that to a Brexit is trickier, but it's still happening. The same old game plan is to just bog it down as much as possible until its motive energy runs down. It's worked in the past. It may not work this time. But that won't stop them from trying. 
Rerun Brexit through Parliament and maximize the wrangling. The Court's ruling is certain to do that. Keep it going through the grinder long enough and maybe it'll go away.",0
6858,Obama Presses for Open Market for Cable Set-Top Boxes - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama on Friday announced his support for opening the market for cable   boxes, singling out the devices in millions of homes as a clunky and outdated symbol of corporate power over consumers, as he introduced a broad federal effort to increase competition. In an unusual step, Mr. Obama weighed in personally on a pending proposal at the Federal Communications Commission, having his administration file comments that applauded the effort to loosen cable companies’ grip on the boxes. The president, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, said it was an example of the kinds of actions government agencies should take in response to an executive order he signed on Friday calling for administrative action to promote competition and to better protect consumers. “The cable or satellite box is just one example of an area where, because it’s been tied to the provider and you rent it, and consumers spend billions of dollars on it every single year, there hasn’t been much innovation,” Mr. Obama said, adding that the private sector becomes less effective “if we get closed systems or if people are gaming the system. ” The announcements are the newest moves by Mr. Obama to push back against the forces of consolidation and monopoly, and to shift power away from large corporations in an array of industries. They are also the latest to place the president squarely on the side of technology companies  —   some led by executives who have contributed to Mr. Obama’s campaigns, hired his former aides and spoken to him often. Among the supporters of the   box proposal are companies like Google, Amazon and Apple, which are eager to establish a broader foothold in the TV market. “An industry that had previously been considered untouchable  —   the cable guys  —   is now subject to criticism from the president,” said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor who is a former aide to Mr. Obama. “This is like weighing in against Big Tobacco or Big Pharma. ” Cable industry leaders lashed out at Mr. Obama, arguing that he was rewarding political friends and benefactors like those at Google, and undermining the independence of the F. C. C. Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at ATT, said the president’s move was “aimed at muscling Democratic commissioners to support the Google proposal. ” The administration can comment on any proposal by the F. C. C. an independent agency, but it does so sparingly, and it is rare for the president himself to speak out on a pending matter. In this case, his advisers said he felt that the issue merited his involvement because of the broad impact the changes could have on the cable market, one that touches many American households. The F. C. C. proposal would allow subscribers to choose and buy the devices they use to view television programming, instead of leasing the boxes from their cable companies at an average annual cost of $231. The agency approved the plan in February, starting a   comment period that closes in a week. In comments submitted on Friday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Commerce Department, urged the F. C. C. to take a “measured and balanced” approach to injecting competition into the   box market, including enabling alternative providers to provide their own user interfaces, as well as other features. In a blog post, Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, and Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, called the   box rule the “mascot” for Mr. Obama’s new   executive order. The president’s aides gave no examples of the kinds of rules Mr. Obama would like to see agencies propose in response to the executive order. Mr. Furman said White House officials had already notified the agencies of the coming call for recommendations, so some of the regulations were already underway. The push announced on Friday is in line with Mr. Obama’s promise in his State of the Union address this year to find ways to help workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs. In a report issued on Friday, the Council of Economic Advisers said that competition was declining in many industries and argued that the decrease was having a harmful effect on consumers and workers. Mr. Obama has acted several times to combat the trend, including signing legislation to unlock cellphones, which allows consumers to switch providers while keeping the same device. The Transportation Department has pressed airports to open slots to more airlines, while the F. C. C. adopted rules for auctioning wireless spectrum intended to allow smaller players more opportunities to participate. The president weighed in personally in 2014 on the F. C. C. ’s net neutrality rules. He argued that the Internet should be regulated as a public utility, and he pressed for strict rules to prevent broadband companies from blocking or intentionally slowing legal content and from allowing content providers to pay for a fast lane to reach consumers. The rules were released last year. The report released on Friday listed several areas that the president’s advisers said they thought could be ripe for   regulations, including   Big Data, the consumer information that includes buying habits and Internet browsing histories, price transparency and common ownership of stock by large institutional investors.",0
6860,How Donald Trump Blew Up the ‘Gaffe’ - The New York Times,"When a politician says something stupid, reporters are traditionally expected to mask their glee with a veneer of shock and disappointment. It was in this mode, more or less, that the NBC News political director, Chuck Todd, and his colleague Carrie Dann began the Aug. 3 edition of First Read, the network’s daily political tip sheet, warning that Donald Trump’s campaign had gone “from ‘unraveling’ to ‘break glass’ mode. ” They began with a heroic attempt to catalog all the previously      things Trump said and did in the preceding 24 hours, a long list that included the candidate’s displaying to a rally audience the Purple Heart medal he had been given by a retired U. S. Army lieutenant colonel who was wounded in Iraq. “I always wanted to get the Purple Heart,” said Trump, who received draft deferments during the Vietnam War for, among other things, bone spurs that had miraculously little impact on his youthful athletic career. “This was much easier. ” “Put those words into the mouth of any past presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, and that comment almost certainly would have been labeled a near   gaffe,” Todd and Dann wrote. In 2016, however, “it wasn’t even the most blockbuster Trump news of the afternoon. ” This prompted them to consider something that, coming from a pair of political journalists, bordered on heresy: Maybe, they mused, we were looking at “the end of the gaffe. ” The “gaffe,” in its old, prepolitical usage, was essentially a faux pas: a breach of etiquette or  —   in the diplomatic context, where it often appeared  —   local custom. In 1922, an anonymous British military officer’s wife recounted in Blackwood’s Magazine how, at a party, she had breezily remarked to a Belgian government minister how happy she had been living in Bonn, Germany, during the postwar occupation. The minister recoiled and informed her that he had spent 10 months in solitary confinement there. “I had obviously said the wrong thing,” she wrote, “committed a gaffe. ” “Saying the wrong thing” is the most straightforward definition of a political gaffe, too. The question, of course, is what precisely we mean by “wrong. ” Reporters typically mean it in the strategic sense  —   something a politician seeking office, or occupying one, should know better than to say. And because strategy is amoral, the media’s preoccupation with gaffes has always been an easy target for critics. It’s emblematic, they argue, of campaign reporting at its hollow,   worst  —   representing little more than, as Jason Linkins of The Huffington Post wrote earlier this year, “the inability of politicians to be perfect at all times, and the media’s ability to monetize these momentary lapses. ” But there is another way of thinking about the gaffe: as an inevitable expression of the paradoxes of scrupulously objective political reporting, pressures that have held reporters hostage for decades. Until Trump, of all people, set us free. The journalistic ritual of   dates approximately to the Vietnam era, but it blossomed into a   obsession during the 1980 candidacy of Ronald Reagan, whose malapropisms were well noted even before he won the Republican nomination. Before the summer was out, reporters were fulminating over his description of the Vietnam War as a “noble cause” and his suggestion that the United States should pursue official relations with Taiwan  —   a move that contradicted the terms of normalization previously negotiated between the United States and China. Both statements were within the spectrum of conservative opinion, but reporters took them as blunders. By early September, press reports routinely described Reagan’s campaign, in The Times’s words, as on “the political defensive after a string of admittedly costly verbal gaffes. ” Two months later, Reagan trounced Carter, winning 44 states. During his administration, verbal pratfalls became enough of a running joke that David Gergen, then his director of communications, commissioned a large plaster foot with a bullet hole in it to be passed around. The Washington Post’s Lou Cannon diligently cataloged the “Reaganism of the Week” Dinesh D’Souza, who worked in the White House during Reagan’s second term, wrote later that “Reagan had no objection and frequently turned to the column to discover his own gaffes. Reagan’s advisers soon discovered what the boss already knew: that Americans didn’t mind his gaffes and were even entertained by them. ” What Reagan understood, in D’Souza’s telling, was that a gaffe revealed at least as much about the journalists who called attention to it as it did about the politician who uttered it. It reflected their own preoccupations and biases, which voters did not necessarily share. Ever since the late 1960s, when reporters began to take a more active role in scrutinizing presidential candidates, they had operated on the assumption that the way a candidate managed the challenges and humiliations of the campaign trail was in some way reflective of how they would perform in the White House itself  —   that a candidacy was a meaningful simulation of a presidency. By the 1980s, this vision of campaign reporting was toppling into solipsism. Journalists were, effectively, grading politicians on their ability to perform what everyone understood to be a largely artificial version of themselves  —   practicing a kind of theater criticism as much as political reporting. This reached its magnificent zenith in 2012, when a Washington Post reporter shouted at Mitt Romney during a photo op in Warsaw, “What about your gaffes?” What about his gaffes? The George Washington University political scientist John Sides reviewed   data from the 2012 race and found that none of the   slips of the campaign  —   not even the surreptitiously filmed video of Romney’s “47 percent” comments  —   had any appreciable effect on either candidate’s support. In imagined service of the interests of voters, reporters had lost track of what actually mattered to them. Still, criticism of the media’s gaffe fixation  —   like Michael Kinsley’s famous observation that “a ‘gaffe’ is the opposite of a ‘lie’: it’s when a politician inadvertently tells the truth”  —   has often been a bit too clever, reflecting the same blend of cynicism and forced naïveté as the trail reporters it maligns. The critics tend to miss something important: the way in which   is, ultimately, a logical and sometimes deliberate way of tackling the impossible task the press has assigned itself. For avowedly nonpartisan and nonideological reporters, examining the substance of a politician’s beliefs and policy views is a professional minefield: The more deeply they venture into it, the more open they are to accusations of bias. The benefits of this dilemma mostly accrue to politicians. If reporters spent too much time on the comfortably nonpartisan foibles of Reagan’s “Reaganisms,” they spent too little looking closely at his advisers’ devotion to   economics. The gaffe, then, is a safety mechanism. It moves a statement from the realm of substance to the realm of performance and strategy  —   allowing the reporters to critique it without incriminating themselves professionally. To say that Trump’s views on immigration are inhumane, or   from the standpoint of the economy or national security, might hint at a subjective opinion on the part of the reporter. An easier problem to identify is that, spoken aloud, those views may hurt him with electorally important constituencies, or reflect poorly on his ability to stay “on message” in the manner expected of politicians. A rational candidate would not deliberately do something that unnecessarily jeopardizes his chances of victory, so it follows that the outburst must have been a mistake  —   a gaffe. This of course bears little resemblance to how actual voters,   or   assess his words. In that sense, Trump really does have more in common with voters than he does with political elites. His inability to apologize or back down has opened the door to a   politics, stripping away the convenient fiction of missteps and errors that journalists turn to when they are uncomfortable confronting a statement on its merits. “This isn’t a situation where you have an episodic gaffe,” Obama said on Aug. 2, needling the many Republicans who had recently denounced Trump’s words without rescinding their endorsements. “This is daily, and weekly, where they are distancing themselves from statements he’s making. ” He’s right at this point, to treat Trump’s statements as anything other than intentional is to uphold   convention at the expense of common sense. Trump has laid bare journalism’s contradictions  —   reporters’ desire to be critical of politicians without criticizing anything they stand for  —   to the point where we have no choice but to examine them. This may be the least expected outcome of 2016: The most flagrantly dishonest candidate in recent memory is forcing us to have the most honest political discussion we’ve had in years.",0
6861,"YAF Pulls Out of Ann Coulter Berkeley Event, Blames College for Allowing ’Hostile Atmosphere’ - Breitbart","Young America’s Foundation (YAF) has pulled out of Ann Coulter’s Thursday event at UC Berkeley, blaming the college for allowing   extremists to terrorize conservatives on campus. [“When Young America’s Foundation confirmed Ann Coulter would speak at   as part of YAF’s nationwide campus lecture program on April 27, we assumed UC Berkeley would take all steps necessary to ensure the safety of students attending the educational event,” the group declared in a blog post on Tuesday. “In the meantime we discovered that the University of California Police Department at Berkeley has an official ‘ ’ policy for any situation that develops on campus as long as the situation doesn’t involve the imminent loss of life, allowing the leftist thugs who have terrorized Berkeley’s campus to do so without consequence. ”  “As of 4:00 p. m. today, Young America’s Foundation will not be moving forward with an event at Berkeley on April 27 due to the lack of assurances for protections from foreseeable violence from unrestrained leftist agitators,” they continued. “Berkeley should be ashamed for creating this hostile atmosphere. ” YAF added that they are still pushing forward with their lawsuit against the college, and that the group “looks forward to the day when First Amendment freedoms are enjoyed by conservative students. ” “Ms. Coulter may still choose to speak in some form on campus, but Young America’s Foundation will not jeopardize the safety of its staff or students,” they concluded. “For information on Ms. Coulter’s plans, please contact her directly. ” Ron Robinson, the president of Young America’s Foundation, also attacked the college in a quote, describing the campus as a “circus. ” “As a parent and a taxpayer, I want the next generation to learn in an educational environment, not a circus,” said Robinson. “I had the misfortune of being in a leftist riot as a student, and I wouldn’t want to put my children or anyone else’s children into that situation without assurances that law enforcement would protect them. ” The Berkeley College Republicans and YAF are currently in the process of suing UC Berkeley over the Ann Coulter event, which they claim has faced numerous unfair and biased restrictions. The groups, and their attorney Harmeet Dhillon, referenced previous events featuring conservative speakers at the college, which also faced similar scrutiny restrictions, including former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos and conservative commentator David Horowitz. During a press conference about the lawsuit on Monday, Dhillon branded UC Berkeley’s policies on “acceptable speech” as “infinitely malleable,” before criticizing the Mayor of Berkeley, Jesse Arreguin, for appearing to sympathize with, be friendly to, and act softly on the   rioters who shut down Yiannopoulos’ event earlier this year. “If the Mayor of Berkeley cannot maintain control of his city, the Governor should call the National Guard, because that’s a serious public health issue,” Dhillon proclaimed.

6862,"Meet New Glenn, the Blue Origin Rocket That May Someday Take You to Space - The New York Times","Blue Origin, the secretive space company created by Jeffrey P. Bezos, offered a look at its newest rocket design on Monday  —   and, by extension, its ambitions to make space travel more frequent and inexpensive. Both the rocket and the ambitions appear to be big. The rockets, named New Glenn after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, are almost as large as the Saturn V rocket that NASA used from 1966 to 1973, before rockets started being built smaller. The   version that could venture to   orbit will be 270 feet tall, and the   version, which could fly outside Earth’s orbit, will be 313 feet tall. Both will be 23 feet in diameter, packing seven   engines, which are developed by Blue Origin, and lifting off with 3. 85 million pounds of thrust. Blue Origin plans to first launch the rocket from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral, Fla. before the end of the decade. “Our vision is millions of people living and working in space, and New Glenn is a very important step,” Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, said in an email update. As a private company, Blue Origin could launch wealthy tourists into space, send commercial satellites into orbit and provide the technology to send NASA back to the moon, as well as to Mars and beyond. Perfecting the technology of reusable rockets  —   which the New Glenn rockets would be  —   could have profound implications on the cost and frequency of space travel. Imagine how much more expensive a flight from New York to London would be if airlines built a new 747 jet for each flight, throwing them away after one use. That is effectively the current model of the space industry rockets typically crash back into Earth after exhausting their fuel, and the steep costs of travel depress how often it happens. “Reusability is a total ” said Charles Miller, the president of NexGen Space L. L. C. a space and public policy consultancy. “It’s on the order of going from the sail to the steam engine, or going from the horse to the automobile. ” Blue Origin first launched its reusable New Shepard rocket from West Texas in November, sending a capsule that would eventually carry paying passengers to a height of 329, 839 feet, just crossing the   line that is considered the beginning of outer space. Before New Glenn was announced as the rocket’s name on Monday, Mr. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, had referred to it as “Very Big Brother. ” The large size of New Glenn  —   Mr. Miller, a former senior adviser for NASA, had guessed it would be big but thought it would have five engines, not seven  —   suggests the company would seek to lower the price of space tourism by offering more seats on the flights, he said. In March, Mr. Bezos said that tourists could make short trips into space, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness, as soon as 2018 via the reusable New Shepard spacecraft. The experience would doubtlessly be reserved for the rich, at least initially, but Mr. Bezos said it would be necessary to build expertise and further develop the technology. Though the company was registered in 2000, Mr. Bezos had not let reporters into its headquarters in Kent, Wash. until March of this year. In September 2015, Blue Origin said it would invest $200 million and create 330 jobs by leasing a launch complex at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Mr. Miller said if the dream of inexpensive space travel were fulfilled, it would significantly impact life on Earth. In   scenarios, the ability to more easily launch satellites could lead to worldwide broadband internet, better weather predictions, the monitoring of carbon sources and the farming of solar energy. For the United States, it could have national security implications, he said. The ability to destroy United States satellites that provide surveillance and guide missiles is a current liability, but enemies may be less likely to target them if they could be quickly replaced. And NASA will most likely be a customer, using the New Glenn rockets for future missions. “With this vehicle, going to Mars will become a lot easier,” Mr. Miller said.",0
6863,"Santa Ana to pay $100,000 to pot shop at center of controversial police raid","OC Register – by Scott Schwebke 
SANTA ANA – The city will pay a Santa Ana marijuana dispensary $100,000 to settle a federal lawsuit in connection with a controversial raid last year where police officers were caught on hidden video eating snacks and making disparaging remarks about a handicapped woman. 
As part of the settlement agreement finalized earlier this month, the city of Santa Ana will also dismiss misdemeanor charges against a dozen people accused of unlawfully operating Sky High Holistic at the time of the May 26, 2015 raid . 
The settlement proceeds will be divided among Marla and David James, who are volunteers at Sky High, and Dr. Bradley Idelshon, a physician whose nearby office was left without power and water during the raid and is not affiliated with the dispensary, its attorney Matthew Pappas said. 
“The settlement of civil rights claims and dismissal of criminal actions shows Santa Ana is taking responsibility for improper actions it took, including the raid of Sky High Holistic, in support of its lottery-based marijuana regulation ordinance, Pappas said Tuesday in an email. 
Santa Ana Deputy City Manager Robert Cortez declined Tuesday to discuss the settlement, saying the municipality doesn’t comment on legal matters. 
The lawsuit alleges that following voter approval of Santa Ana ballot Measure BB in November 2014, enabling a lottery to select 20 entrepreneurs to operate marijuana dispensaries, city and police officials formulated a plan to close dispensaries operating without a permit. 
Sky High, located on West 17th Street, wasn’t selected for a permit in the lottery. The dispensary was then raided as part of the enforcement program carried out by Santa Ana police, according to the lawsuit. 
Hidden video of the raid released by Pappas shows Santa Ana officers forcing Sky High customers to the floor, profanely referencing James in her wheelchair and munching on snacks. 
The bust,which went viral, led to the suspension of three police officers, who are no longer employed by the Santa Ana Police Department . 
Police have not said why the trio aren’t with the department. They have been charged with misdemeanor petty theft and scheduled to be back in court next month. 
The lawsuit alleges police caused extensive damage and took thousands of dollars in cash along with marijuana products during the Sky High raid. 
Pappas said he is continuing to pursue petitions in Orange County Superior Court for return of money and items seized in the raid and a lawsuit that seeks other unspecified monetary damages.

6864,Lemmings and Republicans – Alan Ned Sabrosky,"  Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Lemmings and Republicans – Alan Ned Sabrosky By VNN on November 1, 2016 So why are so many Republican leaders doing all they can do to diminish Trump and give the election to Clinton ? Donald Trump’s Triumph Forces GOP Party Leaders to Make a Decision – Loyalty Pledge 
For conservatives and Republicans, a win by Hillary Clinton in November would be a catastrophe — and not just because people like Miley Cyrus and Al Sharpton would not leave the country. Lemmings who vow to leave the U.S. if Trump Wins 
It would mean continued assaults on the 1st and 2nd Amendments, especially the latter. Higher taxes and more welfare. More war — Hillary Clinton’s defense secretary-in-waiting, Michelle Flournoy, has openly said as much. And it would mean her appointment of at least one justice to the US Supreme Court, and perhaps as many as four, creating a liberal block of five to seven justices that will put its stamp on the country for a generation or more. Lemmings 
So why are so many Republican leaders doing all they can do to diminish Trump and give the election to Clinton, either attacking him openly or withholding support from him? Sure, Trump’s style is often abrasive, and he is a bully, and most importantly to professional politicians, he made fools of the Republican establishment by trashing their best efforts to defeat him. 
But all of that has happened earlier, and the party’s leadership have generally rallied around their chosen candidate. So none of the above ought to make so many of the Republican Party’s “leaders” act like lemmings running around in search of a cliff, jeopardizing everything their party has stood for by enhancing Clinton’s prospects. 
This type of internal division happened significantly only twice before. In 1860, the Democrats split so badly that the two factions each ran a candidate for president. 
The Republican candidate – Abraham Lincoln – won by default, and the outcome was a bloody civil war and poisoned internal relations. 
In 1964, the Republican establishment largely rejected their candidate – Barry Goldwater. This gave Lyndon Johnson a win, and America? – well, America got a horribly escalated war in Vietnam we eventually lost, and an even worse “war on poverty” that created a huge welfare class and effectively dismantled the black family. 
These precedents are not exactly classified secrets, but much of the Republican “leadership” persists in self-destructive behavior. This is because today, there is one unspoken issue that sets Trump apart from Hillary Clinton, and in opposition to all of the other Republican candidates at the start of the primary season — and, oddly enough, aligns him with Bernie Sanders. 
This is that he cannot be counted on to go to war with Iran as soon as possible, which is what Israel wants and what its lobby in the US — AIPAC ( American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the self-described owner of Capitol Hill ) – uses as the litmus test for the legitimacy of a candidate in this election. 
Thus, in obedience to AIPAC, many in the Republican establishment throw their core interests to the wind and in effect serve Hillary Clinton. This was especially evident in the open letter signed by many self-described Republican national security experts declaring Trump unfit for the presidency. 
Left unsaid in it was that most are Jewish; many have dual Israeli citizenship; all put Israel first; all have been architects of one or more of our “lovely” Middle East wars since 2001; and all want the US to attack Iran, alone or in concert with Israel. Architects of Endless “Regime Change” wars 
This ought to give some idea of the sort of debacle awaiting us after the November elections. When the smoke clears, unless Hillary Clinton’s many scandals surface soon and dramatically, perhaps the Republican Party (or whatever remains of it) will replace the elephant with the lemming as the party symbol. I’m just not sure either deserves that fate.",0
6865,"Merkel Issues New Threat to Britain, Talks ’Price’ Of Limiting Open Border Migration","Fresh off the back of an electoral victory this past weekend, a bullish Angela Merkel has threatened Britain over the free movement of people  —   one of the most contentious parts of Brexit negotiations. [The German chancellor issued a warning over placing limits on migration into the United Kingdom, even though the issue was one of the primary motivating factors for those who voted for Britain to leave the European Union in June 2016.  According to Reuters, Mrs. Merkel implied Britain would have to pay a price if it put limits on the free movement of European Union citizens during a speech to trade unionists on Wednesday. “If the British government ends the free movement of people, that will have its price,” she said at a G20 trade union event in Berlin. “That’s not malice,” she said. “But I cannot have all the good sides and then say there will be an upper limit of 100, 000 or 200, 000 EU citizens, no more, or just researchers, but please nobody else. This will not work. ” In such a scenario, the remaining 27 EU members would then have to think about what additional obstacles to throw up in order to compensate, Merkel said. “We will, of course, always think in the future relationship of the 48 or 49 percent who didn’t back Brexit,” the German chancellor added, also commenting that the process of Britain leaving the EU will be “very, very complicated”. In recent weeks, EU officials have suggested Britain pay a 100 billion Euro bill to leave the European Union, a notion that today attracted ire from former UKIP leader Nigel Farage MEP in the Strasbourg European Parliament. “Either we get some grown up, reasonable demands from the European Union or the United Kingdom will be forced to walk away before the end of this year,” blasted Farage, adding: “We can’t spend two years with this farce”.",0
6866,"These Products Make Men Grow Breasts, Get Cancers Of The Prostate And Liver","Owned by Unilever, the Axe brand includes a range of men's grooming products with many of the ingredients never even tested for safety according to the C.I.R. – Cosmetic Ingredient Review. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Axe products are loaded with endocrine disrupting chemicals. Endocrine disruptorsare exogenous, synthetic chemicals that have hormone-like effects on both humans and wild-life and interfere with the endocrine system by either mimicking or blocking our natural hormones and disrupting their respective body functions. Member scientists of the Endocrine Society issued a report in which they claim: “We present the evidence that endocrine disruptors have effects on male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostrate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology.” New studies are also revealing that these harmful chemicals may be causing physical feminization in males. A study published by the International Journal of Andrology found that feminization of boys can now be seen through their play habits. Medical experts are now wondering whether exposure to years of these toxic chemicals is part of the reason so many older men are low on testosterone and experiencing erectile dysfunction. So they take a little blue pill and get exposed to even more chemicals and the cycle continues. Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly is the active ingredient in Axe deodorant products. One or more animal studies show kidney or renal system effects at very low doses, mammalian cells show positive mutation results, animal studies show reproductive effects at moderate doses. Aluminum was first recognized as a human neurotoxin in 1886, before being used as an antiperspirant. A neurotoxin is a substance that causes damage to nerves or nerve tissue. Cocamidopropyl Betaine Cocamidopropyl betaine is a very toxic ingredient which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. The biggest danger of using a product with cocamidopropyl betaine is its potential contamination with nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are created when nitrosating agents are combined with amines. Nitrosamines have been identified as one of the most potent classes of carcinogens, having caused cancer in more than 40 different animal species as well as in humans. PPG-14 Butyl Ether PPG stands for popypropylene glycol, which is made from a completely artificial petroleum product, methyl oxirane. Another name for that is propylene oxide (which is a probable human carcinogen). Propylene oxide is also an irritant and highly flammable. Butyl ethers are in the paraben family, and they are toluene derivatives (toxic petrochemical compounds). Toluene has proven to have a harmful affect on the reproductive system while parabens have been linked to cancer. PEG-8 Distearate According to a report in the International Journal of Toxicology by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) committee, impurities found in various PEG compounds include ethylene oxide; 1,4-dioxane; polycyclic aromatic compounds; and heavy metals such as lead, iron, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic. Many of these impurities are linked to cancer. A 1988 Swedish study by Thompson looked at both BHT and BHA. They found that both were toxic and tumour promoting. Both antioxidants were observed to be cytotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 100 to 750 microM. At equimolar concentrations BHT was more cytotoxic than BHA.

6867,UN “Human Rights” Council Now Officially Controlled by Dictators,"Email 
More than half of the regimes sitting on the United Nations Human Rights Council after last week's election have been categorized as unfree, sparking criticism and further ridicule of the global body ostensibly tasked with upholding the UN's vision of human rights. Among the latest selections to serve on the discredited global council are some of the most oppressive and murderous communist and Islamist dictatorships on the planet. That is despite the UN outfit's mandate saying that only member governments that “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” are eligible to join. Adding to the controversy, the Obama administration and Western powers remained silent as UN member governments chose some of the most barbaric regimes on Earth to police “human rights” around the world. 
Of course, the selection of ruthless totalitarians to the UN's “human rights” bureaucracy is nothing new . It got so bad more than a decade ago that the brutal regime of late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi was selected to lead the UN “Human Rights Commission.” After becoming a global laughingstock and discrediting the broader UN, the “commission” was formally disbanded, being replaced by the new and supposedly improved “council.” Like its predecessor, though, the UN Human Rights Council is now officially controlled by repressive, unelected governments. The UN's pseudo-“human rights” apparatus is also led by an extremist Muslim prince who constantly attacks the United States, free speech, gun rights, and other fundamental freedoms , while meddling in Western elections and covering up real atrocities perpetrated by child-raping UN “peace” troops or dictatorial UN member governments. 
The latest list of selections for the UN body, chosen by UN member governments and tyrants, reads like a who's who of totalitarian regimes. Among the communist dictatorships that cruised to victory at the UN council, for example, was the regime enslaving mainland China, which has murdered more people than any government in human history. Conservative estimates suggest that the Communist Party state in Beijing is responsible for killing between 60 million and 100 million victims, not including those slaughtered in forced abortions. Despite ongoing atrocities that include harvesting organs from political and religious prisoners, forced abortions to enforce population control, ruthless persecution of Christians, massive censorship, a lack of elections, and more, 180 UN member states decided the autocracy in Beijing was well suited for the important human-rights post. 
Another savage communist regime to secure a seat on the UN body is the Castro-led Stalinist dictatorship enslaving Cuba, which received support from 160 out of 193 UN member states. In addition to its history of mass-murder and savage persecution of dissidents, the military autocracy continues to export communist terrorism and tyranny around the world . Indeed, Obama actually launched his political career in the home of Castro-backed communist terrorist Bill Ayers , whose treasonous terror group bombed U.S. targets, murdered police officers, and, according to the FBI, plotted to intern and execute millions of counter-revolutionary Americans with help from foreign dictatorships. 
Havana and Beijing both secured re-election, and will be sitting on the UN “human rights” body with a good number of their ideological allies in Asia, Latin America, and beyond. Among the communist and socialist regimes on the council are those ruling Bolivia, Vietnam, South Africa, Ecuador, El Salvador, what remains of imploding Venezuela, and many more. Ironically, around the time of the “elections” to the UN council, the brutal Nicolas Maduro regime in oil-rich Venezuela was sending its minions disguised as “Non-Governmental Organizations” (NGOs) to praise the socialist tyrant's “human rights” record. At home, Maduro is busy jailing political opponents, massacring protesters, and trying to prevent food riots as starved Venezuelans wait hours in line to get the bare essentials of life. 
Also taking a spot on the Human Rights Council was the Islamist regime in Saudi Arabia, which beheads apostates, bans Christianity, flogs and executes dissidents, and supports radical Islamism around the world. Over 175 people, including children and disabled people, literally lost their heads in 2014 to the Saudi regime's executioners, who typically use swords to behead those convicted of “apostasy” from Islam and other supposed crimes. Sometimes, following a public beheading, the severed head is tied to the decapitated corpse and displayed in public, tied to a post, as a “deterrent,” ISIS style. Others on the wrong side of the regime's “justice” system can face public floggings, firing squads, the severing of hands, and other cruel and unusual punishments typically considered barbaric in civilized countries. The regime is also widely reported to use torture to extract confessions. 
The election of the Islamist Saudi Arabian regime, which has been criticized around the world, followed a successful but deeply controversial effort to have itself removed from a UN list of child killers for its ongoing killing and maiming of children in schools and hospitals in Yemen. It also drew outrage from watchdog groups, human-rights campaigners, and even pro-UN apparatchiks concerned that the UN was further discrediting itself on the world stage. “The UN's election of Saudi Arabia as a world judge on human rights is like a town picking a pyromaniac to be the fire chief,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of the non-profit watchdog group UN Watch. More than a few other Islamist regimes already sit on the UN body. 
According to a statement by UN Watch, a full 53 percent of the governments now sitting on the UN “Human Rights Council” are what the organization referred to as “non-democracies.” And indeed, many of the worst serial human-rights abusers are among them. “The re-election of China, Cuba and Saudi Arabia — regimes which systematically violate the human rights of their citizens — casts a shadow upon the reputation of the United Nations,” continued Neuer, whose organization advocates reforming the system rather than shutting it down. Indeed, as the group has pointed out, the increasingly discredited UN body has instead focused its efforts on demonizing the State of Israel, which has been the target of more than half of all resolutions from the council aimed at a specific country. That is likely to continue. 
UN Watch also expressed “disappointment” at what it described as the “deafening silence” from the Obama administration and the European powers that “deferred to dictators by refusing to speak out and campaign against them.” Neuer added that by remaining silent and turning a blind eye as dictators and human rights violators join and subvert the UN council, those governments “are complicit in the world body's moral decline.” “When the UN helps gross abusers act as champions and global judges of human rights, it's an insult to their political prisoners and their many other victims — and a defeat for the global cause of human rights,” he concluded. “When the UN's highest human rights body becomes a case of the foxes guarding the henhouse, the world's victims suffer.” 
Other governments and dictatorships with troubling records selected in the latest process included those ruling Egypt, Rwanda, South Africa, Tunisia, Iraq, Brazil, and Guatemala. Many of those governments have come under fire for abuses. The increasingly extremist regime in South Africa, for example, is led by Jacob Zuma, who has been caught singing songs advocating genocide against vulnerable minorities on national television . They will be joining the oppressive regimes ruling Algeria, Burundi, Congo, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Maldives, Namibia, Morocco, Qatar, Viet Nam, and more. Vladimir Putin's controversial Russian government was defeated by a razor thin margin, with the governments of Croatia and Hungary selected from the Eastern European grouping instead. 
Even the neoconservative internationalist George W. Bush boycotted the dictator-dominated UN outfit that legitimizes gross human rights abusers and tyranny. The Obama administration, though, decided to re-join, and has now been selected as a member of the council, perhaps imagining that it can tie the hands of a potential President Trump. “U.S. engagement has helped transform the Council into a more balanced and credible organization and has helped focus the global spotlight on grave violations and abuses of human rights around the world,” claimed Obama's controversial Secretary of State John Kerry. Among the alleged “achievements” celebrated by Kerry was the UN body's unleashing of a radical homosexuality and gender-confusion czar to bully governments and dictators worldwide into submission to the so-called “LGBT” agenda . 
Many critics who have ridiculed and blasted the UN Human Rights Council have argued that it can be “reformed.” But despite all of the recommendations for “reforming” the UN body, the problems with it and the broader UN are in reality systemic. To begin with, consider the UN's own “Universal Declaration of Human Rights ,” which outlines what the UN misleadingly characterizes as the “rights” of human beings. While the document offers lip service to various liberties, it is based on several premises that make it fundamentally incompatible with unalienable, God-given rights as understood in the United States — individual rights that the American Declaration of Independence says government is actually instituted to protect. 
Consider Article 29 of the UN declaration, for starters, which claims that “rights” can be limited “by law” under the guise of everything from “public order” to “the general welfare.” Separately, the same article claims that everyone has “duties to the community” and that “rights and freedoms” may “in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.” For perspective, that would be like the First Amendment saying Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, unless Congress dislikes the speech. The UN declaration also assumes “rights” are bestowed by governments and treaties, whereas American traditions and jurisprudence are based on the idea that rights come from the Creator alone, and that governments exist merely to protect them. 
Seen in that light, suddenly the UN's bizarre and increasingly frequent rants citing ""human rights"" to argue against free speech, due process , educational freedom , parental rights , gun rights , the right to life , and so on make much more sense. Indeed, the UN's vision of “human rights” is entirely contradictory to real God-given rights . The two visions are incompatible. The only solution for Americans who value real rights and freedoms, then, is to ditch the UN and its extremist agenda in favor of the U.S. Constitution and the pre-existing rights it enshrines. Legislation to secure an American exit (or Amexit) from the UN , the American Sovereignty Restoration Act , is already in Congress. All that is required now is more public pressure. And as the UN becomes increasingly extreme — even electing the world's most brutal dictatorships to its “human rights” outfit — the pressure will almost certainly continue to build.

6868,"Paul LePage, Besieged Maine Governor, Sends Conflicting Signals Over Intentions - The New York Times","AUGUSTA, Me.  —   The beleaguered Republican governor of Maine seemed on Tuesday to back off from hints that he might quit in the midst of a controversy over his latest tirades of obscene, threatening and racially charged remarks, as Republican lawmakers in the House rallied to quash the possibility of formally rebuking him  —   or worse  —   for his erratic behavior. Gov. Paul R. LePage, whose tenure here has often seemed to lurch from one   crisis to another, began the day by suggesting in a radio interview Tuesday morning that he was considering stepping down as the outrage generated by a profane voice mail and his apparent endorsement of racial profiling drew admonishments even from members of his party. “It’s really one thing to have one party behind you,” Mr. LePage said on the radio, in an interview that was at times uncharacteristically  . “It’s another thing not to have any party behind you. ” But in the early afternoon, in a Twitter message, Mr. LePage seemed to have regained his spirit of defiance. “Regarding rumors of resignation, to paraphrase Mark Twain, ‘The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated,’” the message read. Mr. LePage was spending much of the day in the town of Baileyville, 170 miles from here, near the Canadian border. By nighttime, it was clear there was a basis for the governor’s renewed swagger, as House Republican leaders said they would not join the calls to convene a special session, which would have raised the possibility of impeachment. “We believe that the governor is addressing this issue,” said State Representative Kenneth Fredette, an ally of Mr. LePage’s and the minority leader of the House. “We are not interested in coming back in a special session. ” Speaking with reporters after the caucus meeting, Mr. Fredette condemned Mr. LePage’s remarks  —   “No one agrees with what the governor said or did,” he said  —   and asserted that “no one gets a free pass. ” But he then seemed to give one to Mr. LePage, saying that a special session would distract voters from important issues ahead of the fall election. Since he was elected in 2010 and   in 2014, Mr. LePage has had at least nine political lives and been able to ride out waves of controversy, often provoked by his harsh, insulting and racially charged statements. The outbursts have angered Democrats and embarrassed moderate Republicans, yet left largely unruffled a political base drawn to the former businessman’s unfiltered style. Democrats and some Senate Republicans raised the possibility of a special session to consider ways to rebuke the governor, but such a session could be held only with the approval of half of both caucuses in each legislative chamber. The House Republican caucus held the line after meeting at 6 p. m. The caucus meeting followed days of controversy, after Mr. LePage stated at a   meeting last Wednesday that the vast majority of heroin dealers in Maine were black and Hispanic. As criticism swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker, Drew Gattine, had called him a racist, and left him a threatening voice mail threaded with obscenities, which he followed by suggesting that he and Mr. Gattine have a duel. On Friday, Mr. LePage reiterated his comments about drugs and race, showing reporters a binder of people arrested on drug charges and asserting that black and Hispanic people from out of state were the “enemy. ” Those comments led Amy Volk, a Republican in the Senate, to make a public break with Mr. LePage, questioning his sanity and sobriety in a Facebook post, although she later apologized for doing so. She called for a special legislative session to consider a censure of Mr. LePage. “It’s just so nonproductive,” Ms. Volk said in an interview on Tuesday. “And so offensive to   citizens of color, that they would be somehow lumped in with people that are breaking the law just because of the color of their skin. ” Democratic leaders said they would continue to call for the governor’s resignation. “What the House Republicans have done is slammed the door on their willingness to actually address this behavior at this time,” said Jeff McCabe, the Democratic majority leader of the House, on Tuesday night. “We think that we can work with Senate Republicans as well as some House Republicans who we know are not happy with tonight’s display of political theater. ” Mr. LePage met with Republican legislative leaders on Monday, when he was urged to take steps like apologizing directly to the lawmaker he had threatened, and was asked to seek help, professional or otherwise, according to a person briefed on the discussions. During his interview on the radio station WVOM, Mr. LePage said he “just can’t do” some of the Senate Republicans’ demands, although he did not specify which ones. He added that Republican lawmakers in the   House want “to salvage what we can and move forward. ” He went on to say that he was looking at “options,” conceding that his remarks had cost him crucial support. “If I’ve lost my ability to convince the Maine people that’s what we need and that’s the type of people we need in Augusta, then you know, maybe it is time to move on,” he said. His later Twitter message ridiculed any talk of his stepping down. On the radio, he also apologized for his behavior toward Mr. Gattine, calling it “totally, totally unnecessary,” although, in an interview with local television that afternoon, he suggested that Mr. Gattine owed an apology to him. In the morning’s radio interview, he also defended his comments on drugs and race, saying linking the two were “fact,” and adding, “All lives matter. ” “Every drug arrest we get the story, and the people, and when it comes to meth labs, they’re essentially all Maine white people,” Mr. LePage said. “When it comes to the heroin epidemic, it’s just the opposite. ” The imbroglio seems to have strengthened some Republicans’ commitment to Mr. LePage in some parts of the state in Lewiston on Monday night, a bartender and a patron   when they realized they both still supported the governor. But it has left those who associate more strongly with the state’s tradition of moderate Republicans, like Senator Susan Collins or Margaret Chase Smith, trying to explain his actions. “It seems to be the norm now to speak what’s on your mind now without a filter,” said Wendy Ault, a former Republican state representative and a member of the Early College Task Force appointed by Mr. LePage, adding, “I believe in civilized discourse. ”",0
6869,’Mass Effect: Andromeda’ Review: This Awful Game Should Have Been Left Lost in Space - Breitbart,"Mass Effect: Andromeda is a crushing disappointment from top to bottom and an inadvertent argument for letting the Mass Effect franchise rest in peace.[  Within the first few hours of gameplay, I had already trained myself not to look directly at a character when they were speaking and focus instead on the subtitles below. It reduced the uncanny valley body horror of their warped putty faces and allowed me to focus strictly on what was being said. That too, was a mistake. You see, first and foremost among the copious failings of Andromeda, the   revival of the beloved Mass Effect   RPG series, is its writing. Where the original trilogy delivered its space opera vision with compelling panache from beginning to end, Andromeda offers you an opening as cold and sterile as the   from which you emerge. You are [Insert Name] Ryder, a Pathfinder for the Andromeda Initiative, a   colonization mission departing from the Milky Way just prior to the events of Mass Effect 3. Creating your personalized Ryder is weirdly unpleasant, especially considering the excellent customization available in the latest Dragon Age title  —   or even any of the previous Mass Effect installments, even though the latest entry is five years old at this point. Facial hair in particular looks like pudding smeared across your character’s complexion, and if there are makeup options that don’t look outright clownish, I couldn’t find them.  You can also choose a background for your protagonist, but outside of very specific builds the decision has little to no relevance for the rest of the game. If you were looking for any sort of implementation in the wider story, or even references to your chosen history, you’re out of luck. As the Messianic Pathfinder, you are gifted with an absurd level of authority to make impromptu decisions for the tens of thousands of colonists that left the Milky Way for greener pastures. Your first mission will take you to a planet wracked by violent lightning storms, featuring floating rocks that you know must be interesting, because the characters comment about them no less than four times within the first few minutes. Ryder can be anything he wants to at a whim, with no training required due to Plot Reasons. For similar Plot Reasons, he cannot take more than three skills with him on a mission at any given time. Depending on the skills chosen, there are profiles to equip with various buffs. Some players might enjoy the freedom of completely changing who you are whenever you like, but it robs the character of some   identity.  In case there was any chance you weren’t sure of how the game was going to play out, the shooting begins immediately. It doesn’t stop for the entirety of your playthrough and serves as the default solution to, well, everything. Despite vague overtures about racial and social sensitivity, this game  —   ostensibly about discovery and communication  —   devolves immediately into a decidedly mediocre   shooter. The overall game structure is more than reminiscent of Dragon Age: Inquisition it is virtually identical. Each visitable planet serves as the Andromeda equivalent of a region, with each filled to the brim with   quests that have little more personality  —   and quite often less  —   than something from a genre based on being just barely interesting enough to keep you from logging out and canceling your monthly subscription. The Mako  —   the reviled the   vehicle from the original Mass Effect  —   returns, rebranded as the Nomad, and is every bit as enjoyable to control as it was in the first game. Which is to say, “not fun in any way. ” There are upgrades to make controlling it ever so slightly less painful, but these mostly concern turning it from gameplay focused around it being deeply irritating to merely inconvenient.  Gone are the squad controls that added even a cursory layer of tactics to combat in previous games. Without the ability to alter their equipment or command them beyond the most elementary of directions, squadmates exist purely to add flavor to your journey. It’s a mission they don’t seem to take very seriously. The occasional conversations are acted well enough, but the dialogue seems to have been written by an intern in desperate need of coffee. When there is so little investment in the development of the characters, even the most dramatic moments feel trite. This is the first Mass Effect game where I had no interest in the romantic subplots, because any further unnecessary exposure to the game’s terrible characters (and their ghoulish facial animations) seemed like a terrible decision. Softcore alien porn just isn’t worth putting yourself through that. Among the cast, Vetra, a female Turian mercenary, is a character that is almost interesting. Unfortunately, she has far too little development to truly find her place among the crew. Drack is much the same  —   an overtly paternal Krogan that could have used even half the time spent on Wrex in the original Mass Effect. Or Grunt in Mass Effect 2 and 3, for that matter. Your Asari squadmate Peebee never strays from being singularly irritating, following Ryder’s own tendencies to sound like a walking, talking,   stream of late night tweets.  Liam, Cora, and Jaal feel like the only characters with any sort of genuine motivation to stick with the mission. They’re also the least original members of the cast. Nevertheless, they provide the closest thing that Andromeda has to interesting or relevant commentary. Bioware is famous for its deep and memorable characters. It is difficult to see them slide so far into uninspired filler with this ensemble. That lack of focus and ambition extends to the galaxy at large, which has bartered away its most interesting races for the two most grating options possible. The aliens of the previous trilogy  —   the Elcor, Geth, Hanar, Volus, Quarians, and many more  —   have been traded for a legion of blue folks that are defined by their emotional honesty and a horde of Religious Zealot Space Nazis that seem crafted specifically to be as easy as possible to justify slaughtering. “The Remnant” provide all of the space magic this time around, subbing in for the original trilogy’s Reapers in a pinch, and with galling similarity.  Worse, Andromeda earns all of this criticism before even getting to the game’s numerous bugs. Oh, the bugs. Both friendly NPCs and enemies frequently snapped into their “ ” default postures during dialogue and combat alike. It makes the fighting considerably easier when a giant arctic beast folds its legs and freezes, but it isn’t quite as satisfying. Interiors flicker into and out of existence, spawning and despawning all objects within at a manic pace. Objects regularly cease to exist outside of scanning mode, as if some rocks have been locked to the wrong visual layer of the environment. The   characters that aren’t floating above the floor in their default poses were most often   inside of it, and there were at least a dozen instances in my playthrough of enemies stuck inside terrain, rendering them unkillable and requiring me to a reload my last save or be unable to continue progressing in the game. Speaking of reloads, you’re going to want to keep some backup saves handy. There are   bugs that occur if your braindead companions die, the aforementioned unkillable enemies, and massive chunks of exposition that are frequently interrupted and canceled by your portable AI’s insistence on telling you every single time the temperature or weather changes in any way.  And you may as well consider that exposition gone for good. The alternative is trying to find a summary in what I can comfortably call the worst   journal in an RPG in memory. The information is added in snippets to a variety of files if it’s added at all, requiring you to search through dozens of subfolders for whatever has caused the unread exclamation mark beckoning you to read some new notification. The shoddy interface extends to the game’s crafting system. I genuinely cannot discern the design philosophy behind a menu system that is so blatantly obtuse. Crafting armor and weapons is a painful affair. You will need to gain the right number of the right type of research points. Then, you must gather the random crafting materials from the nodes you mine in the original Mass   with your vehicle. If you want to modify your weapon in any way, repeat the process for each mod. The same is true for armor. And if you want a better version of any equipment  —   handily designated   for each level of quality for that added splash of personality  —   repeat the entire process. It’s better to just wear whatever you pick up and hope for the best.  I can’t finish talking about the interface without discussing the ship navigational map, which features long animations for every single click. Just switching from scanning one planet to another requires multiple steps, each one accompanied by several seconds of sluggish zooming. It consistently feels as if the game is punishing you for exploration  —   to say nothing of the fact that only four of the planets you encounter are actually explorable in any meaningful way. All of this might have been tolerable in a galaxy with interesting problems. However, the narrative lazily abandons the complex issues of a   Milky Way for a    jaunt through a galaxy apparently populated by the least interesting living things in the universe.  Some of these issues might have been easier to ignore if the game wasn’t ugly. Whether it’s lighting effects that feels like an afterthought, the horrifying facial animations, or just the blandness of planets that each seem to sport roughly two sorts of plant and one biome, there just isn’t much to see beyond some occasionally dramatic camera angles. The Frostbite engine the game is built on may have a lot of bells and whistles that have powered other visually stunning titles, but it can only do so much to disguise uninspired aesthetics. Multiplayer also returns in Andromeda from Mass Effect 3. It was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, and I had high hopes for its inclusion in Andromeda. Fortunately, it returns in a more or less identical manner and plays reasonably well. For the few people buying the game for this reason alone, it’s not a total wash. While at first I’d have liked to see Andromeda‘s development team expand on the concept or do something new, after experiencing the single player campaign they put together, I’m glad they just left it alone.  I wanted to love Mass Effect: Andromeda because of how much I enjoyed the previous games in the series. In fact, I had prepared to review the game with a disclaimer about how much my love for the franchise could color my opinion of this   outing. It was an unnecessary consideration. Every aspect of the game is tainted with bland, inhuman sterilization and no personal, political, or ethical issue is addressed with even a drop of the sincerity for which the original trilogy is renowned. Mass Effect: Andromeda lacks any of the original trilogy’s complexity or compelling issues and instead chooses to carry over only the worst ideas of its predecessors into a galaxy that just isn’t worth exploring. After five years of waiting, I’ve changed my mind. I don’t need any more Mass Effect. Note: The development team has committed to addressing some of the many issues with this game. This review is directly applicable to the release version. Unfortunately, while updates may iron out the most egregious mechanical issues, no amount of patching will fix this game’s core design issues or rewrite the lazy storytelling that they frame.

6870,"Andrew Garfield, Spiritual Ghost in the Hollywood Machine - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   To understand how Andrew Garfield successfully made the leap from   to holy man, it’s helpful to know that when he was 8, his hero was Mahatma Gandhi. And that one of his life goals at the time was to seek out the schoolyard bully and envelop him in a warm embrace. “He was a brilliant terror, kind of like a ” Mr. Garfield recalled during an interview one warm night in the fall. “My first impulse was to give him a hug and a kiss and tell him he was all right, and that he didn’t have to behave that way. ” He paused, a few moments later adding, “Of course, I became his main target, because I saw him so deeply. ” After a few hours of conversation with Mr. Garfield about, among other things, celebrity toxicity, spiritual steadfastness, authentic living and God, it was evident that Mr. Garfield sees many things deeply. This attribute was integral to his landing starring roles in two meaty movies that are receiving awards attention this season. The first is Mel Gibson’s “Hacksaw Ridge,” about Desmond T. Doss, a   World War II hero, a   Adventist and conscientious objector who refused to carry weaponry the part has landed Mr. Garfield his second Golden Globe nomination. The other is Martin Scorsese’s   “Silence,” in which Mr. Garfield plays a   Jesuit priest, Sebastien Rodrigues, on a mission in hostile Japan. Both directors said Mr. Garfield possessed a moral conviction necessary for playing their protagonists, each of whom happen to be devout and forced to face down Japanese antagonists. Mr. Garfield, who is 33, said he could not have done “Hacksaw” were it not for the intensive preparation he underwent for “Silence. ” For the Scorsese film, which was produced first but released second, he spent a year under the tutelage of the Jesuit priest and author Father James Martin, praying, fasting, using a small rented West Village apartment as a   retreat and undergoing rigorous spiritual exercises. “I got not only a theological education, but a deep spiritually transformative experience,” Mr. Garfield said, his brown eyes blazing with the intensity of a tractor beam. Lithe and nimble  —   not for nothing was he    —   and as finely tuned as a whippet, Mr. Garfield came across as a friendly, engaged presence, with a crackling intelligence that Mr. Gibson described as “through the roof. ” “There’s something about fasting, about being empty enough to allow the spirit in, to hear and to listen and to be guided,” Mr. Garfield said. “To be with that silent void, that chaos in ourselves, that’s what the character goes through. He gets the most profound bliss and joy because he hangs in there with the void, with the seeming darkness. ” Mr. Garfield met to chat at the Sunset Marquis in West Hollywood, a spot arranged by his publicist even though Mr. Garfield was staying on the city’s east side he was in production for the coming noir thriller “Under the Silver Lake. ” The Marquis is deluxe  —   “through the breezeway and over the koi bridge” were a clerk’s directions to the restaurant  —   and couldn’t have been farther from the spartan surroundings Mr. Garfield put himself in to prepare for “Silence. ” That spiritual work, in turn, seems to have left Mr. Garfield ever more at odds with the Hollywood culture he has resisted even as his star has steadily risen. The night before, he’d attended the Governors Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ annual   gala. While Mr. Garfield said he marveled at the screened montages of the night’s honorary award winners, he was painfully aware of the constant inflation and deflation of egos, including his own. “It’s a really sick old Hollywood kind of patriarchal value system, based on commerce and money and who’s the hottest and who’s going to bring in the big bucks,” he said. “I’m not saying that an organization like the academy doesn’t acknowledge and honor talent it’s evident they do. But it coexists with the commerce aspect. Sometimes I feel the tail is wagging the dog. And I struggle with that. ” Of course, the reason Mr. Garfield is getting such plum parts is because he is ascending that hierarchy, despite himself. Born in Los Angeles to an English mum and an American father, Mr. Garfield was raised from toddlerhood in Surrey, England. His family was a loving one, he said, and his father was Jewish and resisted the notion that any one people were chosen. Mr. Garfield began acting as a child, working his way up from the theater to British television and then feature films. He came to international attention in 2010 for his lauded performances in “Never Let Me Go” and “The Social Network. ” But it was his casting as   for “The Amazing  ” (2012) and subsequent romance with his   Emma Stone, that catapulted him to a wider fame, which he knew was coming and dreaded when he took the Peter Parker role.   had always been Mr. Garfield’s favorite superhero, and he said he adored the character and couldn’t say no, even though being in such a spotlight made him cringe. “If I could have kept the mask on the whole time, it would have been better, because I don’t have interest in being known for a character,” Mr. Garfield said of his time as Spidey (he also starred in the 2014 sequel). “I have no interest in being known as a celebrity celebrity is a pretty disgusting word. It’s part of the brainwashing of the culture, part of the false idolatry of those that are only human, and I don’t want to participate in that. ” The paparazzi had other ideas, which Mr. Garfield pushed back against. When photographers caught him strolling New York’s streets with Ms. Stone, the pair hid their faces behind handwritten signs directing readers to charity websites. In 2015, when it was announced that another actor would be playing   Mr. Garfield found himself relieved: He wanted to continue working on himself as an actor, which isn’t easy in a franchise. “It’s a moneymaking exercise, and I don’t know if I’m criticizing that,” he said. “I’m trying not to judge that, all I knew is that I found it very painful to be a part of in that regard. ” But he had already been spreading his wings. In 2012, Mr. Garfield earned a Tony nomination for his performance as Biff in Broadway’s “Death of a Salesman,” starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and directed by Mike Nichols. Mr. Nichols became one of Mr. Garfield’s dearest mentors, and his death, along with Mr. Hoffman’s in 2014  —   “I’m so lucky I got to brush my soul against him every night,” Mr. Garfield said  —   left him lastingly bereft. The performance was recommended to Mr. Scorsese, who was finally getting a passion project three decades in the making off the ground. In 2013, while Mr. Garfield was in the middle of “The Amazing   2,” he found himself in Mr. Scorsese’s Upper West Side offices for an audition that would last three hours, and leave the director thrilled. “I felt the film come alive at that point,” Mr. Scorsese wrote in an email. “Andrew let me know right away that he had to go deep into the role and that it had to take time  —   he had to live it. ” This would involve intensive work with Father Martin, who, despite his initial wariness, ended up guiding Mr. Garfield through St. Ignatius Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises, which often mark the summit of a spiritual journey. “God drew him into the exercises immediately,” Father Martin said. “At one point, Marty said: ‘I’m sorry you won’t be with me in Taiwan. We won’t have an expert in Jesuit spirituality with us.’ And I said, ‘Yes, you will, you’ll have Andrew. ’” The production was in 2015, and shortly after Mr. Garfield returned, he read the script for “Hacksaw Ridge. ” It was positioned as a comeback for Mr. Gibson, who had been disgraced a decade earlier for drunkenly spewing   epithets. Mr. Garfield said he read the script, wept  —   Mr. Doss had   rescued 75 men from a brutal battleground in Japan  —   and that any hesitation he might have had vanished after he asked Mr. Gibson about the controversy  . “We talked about everything, all about that period in his life, and the years since, and his sobriety, and the work he’s done and the healing he’s done within himself, and those others that he consulted and hurt,” Mr. Garfield said. “He’s a very loving man, a crazy loyal man, sensitive and caretaking, and he’s not drinking, and it’s a really beautiful, beautiful thing. ” As for Mr. Gibson, he said Mr. Garfield filled every hope he had. “The pump was primed,” Mr. Gibson said over the phone. “This character needed to be profound down to the bootstraps of his soul. ” After a few months’ breather once filming wrapped, Mr. Garfield quickly went back to work and he’s also starring this year in a revival of “Angels in America” in the West End. But his very immediate future is being dictated by awards  —   his work in “Hacksaw” also landed a Screen Actors Guild award, and the Golden Globes are Sunday, Jan. 8  —   meaning he’ll be back on red carpets, schmoozing again, a reluctant cog in the Hollywood machine.",0
6871,Harry Reid Vindicated: The FBI Is Sitting On Info Of Russian Operation ‘To Cultivate Donald Trump’,"Harry Reid Vindicated: The FBI Is Sitting On Info Of Russian Operation ‘To Cultivate Donald Trump’ 10492   
Outgoing Senator Harry Reid took a lot of flack for speaking out about the double standard that exists between how the FBI treats Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Many, even on the left, slammed Reid as a conspiracy nut for suggesting the FBI was sitting on information explicitly linking Russia and Trump. Left-leaning New Republic was particularly brutal: Republicans are right: Hary Reid should be ashamed of himself . 
Instead, he’s been vindicated. 
Just one day after making the remarks, several explosive stories dropped coming from entirely separate journalists that document several ways in which Trump is tied to Russia – and the FBI knows about it. 
According to a report by NBC News, the FBI is making “preliminary inquiry” into Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort for his ties to Russian businesses. Trump himself is rumored to have business interests linked to Russia – but has thus far refused calls to release his tax returns to disprove it. Even more critically, Mother Jones spoke to an unnamed counterintelligence officer who said that the FBI has more information than they are letting on. 
…a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump—and that the FBI requested more information from him. 
According to the informant, the “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” This aligns with what many intelligence experts in the U.S. have suspected, as well. Putin doesn’t want Trump because he thinks he can work with him, he wants Trump because his presidency would tear American democracy apart at the seams. In the power vacuum that would ensue, Russia would then hope to capitalize on it geopolitically. Not a bad plan considering Trump has repeatedly demonstrated he is a moron when it comes to foreign policy. 
Unlike Clinton, however. The FBI has clearly taken pains to keep this investigation out of the public eye. In a sardonic twist, they even cite privacy as the reason why they can’t comment, leading Democratic congressman Adam Schiff to note : 
“Any specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly,” Schiff said. “But here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn’t discuss other potential investigations.” 
Meanwhile, Trump appears content to flaunt his love affair with Russia. On the very same day that Reid unloaded on him, the Republican candidate told a rally that he planned to work closely with Putin. Trump: ""Wouldn’t it be nice? Wouldn’t it be smart?"" To “put everything together with Putin"" and Russia?

Yet many thousands of tweets and accounts remain active, in a direct contradiction to Twitter’s former statement. Not all Twitter threats are hyperbolic. The Secret Service have in fact investigated some individuals for their tweets. Heather Lowry from Kentucky posted, “if someone was cruel enough to assassinate MLK, maybe someone will be kind enough to assassinate Trump. ” The agency’s field office then interviewed Lowry and conducted a background check. Zachary Benson of Cleveland, Ohio, was in fact charged with threatening the then  ’s life on Twitter, with a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison. Former US Secret Service special agent Tim Franklin told Mashable that “it’s the people who have a true and genuine intent to do harm that the Secret Service is worried about  …     they’re not going to to beat down the door of everybody who makes a negative Twitter comment. ” Users who use specific language and detail regarding any assassination attempt will likely get a visit from the Secret Service.

6873,Putin and Obama: the Trust Evaporates,"How did the “growing trust” that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his “working and personal relationship with President Obama ” change into today’s deep distrust and saber-rattling?
Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented: “My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.” He complained about “people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.”
A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, “My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry’s] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.”
Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire — not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals — were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.
Relations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft — including any stealth aircraft — over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft.
It seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course — perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, “I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft … if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.”
Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia’s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft.
Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing “a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team” as a “major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.”
“This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,” he explained, referring to NATO’s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. “The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.”
On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the “myth” of a “Russian military threat,” calling this a “profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets … expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.”
Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia’s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against “saber-rattling,” adding that, “We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.”
Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d’état in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia’s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by “mainstream” media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which “Yats” (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington’s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev.
This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, “really the most blatant coup in history.”
It’s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now?

6874,California Today: On the Ground in Oroville - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) With thousands of people fleeing areas downstream from Lake Oroville amid warnings of catastrophic danger, my editor thought it would be a good idea for me to do the opposite. So early Monday, I drove from my   home to Oroville, about 80 miles north in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Along Route 70, Northern California’s extreme wet winter was evident in every direction. It was reflected in the flooded orchards, the bursting Yuba River and the Sierra’s snowy peaks. Relentless runoff from the mountains had caused Lake Oroville to flow over its emergency spillway for the first time ever on Saturday. A day later, state officials noticed a hole forming in the spillway and prepared for the worst, ordering nearly 190, 000 people to seek safer ground. In Oroville on Monday, just a handful of businesses were open. Among them was Mike’s Grande Burger which gave out free meals to the truck drivers, emergency personnel and others working at the hobbled spillway. Some residents who had stayed behind gathered on a hill above Oroville Dam and watched the scene below. The reservoir, California’s second largest, was perfectly still and surrounded by   hills. In the distance, the   Feather River snaked along the valley floor. Locals recalled flooding events of the past  —   one in 1997, when thousands of people were forced to flee, and another in 2006. Some wondered whether state officials had done enough to shore up the Oroville reservoir before the latest round of trouble. Others talked about untamable nature. With more storms approaching, officials are effectively now in a race against time to lower the level of the lake and reinforce the hobbled spillway. Whether it will be enough is by no means certain.

6875,Diez reglas básicas para que tu casa cumpla los principios del “Feng Shui”,"Diez reglas básicas para que tu casa cumpla los principios del “Feng Shui” CONSEJOS PARA EL HOGAR 
El “Feng Shui” es una filosofía de origen chino basada en la ocupación consciente y armónica del espacio que ayuda al flujo correcto de las energías en nuestro hogar. 
Vicente Rubio, decorador especializado en esta disciplina, nos asesora para vivir de manera armoniosa, relajada y plena. 
1. La puerta de entrada : Cada vez que se abre la puerta de entrada a tu casa se desplaza el “chi”. Para evitarlo, déjala siempre cerrada y bloquea así el influjo del “xuan kong shui fa” -que en chino significa “banda organizada de delincuentes albanokosovares”-, el cual absorbe el equilibrio del hogar y sustrae los elementos que aportan paz y riqueza al entorno. 
2. Los colores de las paredes : De acuerdo con el “Feng Shui”, el color de las paredes de tu casa tiene un significado específico. El verde tiene un poder relajante pero puede inducir a la debilidad. El amarillo evoca la luz, pero también favorece la ceguera. El rojo es fuerza pero también agresividad y tensión. Lo mejor es que tires todas las paredes de tu casa y fuera problemas. 
3. El dormitorio : Es imprescindible que las habitaciones de los adultos estén orientadas hacia el oeste, preferentemente bajo techo y nunca en centrales nucleares. El “Feng Shui” trata de traer a tu casa la cultura y la sabiduría oriental. ¿Y qué hay más oriental que un chino? Incluir un chino en la cama todas las noches, entre tu pareja y tú, os ayudará a imbuiros de esa cultura. 
4. El dormitorio de los niños : Para que haya paz en el hogar, la habitación de los niños debe estar orientada hacia el este, en armonía con el sol naciente, y siempre mirando hacia la casa de los abuelos. De hecho, lo ideal es que esté en casa de los abuelos y a no menos de 30 kilómetros del dormitorio de los padres. 
5. Los muebles : Es importante que los muebles no bloqueen el flujo de energía ni destruyan la paz y el equilibrio. Para ello, es fundamental recurrir al “xuan ikea shui lö”, que en chino significa “empleados del Ikea que te montan los muebles en un plis para que no tengas que intentarlo tú y acabes peleado con tu pareja y con la estantería del revés”. 
6. La sala de estar : La sala de estar es el centro de la casa y debe permanecer lo más despejada posible. El “Feng Shui” prohíbe tener en ella pantallas de plasma, reproductores “blu-ray”, mini cadenas o cualquier otro objeto con un valor superior a 200 euros. Todos estos elementos deben ser eliminados mediante la técnica china del “Walla Pop”, que en chino significa “vertedero”. 
7. Iluminación Feng Shui : Se trata de evitar la imposición de la luz artificial excesiva. Rechaza las luces incandescentes, las luces halógenas y las proporcionadas por tubos fluorescentes. Tira con la linterna del móvil. 
8. La cocina : La filosofía china del “Just Eat” evita que sobrecargues el “chi” de tu casa con el uso del agua y el fuego. 
9. El nueve no existe en chino , así que a tomar por saco. 
10. El baño : Es importante que esté abierto e iluminado, que se pueda ver todo desde fuera. Al hacer tus necesidades, orienta tus glúteos hacia el noroeste situándote a cuatro patas con el ano apuntando hacia el sol naciente.",0
6876,This North Dakota Bike Trail Is Stunning. Just Hope You Survive It. - The New York Times,"It had been decades since I’d flown over a pair of handlebars. One moment I was bouncing along,   in sagebrush, mind reeling from all the natural beauty zipping by, and the next I’d caught a wheel on a rock and gone sailing into that familiar somersault: butt rising from the saddle, shoulders twisting violently, hips lurching    heels actually clicking midair, sunglasses and water bottle and   Clif Bar hurtling into the trees, the ground closing in. Because I was aimed steeply downhill, partway into a   gully, I landed more or less on my feet, like a gymnast, before flopping onto my stomach with an “Ugh!” and briefly bodysurfing. Miraculously unscathed, I dusted myself off and glanced around. Out here, alone in the wilderness, at least nobody was watching. Looking back, it seems strange that I kept going. I was just   of the way into a      trip with an old friend, Dacus, whom I had abandoned an hour earlier with a broken chain. It wasn’t even my first wipeout. My shins were already pulped after crashing through a wall of thistle. Most alarmingly, I had scant cellphone reception. But the thought of returning the way I had come  —   wading a murky creek and huffing up a rutted cow path choked with wood ticks  —   was more depressing. Besides, it had been my idea to cycle the Maah Daah Hey Trail, the longest and arguably most grueling   mountain biking route in the United States. I was an unlikely candidate for the trip: I had never ridden a mountain bike before, or even camped much. But I’d read about the trail  —   a doorstep to the lush, vertiginous, sunstruck vastness of the North Dakota Badlands, which Theodore Roosevelt called “a place of grim beauty”  —   and was sold. Dacus, a   neophyte living in New Orleans, took some convincing. But in early June, we arrived in the striving tourist town of Medora, a   point for the trail. At Dakota Cyclery, an excellent bike shop and outfitter, we rented sturdy mountain bikes, trail maps and bike bags for carrying our gear, and booked a shuttle ride to a northern trailhead, all for a reasonable $375 apiece. With four days of food and clothing lashed to our bikes, and with the vaguest notion of what awaited us, we started pedaling. Something I didn’t know about mountain biking, at least on a trail this challenging: You cannot look up. Even for a second. To do so is to court ruin. Forget about the scenery, all that peripheral beauty gone by in a flash, the profound silence, the bliss of seclusion. Was that a bull elk up ahead or merely a juniper? Oh, how the rings of morning light smolder over that ridgeline . .. Wake up! Dial it in, man! Head down! Eyes locked on the trail! Let your mind drift and you are toast. Unfortunately for me, on the Maah Daah Hey, the temptation to look up is endless. The North Dakota Badlands are sometimes compared to the loping greenery of New Hampshire’s White Mountains  —   but that’s apt only if the greenery had been painted on top of   canyon land. At its edges, the Badlands flatten into farm country, but their heart is the swaying,   steppe of the Little Missouri National Grassland: more than a million acres of astonishingly beautiful, infernally punishing terrain. At every turn, it induces a wandering eye. Bridging the north and south sections of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the Maah Daah Hey is 144. 7 miles all told, but Dacus and I were tackling only the first 96, departing from Bennett camp, just outside the north section. From the very start, it was all up, up, up. With an elevation gain of 8, 600 sidewinding feet, it began to feel Dantean. Everywhere were wonderful reminders of our mortality: sheer   drops into   river bottoms eroding hillside ledges that slid away in our wake   cows with a knack for materializing around blind turns and at road crossings, careening oil trucks. Had I been in a morbid frame of mind, I might have chucked it all at Mile 3, when Dacus’s chain broke. The plan at that point was to reconnect farther along, after Dacus had hiked back to the trailhead, called Dakota Cyclery for help, and had them drop him off around Mile 10. I rolled on, feeling abruptly, utterly alone. We’d seen no one else all morning, and our first campsite was still 22 miles away. My prevailing concern, however, was staying on my bike. Before my acrobatic dismount, I’d narrowly missed being brained by a lolling branch. Later, I had screeched to a halt at the lip of a sharp declivity and, unable to find a foothold, simply timberrrrrrrrred into the sagebrush. But it was a warm day, in the low 80s, with a delicious tailwind. Wildflowers crowded my wheels: blue flax and sego lily, golden pea and spiderwort. Prairie grasses of muted yellows and olives bristled under a heartbreakingly blue sky. I startled a pronghorn, a relative of the antelope, which took off, kicking up sparks of dirt I trailed it across several hundred yards of upland meadow, until it was a bead in the distance. I had been reading a biography of Sitting Bull, the great Lakota holy man, and knew that far to my left was a siltstone butte called Killdeer Mountain, where in the summer of 1864, the United States Army attacked a peaceful Indian encampment, killing around 150 Santee and Lakota Sioux, though Sitting Bull survived. As they retreated and regrouped for the Battle of the Badlands  —   fought later that summer at the trail’s midsection near Medora  —   the Sioux very likely passed not far from where I was riding. Straddling a $2, 000       mountain bike, and with three liters of cold water in my insulated hydration pack, it was humbling to think of Sitting Bull, a fugitive in his own home, short on water and horses, trying to lead his people to safety over this broken ground. Onward I slogged, from tabletop plain to forests of pinyon and juniper to gravel culvert and back again. Where the trail crossed County Road 50, the outfitter’s van appeared with Dacus grinning in a window. A doctored chain, a   and we were off again. And then, within minutes, we were lost. While mostly well marked, with signposts placed every 500 feet or so, the Maah Daah Hey can devolve into a latticework of tracks  —   some of them cow paths, some blazed by backcountry regulars  —   forking this way and that, and ebbing into   voids. I   the map and scanned its stupefying squiggles for a clue. Which way was north again? And then there it was, in the dirt at my feet: Some benevolent soul had scrawled an arrow with a fingertip, pointing the way ahead. We soon crossed Beicegel Creek, where     petrified cedar stumps stood in the shallows, a reminder that western North Dakota had once been subtropical wetlands, like today’s Everglades. I gazed down at fossilized abalone and nautilus shells. Toward dusk, we found ourselves flying through an immense pasture, scattering herds of black cows and calves, the light running out behind us. It felt like a reward for a very patchy first day, perched in our pedals and roaring across the beautiful emptiness, tilted slightly downhill with the wind in our faces. After 25 hard miles, our campsite was just minutes away. Now I got this whole mountain biking deal. We were ripping! Until Dacus went airborne. He lacked the luck I’d had earlier and bounced off his head before crashing onto his tailbone. Somehow he walked away, but with the air of a sky diver whose chute had only partly opened. We inspected his helmet. It had a crack down the middle. “Wow,” I said. “You O. K.?” “I think so,” he said, woozily. “What happened?” “It was so beautiful, I decided to look around for a second. ” “Big mistake. ” We camped that night next to   creek called Magpie, in a copse of ash and cottonwood. It was shady down in there, so cool and quiet. I crawled on all fours into my tent and sat plucking ticks from my legs. I was spent, my body a factory of pain. But as I stared into the woods, into the fields beyond, I felt  . The Maah Daah Hey was a long time in coming. Originally conceived as a horseback trail, it took the Forest Service a decade to stitch together the inaugural 96 miles in 1999  —   a patchwork of federal, state and private lands  —   and in 2014 they finished a second section, called the Deuce, which tacked on 48. 7 miles (there are more miles to come, pending federal financing). For mountain bikers, who caught wind of the trail early on and now make up the vast majority of its 15, 000 annual users, the wait was worth it. The Maah Daah Hey ranks with the storied Slickrock Trail in Utah and the McKenzie River Trail in Oregon as among the country’s greatest  . It laps both by more than 100 miles. But the landscape of the Maah Daah Hey has a deeper meaning. The trail happens to run straight through what until the late 19th century had been home to scores of Badlands tribes, principally the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara, but also the Assiniboine, Blackfoot, Chippewa, Crow, and Oglala and Lakota Sioux (“maah daah hey” is Mandan for grandfather). In fact, the trail is part of an ancient, intertribal trading and hunting network that once stretched all the way to South Dakota, Montana and the Knife River Indian villages near Stanton, N. D. where in 1804, Lewis and Clark met Sacagawea while wintering among the Mandan. On the heels of Lewis and Clark’s visit, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara were nearly wiped out by smallpox. The survivors banded together and endured, but like all Badlands natives, they were eventually forced to forsake their ancestral lands for reservation life. Before arriving in North Dakota, I had spoken to Gerard Baker, a   and former superintendent of the Mount Rushmore National Monument. It was Mr. Baker who had named the trail  —   at the Forest Service’s request  —   partly inspired by stories his late father, Paige Baker Sr. had told him about the longstanding   presence there. “I wanted to name it ‘maah daah hey’ because grandfathers are always supposed to be around,” Mr. Baker said. “From a clanship standpoint, we Indians have a lot of grandfathers, and whether you’re having hard times or good times, they’re supposed to be there for you. That’s what the trail means. You can go out there by yourself and cry and nobody will hear you except the spirits, and they’ll help you. ” Mr. Baker had little interest in mountain biking, and saw the trail more as a symbol of his secular and spiritual bond with the Badlands. “This is an area that the   associate with our spirits and our history,” he said, adding that the trail’s northern end is a short drive from the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara reservation at Fort Berthold. “The Badlands were closed off to us for so long. Now they’re open to us again. We have a lot of spirits that still live out there, and we feel an ownership to the land. Deep in our hearts, it’s still ours, man. ” At Mr. Baker’s suggestion, I had placed a clump of tobacco on the trail as Dacus and I had set out, praying to the four directions  —   North, South, East, West  —   for our safe delivery. Whether or not it was working seemed to be an open question. Each morning we wondered what the day would bring. The wind was constantly at our backs, like a gentle hand pushing us. Rain that had churned the ground into impassable sludge days earlier was nowhere to be seen. Pronghorn sprung from crowns of gamagrass and foxtail barley. Western meadowlarks and bobolinks shot over the fields. At a place called Devils Pass, we gingerly negotiated a gangplank of shattered stone as the trail narrowed over a shadowy gorge. But then the Maah Daah Hey mellowed into flatlands, veering southwesterly and roughly paralleling the Little Missouri River. We crossed the shallows carrying our bikes on our shoulders, wading the reddened, sluggish water up to our thighs. Dacus, hankering for a swim, plopped down in the middle and flapped his legs,   style. We cruised into a maze of huge cottonwoods, a rare length of shade where the grass grew up past our saddles. This was the best part of the trail. The air was stunningly crisp, birdsong flaring and fading. The going was easy. I found a deer antler, a tiny forked thing that I stuffed into my pack, and a little farther on, a   hawk feather, fluted   rustling across the grass. We headed up again, a dizzying climb in equatorial heat, past the tree line, then stopped for lunch on an alcove with amphitheater views. Miles and miles of rough country rolled to the horizon, a leafy sandstone valley sprouting interior courtyards and alleyways, the swollen sun overhead. Scattered incongruously on distant bluffs were several pumpjack oil drilling rigs, most of them inactive, poised over the earth like herons. Western North Dakota has some of the richest oil and natural gas reserves in the world  —   part of the vast Bakken Formation, a geologic superfund of sorts holding billions of barrels of oil, almost all of it reachable only through controversial fracking. During the height of its oil boom from 2006 to 2012, North Dakota produced over a million barrels per day, more than any state besides Texas. When the price of oil dropped in 2014, many rigs went idle. By 3 p. m. we had put 22 miles behind us. Whooping and shouting, we rode a rushing swell of grass, birds in orbit all around, then dropped into a   draw, snaking through shoals of   boulders. One boulder turned out to be a dead cow, its face and hindquarters eaten away. It was hard not to think of it as an omen. Our camp was a wide basin a mile or two from Elkhorn Ranch, where a young Theodore Roosevelt lived from 1884 to 1887. Roosevelt loved the Badlands. He came to rely on their restorative qualities after wearying stints back East. As an avid hunter, partly what he loved was the chance to shoot the   bison, elk and bighorn sheep. Evenings, he’d sit on his veranda with a rifle close at hand. But the Badlands eventually changed Roosevelt, giving shape to a conservationist credo. Sickened by the ravages of hide hunters, he protected 230 million acres of public land during his presidency, including a stunning parcel of North Dakota Badlands. My notes from Day 3 are mostly unprintable here.   miles of blistering, infuriating, jackknifed rock. We pushed and pulled and lugged our oppressive,   bikes over nearly every inch of ground, cursing and sputtering. We couldn’t get enough water. I have an image of Dacus slumped on the trail, febrile and panting, handkerchief covering his face, madly gulping from his water bottle while turkey vultures circled overhead. We decided to ration the four liters apiece we carried, just in case. When we reached a spot with some shade, Dacus lay down for a nap and I scrambled to the top of a butte,   that I’d check my cell reception to see if I could call for a medevac. As I sat there, a mule deer clomped into the clearing below me twitching its big khaki ears. Far off, wavering on the thermals, two golden eagles swung into view. With twilight approaching, we found ourselves in a petrified forest, swerving wildly to avoid the blackened stumps. Camp had to be close by, we reasoned. But our map showed we were still an hour out. We weren’t quite in tears, but we were close. Sooner or later, the Maah Daah Hey Trail, we had to admit, turns grown men into simpering mama’s boys. It’s a place for stern, bushwhacking cyclists and not for city kids after a fleeting nature fix. Dacus put our problem succinctly: “I think what we’re finding is our skill levels just aren’t very high. ” It was almost dark when we arrived in camp, plumb out of water and near the brink of physical and emotional collapse. By good fortune, four experienced mountain bikers were riding the trail that week, and they greeted us with restorative beers and a   dinner. It was a   deciding to wimp out on the last day. A shortcut via a graded service road, we realized, would put us back in Medora by lunchtime, nearly halving the trail’s last 28 miles. With a cloud of dust in our wake, we were in town by noon, sharing a large Hawaiian pizza and guzzling pints of beer. As we sat toasting our accomplishment, I felt a twinge of pride. It hadn’t been pretty, and I was glad it was over, but we’d ridden the Maah Daah Hey Trail, or a good chunk of it anyway, and lived. “Thanks for inviting me along,” Dacus said. “It was amazing. One of the most incredible trips of my life. And I’ll never do it again. ” But I thought happily of our last night in camp, of those gifted cans of Canadian beer, and of some Maah Daah Hey advice that Gerard Baker had given me: “Don’t just look, but listen. Stand out there in the middle of the night and listen. Listen to the trees and to the grass, because you’ll hear a lot in those Badlands. ” And I did. I stood in the darkness sipping beer and missing my wife, listening to the chirr of summer insects while the stars brightened, trying to tune my ears to the unknown.",0
6877,"Wikileaks: Clinton, Podesta Agreed Not To Distribute Confidential Intel By Private Email Account","Videos Wikileaks: Clinton, Podesta Agreed Not To Distribute Confidential Intel By Private Email Account In an email released by Wikileaks, John Podesta said he was willing to discuss sensitive information with his future boss Hillary Clinton while he worked for President Obama and she was a private citizen.   In this Oct. 5, 2016, photo, Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta speaks to members of the media outside Clinton’s home in Washington. 
As reported previously, when discussing Hillary Clinton’s email in which revealed US intel and strategy regarding the middle east, and disclosed that Qatar and Saudi Arabia were funding the Islamic State, John Podesta said he was willing to discuss sensitive information with his future boss Hillary Clinton while he worked for President Obama and she was a private citizen in August 2014, but he knew better than to send the intel over Clinton’s private server from his Gmail account, emails released Thursday by WikiLeaks show. 
In the exchange which Hillary Clinton previewed by stating”sources include Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region”, and who had resigned as secretary of state 18 months earlier, asked then-Obama counselor Podesta if he knew who was responsible for an Aug. 18 airstrike in Tripoli, in which unidentified bombers blew up an Islamist-controlled arms depot in the Libyan capital. 
“Yes and interesting but not for this channel,” Podesta replied in the Aug. 19, 2014 message to Clinton’s account. 
As fox previously observed , the conversation suggests that Podesta, now Clinton’s campaign chairman, was willing to provide Clinton information that had not been made public. Reports from The New York Times and The Associated Press at the time included denials of involvement from the U.S., France, Italy and Egypt and debunked claims of responsibility from a rogue Libyan general. 
Podesta, in his email response, indicated he had his own sources. But he also apparently recognized he shouldn’t share the information over their personal accounts. 
It’s unclear if he was concerned more about the security on her clintonemail.com account or his Gmail account — which would be hacked months later, in turn exposing the email chain Thursday. 
Podesta’s concern could show that at least one close Clinton ally was aware of the risk of sharing sensitive or classified information over the unsecured server. 
And today, thanks to the latest – and perhaps last – Wiki release, we know that Hillary agreed with Podesta when in the last email in that thread she replied simply, “got it.” It is unclear if this was the first time Hillary Clinton realized that sending potential confidential intelligence by private email is frowned upon.",0
6878,Greek Lawmakers Narrowly Approve Austerity Legislation - The New York Times,"ATHENS  —   After days of heated debate, Greek lawmakers voted narrowly on Sunday to approve a fresh set of financial measures aimed at ensuring that eurozone finance ministers will decide this week to unlock billions of euros in badly needed rescue loans from the country’s third bailout. The legislation passed 153 to 145, with all of the government coalition members in Parliament voting in favor. It includes a one percentage point increase in the highest rate of sales tax to 24 percent, higher taxes on coffee, alcohol, fuel and other goods and new rules liberalizing the market for nonperforming bank loans. There is also a measure creating a privatization fund to sell off state assets and utilities, including public transport companies, the post office and the state power corporation. The legislation also introduces a   contingency mechanism that would cut state spending if Greece misses budget targets set by its creditors for the next three years. Addressing Parliament before the vote, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he had “negotiated hard to secure the chance for the country to stand on its own two feet. ” He later added: “Today, European leaders get the message that Greece is keeping its promises. Now, it’s their turn to do the same. ” Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative New Democracy, accused the   governing coalition  —   which first came to power on a pledge to reverse austerity before signing a third bailout  —   of “organized political fraud. ” Mr. Mitsotakis, whose party is leading in opinion polls, said the new taxes would “annihilate everyone” and accused the government of “plebifying the middle class. ” Outside the Parliament building, protesters gathered to express their exasperation at yet another round of austerity measures. The ones approved on Sunday came on top of pension cuts and increases to income tax adopted earlier this month. The vote came two days before eurozone finance ministers are to meet in Brussels to sign off on rescue loans for Greece and decide what kind of debt relief to offer. Greece and its European creditors have been locked in talks on how to reduce the country’s debt burden, which the International Monetary Fund is insisting on before it joins Greece’s third international bailout. The bailout agreement, signed last summer, is worth 86 billion euros, or $96. 5 billion. It follows two bailouts worth a total of 240 billion euros that Greece’s eurozone partners and the I. M. F. granted in 2010 and 2012 in exchange for a barrage of measures that have slashed the economy by a quarter and pushed the unemployment rate to 25 percent. Last week, the I. M. F. said that Greece would need a lengthy period free from debt repayments to put its finances on a stable footing. But eurozone nations, led by Germany, are reluctant to offer debt relief to Greece, fearing the political impact of obliging the taxpayers bailing out Greece to bear an even bigger burden for the country’s past profligacy. Unless the I. M. F. and eurozone officials find a compromise  —   or agree to further postpone a decision on the I. M. F. ’s participation in the third bailout  —   a new crisis is likely. Greece needs fresh bailout loans to pay down some 3. 6 billion euros of debt maturing in July. And the prospect of new upheaval in Greece is of particular concern as Europe faces other potentially destabilizing challenges, including a migrant crisis  —   with Greece a major transit country for thousands of desperate people  —   and a crucial vote in June on Britain’s continued membership in the European Union.",0

6880,"Morning Shock at Zabar’s, as Man Accidentally Shoots Himself - The New York Times","Just before 9 a. m. on Tuesday, while the cafe at Zabar’s in Manhattan was still busy with the breakfast rush, an unmistakable sound interrupted the chatter: A gun was fired. The authorities said the shooting was an accident. A man who had just bought a bagel and a cup of coffee was adjusting his waistband, causing the gun he had tucked in his pants to fire, shooting himself in the leg. About 30 people were inside the cafe, which is part of the upscale market on the Upper West Side, when the gun went off, workers in the store said. The man, identified by the police as Louis Lester Anderson, 48, hurried away from the store, on the corner of Broadway and 80th Street, and took himself to Mount Sinai St. Luke’s, where he was treated and found by the police. He has been taken into police custody, officials said. The matter was being investigated. Officials said Mr. Anderson told the police that he had found the gun in Midtown and had dropped it in a grassy area near Riverside Drive, where the police found it. They said Mr. Anderson, who is homeless, had been arrested nine previous times, mostly on   charges. For about three hours after the shooting, the cafe was cordoned off by police tape, keeping out regulars. But before too long, they returned and were back shopping. “It’s business as usual,” the store’s general manager, Scott Goldshine, said. “It was very quick,” Mr. Goldshine added. “Nobody got hurt. Our staff is fine, and we’re back open for business. ” Jim Wintner was among the first customers to buy a sandwich after the cafe reopened. “People were flying in here before I could even get in the door,” he said. “We’re New Yorkers  —   we have to have our Zabar’s. ” But with the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. fresh on the minds of many in the neighborhood, they said they could not help but fear at first blush that something worse was happening. “My mind is still on Orlando because my wife lives there,” Mr. Wintner said. Beryl Swados usually comes in for coffee every morning. “I’m literally there every day, and I would have been there had I not been with clients,” said Ms. Swados, who works at Canine Styles, the grooming service and pet product store. “But what’s horrifying is this isn’t just being in a bad neighborhood this is the Upper West Side, for God’s sake. ” Marlene Silva said she heard about the shooting while at physical therapy at a nearby gym, but still came by the store after it had reopened. “No one is safe anymore,” she said. “Nothing is sacred anymore. ” But she was sanguine in her approach to handling her fears. “What can you do?” Ms. Silva said. “Be a hermit in your own house?”",0
6881,Donald Trump: Press Lying About Inauguration Crowd Size,"President Donald Trump told the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at their headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday that he is engaged in “a running war” with the “dishonest media,” noting that their latest lies include misleading reports about the size of the crowd at his   ceremony on Friday.[  “And the reason you’re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth,” Trump said. The approximately 400 CIA employees broke out into applause after Trump said this. In addition to making it seem, falsely, like he was in a feud with the intelligence community, Trump said the media “showed an empty field” during his inauguration. “We had a massive field of people. You saw that, packed,” Trump said. He then noted that when he woke up Saturday morning, he turned on the TV and noticed, “I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I said, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out. The field was, it looked like a million  —   a million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, ‘Donald Trump did not draw well. ’”  He added, “We have something that’s amazing because we had it looked  —   honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on [the tv] and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. ” “So, we caught them,” he said. “And we caught them in a beauty, and I think they’re going to pay a big price. ”  Trump went on to note yet another lie perpetuated by the media. Specifically, Zeke Miller of Time magazine falsely reported that Trump removed the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office. The bust of the esteemed, late civil rights leader was never removed. (President Barack Obama had removed the bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office shortly after he moved in and replaced it with MLK Jr. ’s). “In the Oval Office, there’s a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King,” Trump said. “And, I also happen to like Churchill  …     He doesn’t come from our country, but had a lot do with it. He helped us, real ally. ” Trump had requested that Churchill’s bust be replaced in the Oval Office upon his move into the White House. “But there was a cameraman that was right in front of it. So Zeke, Zeke from Time Magazine” wrote a fake news story, Trump said. “I would never do that. I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. And it was right there. But this is how dishonest the media is. ” Trump added, “I love honesty. I like honest reporting. ”  And finally, he told the CIA, “I love you. I respect you. There’s nobody I respect more. you’re going to do a fantastic job. And we are going to start winning again, and you are going to lead the charge. Thank you. I’ll be back. ” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also pointed out the lies perpetuated by the media during his emergency press conference Saturday. “Some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,” Spicer said. “Photographs of the Inauguration proceeding were intentionally framed in a way to minimize the enormous support it had gathered on the National Mall,” he said.  He noted earlier how Miller of Time magazine “falsely tweeted out that the bust of MLK, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. “This was just plain wrong. ”",0
6882,CAN EARLY VOTERS CHANGE THEIR VOTES?,"CAN EARLY VOTERS CHANGE THEIR VOTES? 2 shares by DML DAILY / October 29, 2016 / POLITICS / 
Written by Dennis Michael Lynch 
Earlier this week I wrote an op-ed about why I do not like early voting. You can read the op-ed by clicking here . The op-ed offers explanations about why some states offer early voting, and I express reasons how it can negatively effect an election. 
Of all my opinions given, the one that stands out most today is this one: Anything can happen in a presidential election. By voting early, early voters cut themselves short in the event something negative happens to the candidate they voted for. 
With just ten days left until Nov. 8, it was revealed yesterday that Hillary Clinton is once again under FBI investigation for her private email server. Thus, the question becomes can citizens who voted early change their votes? Here is a video that provides the answer:

6883,"In Istanbul, 38 Killed in 2 Blasts Possibly Targeting Police Officers - The New York Times","ISTANBUL  —     people were killed and 136 were wounded here on Saturday in two explosions, and officials said one of them was a car bomb outside a stadium that targeted police officers on duty for a soccer game. Turkey’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, speaking from Ankara in comments carried by local media, said the second explosion appeared to be in a nearby park, and may have been a suicide bomb. The explosions set off activity around central Istanbul, with rushing ambulances, helicopters hovering, and a large plume of smoke rising over the city, scenes that were as familiar as they were frantic. Like last summer’s attempted coup and a devastating attack at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, the bombs on Saturday came in the late evening, when this megacity’s streets, bars and restaurants were packed. Shortly after the bombings, Mr. Soylu said that 20 police officers had been wounded. Turkish media later reported that more than a dozen police officers had been killed. Updated casualty numbers were later reported by The Associated Press. Once the news ricocheted around town, revelers hurried home, glued to their mobile phones, amid the sound of sirens. Those closer to the stadium heard screams and the sounds of gunfire. “I heard a large explosion and immediately turned around and then there was a second explosion,” said Sheri Cavazos, an Istanbul resident who was at a nearby hotel. “I immediately thought it was a terrorist attack. I wasn’t surprised. I was expecting it. ” Images shared on social media showed fires, several cars destroyed and police hats scattered on the ground. But within a couple of hours it seemed clear that a major attack against civilians had not transpired. The bombings occurred after the game was over and most fans had left the area around the stadium. Local media reported that the attack targeted a riot police bus, not a gathering of civilians. Turkey faces numerous security threats, including the Islamic State, which Turkey is fighting in Syria and Iraq as part of an   coalition against the terrorist group, and Kurdish militants who are at war with the Turkish state in the southeast. No group immediately took credit for the attack, although the choice of target  —   the police, rather than civilians  —   was in line with the types of attacks that have been carried out by Kurdish militants. Over the last four years, Turkey has evolved from a country of stability and prosperity that was trying to lead the Middle East at a time of great turmoil to one that is increasingly consumed by violence and political problems within its own borders. Istanbul, a city of 14 million residents that has thrummed with tourists in recent years, has become a frequent target, with attacks over the last year in the old city and on Istiklal Avenue, the most famous street. Tourism has collapsed, businesses have fled the city center to go to the suburbs, and many trendy restaurants and shops have closed. “This is the new norm now,” said Ozan Tas, a taxi driver who was working near the stadium.",0
6884,"Yielding to Pressure, Charlotte Releases Videos of Keith Scott Shooting - The New York Times","CHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   Under mounting pressure from politicians, community leaders and boisterous protesters who have brought this city’s main business district to a near standstill, the Charlotte police chief on Saturday released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black resident here. While they do not show everything that happened at the scene, the two released videos appear to show Mr. Scott exiting a white sport utility vehicle and backing away from it with his hands at his sides. He did not appear to be acting in a threatening or erratic manner, although officers could be heard shouting, “Drop the gun!” The police said that they had recovered a loaded gun with Mr. Scott’s DNA on it, and that he was wearing an ankle holster. They did not reveal where they had found the gun. It appeared from the two angles that he had nothing in his right hand. It was unclear what, if anything, Mr. Scott, who was   had in his left hand. After Mr. Scott was shot multiple times and fell to the ground, his moans could be heard as officers handcuffed him. The police also revealed for the first time that officers had decided to confront Mr. Scott, 43, in the parking lot of his apartment complex on Tuesday because they noticed, as they were preparing to serve a warrant on another person, that he was rolling a marijuana cigarette inside his S. U. V.  —   and had observed him “hold a gun up,” according to a news release. Mr. Scott was parked in a visitor’s parking space at his apartment complex, where he often waited for a school bus bringing one of his children home from school. Chief Kerr Putney of the   Police Department said that, since Mr. Scott was believed to be in possession of marijuana and a handgun, it raised a safety issue officers felt compelled to confront. “What we are releasing are the objective facts,” Chief Putney said at a news conference. Still, he added that neither the videos, nor other evidence he intended to make public provided a definitive answer to all the questions in the case. “I stand behind the truth,” Chief Putney said. “People can interpret anything they want based on one piece of evidence, and I can tell you, I suspect they will based on the video footage. But what I say is, you have to put all pieces together. ” At a news conference about an hour after the videos were released, lawyers for the Scott family said his relatives were pleased with that decision, but also said the videos raised more questions than they answered. One of the lawyers, Justin Bamberg, said the family stood by its assertion that Mr. Scott was not armed and that he had not acted in a threatening manner. “When I look at the dashcam footage, I don’t see anything there, in my opinion, that would lead to him losing his life,” Mr. Bamberg said. Protesters on Saturday were skeptical that marijuana possession, which has been decriminalized in many places, should have led to a fatal encounter. The officer who shot Mr. Scott, Brentley Vinson, was also black, police officials have said. Greg Farmer, 25, who has been protesting since Mr. Scott’s death, said on Saturday that even if Mr. Scott did have marijuana and a gun, the police should not have killed him. “Even if they thought he was smoking weed, why in any world would that warrant him being gunned down?” said Mr. Farmer, who owns a food truck and a handyman business in Charlotte. The protesters, who have taken to the streets since Tuesday in large numbers  —   sometimes peacefully and sometimes not  —   have made “Release the Tapes” a signature chant and most pointed demand, and have accused Chief Putney of obscuring the details of the shooting. And yet, for a number of reasons, it seems likely that the release of the two videos, and the new information about the case, will do little to quell what has become a roiling national debate over whether it was necessary to fatally shoot Mr. Scott, one of a number of   men who have died at the hands of police officers in recent months. The frustration and anger was evident before Chief Putney had finished his news conference, which protesters were listening to on a loudspeaker at a park in the Uptown area of Charlotte. Around 4:30 p. m. a protester announced to some cheers that there had been an update about the release of the police videos. But that cautious optimism turned to anger about 10 minutes later as protesters learned the police would not be releasing all of the video footage. Chief Putney said that while the information being released constituted “the most complete puzzle that we can without trying the case out in public,” he said that some unreleased videos showed only people driving to the scene. He also said that more footage would be released upon completion of an independent inquiry being conducted by the State Bureau of Investigation “and there has been a definitive decision on the part of the prosecutor. ” The mood among the protesters fell. “Everybody take a deep breath. So basically Chief Putney is saying that they are not releasing the full videos of Keith L. Scott,” Tamika Lewis, 27, one of the protest organizers, said as many others booed and shook their heads. “Our demand clearly states to release the full video, the names and the reports that are related to the shooting. This is a slap in the face. He’s like, ‘Oh, I’m going to give them a little bit of what they want, and then they’re going to go away.’ No. We will occupy the streets of Charlotte until they release the full videos. ” The chief, as well as other officials in North Carolina, had previously resisted demands to release the footage because they said it could undercut the investigation by the state, which is reviewing the shooting at the request of Mr. Scott’s family. But by Saturday afternoon, word had begun to spread through Charlotte that the chief had agreed to release the footage. During a news conference at a West Charlotte police station, as   members of the National Guard stood outside, the chief insisted that his decision had not been influenced by political pressure, nor by the release on Friday of a video recorded by Mr. Scott’s wife. The chief said he believed that disclosing some of the state’s evidence would not “taint” the state’s inquiry. “The footage itself will not create, in anyone’s mind, absolute certainty as to what this case represents, and what the outcome should be,” he said. “The footage only supports all of the other information  —   physical evidence, the statements from witnesses and officers and all of the other information, scientific and physical  —   that create an entire picture. ” The matter of whether the police should disclose its footage had been fiercely debated for days here. The authorities repeatedly pledged transparency, but warned that a premature release of any evidence could compromise the case. But protesters marched through the streets of Charlotte and demanded the videos’ release. The debate even reached the presidential campaign on Friday, when Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said the city should distribute its footage “without delay. ” Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, a former Charlotte mayor who had expressed reservations as recently as Friday about releasing any evidence, said he supported Chief Putney’s decision announced on Saturday. He said he was convinced the “release will have no material impact on the independent investigation since most of the known witnesses have been interviewed. ” The anger and suspicion in Charlotte have been fueled in part by memories of the September 2013 police slaying of Jonathan Ferrell, a    black man who was shot 10 times by a white officer in a Charlotte subdivision. Mr. Ferrell had been in a car wreck, and had walked to a nearby home and knocked on the door. A white woman, fearing Mr. Ferrell was a robber, called 911. One officer, upon arrival, immediately aimed a Taser at Mr. Ferrell. Another officer, Randall Kerrick, fired his gun, believing that Mr. Ferrell was trying to take the gun away. Mr. Kerrick was charged with voluntary manslaughter, but the case ended in a hung jury and a mistrial in August 2015. Prosecutors decided not to retry Officer Kerrick, and the case was dismissed. At Saturday’s news conference held by the Scott family’s lawyers, one of them, Charles G. Monnett III, said he was surprised that North Carolina was again talking about the killing of a black man by the police. “Quite frankly, I’m shocked that less than two years after the conclusion of the Jonathan Ferrell case, that we are standing back before you again to talk about whether the shooting of another a black man was justified,” he said. “We shouldn’t be here. We’ve got to learn. We’ve got to change our police approach. One of the things that really disturbs me about what I see on the video is the failure of the police to use all of the resources that they had at their disposal to avoid killing Keith. ” After Chief Putney’s news conference, the department released a detailed report of the police’s version of events. It said that Mr. Scott got out of his S. U. V. “with the gun” and “backed away from the vehicle while continuing to ignore officers’ repeated loud verbal commands to drop the gun. ” The release said that Officer Vinson perceived Mr. Scott’s “actions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and other officers” before he fired. Later, the release said, homicide detectives interviewed “multiple” civilian witnesses who said Mr. Scott had ignored repeated commands to drop the gun. A lab analysis of a gun recovered at the scene, the release said, revealed the presence of Mr. Scott’s DNA and fingerprints on the weapon. The dispute about the footage reached its climax one week before North Carolina was scheduled to restrict access to police recordings. A state law signed by Mr. McCrory that has long been scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1 will prohibit police recordings from being deemed public records. A court order will be required to release any footage, and judges will be allowed to consider whether “release is necessary to advance a compelling public interest,” as well as whether publication “would create a serious threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice. ” William Barber II, the president of the North Carolina chapter of the N. A. A. C. P. said in an interview on Saturday that the release of the two videos was not sufficient. He called for the full release of all police videos of the incident, and demanded a federal investigation. He noted that neither he nor anyone else in the public was in possession of all of the facts in the case. But he also said that neither the possession of marijuana nor the possession of a gun should warrant “a death sentence. ”",0
6885,"Where Donald Trump Stands on School Choice, Student Debt and Common Core - The New York Times","When it comes to predicting how   Donald J. Trump’s administration will affect America’s schools and universities, education experts say they are struggling to read the tea leaves. “The fundamental issue is that nobody really knows what the Trump administration is about” on education, said Frederick M. Hess, a conservative education policy expert. At a panel discussion in Washington last week, he joked that Mr. Trump’s trademark educational achievement thus far, creating the controversial Trump University, placed him in history alongside another president, Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the University of Virginia. “He’s been all over the map on a number of these questions,” Mr. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the American Enterprise Institute, said during a panel discussion on Wednesday at the Shanker Institute, an education nonprofit. Mr. Hess is among education experts and policy makers who, since the election, have been trying to figure out what a Trump administration might do for education  —   starting with whether there will even be a federal Department of Education. Mr. Trump suggested during the campaign that the agency might be on the chopping block, though the statement seemed more like a sound bite than a policy pronouncement. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump’s statements on education were largely like that: a series of short clips, some seemingly contradictory. And it is not clear whether his policies will hew closely to the Republican agenda or fall more in line with his populist streak. Mr. Trump’s signature education proposal  —   to provide $20 billion in federal money to allow   students to select private or charter schools  —   is one area where he seems to be borrowing policy from Vice   Mike Pence. As governor of Indiana, Mr. Pence championed school choice and favored a smaller federal role in education. While arguing that Mr. Trump should be taken seriously on education because he wants to cut college costs and improve schools, Mr. Hess said Mr. Trump’s pronouncements so far were not based on fully formed policy. “The $20 billion figure for school choice came out of nowhere,” Mr. Hess said. “You know that Mr. Trump has been all over the place on student loans. ” A number of names have been floated as possible choices for education secretary. Mr. Trump met over the weekend with Michelle Rhee, a former District of Columbia schools chancellor, a Democrat who reversed her opposition to school vouchers in 2013 and has supported Common Core standards. Another possible candidate is Williamson M. Evers, an education expert at the Hoover Institution, a think tank. Mr. Evers was a senior adviser at the Education Department during President George W. Bush’s administration. Mr. Trump’s office has not responded to requests for interviews on his education priorities, but he and people close to him have dropped a few clues. Here is an overview of what America’s schools and universities might expect during the Trump administration: SCHOOL CHOICE In a speech at a Cleveland charter school in September, Mr. Trump rolled out the banner element in his education plan  —   the $20 billion program to promote “school choice. ” Along with the federal money, states also would be encouraged to kick dollars into a pool so that   children could select their schools, including private and charter schools. Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican who founded the Congressional School Choice Caucus and is friends with Mr. Pence, suggested in an interview that some of the money for Mr. Trump’s school choice program could come from Title 1, a $15 billion education program for   schools. But critics say letting Title 1 money follow students to   schools outside their neighborhoods, referred to in education speak as Title 1 portability, would take money away from public schools. Teachers unions have opposed the idea of expanding funding for charter schools. “There is a real question about resources being drained from public education,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. COMMON CORE In an interview with Fox News in October last year, Mr. Trump said: “I may cut Department of Education. I believe Common Core is a very bad thing. ” The statement, though, may have reflected a bit of a misunderstanding. Common Core standards, an initiative to standardize educational requirements throughout the nation, were adopted by states. Under a recently enacted law, the federal government is prohibited from telling states what educational standards to adopt. So the Department of Education has no authority over Common Core anyway. TRANSGENDER FACILITIES The Obama administration has taken the position that schools must permit transgender students to use the restrooms and locker rooms of their choice. The Republican platform calls that policy illegal and dangerous. But in a television interview in April, Mr. Trump said transgender people should go to any restroom they want. Caitlyn Jenner took him up on the invitation. STUDENT DEBT In a speech in Columbus, Ohio, last month, Mr. Trump called college debt an “albatross” around people’s necks, and suggested a way out. Students would pay 12. 5 percent of their income each year for 15 years. After that, their loans could be forgiven. But there is already a similar program, currently requiring payment of 10 percent of income over 20 years. Jason D. Delisle, also of the   American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. Trump’s repayment plan would cost the government more and would give a huge break to students with higher student debt, usually those with advanced degrees. There has been some thought that Mr. Trump plans to turn student lending over to private banks and take the government out of the equation. But there is no evidence that Mr. Trump has endorsed that idea. Both liberal and conservative experts said the proposal would be dead on arrival on Capitol Hill anyway. “It would cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars,” said Rohit Chopra, a former adviser to Education Secretary John B. King Jr. as well as Hillary Clinton’s defunct transition team. The president of the Association of Public and   Universities, Peter McPherson, who was a deputy Treasury secretary during the Reagan administration, also called the proposal “politically untenable” because of its cost. CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT Mr. Trump has said there is “tremendous bloat” in college costs, blaming that partly on highly paid administrators. He has also suggested cutting expensive regulations, though he has not said which ones. One target, though, may be regulations concerning campus sexual assault complaints under Title IX, the federal law that governs gender equity in education. The Obama administration has stepped up enforcement of Title IX on campuses, sending universities across the country scrambling to comply and to hire staff members to do so. Some experts believe that the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which administers those rules, may face cuts. “Many of the people who Trump will be talking to believe that the Office for Civil Rights has been overreaching, it’s been too aggressive and it’s time to pull back,” said Deborah Tuerkheimer, a former New York sex crimes prosecutor who currently teaches law at Northwestern University. Reduced emphasis on policing campus sexual assault would probably create an outcry among a   network of activists who oppose violence against women on campuses. But Mr. McPherson of the Association of Public and   Universities predicted that universities will continue to address campus sexual assault  —   with or without federal enforcement. “Every president I talk to says this is something that needs to be fully dealt with,” he said. “The public visibility of this issue has transferred the responsibility, the ownership, to campuses themselves. ” ENDOWMENTS Mr. Trump has said that universities should spend more of their endowments on students rather than investing the money. He suggested that some colleges pay more to financial advisers to manage their endowments than they spend on tuition assistance. University endowments currently hold more than $500 billion. In recent years, various lawmakers have proposed cutting tax breaks to universities unless they spend more of their endowments. But most of the colleges with large endowments  —   like Harvard, Yale and Stanford  —   already give needy students generous aid. There are 92 universities with endowments of $1 billion or more, with half of the wealth controlled by about two dozen schools, so forcing colleges to spend more of their endowments would likely have limited national impact.",0
6886,Assange: Clinton Campaign Tried To Hack WikiLeaks,"  Edmondo Burr in News , World // 0 Comments Julian Assange claims that Hillary Clinton’s campaign used hackers to attack WikiLeaks’ servers. 
WikiLeaks’ editor-in-chief says that despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down its internet to stop accusations of interference in U.S. elections, his organisation will keep on publishing until the elections are over. 
RT.com reports: 
“ Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict, ” Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. 
The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. 
Assange claimed the release “ whipped up a crazed hornet’s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign ” leading them to attack WikiLeaks. 
“ They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile, ” he added. 
Ecuador’s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a “ strategic position ” so that its “ policy of non-intervention can’t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador. ” 
He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month.

— RT (@RT_com) 17 October 2016 
Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with Ecuador’s decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. 
He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, “ this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process – for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. ” 
He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being “ controlled by Clinton supporters. “ We were fastest on #Podestaemails6 , faster than @wikileaks , and the US conspiracy machine can’t handle it https://t.co/njAae50qDd 
— RT (@RT_com) 13 October 2016 
The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. “ I don’t think there’s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton, ” he said. 
Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing “ what in their mind is white trash. ”",0
6887,Sanctuary City Migrants Protest Trump Nationwide,"  immigrant groups across the country protested in major sanctuary city hubs to decry   Donald Trump’s upcoming Inauguration Ceremony. The sanctuary cities carry out policies to shield illegal immigrants from federal immigration law enforcement officials. [Protesters holding signs reading “Immigrant Rights = Workers Rights = Human Rights” and “No Muslim Registry,” marched in cities such as Los Angeles, California, Chicago, Illinois and San Jose, as the Associated Press reported, all of which have existing sanctuary city policies in place.  Senator Chris Van Hollen ( ) told a crowd at an   protest in Washington D. C. “We are not going to allow Donald Trump to bury the Statue of Liberty. ” “We are a nation for all people, regardless of religion, regardless of background, regardless of who you love,” the junior Maryland senator continued. Illegal immigrants also spoke at rallies, and to the Associated Press, about being proud of their illegal status in the country. “I stand here because I have nothing to apologize for,” 19   Max Kim, an illegal immigrant, told the Associated Press. “I am not ashamed of my status because it is a constant reminder to myself that I have something to fight for. ” Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago Chairman Dr. Bassam Osman told more than 1, 000 protesters in the “Windy City,” “Lord, this land is your land, it is not Trump’s land. ” Rehab Alkadi, a 31   Syrian refugee, told the Associated Press that Trump has “said a lot of things bad about the Muslim people. ” The protests come just days before Trump is set to take the oath of office. During his campaign and transition period, Trump has promised to fix the country’s broken immigration system, starting with a border wall along the   Southern border. Trump has also said he will halt all immigration from countries in the world which have been compromised by Islamic terrorism and extremism. The cities where the majority of the   immigrant rallies took place are already considered to be sanctuary cities.   Trump has threatened to not only defund sanctuary cities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) could also seek legal action against these cities for failing to comply with federal immigration law. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

6888,Selling ‘Regime Change’ Wars to the Masses,"Selling ‘Regime Change’ Wars to the Masses October 28, 2016 
Propaganda is now such a pervasive part of Western governance that any foreign leader who resists the prevailing power structure can be turned into a demon and made a target of a “regime change” war, explains John Pilger. 
By John Pilger 
American journalist Edward Bernays is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psychoanalysis, it was Bernays who coined the term “public relations” as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. 
In 1929, as a publicist for the cigarette industry, Bernays persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade – behavior then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” Edward Bernays, a pioneer in the modern use of propaganda. 
Bernays’s influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was “engineering the consent” of people in order to “control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it.” 
He described this as “the true ruling power in our society” and called it an “invisible government.” 
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and filmmaker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. 
Tale of Two Cities 
Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front-page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. Samantha Power, Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, addresses the Security Council meeting on Syria, Sept. 25, 2016 (UN Photo) 
In the second city – in another country nearby – almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. 
The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by “us” – by the United States and Britain. They even have a media center that is funded by Britain and America. 
Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the “bad guys,” condemned for assaulting and bombing the city – which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. 
Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain, and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. 
Behind the Fanatics 
What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. U.S.-backed Syrian “moderate” rebels smile as they prepare to behead a 12-year-old boy (left), whose severed head is held aloft triumphantly in a later part of the video. [Screenshot from the YouTube video] Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al Qaeda and the Nusra Front and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today.
Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that British Prime Minister Tony Blair was “vindicated” for what turned out to be the crime of the century, the invasion of Iraq. The U.S. television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to effuse over then-Secretary of State Colin Powell’s fabrications. 
The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, “What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?” 
He replied that if journalists had done their job, “there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq.” 
It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question — Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer, and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. 
In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. 
There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on July 7, 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. 
When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria – and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande’s bombast about France being “at war” and “showing no mercy.” That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. 
“When the truth is replaced by silence,” said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, “the silence is a lie.” 
Punishing Independence 
The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. Ousted Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi shortly before he was murdered on Oct. 20, 2011. 
The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an “agreement” that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. 
As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics – the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. 
Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: “We would feed journalists factoids of sanitized intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.” 
The West’s medieval client, Saudi Arabia – to which the U.S. and Britain sell billions of dollars’ worth of arms – is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. 
Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs – “our” bombs – that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news. 
Refined Messengers 
Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education – Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia – and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . New York Times building in New York City. (Photo from Wikipedia) 
These organizations are known as the “liberal media.” They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. And they love war. While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. 
In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. 
In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call “regime change” in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi’s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. 
So Gaddafi was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, “We came, we saw, he died!” 
The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : “Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.” 
Intervention – what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. 
According to its own records, NATO launched 9,700 “strike sorties” against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, “most [of them] under the age of ten.” 
As a direct consequence, Sirte became a capital of ISIS. 
Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and 
dangerous Cold War. All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and NATO. 
Inversion of Reality 
This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington’s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear-and-scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first Cold War. Once again, the Russkies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, flanked by Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria “Toria” Nuland, addresses Russian President Vladimir Putin in a meeting room at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on July 14, 2016. [State Department Photo] The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine – except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count.
Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. 
There is almost the joie d’esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
A Freak Show 
To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behavior and opinions. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking to the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on   credit: AIPAC) 
To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America’s design for the Twenty-first Century. This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. 
To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. 
In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, “I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over.” That was not news. 
Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. 
The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world – unlike Hillary Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. 
The Clinton Danger 
Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to “totally obliterate” Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressing the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on   credit: AIPAC) 
She has now pledged to support a “no-fly zone” in Syria – a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime – a distinction for which the competition is fierce. 
Without a shred of public evidence, Clinton has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. 
That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. 
Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way – in the Caucasus and Eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. 
Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on Nov. 8. If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton’s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defense drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays’s “torches of freedom.” 
Scott McClellan, who had been George W. Bush’s press spokesman, once called the media “complicit enablers.” Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. 
In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: “Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.”",0
6889,"At ‘Doomocracy,’ It’s Fright Night in Brooklyn - The New York Times","Halloween started early this year. I’d put the date at July 18, opening night of the 2016 Republican National Convention.    has been nonstop since. The tricks have included a couple of Creature Feature debates, email scandals, xenophobic rants and personal attacks, all of which have too often been received as sordid but tantalizing treats by audience and news media alike. Action in the electoral arena makes any art pale by comparison. But this hasn’t prevented Pedro Reyes, an   from Mexico City, from creating his own bit of   political high jinks in “Doomocracy,” an elaborately trenchant performance piece presented by the nonprofit Creative Time in the Brooklyn Army Terminal. The setting, on the Sunset Park waterfront, is ideally spooky. If you imagine the concept of a   complex translated into power architecture, that’s the terminal. Built in 1919, a military supply depot through two World Wars, it’s monstrous: a     complex with two   concrete warehouses and enough space to park 20 ships and a train. Although much of it is now given over to light industry and boutique businesses (furniture designers, chocolatiers) the place still projects a mausoleumlike chill, especially at night. And, appropriately, night is when “Doomocracy” happens, on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, from 6 p. m. to midnight. Visitors first gather in a soaring   hall dominated by one of Mr. Reyes’s wood sculptures. A surreal fusion of the Statue of Liberty and the Apocalyptic Beast, it hints of disorientations to come. From that starting point, small groups are admitted, one at a time, to the main event under close supervision on what feels like a cross between a guided tour and forced march. (Tickets are free but must be reserved in advance.) A group is loaded into a van and driven to a distant location on the terminal campus. As the group nears its destination, a disruption occurs. The van is flagged down by figures who are not, as it first seems, parking attendants, but military police in SWAT gear. They yank the van doors open, flash lights in your eyes, order you out and herd you into a   building, barking commands: put your hands on the wall behind your head line up move. You know this is theater, but you also discover that being yelled at and   makes your pulse jump disarms your defenses persuades you to do what you’re told. The rest of the show, which is basically a   mobile drama in a dozen or more short acts, alternates staged reality with zany satire, though, as usual, Mr. Reyes tends to resist making clear distinctions between modes. For earlier projects, he gathered automatic weapons that were turned in or seized by the Mexican Army from drug cartels and melted them down to make garden shovels and musical instruments. He has also organized exhibitions that have fused performance art, sculpture and psychotherapy. Ambiguity of tone and purpose is one of the elements that makes “Doomocracy” dramatically effective. Another is the   pacing established by the performance’s director, Meghan Finn. One scene bangs into another. The SWAT team hustles you down a corridor, then disappears. Now you’re in a polling station, being registered to vote while watching ballots being shredded before your eyes. Next, you take a breather in a comfy suburban living room, only to hear a pair of   housewives warn about unwelcome “new additions” to the neighborhood. The   duo have barely warmed to their subject when you’re moved on again, into a doctor’s waiting room, where an   soccer mom hits you up for a fix. And you go on: to a corporate boardroom to vote on advantageous deals for the privileged (meaning yourself) to an elementary school classroom that teaches false history (slavery wasn’t all that bad) and supplies you with   bulletproof shields to an   witch hunt (this is the show’s big    number) to a factory that markets artisanal Himalayan air to an environmentally ravaged world. (“Only God breathes air this pure. ”) And in one amusing moment along the way, you emerge from an elevator into a cocktail party in a collector’s penthouse. The scene, like the art world itself, is a pure cliché:   waiters, an   hostess, a Christopher Wool   on the wall, and an antsy, importunate artist in residence pitching his latest product. (“It’s about gentrification! ”) There’s more, quite a bit, concluding with an ostensibly nonpartisan,   take on the current election battle as a political World Cup match with Earth as the ball in play. Then suddenly you’re on your way out of the show, passing a grumbly street prophet wearing a sandwich board and handing out “Doomocracy” fliers. Given the performance’s speed and the pileup of sensory input, it’s impossible to take everything in. Enough to say that, while all parts of the piece are not equally strong  —   satire has to be right on the nose,   to work, and some of this is too easy  —   the level of visual invention is high, and the cast of more than 30 actors (among them, a Chihuahua named Dreidel) is impressive. Paul Hufker’s script, with contributions by Nato Thompson, Creative Time’s artistic director, sounded, on a   hearing, sharp,    and   in its talking points, some of which Mr. Reyes cites in the definition of “doomocracy” he has printed in the flier: 1. A form of government in which the supreme power is vested in a tyrant by a terrified general electorate. 2. The esoteric arithmetic that makes the electoral process malleable. 3. A corporate coup d’état in slow motion. 4. Permanent global war waged in the name of freedom. At present, we’re experiencing all of that, not to mention planetary destruction and international homelessness. And if the standard for judging the success of “Doomocracy” is whether it’s weighty enough for its subjects, it fails. Most political art does. In a global media age of perpetually cycling digital drama, it feels dwarfed and static. And the audience that really needs to see it won’t. Mr. Reyes knows this, and he knows you have to make the art anyway, and he makes it well, shrewdly and with upbeat panache. When you emerge from “Doomocracy” you’ve felt the visceral thrill, the thrill that good theater delivers, the sense of having been through something energizing and focusing. You may also feel a reassuring sense that, no, it’s not just you American reality, in 2016, is every bit as out of control as you think it is. Hold onto that reassurance. You’re going to need it. The show wraps up on Nov. 6, two days short of the presidential election. And that event, no matter what the results, will not bring Fright Night to an end.",0
6890,Russia Tests Nuclear-Capable Ballistic Missile – But Have You Heard That Trump Grabs Pussies?,"Russia Tests Nuclear-Capable Ballistic Missile – But Have You Heard That Trump Grabs Pussies? 
Andrew Anglin October 27, 2016 
Basically, we’ve got a Road Runner vs Wile E. Coyote situation going on here. 
The West just keeps coming-up with these elaborate, stupid schemes and Russia plows right past them. 
I am really not sure that the West understands exactly what they’ve gotten themselves into here. 
RT : 
Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems. 
The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russiaâs Far East. 
âThe test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field,â the Defense Ministry reported. 
Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test Russiaâs hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, âobject 4202â, or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. 
A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. 
A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. 
We are at a point in history where the American people are forced to make a decision. 
Which is worse: 
A) Joking about sex with another man in a private conversation on a bus, or 
B) Nuclear war 
If only the media were putting things in these terms.

6892,China Working to Create Country’s Own Wikipedia Alternative - Breitbart,"The Chinese government is recruiting up to 20, 000 people to aid in the development of a Chinese Wikipedia alternative. [VICE News reports that the aptly named “Chinese Encyclopedia” will launch online in 2018 with the help of thousands of scholars from research institutes and universities who have been employed by the government to contribute articles relating to over 100 topics to the new website. The expected finished product will feature as many as 300, 000 article entries.  Yang Muzhi, the    of the project and the chairman of the Book and Periodicals Distribution Association of China, said in an interview, “The Chinese Encyclopaedia is not a book, but a Great Wall of culture. ” He added that China was under pressure from the international community to develop an encyclopedia that will “guide and lead the public and society. ” The development of the Chinese Encyclopedia may in part be due to the blocking of Wikipedia by the Chinese government.

6893,Woman Uses Milk And Gelatin To Remove Blackheads,"posted by Eddie I’m the kind of person who notices every little thing on my face. Now, I may not act on everything little thing that “pops” up, so-to-speak, but I definitely notice! A stray eyebrow hair? Yeah, I see you there. A little pimple: how could I miss it? But none of these things compare to the feeling of finding a little patch of nasty blackheads popping up. I get them around my chin and nose. And, honestly, I really don’t know how to effectively deal with them at home. So, I end up popping them. Anyone who has ever done this knows that nine times out of ten, popped blackhead will turn into something way worse! I got sick of the whole process. Get rid of a blackhead to get a pimple instead? No thanks. So that’s why I got really excited to see a natural remedy I could try at home. If you’re anything like me, you’ll definitely want to check this out, too. When you try it, make sure to snap a pic and upload it in the comments so everyone can see how awesome this blackhead mask is in action! Here is how you transform your face for the better–naturally! 1. Get the ingredients: milk and gelatin. 
Since you’ll be putting these things directly on your face, I highly recommend choosing high-quality options here. Also, make sure the gelatin is unflavored. 2. Measure, then mix. 
Put the gelatin (1 Tablespoon) in a container first, then add the milk (1-2 Tablespoons). Mix. 3. Rinse your face while microwaving the mix for 15 seconds. 
The heat makes this mix so soft. You’ll want to put it on straight away to ensure the desired smoothness. 4. Apply the warm mixture to your face. 
You can spread this mix all over or do some spot treatments — your choice. Just remember to use it quickly! 5. Let it soak in! 
Grab your smartphone; you’ve got about 15 minutes to spare here. Better yet, take note and make some funny faces in the mirror. 6. Start peeling away those nasties! 
Once it’s dry, grab a corner and start slowing peeling. Get ready to be amazed! 7. Pull! Make sure to get them all! 
This is the most satisfying part — seeing all those disgusting blackheads meet their fate.

6894,Anti-Heroin Video From a Florida Sheriff Appalls Critics but Impresses Constituents - The New York Times,"Maybe it was the ski masks that did it. Or it could have been the steely look in the eyes of Lake County, Fla. Sheriff Peyton Grinnell as he deadpanned: “We are coming for you. Run. ” Perhaps it was the muted background music: an eerie melody that wouldn’t have been out of place in a Batman movie. In the end, what could have been an unremarkable public service announcement about opioid abuse in Lake County spread widely on the internet, garnering about a million views on the Facebook page of the sheriff’s office, where it was first posted Friday. It sparked concerns about police militarization and drew more than a few comparisons to Islamic State recruitment videos. But many residents of Lake County seemed to respond positively, thanking the sheriff for drawing attention to a deadly scourge that has altered communities beyond recognition. In the   clip, Sheriff Grinnell, who was elected in November, stood at a podium flanked by four deputies wearing black face coverings. The sheriff addressed his Lake County constituents, saying he was aware of the “serious issue” of heroin abuse in the area. He encouraged people to call the office with tips. He added: “To the dealers that are pushing this poison, I have a message for you. ” And the camera began to zoom in. The sheriff warned drug dealers that the police were waiting for some arrest warrants to be finalized. “Enjoy trying to sleep tonight, wondering if tonight’s the night our SWAT team blows your front door off the hinges,” he said. “We are coming for you. If our agents can show the nexus between you, the pusher of poison, and the person that overdoses and dies, we will charge you with murder. We are coming for you. Run. ” At the end of the video, Sheriff Grinnell and the four others walked offscreen in a silent, single file. “It makes the Lake County Sheriff’s Department look like they’re about to go to battle in Falluja,” said Ezekiel Edwards, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Criminal Law Reform Project. SWAT teams, he added, should be used only when there is an imminent threat to human life. “That video suggested that they are using SWAT inappropriately, and in a way that is going to escalate violence and danger to all involved. ” But Lt. John Herrell, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said responses from residents had been positive. “I would say that the critics are off the mark and have missed the whole point of the message,” he said. “The sheriff wanted to let the community know that he’s aware of this problem. ” Lt. Herrell added that the video’s tough tone was aimed at dealers, not addicts. And as for the men in black masks, he explained: “They are undercover deputies, and state statutes require that their identities be protected. ” Kim Mousette, 52, said it was time for the police to take a tougher approach to heroin abuse in the county. She said her neighborhood in Pine Lakes, once a quiet refuge, had lately become a haven for drug users where people no longer felt safe leaving their doors unlocked. “We were in one of the most pristine, protected areas of Florida, and now this is going on,” she said in a phone interview. “You could be walking along and have a syringe go through your foot. ” Ms. Mousette, who said the police had largely been unresponsive to complaints, voted for Sheriff Grinnell last year. Now, she feels she made the right choice. “I was very happy to see that video,” she said. Heroin abuse surged in Lake County after Florida’s state legislature cracked down on loosely regulated pain clinics  —   known as “pill mills”  —   in 2011, said Lt. Herrell. As a result, people lost easy access to prescription drugs like OxyContin and turned to heroin. The opioid scourge is national in scope the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that nearly 13, 000 people died of heroin overdoses across the country in 2015, up 20. 6 percent from 2014. Audrianna Nicole Boone, 27, watched family members suffer from addiction in her hometown, Lady Lake. She moved to North Carolina in 2012, and has long felt that the Lake County police never did enough to fight opioid abuse. “When I see this video, it’s kind of like the sheriff’s office declaring war on the drug addiction and the criminals,” she said. “I love it, and I hope it continues to go viral. ” Still, she added, the video was only a starting point. “Instead of arresting these people for the drug use, how about enacting some type of system that helps these people get clean and reintroduces these people to society?” she said. As the clip began to find audiences across the country, it encountered sharper criticism. Some compared it to Islamic State recruitment videos, which often feature militants wearing black ski masks. Others poked fun at the melodramatic production. Still others said it was a clear case of an   of police forces across the United States. Mr. Edwards of the A. C. L. U. acknowledged that opioid addiction was a serious issue in need of redress  —   but not like this. “Even though it’s just one local video, it does, in a very short amount of time, encapsulate much of what is wrong with policing today: militarization, using force inappropriately, and continuing to fight a drug war that has proved to be a failure,” he said. Some in Lake County agreed. “It’s a good example of how overly militarized police in the U. S. are,” said Robert Vibert, 35, who lives in the town of Tavares, where the county sheriff’s office is. He said he found the video overly dramatic, as if Sheriff Grinnell were trying to make a name for himself. “I’m sure he means well, but his approach is lackluster and a waste if he doesn’t tackle the totality of the problem,” Mr. Vibert said. “Without attacking supply lines, and helping addicts and users get clean, it won’t ever really solve the problem. ”",0
6895,‘The Daily’: Making Sense of the Gorsuch Pick - The New York Times,"On the eve of our debut episode of “The Daily,” President Trump delivered a major news story. For his first Supreme Court nomination, he selected Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling résumé. I spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful New York Times colleagues about what it means. Maggie Haberman, a White House reporter, explains Mr. Trump’s reverence for the Supreme Court. Carl Hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. And Adam Liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the country’s new Supreme Court nominee. To understand more about Judge Gorsuch, I also talk to David Green, the chief executive of Hobby Lobby, a company at the center of one of Judge Gorsuch’s most important cases. He ruled that corporations with religious owners  —   like Hobby Lobby  —   cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. “We voted for Trump, not that we agree with everything he does,” Mr. Green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. “The most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the Constitution,” he said, referring to the Supreme Court. “Because if you rule on the Constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties. ” Tune in, and tell us what you think.

6896,Yet Another School Bombing In Syria: 22 Children And 6 Teachers Killed,"“Syria’s children, like children anywhere else in the world, deserve the chance to learn and play without running the risk of being killed in their classrooms.” A damaged classroom at a school after it was hit in an air strike in the village of Hass, in the south of Syria’s rebel-held Idlib province on October 26, 2016. (Photo: Omar haj kadour/AFP)
Twenty-two children and six teachers were killed after a school in Idlib, Syria was bombed on Wednesday, which aid groups are saying may be the deadliest attack on a school since the conflict began.
“This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate, it is a war crime,” said Anthony Lake, executive director of the United Nations children’s agency UNICEF, of the attack on the school compound.
“This latest atrocity may be the deadliest attack on a school since the war began more than five years ago,” he continued. “Children lost forever to their families…teachers lost forever to their students…one more scar on Syria’s future.”
According to BBC :
The attack on Haas, about 75km (46 miles) south-west of Aleppo, appears to have been intense and flattened a number of buildings, reports the BBC’s James Longman in Beirut.
Children were reportedly gathered around an entrance when it was hit, at about 11:30 local time (08:30 GMT). They had been allowed to leave classes early because of the raids elsewhere in the village.
Activists shared photographs of dead bodies—many of them children—on the floor of a makeshift treatment center.
Many are saying that Wednesday’s bombing is evidence of the increasing human suffering caused by the intractable war within Syria .",0
6897,Comment on The Myth Of Male Privilege by An Infographic Showing What Male Privilege Really Looks Like,"  The Myth Of Male Privilege The Myth Of Male Privilege November 25, 2012 20 Comments Culture 
What happens when a woman doesn’t want a baby? She aborts it. She can go to the doctor for a minor procedure that inconveniences her for a day. The man who impregnated her has no legal right to prevent her from doing so. 
What happens when a man doesn’t want a baby? Assuming the woman wants to keep it, he is ordered by a court to provide payments. If he chooses not to, money will be automatically garnished from his salary. If garnishment is not an option, he is sent to prison . 
A woman can kill life and she is empowered while receiving no interference from the state. A man can choose to merely ignore life and he can be imprisoned, his life ruined. And we live in a society of male privilege? Nov 25, 2012 Roosh Valizadeh",0
6898,"Sessions Comes Out Swinging, Dismisses Russian Meeting Controversy - Breitbart","Attorney General Jeff Sessions hit back against any implication of improper meetings with Russian officials in a prepared opening to his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Tuesday. [“Let me state this clearly colleagues. I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russian or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States,” Sessions told the committee. “Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign. ”  He then became more indignant, saying: The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie. The attorney general has been dogged by implications of dishonesty and impropriety regarding his supposed contacts with the Russians since it became clear he neglected to mention meeting Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at the Republican National Convention during his confirmation hearings. Some Democrats have even called for Sessions to resign over the matter. Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Mark Warner ( ) opened the hearing imputing a possible additional meeting between Sessions and Kisylak at the Mayflower Hotel in April 2016. Sessions countered this suggestion. His prepared remarks insisted: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.  I did not attend any meetings at that event.  Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump.  Though I do recall several conversations I had during that   reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials.  If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it.  After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel. As for the confirmed meeting between the pair at the RNC, which became the basis of his alleged “lie” at his confirmation hearing, Sessions was equally unconvinced. “There is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Franken’s question honestly at my confirmation hearing.  Colleagues, that is false,” Sessions said to his   fellow senators, smiling as he corrected himself. “I can’t say colleagues anymore   …     former colleagues. ” “This is what happened,” Sessions continued: Senator Franken asked me a rambling question after some six hours of testimony that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community, the U. S. intelligence community, had advised   Trump that “there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump’s surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government. ” I was taken aback by that explosive allegation, which he said was being reported as breaking news that very day and which I had not heard. I wanted to refute  —   immediately  —   any suggestion that I was part of such activity. I replied, quote, “Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities.  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have  —   did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it,” end quote. That was the context in which I was asked the question and in that context it was a fair and accurate response to the charge as I understood it. Session explicitly acknowledged the meetings between him an Kislyak, one at his Senate office and the other after a speech Sessions delivered at the RNC last July, but told the committee, “Not one thing happened that was improper in any one of these meetings. ” But Sessions also took issue with the entire idea his seeing the Russian ambassador had anything to do with the investigation into Russian election interference that ostensibly is the subject of Tuesday’s hearing. “Whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns,” he said.

6900,3 Philadelphia prison guards arrested for alleged assault on handcuffed inmate,"3 Philadelphia prison guards arrested for alleged assault on handcuffed inmate 3 Philadelphia prison guards arrested for alleged assault on handcuffed inmate By 0 48 
Three Philadelphia prison guards are facing charges including aggravated assault after allegedly beating up a handcuffed inmate and submitting a fraudulent report. They say the inmate harmed himself, but their actions were caught on video. 
Milton Gibbs, 52, Terrance Bailey, 30, and Shaun Lowe, 26, are facing charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, and tampering with public records. There are also additional charges of misdemeanor, recklessly endangering another person, unsworn falsification to authorities, and obstructing the administration of law and official oppression. They turned themselves in for arrest on Wednesday. 
“We cannot stand for any kind of assault, and this attack on a handcuffed inmate by sworn corrections officers is egregious. Every inmate who is held in our prisons deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,” Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said in statement following arrests of the three guards. 
According to the investigation, the assault at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center dates back to June, when Gibbs allegedly threatened inmate Brandon Kulb, 22, stating that he would “hang him and murder him.” 
It is alleged that Gibbs called Bailey, and the two then entered Kulb’s cell and began beating, kicking, and spitting on him. 
District Attorney Williams says they eventually put Kulb in handcuffs and walked him down a staircase, while continuing to beat him. 
“Once they arrived at the cell block’s exit, Bailey struck the victim in the back of the head knocking him to the ground. Gibbs and Bailey then dragged the victim into the central control area and began to stomp on him. Lowe arrived on scene and joined in the assault,” the DA’s office said in a press release, adding that Kulb “lost consciousness” at least twice during that time. 
The guards tried to make sure that the assault would not get captured on surveillance cameras, but “much” of it was still caught on CCTV, offering the investigation irrefutable evidence. Despite that, guards tried to cover up the assault. 
After the purported beating of Kulb, Gibbs and Bailey submitted a mental health referral saying the inmate had intentionally harmed himself. Lowe allegedly transported the victim to the receiving room, and Gibbs tried to coerce the victim not to report the incident in exchange for food from the staff kitchen, the DA said. 
In their reports, the three wrote that they only used “open hand” control, because they had to subdue Kulb. They omitted their own actions. 
This is not the first time Gibbs has been arrested, according to NewsWorks. In 2004, he was reportedly fired for assaulting an inmate but was acquitted in a federal civil rights case filed against him.

6901,Central Bankers Are Out Of Monetary Ammunition And Weapons,"Central Bankers Are Out Of Monetary Ammunition And Weapons by IWB · October 27, 2016 
by GoldCore 
Satyajit Das has written an excellent article in Bloomberg which clearly details the risks facing the global financial and monetary system and how central bankers are out of monetary ammunition and weapons. 

Excerpt: 
“No one likes to admit defeat. But global policymakers, who continue to insist that there’s more they can do to revive growth and inflation, are starting to sound like Monty Python’s Black Knight (click link to see video), the limbless and mortally wounded warrior who threatens to bleed on his victorious opponent. The truth is that governments and central banks have very few weapons left — and have probably lost any chance they once had of averting a prolonged stagnation. 
Secular Stagnation 
Clearly, the real economy hasn’t responded as hoped to zero and now negative interest rates. A whole host of factors continue to depress personal spending — high debt, stagnant incomes, unemployment and under-employment, and economic uncertainty. Even the rich, who have benefited immensely from the runup in asset prices, can’t really spend much more than they already are.” 
Satyajit Das is an Australian former banker and corporate treasurer, turned consultant, author and academic. His latest book is “A Banquet of Consequences” and he is also the author of “Extreme Money” and “Traders, Guns & Money.”

6903,Living in Andy Cohen’s America - The New York Times,"The Season 7 “Real Housewives of New Jersey” reunion show took place in October in a theater in Westbury, N. Y. An elaborate    thing had been constructed on a stage that would soon seat the five Housewives, complete with a   rug and zebra chairs, everything sparkling, everything  . The set was erected so specifically and thoroughly that it included a kitchen in the back, unusable but complete, that you could see only a fraction of, and a fireplace that the cameras would never pick up. “That’s not a real fireplace?” I asked a production assistant, who answered, “It’s not not real. ” The five contracted Housewives arrived on Long Island the night before for this   reckoning of the season’s tensions, equal parts State of the State panel discussion and   of every lunchtime confrontation that occurred at my   high school. The Housewives were shuttled in black S. U. V.s under the cover of darkness to a hotel more than two hours from where they live, in order to “throw off the scent to the press,” a publicist told me, though “scent” is a strange word choice here because anyone with a nose could have    the place from the sheer concentration of applied Shalimar. But there was good reason for the secrecy. Leaks from these reunion shows have been rampant, and after a previous one, Andy Cohen, the   mediator and the franchise creator (or as he says, “the person who gets credit for creating the franchise” when, really, a lot of other people were involved) realized that the leaks might be coming from the hair and makeup teams, who watch the live feed from a holding room. He told the producers to cut the audio to those dressing rooms. Since then, the integrity of his reunion show  —   if, again, “integrity” is the right word to describe the absolute ravaging of women by their former, current and future friends, accusing one another of everything from having had more than their admitted amount of plastic surgery to being an actual F. B. I. snitch  —   has been intact. The only leaks would be coming from Cohen, and they’d come when he decided they would come. Cohen prepared himself in a sunny, makeshift dressing room on the first floor, standing shirtless as he tried to choose a tie for the    —   yes, that’s    —   taping. His voice was a hoarse whisper, stubbornly projected through sheer will from deep behind his sternum. He had just come from disseminating his Andyness throughout the country on a speaking tour with his friend Anderson Cooper, in which both men told stories from their personal lives and drank Fresquilas on stage. There were a few    appearances for his coming book tour for “Superficial: More Adventures From the Andy Cohen Diaries. ” He had been talking for hours on his weekly radio shows (plural) as well as negotiating and announcing his new book imprint, Andy Cohen Books. He had been hosting his nightly live talk show on Bravo, “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. ” And of course, he continued to   the “Real Housewives” franchise, watching cuts of each episode for all seven cities, giving notes, hiring, firing, reconsidering and fielding    text messages from the stars of those shows, sometimes replying purely with emoji. I told him that the Housewives, who were waiting for the taping to begin, seemed nervous. “A lot of them view me as kind of their daddy in some weird, sick way, and their boss, and their friend, and their boyfriend, and their enemy  —   and so there’s a lot of different psychological layers happening in a situation like this,” he replied. “Some of them are volatile women. So it’s all real. It’s all real. ” Below the street, in their dressing rooms, the Housewives breathed through the tension. They had lived their reality on camera and watched the results. They had heard their Housewife colleagues talk about their behavior in   interviews. And they had built within themselves a caldron of anger, resentment and oh, yeah? s to what they had seen. So as not to dilute their fury, so as not to lose one moment of heat for the cameras, the publicists brought them to me separately through secured hallways, like Hannibal Lecter on his gurney. Teresa Giudice, who wore a satin evening gown and body shimmer (it was 8 a. m.) told me she used to be nervous about confronting certain cast members at these reunions, but now, since serving a prison term for fraud in 2015, which she continually refers to as “the time I went away,” she’s fine she’s ready for her day in court or whatever this is for her. She used to resent Cohen, because she thought he was hardest on her, but now she takes a more nuanced view. “I think he’s an amazing guy,” she said. “If he was straight, I definitely would date him. ” Jacqueline Laurita, who was Teresa’s best friend but has now replaced Melissa Gorga as Teresa’s sworn enemy for life, admitted that she was expecting a blood bath. “Yeah, it feels like you’re walking to the electric chair” is how she put it. She knew she would be held accountable for crimes that included calling Teresa a “criminal” and accusing Teresa’s allies of being her “soldiers. ” Jacqueline knew she just had to endure it. She has stopped trying to game Cohen at these things. “He greets you with a smile, and he has a way about him, and he makes you feel comfortable talking about things, and he can pull the best and the worst out of you with a smile on his face. ” She agreed that the best way to think of Cohen is the way you think of Jesus. You pray to him for blessings  —   to get more airtime, to get a rival off the show  —   but like Jesus himself, he answers prayers only sometimes. In his sunny dressing room up above, I asked Cohen how he’d feel if, like the Housewives, he were about to be confronted by everyone he’d interacted with this year. “I’m not on a reality show about my life” was his answer. It annoys him, this implication that what he’s doing is somehow cruel to the women who have signed up for it. But don’t you feel bad for them? I wanted to know. He shook his head, the way he would every time I didn’t get it. These women, who were once housewives, real housewives, are now businesswomen. Teresa Giudice is a   New York Times   author. Melissa Gorga has a successful clothing store. Jacqueline Laurita now has a platform to talk about her son’s autism and for her husband to sell a   brand called the Little Kernel. “I’m in a business relationship with these women,” he said. “They know what they’re doing. ” He put on his shirt and picked the striped tie. Walking out, he was intercepted by Kathleen French, a senior vice president at Bravo, who said that things had become a little too crazy the night before at the end of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” trip to Ireland. “Don’t tell me any more,” he said. “Let me just see it. ” He took his place in the fake living room and sat down. “Very casual,” he said as the women   out in their restrictive formal wear,   a deep mustard and hair spritzed to within an inch of   laws. “This is their Super Bowl,” he told me when I asked why they were in   tie before 8 a. m. Over the next few hours, as they said things like “Oh, really, bitch?” and “I was friends with Teresa when she was chasing a prostitution whore out of a country club” and “Do I look like an ape?” and “I’m turning you off” and “You’re a dumb bitch,” Cohen’s placid cool sometimes gave way to frustration. “Stay on your couches!” he beseeched them. “Don’t push Daddy!” He put a finger gun to his head as Teresa accused Jacqueline of selling a story to a tabloid. He won’t like that I began this article with the “Housewives. ” Cohen has hosted a nightly talk show now for more than seven years that features scintillating conversation with celebrities and (O. K. yes) clips of Bravo shows, but his guests are legitimate stars, like Meryl Streep and Oprah Winfrey and (O. K. yes) Real Housewives. “Watch What Happens Live” is doing well, with nearly 800, 000 viewers a night. The set just expanded to accommodate twice its   audience. But you can’t talk about Cohen without talking about the     empire that he helped create in 2006  —   a juggernaut of unscripted television, with all but one of the locales (it’s Dallas) averaging two or three million viewers per   episode. “Real Housewives” is watched sincerely, it is watched as camp. It is   it is   it is   it is pored over by at least one very funny podcast (“Bitch Sesh”) it is debated by feminists, it is singled out for a particular kind of cultural degradation that has seeped into our national conversation and it is fairly said to have been a factor in our recent elevation of a   host to the highest office of this country, a man who apparently spent Thanksgiving asking his guests,   style, whom he should pick for secretary of state. Cohen was at a Jewish Federation speaking gig in Washington recently when a man raised his hand and asked if he felt responsible for the level of discourse that the American republic had descended to in the last few months. It was two weeks before the election, and the question was fair. Over the 10 million episodes of “Real Housewives” I watched this fall, I heard people say to one another, “I just wanna friggin rip his balls off” and “Put away your penis . .. and maybe someone would treat you like a woman. ” I saw a woman flip a table when she was angry, a woman who threw her fake leg when she was angry (more on this later). I saw women demand respect, respect, respect, saying, “You don’t respect me” and “That is not respect” and “That’s disrespectful,” respect in the way that people who conduct themselves respectfully and respectably seldom feel the need to demand out loud. Over in the presidential debates, meanwhile, Hillary Clinton was called a “nasty woman,” and Donald Trump’s Twitter feed seemed as if it had been ghostwritten by Kelly Dodd, the Real Housewife of Orange County responsible for such Twitter pronouncements as: “Got my phone hacked with the fraud Dept. Going to get a private investigator and I’m going to sue  press charges!! Good luck Thunderdome. ” But Cohen told that man in Washington this: “First of all, the ‘Housewives’ are entertainment. Second of all, in the ‘Housewives universe,’ you get punished for behaving badly. There are consequences to it. ” The consequences to Donald Trump’s behavior, by contrast, seemed to be more people loving him. Had he seen the polls? I asked. He had made a similar speech to me, and I was skeptical. Trump’s not going to win, I told him. Cohen pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows and tilted his head back and forth in consideration. “You never know. ” I didn’t listen to him. No one did, not even when he conducted two televised and dubiously scientific polls of the people who tuned into “Watch What Happens Live” and turned up numbers based on about 60, 000 votes that said, actually, yes, Trump was going to win. He’s used to that. “There’s a lot of times when I will say something about politics, and people will immediately discount me, and I think it’s the easiest way to discount my show too. It’s just like, Oh, that’s the ‘Housewives’ guy, who cares?” Cohen explained a few weeks after the reunion. We were at Cafe Cluny in the West Village for lunch in the 3 p. m. hour, which is the approximate time lunch happens for someone who goes to bed at about 2 a. m. each night, often following a   massage. He ordered a salad and then stared down the three pieces of dark chocolate that came with the check. “I think I’m   about it, but on the other hand, if that’s what I am, I’m also good with it because it’s a wonderful thing to be. ” His voice didn’t get less hoarse over the months I spent with him. “You know what I mean?” He opened his mouth to say something else, only to remember that control in an interview resides with the person who can stop talking. “Look, I was a thinking person before the Housewives ever came. ” He took a piece of the chocolate. “I’ve been a TV producer for a long time  —   not that that’s Mensa, but I’ve had a career, and I made my own way. So I just think, If I ever say something that someone doesn’t want to hear, it’s a very easy thing to then say, Oh, well, coming from the ‘Housewives’ guy, oh, really, Mr. ‘Real Housewives’?” He is lately, at 48, consumed with trying to gauge exactly where he stands in the national esteem. When I first met him, in his downtown office, a few minutes before he went on the air, he asked me why I wanted to do an article on him. “I’m just not that introspective,” he said. I took this to mean he possessed the natural discomfort that a producer might have with someone else telling his story. But soon I realized it was more about positioning: Do we think of him as the “Housewives” guy  —   or as a former Bravo head of development who has a thriving production company? Or a guy with his own channel on Sirius XM Radio that features shows with Sandra Bernhard and Dan Rather? Or the author of three   books, or the host of a nightly talk show, the first one in late night with a working bar, no matter what James Corden says? He is no longer what he started out as on the talk show, the kind of person who could ask the question we wanted answered (like: Jacqueline, why would you sit on that woman’s lap after she threatened to “rage on your ass”? ). Now he’s one of the famous people. And so he is these days often trying to figure out a metric by which he can ascertain where he falls in the fame food chain. In “Superficial,” there’s a diary entry in which he talks about getting a   invitation from his good friend Sarah Jessica Parker to be her date for the Met Gala  —   so that’s data. But he goes to Ralph Lauren to get a tux for the event and the one he likes is being held for Bobby Cannavale, and he spends a little time trying to process that he doesn’t have more pull than Bobby Cannavale. Another tux he likes is being held for Johnny Depp, which is O. K. with him, because of course Johnny Depp. “It didn’t piss me off,” he insisted when I asked about the incident and his calculations surrounding it. “No. I was like, oh, O. K. oh, good, here’s a ranking, and now I know where I stand. They’re telling me where I stand. I’m finding out how this works. ” He paused for a second. “I’m just psyched that I’m getting a tux. ” O. K. maybe it did sting a little when Vanity Fair had an article devoted to the hosts of late night, and Cohen seemed to be the only one excluded from it. Trevor Noah hadn’t even made his debut yet! But again, this is just data. “Everything’s good,” he insisted. “I have my health. I have my show. I have my life. You know what I mean?” But also, “I think my show is a late show, you know?” Don’t read any of this as defeated or bitter. If there’s one thing about Cohen, it’s that his respect for the democratic rhythms of popular culture and popularity in general is total. He wants to watch the rise and fall of things, even himself, without trying to manipulate the process. He wants it all to play out. The people will decide, and watching what the people decide and how they decide is far more important than the decision itself. From a young age, there was something about Andy Cohen that his mother couldn’t quite put her finger on. They would watch “All My Children” together during the    era ( ) which she wondered if maybe other sons weren’t doing with their mothers. He had a Diana Ross poster on his wall. What was it, though? What was it? Then one day, she was watching him “prance” (her word) across the stage in his high school’s performance of “Carousel,” and a notion crept in and took hold. She got home that night and looked under his bed, where she found a healthy stash of gay porn. Now she was sure something was going on, but what? She spoke with a psychologist she knew who understood gay issues because he had a gay relative, and that psychologist told her that maybe she should stop looking under his bed. Andy was about to leave for college, for Boston University, and the psychologist said, “B. U. is a good place for him to go for that, he’ll meet a lot of other gay people,” and now his mother really began to suspect something was up. A few years later, Cohen wrote a   letter to a friend that he left on his parents’ kitchen table, and his mother read it and sat him down and asked him if he was sure. And he told her he was. A mother always knows. He knew he wanted to be onscreen even in high school, but he didn’t want to play characters. He wanted to be famous for being himself, but at the time, that idea didn’t truly exist yet outside the news and shows like Oprah and “Donahue. ” “I liked the idea of being myself in front of the camera. So, just me being me. I used to think if I could work on a morning show then I could be me. ” He got a job as an intern at CBS News, then as a producer there, but he started to burn out after 10 years. After a   run at the   Barry Diller cable network Trio, he landed at Bravo, where he helped develop breakout successes like “Top Chef” and “The Millionaire Matchmaker. ” Lauren Zalaznick, at the time president of Bravo, recalls someone coming in with hundreds of hours of documentary tape from a gated community in Orange County, Calif. which the producers needed to work. In that footage, Cohen saw something. “I don’t want to pretend like it was like lightning in a bottle at the beginning,” he said. “I was like: ‘This is a soap opera. This is a soap opera. ’’u2009” It was also something else. “This is real life. ”’ Right before the first season aired in 2006, he had a minor crisis over the opening credits. The “Housewives” shows usually begin with an introduction of each Housewife, posing in Grade A evening wear and announcing her tagline, which is part defensive apologia, part mission statement, part brand definition. But at the beginning, when they were editing the first season of Orange County, they went with sound bites from the show, like “I don’t wanna get old” and “  percent of the women around here have had breast implants” and “Are the police involved?” When Cohen saw the first cut, he ran to the office of Shari Levine, Bravo’s vice president of production, and told her she had to call the production company. The Housewives were going to think the producers were sabotaging them. But Levine told him the Housewives had already seen it  —   and they loved it. Cohen learned that day that people stand behind their behavior, and that trying to protect them from themselves is a fundamental act of disrespect: “These women, but maybe all women. I mean maybe all men, too I think all people want to be heard and understood. ” He learned too that people don’t need you to fight their battles, that they are entitled to them, even if you think they’re ridiculous. He learned that an audience will respond to however eccentric or stubborn or mean or dumb or kind a person is if that person is being authentic. “The things that you think might embarrass them they actually feel like, Well, I was standing up for myself,” he said. I eventually watched the episode of “Real Housewives of Orange County” that Kathleen French had warned Cohen about. It was part of a   arc in which the women go to Ireland so that one of them, Meghan, can track down her ancestors. (This is manifested as her actually tapping people on the shoulder in the street and asking if they are related to her.) Now, “Orange County,” which is the screechiest “Housewives” franchise, had experienced so far a year of immense healing, with the Housewives working on forgiveness. That went right out the window on this trip. Kelly, whom I mentioned earlier, is someone prone to saying things like: “What comes before Part B?  !” She also does the old    “What’s on your shirt?” and when you look down, she flicks you in the nose. Well, it was one such flick, which she administered to Vicki, that plunged the whole trip into darkness. Kelly wanted to know why Heather was so uptight about it, since Jews are supposed to have a good sense of humor. Heather called Kelly racist, and Kelly, of course, said: “I’m not being racist. I’m Mexican. ” Eventually, Tamra got involved, and Kelly said, “No wonder why her daughter isn’t talking to her,” which prompted Tamra to lunge for Kelly and curse and hit her, and they were all kicked out of the department store they were in. Something Cohen knows, a belief that began to take root in him back when he was watching “All My Children” with his mother, was that people who interacted would always create something interesting. That’s why he doesn’t understand why anyone would think that “Real Housewives” wasn’t real in some way. Or that it was too crass. Had people been on a subway recently? Had they read an online comments section? If anyone was under the impression that we were still in a Jane Austen novel in terms of national discourse and manners, it wasn’t Cohen’s fault that they were in for a rude awakening. It’s all real. It wouldn’t be compelling to watch if it weren’t. Teresa Giudice was having a real breakdown when she flipped that table in New Jersey. But in New York, when Aviva Drescher got angry and threw her prosthetic leg at Le Cirque, of all places, in a   effort to make her onscreen presence more interesting, well, that was the last we saw of Aviva. “It is very real to them,” he said. “And by the way, when it’s not, they’re off the show. ” A few months after the women from Orange County returned from Ireland and watched the episodes through holes between their fingers, they pulled themselves together for the reunion. They put on clothing appropriate for Christmas dinner at the White House if it were Cinderella’s   gathered on two separate couches with Andy in the middle, folded their hands in their laps and apologized to one another. A few days after the election, Cohen began book promotion for “Superficial. ” He started with a few local appearances, including one at the 92nd Street Y, where he was interviewed onstage by Sarah Jessica Parker. He had spent election night at her house, actually, and as soon as it became clear who the winner was, Cohen left the room to eat. A few days later, his optimism had mostly returned. Anderson Cooper told me when we met in St. Louis, “I think Oprah said to Andy, ‘You carry the light.’ When I heard that, I was like, That’s really true. ” Onstage at the Y, he had already come around enough to say that he thinks that at heart, Donald Trump is a Democrat. The liberal, largely Jewish crowd, who had been reading about the terrifying increase of hate crimes since the election and had begun to feel as if the world were closing in faster than they’d expected, responded with silence. We met at Cafe Cluny again a week later, and I asked him if he had noticed the silence. He said he didn’t get it. He wanted to know why everyone he knew was so surprised about all of this. I’d been watching the show, hadn’t I? I’d seen Tamra from “Orange County” call Alexis “Jesus Jugs,” hadn’t I? How was that different from calling Hillary Clinton “Crooked Hillary”? I’d watched in the primaries as Trump defended the size of his penis, right? “Wouldn’t that be the province of the Housewives if they were men?” He was right. Trump was not not like one of Cohen’s Housewives. He knew he had to be entertaining to stay on the show. He was willing to say anything to get his contract extended. Throughout his campaign, he pulled out the “I know something, but I’m not going to say it now” trick, most recently employed by Bethenny Frankel about dirt she has but won’t reveal about both Dorinda and Jules at the last “New York” reunion. At the debates, the candidates fought for time to speak and demanded that they be allowed the time they were promised, which is what happens at the reunions. When Cohen saw that, he told me, he thought, Lester Holt, I feel your pain. Anderson Cooper was a moderator of a debate in St. Louis that ended with the candidates saying something nice about each other, which is exactly how Cohen ends some “Real Housewives” reunions. It was one thing when people were copying his format for a talk show and pretending it was theirs, but now life is copying his format, and he’s still not quite getting credit for it  —   just blame. But isn’t that always the way for Cohen? He’s confronted from the audience, he’s confronted by that guy in Washington, and still he’s not getting the credit for what his gift actually is, which isn’t knowing how to deviously propel national discourse into the gutter but instead delivering to viewers what they want before they know they want it. And still, they mess up the name of his show, calling it “Watch What Happens Now. ” They accuse him of ruining America, when he carries the light. Even Oprah said it. Andy Cohen didn’t invent our society. To think that is to have missed the entire point of him. He simply predicted it. He saw it coming before we did, and he taped it. He has a lack of judgment about the way the world works, and therefore doesn’t have the willful ignorance that the rest of us do  —   yes, we’d seen Tamra call Alexis “Jesus Jugs,” and we insisted it was a tacky anomaly. But it wasn’t. It was the way the world works now. Andy Cohen isn’t how our culture got this way. He is simply a walking seismograph of it. Back at Cafe Cluny, I took one of the pieces of chocolate that came with the check he left the other two alone. I asked him what was going to happen next. He shrugged and opened his mouth to say something, pausing for what felt like a minute. Then he told me that it was all going to be O. K. and I decided to believe him.",0
6904,Donald Trump’s Surrogates Back Off ‘Deportation Force’ for Illegal Immigrants - The New York Times,"A parade of surrogates for Donald J. Trump backed away on Sunday from a primary element of his immigration policy, further muddying an issue on which Mr. Trump himself sowed confusion in recent days. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump’s running mate on the Republican presidential ticket, would not affirm that their administration would expel the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally, a   stance that helped Mr. Trump vanquish opponents in the primary race. Asked if Mr. Trump still sought a “deportation force,” which he called for last year, Mr. Pence said Mr. Trump was speaking of “a mechanism, not a policy. ” He also backed away from Mr. Trump’s opposition to automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants. On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mr. Pence promised that Mr. Trump would lay out a detailed immigration plan in the next two weeks, though Mr. Trump has emphasized the issue for more than a year. Mr. Trump last week suggested a “softening” toward illegal immigrants, then seemed to reverse himself under fierce and immediate criticism from some conservatives. “You see a C. E. O. at work,” Mr. Pence said. “You see someone who is engaging the American people, listening to the American people. ” On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that he will make a “major speech” about the issue in Arizona on Wednesday. The efforts of Mr. Trump’s surrogates  —   who argued on Sunday that nothing he had said recently was inconsistent  —   reflected a problem for Mr. Trump as he lags Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, in many polls. He enters the campaign’s final stretch with immigration policies that are popular with his core supporters but not with voters at large. Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, went even further than Mr. Pence, suggesting that Mr. Trump no longer favored the forced removal of illegal immigrants. “He is not talking about a deportation force, but he is talking about being fair and humane,” Ms. Conway said on CBS’s “Face the Nation. ” “He has said that, if you want to be here legally, you have to apply to be here legally,” she added. The statement seemed to suggest that immigrants would be able to attain legal status without leaving the country, a position that conservatives call amnesty  —   and that Mr. Pence said was not an option. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he agreed Mr. Trump had oversimplified immigration during the primary campaign. “But now he’s reflecting on it, and his position is going to be known,” he said. Also appearing on “Meet the Press” was David Plouffe, President Obama’s former campaign manager, who called Mr. Trump mentally unhinged. “You have a psychopath running for president,” he said. “I mean, he meets the clinical definition, O. K.?” The host, Chuck Todd, rebuked Mr. Plouffe for making an unfair judgment. Conceding he was no psychologist, Mr. Plouffe cited Mr. Trump’s “grandiose notion of   pathological lying, lack of empathy and remorse. ” He predicted that Mrs. Clinton would win the election in a landslide.",0
6905,15 Foods That Contain the Most Vitamin E | Alternative,"(Before It's News)
What is Vitamin E? Vitamin E is an important fat-soluble antioxidant compound that aids the body in neutralizing the harmful after-effects of oxidation of fats. Current research is even looking into the important role that this vitamin plays in stopping free-radical production, a key method of preventing the development of chronic diseases and aging. It is also a vital element in the overall maintenance of a healthy immune system.
Some studies are even looking into its role in preventing degenerative mental imbalances such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. And while many of us may do well in taking extra vitamin E supplements, we can use an organic diet to get a large amount of the daily requirements for this powerful antioxidant lipid. In fact, there are many common foods with vitamin E. You probably have a few in your house right now.
Foods With Vitamin E
Here are fifteen foods with vitamin E that you should strongly consider adding to your diet.
1. Almonds
Almonds are one the best vitamin E foods. Just an ounce of almonds offers a whopping 7.4 milligrams of vitamin E. You can also get your vitamin E needs in the form of almond milk and almond oils. We would recommend eating raw almonds, if possible.
2. Raw Seeds
Select raw seeds , such as sunflower, pumpkin and sesame, are another common food with vitamin E. In fact, eating just ¼ of a cup of sunflower seeds gives you 90.5% of your recommended daily value, making them one of the best vitamin E foods you can eat daily.
3. Swiss Chard
Swiss chard is easily one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat on a daily basis. Commonly known to be high in vitamin K, vitamin A and vitamin C, Swiss chard is another food high in vitamin E. Just one cup of boiled swiss chard greens will provide you with almost 17% of your daily recommended values.
4. Mustard Greens
Similar to swiss chard, mustard greens are very nutrient dense and will provide a variety of health benefits. Not only are they one of the best vitamin E foods, but mustard greens are also high in vitamin K, vitamin A, folate , and vitamin c. Eating just one cup of boiled mustard greens contains about 14% of your daily dietary requirements. We would recommend eating organic mustard greens, if possible.
5. Spinach
Spinach may not be your favorite veggie, but it is one of the best leafy greens you can add to your diet. Not only is it one of the best calcium foods and naturally high in folate, it’s also one of the best vitamin E foods as well. Just one cup of boiled spinach will provide you with approximately 20% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh spinach to your sandwiches to make them extra healthy.
6. Turnip Greens
While turnip greens may have a slightly bitter taste, they are very high in many essential nutrients. Like the rest of the leafy greens on this list, just one cup will provide you with plenty of vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C and folate. Not to mention approximately 12% of your daily requirements of vitamin E.
7. Kale
Kale is another great cruciferous vegetable you should eat as often as possible. Kale is very high in many nutrients, in fact, just one cup of boiled kale can give you almost 6% of your daily vitamin E requirements. We would recommend eating organic kale, if possible.
8. Plant oils
Most plant seed oils are very good sources for Vitamin E as well. The best oil with vitamin E is Wheat germ oil. In fact, one tablespoon of this oil holds 100% of your daily Vitamin E requirements. Sunflower oil is another excellent option, as it provides over 5 mg of the vitamin, and can easily be be used for cooking. Other great Vitamin-E-rich oils include hempseed oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil (with almost 5 mg of vitamin E), olive oil and safflower oil. We would recommend only buying oils that are cold pressed unrefined and organic.
9. Hazelnuts
A perfect snack during a long workday, eating just one ounce of hazelnuts can provide you with approximately 20% of our daily requirements of vitamin E. For an alternative to eating nuts, try drinking hazelnut milk in your morning coffee instead of milk or flavored creamer.
10. Pine Nuts
Add an ounce of these nuts to anything you please! One serving contains 2.6 mg of vitamin E. You can also use pine nut oil for added health benefits.
11. Avocado
Perhaps one of the tastiest foods with Vitamin E, avocados represent natures creamiest, oil-rich food. Just half of an avocado holds more than 2 mg of vitamin E. Avocados are very easy to incorporate into your diet. We would recommend adding sliced avocados to your salad, a sandwich, or mashed up as guacamole!
12. Broccoli
For generations now, broccoli has been considered one of the best detox foods , but it’s also one of the healthiest foods high in Vitamin E. Just one cup of steamed broccoli will provide you with 4% of your daily requirements. Broccoli may not be as nutrient dense as other Vitamin E foods on this list, but it is definitely one of the healthiest foods you can eat daily.
13. Parsley
An excellent spice, parsley is another great Vitamin E food. Try adding fresh parsley to salads and dishes for an extra Vitamin-E kick. Dried parsley will also provide you with this important vitamin, but the fresher the better.
14. Papaya
This popular fruit is most commonly known as one of the best vitamin C foods , but it’s also high in Vitamin E. Just one papaya will give you approximately 17% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh or frozen papaya to fruit smoothies, along with other fruity vitamin E foods on this list for an extra healthy snack!
15. Olives
From the oil to the fruit, eating olives is an excellent way of getting your daily needs for vitamin E. Just one cup of olives can give you approximately 20% of your daily recommended amount.
These are just a few examples of foods with vitamin E. There are plenty more that aren’t listed here. Which vitamin E food is your favorite? Let’s hear your thoughts below.

6906,Labour Turfs out Cabbie After Accusation He ’Liked’ Islam-Critical Posts,"Labour has sacked a general election candidate who campaigns for workers’ rights after allegations the prospective MP for a safe Conservative seat had ‘liked’ a series of ‘Islamophobic’ posts on Twitter over the years. [The former Labour candidate, Trevor Merralls, is the general secretary of   cooperative United Cabbies Group (UCG) and a black cab driver in London. He previously penned an article published in The Guardian in which the   black cab driver slammed taxi firm Uber for “eroding one of the only paths London’s   kids still have to get a stable job at a time when social mobility has screeched to a halt”.  The decision to ditch Mr. Merralls as the candidate for Old Bexley and Sidcup followed an investigation by Labour which centred around a Twitter account with the handle @wellingboyblue. According to the Independent, the   account “‘liked’ a number of racist and Islamophobic messages over the course of the last few years”. Merralls, who denies the account belongs to him, said in a post on social media: “Already the smears and fake tweets have begun. I’ve been through this before. I’m standing in a safe Tory seat. What are they so afraid of?” “Uber accessed highest level of government and used ministers like paid up lobbyists. Made up, cropped, and photoshopped tweets wont shut me up. ” He added: “That’s categorically not me. ” Activists have pointed to the fact @wellingblueboy identified themself as “trev” and said it was a taxi driver in London and campaigner with the UCG as evidence that Merralls is behind the account. One of the account’s posts which the Independent highlights is a message dating back to March 2014, in which @wellingblueboy said Europe should “eradicate Islam from our continent”. Another aspect of the account the left wing website identified as having been offensive to Labour Party officials was how, at one point, @wellingblueboy identified themself as a supporter of the     correctness BlueHand movement. The organisation’s website says: “Free Speech is a fundamental right, one that is   given. Sadly, it is also a right that our politicians are attempting to take from us, thanks to the appeasement of Islamism coupled with the constant   of certain minority groups. ”",0
6907,The “American Conservative Movement” Has Ended. the American Right Goes On.,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name => Horatius Defends the Bridge at Rome. Credit: VDare.com. 
VDARE.com Editor Peter Brimelow writes: I spoke at the H.L. Mencken Club conference in Baltimore last Saturday, November 5. It seems like a thousand years ago. Subject: “The Right and American Conservatism.” Reading the transcript, I see it’s almost as f I thought Donald J. Trump might lose the November 8 election . Silly me. 
[See also: America`s Egalitarian Temptation—Stalinism`s Unquiet Ghost , Peter Brimelow’s address to the 2008 inaugural meeting of the H. L. Mencken club]. 
Peter Brimelow: Ladies and Gentlemen: Some of you may recall I gave the banquet address at the H.L. Mencken Club last November. It’s been lost to history because (to my intense rage!) H.L, Mencken Club Chairman Paul Gottfried didn’t have it recorded. In it, I praised Ann Coulter’s great book Adios America! , which came to the same conclusions about immigration (moratorium, sealed borders, attrition through enforcement etc.) that I had in Alien Nation 20 years earlier. And a questioner said: “Why is she doing this? Why is she taking this risk?” And I said: “Well, look on the bright side, maybe Trump will win.” 
There was sort of a shocked silence, as I recall. [ Laughter ] This was before the primaries had even begun. I was pretty shocked at the idea myself! 
But, you know, he’s come very close . He’s come very close. The moral of this is: we should not give into despair. Amazing things happen—completely unexpectedly. 
The subject I’ve got now from Paul is: “The Right and American Conservatism.” And I think it’s right that we should use the term “American Conservatism” because it’s on the point at becoming a Term Of Art. It represented a specific intellectual eddy , which came into existence relatively recently. I don’t know how widely the term “conservatism” was used in American politics prior to 1950s —Paul, do you? 
Paul Gottfried: 
It was not used often at all. Robert Taft described himself as a “liberal.” 
PB: 
Right. In Britain, of course, it didn’t exist at all before the 1840s. 
Anyway, the American Conservative Movement came into existence in the 1950s—and now it’s ended. 
I may say I immigrated to the American Conservative Movement. I discovered it when I was at university in England in the late 1960s, reading National Review, which we found in great bundles in the History Basement of the University of Sussex Library . They had discontinued their subscription —because they thought National Review was irrelevant and pointless. We of course were fascinated by the fact that there’d been a story on the cover proposing that the Americans nuke China, which struck us as very enterprising, the sort of initiative that was unthinkable in the British political context. [ January 12, 1965 ] So we made them re-subscribe. 
And I’m not one of these people that thinks the American Conservative Movement did not achieve anything. It ended in failure, as all political movements do. But it did win the Cold War and that’s really significant. Some of you are old enough to remember the despair that prevailed in the mid1970s after the fall of Vietnam. And we had reason to despair. American society and American politics was riddled with no-goodniks who absolutely planned to staff the gulags after the Soviets arrived. Absolutely planned to do that. And, of course, now they’ve simply mutated into Cultural Marxists. They’re still planning to staff the gulags. 
I was talking to Paul [Gottfried] a little earlier about Tom Fleming, our mutual friend, who was the long-time editor of the Chronicles . He’s a sort of wayward genius and I have learned to respect him because he told me more than 20 years ago that the great Lawrence Auster , the blogger , was in effect “mad, bad, and dangerous to know,” to use Lady Caroline Lamb’s description of Lord Byron. And he was understating the matter, although I do think Larry was a great man and we’ve missed him sorely in the immigration wars. 
And Tom also said about 20 years ago that we had to give up the term “Conservatism”—because it had been co-opted by, basically, corporate lobbyists and rent-seekers. 
I didn’t like this at all because I thought “Conservatism” was one of our very few—but there are a few—victories in the culture. Another one, for example, is the idea of Political Correctness. Everyone knows what Political Correctness is. It’s not that the Cultural Marxists wanted us to know, it’s just that somehow it made it to the front. 
We saw Romney describe himself in one of the 2012 primary debates as “ severely Conservative .” Now, of course, he’s not conservative at all, and he doesn’t strike me as particularly severe, he strikes me a rather a wimp as a matter of fact. But he felt obliged to say this because of the power that the word has achieved in the culture. So, I was kind of sorry to give it up. But I’m afraid that we are going to have to. 
A few years ago, I learned with delight that the Indian Army has inscribed, on the monument erected in Tawang province to its soldiers who fell in the 1962 border war with China, now completely forgotten, the famous lines from the Lays Of Ancient Rome by Lord Macaulay—also now completely forgotten: 
And how can man die better 
Than facing fearful odds 
For the ashes of his fathers 
And the temples of his gods? 
It`s always seemed to me that Macaulay`s verse is a litmus test for conservatism—or perhaps I should more accurately say, the Right. It either it speaks to you or it doesn`t. 
It`s vital to note that this verse is not vainglorious and chest-thumping, but somber and stoic. The scene, of course, is that Horatius is about to make a stand on the bridge to stop the storming of Rome by Lars Porsena and the deposed king of Rome, Tarquin the Proud. The previous lines are: 
Then up spake brave Horatius 
The Captain of the Gate: 
“To every man upon this earth 
Death cometh soon or late…” 
In other words, Horatius` point is not that death facing fearful odds is so wonderful—but that there is no wonderful alternative. So why not? 
Note also that Macaulay has Horatio fight for “ashes” and “temples”—that is, not in the hope of saving any living family members, or in the service of any gods in whom he has confident faith. The implication: he could have no family members and no hope of divine providence—but his death in battle would still have symbolic resonance. 
The core of conservatism, it seems to me, is this recognition and acceptance of the elemental emotions. Conservatism understands that it is futile to debate the feelings of the mother for her child—or such human instincts as the bonds of tribe , nation , even race . Of course, all are painfully vulnerable to deconstruction by rationalistic intellectuals—but not, ultimately, to destruction. These commitments are Jungian rather than Freudian, not irrational but a-rational—beyond the reach of reason. 
This is one of the problems, by the way, with the American Conservative Movement. I was completely astonished when it fell apart at the end of the Cold War—I never thought it would. That’s because I assumed that everybody realized that America standing up to the Soviet Union was, in some sense, a nationalist resistance. Americans just didn’t want to be conquered by Russians. 
But, it turned out that there were people who had joined the anti-Communist coalition who harbored messianic fantasies about “global democracy” and and America as the first “universal nation” (i.e. polity. Nation-states must have a specific ethnic core.) They also had uses for the American military which hadn’t occurred to me. But they didn’t care about America—about America as a nation-state, the political expression of a particular people, the Historic American Nation. In fact, in some cases, it made them feel uneasy. 
I thought about this this spring when Trump was debating in New Hampshire. ABC’s John Muir asked three candidates: “What does it mean to be Conservative?” 
I’m going to quote from John Kasich: blah, blah, blah, blah. Balanced budgets—tax cuts—jobs—“but once we have economic growth I believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows.” 
By this he meant, not illegal aliens, although he did favor Amnesty , but “the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor…[and] our friends in the minority community.” 
That’s because the Republican Party has lots of friends in the minority community. 
Marco Rubio said: 
…it’s about three things. The first is conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level…It’s about free enterprise…And it’s about a strong national defense. It’s about believing, unlike Barack Obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. That’s conservatism. 
Kasich and Rubio’s answers, of course, are not remotely “conservative” but utilitarian, economistic, classical liberal. Note that Rubio even felt obliged to justify “strong national defense” in universalistic, Wilsonian terms: it will make the world “a safer and a better place.” 
In contrast to all that, Donald Trump said: 
I view the word conservative as a derivative of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth…We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. 
Now, this caused a considerable amount of harrumphing among Conservative Inc. intellectuals and various Republican politicians. Somebody called John Hart , who writes a thing called Opportunity Lives —has anybody heard of it? It’s a very well-funded Libertarianism Inc. website in Washington. 
Nobody has heard of it? Good. 
Hart said: 
Trump’s answer may have been how conservatives described themselves once: in 1957. But today’s modern conservative movement isn’t a hoarding or protectionist philosophy. Conservatism isn’t about conserving; it’s about growth. 
“Growth”? 
Well, I don’t think so. And not just because I remember 1957 . 
As I said, I think it turned out that American Conservatism was just a transitional phase. And now it’s over. 
Why did it end? After Buckley purged John O’Sullivan and all of us immigration patriots from National Review in 1997, we spent a lot of time thinking about why he had done this. And there were a lot of complicated psychological explanations: Bill was getting old, he was jealous of his successor, the new Editor, John O’Sullivan, he was terrified of the neoconservatives who didn’t like the emphasis on immigration because of their own ethnic agenda, and he was very inclined to listen to the Congressional Republicans, who didn’t want to talk about immigration because they are terrified too—because they are cowards, basically—and also because they have big corporate donors . And, I think that is part of the explanation. 
But there was a similar discussion in the 1950s and 1960s, which I’m old enough to remember, about why the Old Bolsheviks all testified against themselves in the treason trials during Stalin’s Great Purge . They all admitted to the most fantastic things—that they had been spies for the Americans and the British and the capitalist imperialists all along, that they’d plotted to assassinate Comrade Stalin. And there were all kinds of discussions as to why this was, and in fact a wonderful novel, Darkness At Noon [ PDF ] by Arthur Koestler , one of the most remarkable novels in the last century, describing the exquisite psychological process by which an old Bolshevik in prison came to the conclusion that he was going to have to say all these things in the long-term interest of the Revolution. 
Do you agree about Darkness At Noon , Paul? [ Paul Gottfried indicates assent ] 
Good. 
Well, when Nikita Khrushchev got up and denounced Stalin in at the party conference in 1956, he was asked about this. Why did all these Old Bolsheviks turn turtle like this? And his answer was: “Beat, beat, beat.” 
In other words, there is no complex psychological explanation : they were just tortured. 
I think that goes to what happened to the American Conservative Movement. It wasn’t tortured; it was bought . It was simply bought . 
I think the dominance of the Donorist class and the Donorist Party is one of the things that has emerged analytically within the past 10 years. 
When I was first writing about American politics and got involved in American politics–and I started by working for John Ashbrook (not Ashcroft , Ash brook ) against Nixon in 1972 –nobody thought about donors. We have only gradually become conscious of them. And their absolute dominant role, and their ability to prohibit policy discussions, has really only become clear in the last five to ten years. 
I think, in retrospect, with Buckley , who subsidized his lifestyle out of the National Review to a scandalous extent, that there was some financial transaction. I think that now. 
It’s an open secret that Rich Lowry did not want to come out and with this anti-Trump issue that they published earlier this year, but he was compelled to do it. That’s not the type of thing that Lowry would normally do. He wouldn’t take that kind of risk, he’s a courtier, he would never take the risk of not being invited to ride in Trump’s limousine in the case that Trump won. But, apparently, someone forced him to do it. And I think that someone was a donor and I think I know who it was. 
So I think that is the reason for the end of the American Conservative Movement. It really goes back to what Eric Hoffer said: “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket .” It’s a racket. 
But the good news is, as John Derbyshire said a few minutes ago, that ultimately Conservatism—or Rightism— is a personality type. It underlies politics and it will crop up again—just as, to our astonishment, Donald Trump has cropped up. 
So, I guess my bottom line here is: “ Don’t despair .”

6908,Donald Trump Junks Barack Obama’s Pro-Transgender Policies - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump is junking former President Barack Obama’s unpopular federal   policies, according to the White House spokesman. [The policy reversal will likely protect   civic groups and institutions  —   including   bathrooms  —   across the nation from lawsuits and will put new pressure on federal judges to preserve the central role of biology in defining whether a person is male or female.  The new policy is a big defeat for gay advocacy groups and for progressives, who want judges to declare that people can change their legal sex when their “gender identity” changes from day to day. The announcement came Tuesday from White House spokesman Sean Spicer, who said, “the president has maintained for a long time that this is a states’ rights issue and not one for the federal government. ” “So while we have further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the president’s view has been for a long time, that this is not something the federal government should be involved in, that this is a states’ rights issue,” he added. Trump’s deference to the states will force the cancellation of the federal “gender identity” policy announced in May 2016 by Obama’s deputies. Numerous states are already debating how sex should be defined. In North Carolina, for example, the   HB2 2016 law says people can change their legal sex after surgery. That clear   distinction is strongly opposed by gay advocacy groups, who helped lead an economic boycott of the state in 2016. Other states, such as Oregon and Washington have decided that people  —   including children  —   have a fundamental right to change their legal sex, regardless of the impact on civic society. Less than   of Americans support the “ ” plan pushed by gay groups and by Obama, which would allow transgender activists to sue   institutions  —   such as sports leagues, public   and women’s shelters   —   until they treat both biological sexes as interchangeable. That would be a very different regime from today’s laws and civic society, which are designed to help two equal and different sexes complement each other in a heterosexual society built on families and child rearing. The process has already forced the Boy Scouts to accept girls, and will also force teacher and parents to change how they educate young boys and girls, say critics. Since Trump’s election, Obama has twice admitted that his unpopular transgender policy helped defeat Hillary Clinton. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a lawsuit from a young woman in Virginia who wants school officials  —   and schoolkids  —   to declare that she is a he. The court has not revealed where it stands on the issue, but in 2015, the Court changed the definition of marriage nationwide so that states could not define marriage as a   relationship. Only about  400 Americans have changed their names from one sex to the other, according to a study of the 2010 census.

6909,Deepwater Horizon Continues to Impact Public Health,"Deepwater Horizon Continues to Impact Public Health Deepwater Horizon Continues to Impact Public Health By 1 135 
It’s hard to believe that the Deepwater Horizon incident, which discharged over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, happened six years ago. What’s not hard to believe is that the environmental health implications of the spill are stubbornly lingering. 
Gulf residents of variety of species are paying a high price for it — so high that litigation against BP for its role in the spill, officially deemed “ negligent ,” is likely to continue for decades as people fight to get help with ongoing medical expenses. 
Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the spill was linked to an uptick in dolphin deaths , illustrating that this unprecedented release of petroleum products in the Gulf had a lasting health impact for animals. 
Similarly, abnormalities in heart development among fish have also been connected to Deepwater Horizon exposure. Part of the problem is that sediments remain coated in oil and sludge . Because it was impossible to clean up every drop of crude from the Gulf, the oil that settled to the bottom continues to interfere with the embryonic development of a range of fish species. 
But humans aren’t doing too well either. 
In the aftermath of the spill, people were exposed both to crude petroleum and to Corexit , a chemical dispersant used in unprecedented volumes during the cleanup. 
Subsequent research has shown that in addition to having some hazardous health effects on its own, the combination of Corexit and the type of crude spilled during the Deepwater Horizon incident packs a hefty punch for marine animals. 
In the weeks following the spill, first responders reported symptoms like rashes, respiratory problems, headaches, seizures and depression. In response to the complains, agencies closely monitored these individuals. 
As the years went by, enough significant health problems arose for a class action lawsuit against BP. The company eventually agreed to a settlement that included the potential for…",0
6910,"Carville Melts Down: Asserts FBI, GOP and KGB in Cahoots","Posted 10/31/2016 3:17 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Democratic strategist calls reopened Clinton probe an ‘attack’ on American democracy in MSNBC tantrum 
Famed Democratic strategist James Carville may be the first Clinton surrogate to have officially lost his mind over the FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton’s private email server. 

In an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Carville relentlessly — and repeatedly — attacked the FBI’s decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton, asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert American democracy. 

“This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,” Carville claimed. “It’s unprecedented … the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,” he said. 

Apparently the fact that the Soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton conspiracy organized by the FBI, according to Carville. Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey’s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times. 

He was also adamant about who was responsible. “Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,” Carville said. “We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,” he claimed. 
Carville was very upset that Comey’s announcement thrust Clinton’s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight. “It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn’t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that’s what happened here — there’s nothing else that’s going on — and in the meantime … democracy is under assault by the KGB,” he said. “To me that’s something we ought to be talking about.” 

Unfortunately for Carville, whilst fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI on the GOP’s take certainly make for interesting entertainment, they pale in importance to the real life stories of Clinton’s brazen lawlessness. 
When the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI’s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. Hillary Reboots ‘Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy’ Playbook Clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit FBI Director Comey and criminal probe as politically motivated 

“When the facts change I change my mind,” Carville said. “Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?” he asked angrily. Faced with the Democrats’ clear double standard 

“This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,” Carville repeated. “And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.”",0
6911,Jim Rogers: It’s Time To Prepare; Economic And Financial Collapse Imminent (VIDEO),"By: The Voice of Reason | Regardless of how much information gets released through Wikileaks or Project Veritas revealing grossly immoral, or even criminal conduct between members of the Clinton campaign, neither the mainstream media nor our woefully corrupt Department of Injustice have done anything to even slow the Clinton Crime Syndicate’s march toward the oval office. With each passing day that brings us closer to the election, lies continue to be pumped out with impunity to the voting public at large by the very institutions the public should be able to trust to give them fair and honest reporting or education on important matters. In the following interview, legendary investor Jim Rogers, explains in detail why nothing being reported about the economy is true, and why financial and economic collapse is imminent. Who is Jim Rogers? Why should you care what he says? First of all, listen to him because he’s right. Start learning facts, and stop listening to mainstream media propaganda. They are lying. Your life may depend on being prepared. Second, Jim is hardly alone in his line of thinking. Many of the world’s best economists are saying a global reset is coming that will have an effect on the world like nothing mankind has ever seen before. One famous investor even goes as far as to say the collapse of the U.S. Dollar, and the global reset that follows it, will be the single biggest event in all of human history. Let that sink in… Third, and lastly, you should care what Jim Rogers says because Jim is a legendary investor, one who co-founded the Quantum Fund, and retired at age thirty-seven. Do you know who his partner used to be? George Soros. Do you recall who is involved in virtually every major geopolitical firestorm anywhere on the planet, including the U.S. presidential election right here domestically? Many Trump enthusiasts incorrectly believe Donald Trump can save the U.S. from financial implosion, but in his interview, Jim Rogers explains why it doesn’t matter who wins the election, the problems that plague the U.S. economy are as systemic as the corruption is in Washington. There is no question Donald Trump has created a massive wave of anti-establishment fervor across the country, and there’s equally no question a Trump presidency would soften the blow of a financial collapse, but as Michael Synder explains in the article that follows the Rogers interview, the electoral college math just doesn’t add up to a Trump Win. At this point if Donald Trump is able to overcome the amount of fraud baked into the system by the Clinton campaign, and an electoral map that doesn’t give him a millimeter of wiggle room, it will truly be a miracle of Biblical proportions. In the meantime, Americans had better begin to prepare for the future that awaits them, with or without a President Trump ! Michael Snyder writes: Are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time? Because as I will show in this article, that is precisely what it is going to take in order for Donald Trump to win. Before I go any further, I want to make it exceedingly clear that I am not saying what the outcome will be on November 8th. As I recently told a national television audience, I do not know who is going to win. In this article I am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand. But in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight, and it is entirely possible that we could still have another “October surprise” or two before it is all said and done. And without a doubt Donald Trump desperately needs something “to move the needle”, because if the election was held today Hillary Clinton would almost certainly win. What we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented. Just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time. We have never had a bigger “October surprise” than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which Donald Trump claimed to grope women without their consent. We have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked Donald Trump . In the past, the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced, but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity. They should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves, and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back. We have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election. It has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall, and a whole host of prominent Republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the Trump campaign. If Donald Trump is able to overcome all of these factors, it truly will be a miracle of Biblical proportions. As it stands at the moment, however, the numbers are looking quite ominous for Trump . Right now, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls has Hillary Clinton ahead by 6.2 percent. Most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game. But even if Trump can close that gap and pull ahead, that does not mean that he will win the election. In fact, Trump could beat Clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose. In order to win the election, one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes. And on the latest Real Clear Politics electoral map , 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to Hillary Clinton, 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to Donald Trump , and 112 electoral votes are in the “toss up” category. So unless something dramatically changes, Donald Trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win, and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim. Let’s take a closer look at this. The first thing that Donald Trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. That would get him up to 206 electoral votes. Unfortunately, it looks like that may be very difficult to do. Romney won North Carolina, but the six most recent polls all have Clinton ahead in that state. Romney also won Arizona, but the most recent poll to be taken there has Clinton ahead by five points. But for a moment, let’s assume that Trump can win all of the states that Romney won. On top of that, there are four other states that Trump must win… #1 Trump must win Florida’s 29 electoral votes. Without Florida, Trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes. So on election night if it is announced that Trump has lost Florida, you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because Trump is going to lose the election. Unfortunately for Trump , four recent major surveys all show Trump down by four points in the Sunshine state. #2 Trump must win Ohio’s 18 electoral votes. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, and the two most recent major surveys show that Trump and Clinton are tied in the state. #3 Trump must win Iowa’s 6 electoral votes. Fortunately for Trump , most recent surveys show him actually leading in Iowa. #4 Trump must win Nevada’s 6 electoral votes. At this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do, because all of the recent polls have Clinton leading in Nevada, including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points. If Donald Trump can win those four states, that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes. Instead, it gets him to 265 electoral votes, and so he would still need one more medium-sized state to win. The most likely candidates for that last state are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota. Unfortunately for Trump , Clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment. But even if Trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark, the truth is that Utah could still mess everything up. Do you remember Evan McMullin? He was the third party “conservative alternative” candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards. He is only on the ballot in 12 states, but one of those states is Utah, and it turns out that Evan McMullin is a Mormon. Many Mormons believe that a Mormon will be elected president someday when the U.S. Constitution hangs “ like a thread “. According to this belief, this Mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen. Many Mormons thought that Mitt Romney was going to be this president, but now Evan McMullin has become the target of these expectations. So how in the world could Evan McMullin become president? Well, their plan is to have Evan McMullin win Utah, and that could potentially keep both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close. If that happens, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives. It is being projected that the House will still be controlled by the Republicans after this election, and so the choice would come down to either Trump or McMullin, and those backing McMullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario. I know all of this sounds very strange, but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over Utah tonight. And in recent days Evan McMullin has been soaring in Utah. One recent survey shows Trump with a one point lead over McMullin, and another recent survey actually show McMullin leading Trump by four points in the state. So Trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes, and Utah could end up messing up everything for him. In addition, it is also very important to keep in mind that Trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud . There was widespread evidence of “funny business” in 2012, and this is something that I detailed for a live studio audience down at Morningside earlier this month … Are you starting to see why I would consider this to be the biggest miracle in American political history if Donald Trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election? And we don’t have to wait until November 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go. Early voting is already taking place is some states, and so far the signs are not encouraging for the Trump campaign. The following comes from CNN … Democratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots. Perhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509. But if you do want Trump to win, the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before November 8th. We have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election, and a miracle is definitely not out of the question. In fact, I am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early November. So hold on to your hats, because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us.

[Federal agents with the help of local police raided two local restaurants and two mobile homes where they arrested 16 illegal aliens and found multiple firearms. At one of the restaurants, Taqueria Guadalajara, agents arrested Alfredo Plascencia Leon five illegal immigrants from Mexico and one from Honduras who were working at the restaurant. The other raids took place at the properties behind the store and at a second restaurant, Gumbo Seafood, owned and operated by Plascencia. Refugio is approximately 44 miles from Corpus Christi.   Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that Plascencia would allegedly house illegal aliens in various mobile homes and collected rent.  During the raids, authorities seized an “assault rifle” a shotgun, a . 45 caliber pistol, and a . 22 caliber rifle. Mario Rizo Melendez, one of the illegal aliens, told authorities that the . 22 caliber weapon was given to him by Plascencia and that the shotgun was loaned to him also.

6913,Upheaval Amid ‘Alarming’ Revelations at William Koch’s Florida School - The New York Times,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   The youngest of the billionaire Koch brothers had a dream: to found a private high school where academically gifted students of all socioeconomic backgrounds would do   projects and learn by solving problems. He poured more than $75 million into building the school, the Oxbridge Academy of the Palm Beaches. But on Friday, he fired the head of school and declined to renew the contracts of the athletic director and the football coach. The moves came after a sexual harassment complaint and an internal investigation into accusations of kickbacks,   excessive spending and violations of the rules governing high school sports. It turned out, William I. Koch said in an interview, that a “power elites group” in the school ran “the asylum. ” Mr. Koch, 76, is the chief executive of Oxbow Carbon L. L. C. an energy development holding company based in West Palm Beach, and is the younger brother of Charles G. and David H. Koch, who are known for supporting conservative Republican causes. Referred to by some journalists as “the other Koch brother,” he established Oxbridge Academy to much fanfare in 2011. The school, which has 580 students, has many perks, including a physical therapist on staff,   lunches, an equestrian club and a flight simulator. The debate team spent hundreds of thousands of dollars traveling to competitions nationwide, Mr. Koch said. “We are finding alarming things of how money was misspent,” Mr. Koch said at his company’s offices. “If people think they’ve got a honey pot, there’s going to be a lot of bears around it, trying to get it. ” A few years ago, students requested that the school establish a football team, an idea the administration embraced. But that was when the troubles took off. An athlete who read at a   level was given a full scholarship, the football team had its own locker room and the coach earned more than $200, 000 a year, according to tax records and interviews with former employees. The former head of school, Robert C. Parsons, whose official title was president and chief executive, is a former chief financial officer at the United States Naval Academy. Mr. Parsons started at Oxbridge in 2011 with a compensation package worth $1 million, tax records show, seven times his academy salary. Eventually, he made about $600, 000 a year at the school. But in interviews, former employees questioned Mr. Koch’s decision to hire Mr. Parsons in the first place, because he was suspended for five days after a 2009 Naval inspector general report accused him and his former boss of operating a “slush fund” to pay for tailgate parties. Mr. Koch said he did not think Mr. Parsons’ record at the Naval Academy was a red flag because the government is “all screwed up. ” Other billionaires  —   such as Bill Gates of Microsoft Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook the music mogul Sean Combs the filmmaker James Cameron the philanthropist Eli Broad and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla  —   have poured parts of their fortunes into education. Some, like Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Broad, said they wanted to help solve problems in public education. Their experiences underscore the pitfalls that confront business leaders whose professional success does not always translate into the education field. Mr. Koch has discovered similar challenges, though he had a personal motivation for starting Oxbridge. He said he founded the school to give his own children a better academic experience than he had. By his account, he went from being an awkward ugly duckling who was flunking out of middle school in Kansas, to a military academy cadet who embraced a love of study. He longed for a place where students, not teachers’ unions or principals, ruled. He completed a Ph. D. at M. I. T. but acknowledges that he still cannot spell very well. And he chokes up just talking about the troubled students who have made a turnaround at Oxbridge, which his children attend and from which his son has just graduated. In the past, Mr. Koch has famously sued his siblings in disputes over the family business, usually losing. Several years ago, he spent more than $25 million investigating counterfeit wine after being duped by a wine salesman. In 2012, a former company executive who had faced a fraud investigation accused Mr. Koch and his staff members of kidnapping him. In court papers, Mr. Koch’s lawyers said the former employee had made the claim in a lawsuit because he was angry and embarrassed that his fraud had been exposed. A judge later dismissed the case. “My biggest failing is I’m too trusting of people,” Mr. Koch said. Oxbridge was created in less than a year on a   campus that once held a Jewish community center. “I don’t know if people appreciate how much happened here in five years,” said Bob Kaufmann, the chairman of the school’s executive committee, who has been given the task of reducing spending. “This is a happy place for children. ” Oxbridge graduates have been accepted this fall to nearly all of the Ivy League universities. One senior won a $100, 000 Siemens scholarship for inventing a   method. “The intention was really good,” Mark Bodnar, the school’s former vice president for technology and security, said about Oxbridge. “It sort of went off the rails a couple of years in. ” Mr. Bodnar, who had been on the admissions committee, said the committee’s recommendations were often overruled by the football coaches. He said that there were so many academically struggling athletes that tutors were overwhelmed, and that the players had to be put in classes separate from the rest of the student body. John Klemme, the academic dean who will take over as head of school, said that some of the struggling students “would have been written off” at other schools, but had found their way to a superior education because of their football prowess. “This is not to be a rich kids’ school,” Mr. Klemme said. Mr. Koch said that about 40 percent of students  —   including those who do not play football  —   received some kind of scholarship. Phillip Taylor, 17, a junior, said he loved the school and the opportunities he had been given, such as spring break study at Cambridge University in Britain. Still, he said he resented the double standard on admissions afforded to football players. “My experience was positive,” he said. “I learned so much. But it does bother me. ” His mother, Cheryl Taylor, also had a daughter in the school’s freshman class in the school’s inaugural year. She said parents like her who are impressed by the education the school offered were startled by its cultural shift. “At first, you had to be academically qualified, but that changed dramatically about two years in,” Ms. Taylor said. “Football began to outshine everything else. ” The football team, the Thunderwolves, made it to the regional finals this past season. The problems at Oxbridge, where tuition is $31, 500 a year, went beyond sports. In interviews, several former employees said Mr. Parsons had created a “toxic” work environment. Employee turnover was high and tens of thousands of dollars were spent on severance packages, tax records show. “If he likes somebody and she’s a pretty girl, they got a signing bonus or a higher salary or a bonus,” Ulle Sinisalu Boshko, the school’s former controller, said of Mr. Parsons. Ms. Boshko, who said she was given a large pay increase to leave one of Mr. Koch’s companies to join Oxbridge, said she had been demoted after fending off Mr. Parsons’ advances for months. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is pending, and then she went public. Her accusations led to an investigation of the entire school by The Palm Beach Post. Reached by a New York Times reporter on the phone for comment last week, Mr. Parsons hung up. Reached on Sunday, he said, “I’m not interested,” and hung up again. After inquiries from The Post, Mr. Koch hired a team of accountants, lawyers and a retired F. B. I. agent to look into the conduct of school officials, including whether employees were rigging bids with vendors and whether they had broken rules by housing students in their homes. Mr. Koch said he had not been able to verify any “super sexual harassment” beyond what he called “ ” comments like “God, that girl’s hot” or “She’s got a great behind. ” But the investigation, he said, turned up information that led to the firing of Mr. Parsons and the forcing out of the athletic director and the coach. Mr. Koch said the investigators did not find any evidence of kickbacks to employees from vendors. He said that if any evidence of   emerged, the employees responsible would be fired. He said budget watchdogs would be hired to cut costs and pay closer attention to spending. “The attitude that was there at the school was that they had a rich guy backing it and they could do whatever they wanted,” he said. He also wants to figure out how to get others to donate to the school, he said. That was one reason he did not name the school after himself.",0
6914,Pence Plane Scare,"Pence Plane Scare October 28, 2016 A campaign plane that had been carrying U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence rests in the grass after it skidded off the runway while landing in the rain at LaGuardia 
U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and family declared safe after his plane skids off runway. 
A plane carrying U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence skidded off the runway after landing in the rain at New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Thursday, halting flights for at least an hour, officials said. No one was injured in the incident which occurred less than two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, crucial campaign days for Pence and running mate Donald Trump. Pence pledged to hit the campaign trail again on Friday. 
""So thankful everyone on our plane is safe,"" the Indiana governor said on Twitter after the incident. ""Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many."" 
The Boeing 737 was coming in for a landing and went off the runway at about 7:40 p.m. local time (2340 GMT). The plane was stopped by a crushable type of concrete runway that arrested the aircraft's movement, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said. Trump called his running mate before a rally in Geneva, Ohio. 
""I just spoke to Mike Pence and he's fine,"" Trump told the crowd at the rally. ""The plane skidded off the runway and was pretty close to grave, grave danger.” 
The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate the cause of the incident.

6915,Jackboots! Heavily Militarized Police Caught Red Handed In Collaboration With Oil Companies -,"Via Alternet 
Today’s militarized crackdown on water protectors in Cannonball, North Dakota stems from high levels of coordination between the extractive industry, state officials and police departments. It was waged against a frontline camp seeking to block the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which would cross beneath the Standing Rock Sioux reservation’s main drinking water source and bisect the community’s burial grounds. The attack took place under cover of a media blackout, with reports emerging that police were disrupting cellular phone reception. 
Water protectors have already endured dog attacks, military-style checkpoints, low-flying surveillance planes, invasive strip searches, national guard deployments, and mass arrests. “What’s happening today is a travesty on the human rights of Indigenous people,” Tom Goldtooth, the executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, told AlterNet. “I see this as glaring evidence that the law enforcement of this county and state is more concerned about protecting corporate rights of the extractive industry than tribal nations.” 
There is evidence of close coordination between the companies backing the $3.8 billion crude-oil Dakota Access Pipeline and police departments. Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company for Dakota Access LLC, said Tuesday it intends to work with police to forcibly clear a frontlines water protectors’ camp. Energy Transfer Partners threatened that “in coordination with local law enforcement and county/state officials, all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land.” 
Challenging the company’s charges of trespassing, the frontline Sacred Stone Camp says it is taking back “unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 Treaty of Ft. Laramie as sovereign land under the control of the Oceti Sakowin.” 
“We have never ceded this land,” Joye Braun, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said in a press statement. “If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland.” 
Today’s events indicate that Energy Transfer Partners is not bluffing when it says police are siding with the company. In fact, law enforcement has vocally rallied behind the pipeline, which is backed by Enbridge. “At some point the rule of law has to be enforced,” Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. “We could go down there at any time. We’re trying not to.” 
The companies backing the pipeline already have private security under their employ. Dakota Access LLC confirmed to AlterNet in September that it had hired the notorious multinational security firm G4S during a period that overlapped with the protests, but would not state where its forces were located. Attorneys representing the Standing Rock encampments identified the companies behind the Dakota Access company’s brutal dog attacks, captured on video, as private security firm 10-Code Security, LLC and attack dog contractor Frost Kennels. 
But according to Peter Kraska, professor and author of Militarizing The American Criminal Justice System: The Changing Roles of the Armed Forces and Police , the extractive industry also has taxpayer-funded security, in the form of police. 
“We have romantic notions of the relationships between government and the private sector and tend to think the old days of police supporting owners of capital—the railroad companies instead of the workers—are from a bygone era,” Kraska told AlterNet. “Situations like these show that corporations and energy interests are exercising a monopoly on violence to continue the fossil fuel industry unabated.” 
Steven Salaita, professor and author of the forthcoming book Inter/Nationalism: Decolonizing Native America and Palestine , put it this way: “The current buildup of tremendous force at Standing Rock should be understood as a military invasion of a sovereign nation on behalf of a foreign oil company.” 
The heavy-handed response does not stem from local coordination alone. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department said in a press statement released Sunday that, “Due to escalated unlawful tactics by individuals protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, Morton County has requested additional law enforcement assistance from other states. The state of North Dakota made an Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) request to states for assistance on October 7th.” 
Remarkably, the EMAC program is supposed to be used to allow “states to send personnel, equipment, and commodities to help disaster relief efforts in other states.” 
According to the Morton County Sheriff’s Department, “Several states have responded and have arrived or will be arriving to support Morton County. States that are currently assisting Morton County are: Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, Indiana and Nebraska.” AlterNet could not immediately reach Morton County for comment. 
In Minneapolis, news that local law enforcement officers were being sent to Standing Rock sparked protests on Wednesday. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that, “At the request of the State of North Dakota, and as approved by the State of Minnesota, on Sunday, Minnesota Sheriff’s Deputies from the Hennepin, Anoka, and Washington Counties’ Sheriff’s Offices were deployed to assist in Morton County, North Dakota.” 
Those counties cover the bulk of the Twin Cities area, where local police been accused of placing protesters in danger, through a far-reaching culture of incitement against the Black Lives Matter movement. In one incident, St. Paul police officer Jeff Rothecker was forced to resign in February after he was caught encouraging drivers to run over Black Lives Matter protesters slated to gather for a Martin Luther King Day mobilization. Lt. Bob Kroll, the head of the Minneapolis Police Officer’s Federation who has ties to a white-power-linked biker gang, has repeatedly referred to protesters as “terrorists.” 
As police departments around the country send reinforcements to North Dakota, the appeals of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe for federal protection from law enforcement violence appear to have had no effect. In a letter sent to Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, the water protectors asked the Department of Justice to intervene. 
“To many people, the military tactics being used in North Dakota are reminiscent of the tactics used against protesters during the civil rights movement some 50 years ago,” the letter states. “But to us, there is an additional collective memory that comes to mind. This country has a long and sad history of using military force against indigenous people—including the Sioux Nation.”

In these final days of the election the gloves have truly come off. Trump has just released a new ad which ties Hillary’s email scandal and the new FBI investigation to Anthony Weiner, the husband of Hillary aide Huma Abedin. 
The Washington Examiner reports: 
New Trump ad targets ‘pervert’ Anthony Weiner, dubs Clinton ‘unfit to serve’ 
Donald Trump’s campaign has capitalized on the latest developments surrounding Hillary Clinton’s private email server, releasing a new television ad on Thursday that ties the Democratic presidential hopeful directly to disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner. 
Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, came back to haunt Democrats last week after FBI officials uncovered more than 650,000 new emails on a device of his, some of which may have originated from Clinton’s unsecured server. The discovery led FBI Director James Comey to reopen the agency’s investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified material. 
“Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation again after her emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiner’s laptop,” says the narrator of the 30-second ad, which the Trump campaign titled “Unfit.”

6917,Met Job Cuts Could Exceed 100 in a Move to Steady Finances - The New York Times,"Just three months after the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced a hiring freeze and voluntary buyouts, the museum is turning to layoffs as part of an effort to cut its deficit by $30 million, through cost reductions and revenue growth. On Friday, the Met said that more than 50 employees had taken the buyouts but that it would seek further cuts in its core departments, for a total of at least 100 positions. Curatorial and conservation jobs are likely to be cut by an additional 5 percent, and administrative staff  —   including marketing, human resources, and digital personnel  —   may see staff cuts of 15 to 20 percent. “There is no letting up on the quality and the commitment we have to excellence  —   nothing we’re doing will be discernible or visible to the public,” said Daniel H. Weiss, the Met’s president and chief operating officer. “We’re planning to streamline our budgets but not to diminish our mission. ” These significant cuts in staff come as some are questioning the museum’s direction under Thomas P. Campbell. It has faced not only layoffs, but also a ballooning deficit of $10 million this year, and a pause in work on a $600 million new wing dedicated to Modern and contemporary art. The museum also underwent a $3 million rebranding, which was widely derided. In addition, the Met’s   lease of the former Madison Avenue home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, now known as the Met Breuer, has proved to be expensive, soaking up about $17 million in yearly operating expenses in addition to an estimated $15 million building renovation. Given the Met’s annual attendance of more than six million, annual operating budget of $300 million and endowment of nearly $3 billion, any cracks in its foundation are surprising. But, Mr. Campbell insisted, “We’re not in a crisis. ” “The Met is a very strong institution firing on all cylinders,” he said, adding that the museum had to establish “a fiscally sustainable budget over the long term. ” In response to the buyout offer in April, 56 staff members signed up, out of 159 eligible employees  —   those 55 years or older who had served for at least 15 years. Among those taking it is Carrie Rebora Barratt, the Met’s deputy director for collections and administration. The Met would not release or confirm other names. In June, three   employees, including the Met’s first chief digital officer, Sree Sreenivasan, stepped down from their posts. The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum also recently announced buyouts. The Met’s roughly $10 million deficit this year, officials have said, would almost certainly rise to as much as $40 million if the museum failed to, as Mr. Weiss put it, “dial back. ” Mr. Weiss  —   formerly the president of Haverford College who came to the Met last year  —   appears to be overseeing the  . “I was brought in to be the chief operating officer of the museum,” Mr. Weiss said. “I’m making the corrections I need to make to fulfill that responsibility. ” Mr. Campbell, its director and chief executive since 2009, said that he and Mr. Weiss “will be working together” in making layoff decisions and that departures were to be expected at an institution with 55 departments and 2, 300 employees. “The   assumption when people write about attrition is often fear of some kind of a brain drain  —   I want to push back against that really robustly,” Mr. Campbell said. “Inevitably, people come, people go. ” The number of annual exhibitions over the next few years will also be curtailed to reduce costs, perhaps to 40 from 55, Mr. Campbell said. For example, the museum has postponed by a year a major show on Versailles. “We’ll be stretching out and slimming down the numbers of exhibitions,” Mr. Campbell said, “but not compromising the quality and the content. ” He said that would make the museum “more manageable” for general visitors. “We have seen considerable growth in installations and exhibitions,” he added. “We’re very conscious that it’s too much. ” Some have questioned Mr. Campbell’s decision to devote significant resources to the Met Breuer. While shows there have received positive reviews, attendance often seems sparse. But the museum said that Met Breuer attendance  —   185, 000 visitors in the first four months (March 1 through June 30)  —   exceeds initial projections of 155, 000. “We obviously hope we can grow those in the future,” Mr. Campbell said of the numbers of visitors, “but we’re very satisfied with the attendance to date. ” The Met also consistently makes the point that it has raised operating funds separately for the Met Breuer, though donations are arguably coming from donors who would give to the Met regardless. The Met is working to lift its revenues, particularly in its retail operations, which declined by between $3 million and $4 million over the last year. Mr. Weiss said the retail numbers had already improved. “We are putting greater emphasis on our publications and some of our more distinctive merchandise,” Mr. Weiss said. The museum’s executives said that restructuring is a continuing process, all to create a leaner Met. Asked how the Met  —   with its board of several financiers  —   failed to anticipate the $8. 5 million annual debt service on $250 million in bonds issued for capital infrastructure work (one of the reasons given for its deficit) Mr. Weiss said that arrangement had been made before he started. And Mr. Campbell said that the Met is “still learning. ” “What we have to emphasize is, we’re a big institution,” he said. “Turning around in the ocean takes time. ”",0
6918,"Michael Hubbard, Alabama House Speaker, Is Convicted on 12 Felony Ethics Charges - The New York Times","Michael G. Hubbard, the speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, whose   approach to politics propelled the Republican Party to dominance in his state, was convicted Friday on 12 felony ethics charges, leaving him stripped of power and facing the possibility of decades in prison. The verdict, at the end of Mr. Hubbard’s trial in the Lee County Circuit Court, deepened the political crisis in Alabama, where some of the most influential state officials are facing inquiries and threats of ouster. In recent weeks, the troubles of Mr. Hubbard, who had wielded a level of influence that easily rivaled Gov. Robert Bentley’s power, played out in public as prosecutors portrayed him as financially desperate, privately frustrated and criminally culpable for misconduct under the very ethics law he had helped to strengthen. Although jurors acquitted Mr. Hubbard on 11 counts, his conviction on the remaining dozen charges prompted his removal as the leader of the House. Mr. Hubbard, who was convicted of improperly soliciting benefits from lobbyists and voting in favor of a measure that helped a company for which he consulted, faces up to 20 years in prison on each count. “We hope that this verdict tonight will restore some of the confidence of the people in the state of Alabama,” said W. Van Davis, who oversaw the public corruption inquiry that led to Mr. Hubbard’s indictment in October 2014. Mr. Hubbard, 54, had denounced the indictment from almost the moment it was released, and he and his lawyers argued that he had done nothing illegal, particularly because some of the lobbyists with whom he communicated were personal friends. The charges, they said, amounted to a political assault on a   elected official who often seemed to have as many enemies in the capital as he did friends. Mr. Hubbard intends to appeal, but he is expected to be sentenced next month. His conviction and automatic ouster immediately increased the political turmoil that had shadowed Alabama for months, and made it something of a punch line. The chief justice of the State Supreme Court, Roy S. Moore, could be removed from office this year because of his efforts to resist   marriage, and Mr. Bentley is a subject of impeachment proceedings over an improper relationship with an aide, as well as federal and state inquiries. “It’s a sad day in the state because people have a distrust in government when you look around all three branches,” State Senator Cam Ward, a Republican, said in an interview after the verdict was announced. “This kind of affirms what people have been thinking. ” Mr. Bentley declined to comment through a spokeswoman, but the state’s attorney general, Luther Strange, also a Republican, welcomed the verdict. “This is a good day for the rule of law in our state,” said Mr. Strange, who added that the decision “should send a clear message that in Alabama, we hold public officials accountable for their actions. ” After the verdict, The Associated Press reported, Mr. Hubbard spoke with his team of lawyers, including a former lieutenant governor, before a deputy escorted him from the courtroom. Jurors began their deliberations Friday afternoon and worked into the night, punctuating a trial in Opelika that was notable as both a public spectacle and a clinic about the practice of power in a Southern state with a long history of corruption prosecutions. Witnesses described regular meetings between Mr. Hubbard and lobbyists, and they spoke of how he had sent emails essentially pleading for consulting work. Mr. Hubbard’s emails were flashed onto a screen and dissected while he sat between his lawyers. Mr. Bentley testified, as did former Gov. Bob Riley, whose appearance became so tense that a prosecutor asked that he be deemed a hostile witness. (Judge Jacob A. Walker III, who will sentence Mr. Hubbard, declined to make such a declaration.) Business leaders also appeared as witnesses  —   and were asked to discuss why they had each invested $150, 000 in Mr. Hubbard’s struggling printing company  —   and so did a former state senator, who testified under an immunity agreement. Prosecutors said Mr. Hubbard had abused the power of his office. “He just didn’t want to be held accountable to the law,” a prosecutor, Matt Hart, said last month in his opening statement. Defense lawyers, who called Mr. Hubbard as their only witness, argued that he had taken steps to ensure that he complied with ethics standards and that his efforts to find work were permissible because he had contacted longtime friends. “He tried to follow every part of the ethics law,” a defense lawyer, Bill Baxley, said in the first hours of the trial. Mr. Hubbard’s prosecution was a crucial test for the ethics law, which Republicans had championed after they, under Mr. Hubbard’s leadership, took control of the Legislature in 2010. “This legislation that was passed in 2010 was needed, and prosecutors used it to convict based on violations of the law,” said Paul DeMarco, a former Republican lawmaker. “This may be a black eye on the state of Alabama, but I think all eyes will be on the Alabama Legislature now. ” Addressing reporters outside the courthouse on Friday, Mr. Davis would not discuss other public corruption investigations. “This is probably the first time in recent history that someone at this level in state government has been prosecuted,” he said in an apparent reference to cases brought by Alabama officials. “For that reason, I think it makes a statement. ”",0

Really?’ - Breitbart","On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” veteran columnist Mike Barnicle said, “Now, the delegitimization of the presidency is taking hold within the country, within ordinary people, looking at the presidency, a position they once revered and held on a higher pedestal.

But this presidency, you can make a case, I think, for one additional step. in addition to delegitimizing the presidency among political people, largely that occurred.

A YouTube video that's making the rounds appears to show a man being beaten and robbed in the middle of the street by a group laughing and shouting that he voted for Trump. 
In the clip (below), what appears to be a middle-aged white man is on the ground while two younger black males are hitting and kicking him in the head. The camera person yells, ""Happens when you vote Trump, dummy,"" while a woman next to him shouts, ""You voted Trump? You voted Trump? Damn! Yeah, he voted Trump! Damn!"" 


The man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. 
""Get out of my car,"" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, ""You're gonna pay for my shit!"" One of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. 
The camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, ""Beat his ass! Don't vote Trump! Don't vote Trump!"" 
The video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. 
In the longer version of the video (below) posted on Twitter, one of the attackers gets into the driver's seat and closes the door. The beaten Trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker. 
The criminal then hits the gas and takes off in the car as the man desperately holds on from outside through the rear door's window while being dragged through the streets.

Marco Rubio ( ) said he “hoped” the Trump would have responded differently “given everything that John Lewis means to our country. ”  Rubio said, “I have tremendous admiration for Congressman Lewis, not only for what he has done but what he stand for, and that remains undiminished. I don’t agree with him that   Trump is illegitimate. I believe it was a legitimate election and that he was elected through that electoral process. I also don’t agree with his decision not to attend the inaugural although it certainly is his right because it is not about   Trump, it’s a peaceful transfer of power which is a distinguishing characteristic of our republic. That said, I also hoped the   would have responded differently given everything that John Lewis means to our country.

6922,"In a Defiant, Angry Speech, Donald Trump Defends Image Seen as Anti-Semitic - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump on Wednesday offered a defiant defense of his campaign’s decision to publish an image widely viewed as    —   saying he regretted deleting it  —   and vigorously reaffirmed his praise of Saddam Hussein, the murderous Iraqi dictator. In the span of 30 minutes, an   Mr. Trump breathed new life into a controversy that was sparked on Saturday by his posting of an image on his Twitter account of a   star next to a picture of Hillary Clinton, with money seeming to rain down in the background. The image was quickly, and broadly, criticized for invoking stereotypes of Jews. Mr. Trump deleted it two hours later, and replaced the star image with a circle. “ ‘You shouldn’t have taken it down,’ ” Mr. Trump recalled telling one of his campaign workers. “I said, ‘Too bad, you should have left it up.’ I would have rather defended it. ” “That’s just a star,” Mr. Trump said repeatedly. It was a striking display of   from a presumptive presidential nominee and underscored the limitations of Mr. Trump’s scattershot approach during the Republican primaries  —   not to mention how difficult he often makes it for his campaign team to control him. The rally in Cincinnati had been promoted by Mr. Trump’s team for two days as a chance for him to give a tryout to a potential running mate, former Speaker Newt Gingrich. Periodically, beginning midway through Mr. Trump’s speech, the crowd chanted Mr. Gingrich’s name, but Mr. Trump did not heed its wishes. Mr. Trump had not discussed the Twitter message at length until Wednesday night, at his rally in Cincinnati, and his remarks seemed to clash with those of his    Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, who earlier in the day had defended Mr. Trump in an unusual and candid   article, suggesting that the Twitter post was “careless. ” The attention paid to the controversy had begun to die down by the time Mr. Trump took the stage, and he began to read from notes about the criticism leveled against Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday by the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey. But within 20 minutes, Mr. Trump tossed his notes aside and moved on to topics closer to home  —   the criticism he had received for his praise of Saddam Hussein at a rally Tuesday night in Raleigh, N. C. Mr. Trump reiterated his belief that Hussein was “bad,” but effective at killing terrorists, despite Hussein’s classification by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. But the bulk of Mr. Trump’s energy was spent on the Twitter post. “They’re racially profiling, they’re profiling, not us,” he said of the news media. Mr. Trump called the news media “dishonest” in the rambling and sometimes   address, in which he hopscotched from one topic to another. He angrily lamented his treatment at the hands of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, which he called a “crooked, crooked, disgusting group. ” Raising his voice to a hoarse shout, he complained that the Clinton campaign had released an ad showing Mr. Trump playing golf, though he said he did not play golf on his recent trip to Scotland. “The picture was from two years before,” Mr. Trump said. “At a different course!” He also noted, in a calmer tone, that the clip used by the Clinton campaign made him look thin. “The swing,” he added, “actually looked good. ” At one point, Mr. Trump lamented that his youngest child, Barron, “draws stars all over the place. ” He continued, “I never said, ‘That’s the Star of David, Barron, don’t!’ ” At another, he swatted at a mosquito that landed on his lectern and said he never liked the insects, before adding, “Speaking of mosquitoes, hello, Hillary. How are you doing?” Hours earlier, the deeply private Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, wrote the   article in which he described the “Donald Trump I know. ” Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner wrote, is not an  . He also described his family’s experiences during the Holocaust, adding: “I go into these details, which I have never discussed, because it’s important to me that people understand where I’m coming from when I report that I know the difference between actual, dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points. ” Mr. Kushner obliquely acknowledged that the Star of David post was a mistake, but cited it as evidence of the refreshing originality of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “If my father in law’s   team was careless in choosing an image to retweet, well part of the reason it’s so shocking is that it’s the actual candidate communicating with the American public rather than the armies of handlers who   ordinary candidates’ every move,” he wrote. But Mr. Trump said several times on Wednesday that he saw nothing wrong with the image. In an interview shortly before the rally, Mr. Trump said, “I didn’t want to delete it  —   I would have never deleted it. My people deleted it before they told me about it, they did it because of the sensibilities and sensitivities. But when I looked at it, I thought that’s a star. I never thought, that’s the Star of David. ”",0
6923,America’s Inequality Problem: Real Income Gains Are Brief and Hard to Find - The New York Times,"Working families finally got a raise. Early on Tuesday, the Census Bureau provided some   good news for the beleaguered working class: The income of the typical American household perched on the middle rung of the income ladder increased a hearty 5. 2 percent in 2015, the first real increase since 2007, the year before the economy sank into recession. Households all the way down the income scale made more money last year. The average incomes of the poorest fifth of the population increased 6. 6 percent after three consecutive years of decline. And the official poverty rate declined to 13. 5 percent from 14. 8 percent in 2014, the sharpest decline since the late 1960s. The numbers are heartening, confirming that the sluggish yet consistent recovery of the American economy has finally begun to lift all boats. They fit the story coming from the job market, which is about as tight as it has been in a very long time. They follow rises in the minimum wage across many states and municipalities. “This shows the importance of robust labor markets,” said Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “If   Americans are going to get ahead, it is through a paycheck. ” And yet this positive news  —   while clearly undermining Donald J. Trump’s unbridled pessimism about the American economy  —   does not justify unbridled celebration, either. “The next question is why did it take such a long time for things to look good?” said Arloc Sherman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a   policy analysis group. As Sheldon H. Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation put it, it’s great news that men’s earnings from work increased 1. 5 percent. But they are still lower than in the 1970s. The answer does not just involve sluggish growth. It is also about its distribution. Gains may be finally trickling down to those at the bottom of the ladder. But the numbers still offer a lopsided picture, with a gargantuan share of income rising to the top. While the bottom fifth of households increased their share of the nation’s income, by the census’s definition, to 3. 4 percent from 3. 3 percent, the richest 5 percent kept 21. 8 percent of the pie, the same as in 2014. “There’s an inequality problem,” Mr. Sherman added. Against the backdrop of the last few decades, the income gains revealed on Tuesday underscore how difficult the American economy has made it for average workers to get ahead. In nearly every successive economic cycle, progress came slower and harder than in the previous one. The data, which measured how Americans were doing six years into the economic recovery, show that incomes in the middle, measured in 2015 dollars, were still 1. 6 percent below the previous peak of $57, 423 a household, which was attained in 2007, just before the economy sank into what has come to be known as the Great Recession. How does that look compared to the nation’s recent history? After the economy slipped into recession in 1969, it took only three years for incomes in the middle to rebound and surpass their previous peak. After the downturn of 1973, it took five after    recessions in 1981 and 1982, it took seven. And, except for the long expansion that ran from 1991 through 2000, it has been getting worse. The economic growth from late 2001 to about the end of 2007 never even managed to deliver incomes above the previous peak for the typical household, reached near the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency. The expansion underway today may not get there, either. Today, median household incomes are still 2. 4 percent below the absolute peak they hit in 1999  —   when Facebook had yet to come into existence, the big news in the music business was Napster, and the good times in Silicon Valley were about to come crashing down with the collapse of the   bubble. At the bottom of the ladder, households at the 10th percentile  —   those poorer than 90 percent of the population  —   are still a bit poorer than they were in 1989. Americans have managed to develop an internet economy, invent social media and build driverless cars since then, but not to improve the lot of those at the bottom. What’s more, changes starting in 2013 in the way the census asks people about their incomes can distort comparisons with previous years. After adjusting the data for these changes, according to Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute, the income of American households in the middle of the distribution last year was still 4. 6 percent below its level in 2007 and 5. 4 percent below where it was in 1999. Of course, the Census Bureau’s numbers on income and poverty don’t add up to a perfect representation of families’ means. For one thing, they include only “money income”  —   excluding   government benefits like housing vouchers or food stamps. They don’t include the impact of taxes, ignoring the   tax credit, which provides substantial help to families with low earnings. The official poverty line, moreover, is assessed using a basket of necessities defined in the 1960s  —   which has little to do with people’s lives today. Over the last few years the census has also published an alternative Supplemental Poverty Measure  —   which keeps a better tab on Americans’ income and expenditures. Using that count, poverty dipped to 14. 3 percent, the lowest level since the census began compiling it in 2009. Analysts like Scott Winship of the   Manhattan Institute have argued for some time that   income numbers, like those published by the Congressional Budget Office, suggest that Americans in the middle of the income distribution and below have not done badly over recent decades. He concludes that the best strategy to promote the welfare of working Americans is to focus on improving overall economic growth. The fixation with inequality and income distribution, he says, will produce bad policy. The current census data does suggest that growth can ultimately bring prosperity to average Americans. Still, it also points to the persistence of wide inequality as being at the center of the story. Across the entire bottom 60 percent of the distribution, households are taking home a smaller slice of the pie than they did in the 1960s and 1970s. The 3. 4 percent of income that households in the bottom fifth took home last year was less than the 5. 8 percent they had in 1974. With their share shrinking with almost every economic cycle, it is hardly a surprise that it takes longer for them to experience any income gains at all. Growth, alone, is not adding to their prosperity as it once did. By contrast, households in the top 5 percent have profited nicely from America’s expansions. In 2015, they took in $350, 870, on average. That is 4. 9 percent more than in 1999 and 37. 5 percent more than in 1989. Historical precedent suggests the latest economic expansion is getting long in the tooth. Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser in President Obama’s first term, says there are better than even odds today that the United States will tip into a recession within three years. In July, Deutsche Bank said the probability of a recession within the next 12 months had jumped to 60 percent, the highest since August 2008. JPMorgan thinks the odds are 37 percent. For all but Americans at the very top, that means that the punch bowl may well be taken away again before the party really gets going. That is not how a   economy should work.",0

6925,Trump to ‘Clamp Down’ On Immigration Through ‘Merit-Based’ System,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —     Donald Trump’s first act as president will reportedly be to “clamp down” on the country’s immigration system and refugee resettlement program, while enforcing a “ ” method, focusing on skilled workers. [In a new piece by the LA Times, the   newspaper says Trump will immediately focus on the broken immigration system, both legal and illegal, just as his campaign for president promised:  Gone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally. In their place, expect to see images on the evening news of workplace raids as Trump sends a message that he is wasting no time on his promised crackdown. The LA Times cites Trump spokesman Sean Spicer’s statement on immigration as an indication that the incoming administration will not take a backseat to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the issue. “We need to get control of our borders and we need to get control of our immigration system, and we can do it in a very smart and methodical way that ensures that the priority is first and foremost people who seek to cause us harm or who are a danger in a community,” Spicer told the LA Times. The LA Times also noted Trump’s widespread powers as president over the country’s immigration system, writing that “Trump can act on immigration without Congress”: Taken together, the actions would result in a significant shift in how immigration law is enforced, which could itself create a ripple effect that alters the immigration pool and how the 11 million or so in the U. S. illegally live their lives. Unlike some of his other   plans, such as replacing Obamacare, Trump can act on immigration without Congress under the president’s wide legal authority to control borders. “We’re going to move very quickly on the border,” Vice   Mike Pence told NBC News on Wednesday, saying Trump could even use his executive power to start on his chief immigration pledge  —   building a wall along the border with Mexico. That   on immigration could come via a   immigration system, which would mean less   immigrants and more   workers to take jobs that cannot be filled from the country’s native population, POLITICO reported. “We’re going to have great people and people of great talent coming into our country,” Trump said in an interview with Fox  Friends. “And if you can think of this, some of the Silicon Valley companies want to build up in Canada, because in Canada, they’re able to get the people that they need and they can’t get them in this country because we don’t allow them in this country. ” “So we’re going to take care of a lot of situations,” Trump continued, referring the country’s immigration system. “And we’re going to have a lot of heart, believe me. It’s going to be a heart almost as big as yours. ” The   immigration plan could be trotted out by the incoming Trump administration “over the next two to three months,” as he noted in the interview. Immigration groups like NumbersUSA heralded the potential   system, saying that it would favor giving legal immigrant residence to individuals who fill jobs, rather than the current system which favors family members of immigrants already living in the U. S. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.",0
6926,A una chica se le sincroniza el Mac con la regla,"A una chica se le sincroniza el Mac con la regla DURANTE EL PERIODO, EL ORDENADOR DESACTIVA LA CÁMARA PORQUE NO QUIERE VER A NADIE Siri 
A Marisa Puertas, una joven de 27 años natural de Torrelodones, se le ha sincronizado el Mac con la regla. Esta vecina de la Comunidad de Madrid, clienta de Apple desde hace dos años, comenzó a sospechar que algo raro pasaba en sus últimas menstruaciones cuando Siri empezó a responderle con escuetos monosílabos. “Noté que tenía menos paciencia y que estaba muy irritada, como yo”, explica la joven. 
Marisa, acostumbrada ya a que su regla se sincronice con la de todos sus dispositivos, agradece sentirse más acompañada en esos días del mes. “Nunca me quedo sin tampones porque Siri me recuerda que los compre ya que ella también los necesita”, explica encantada. 
Reconoce, eso sí, que los días que tiene la regla el Mac funciona mucho más lento y es mejor no agobiarlo con demasiadas peticiones. “Se pasa todo el día en modo hibernación”, lamenta Marisa. “Es como tener un PC durante cinco días al mes”, añade. Durante la menstruación, el sistema operativo sufre desarreglos en sus procesos de ejecución y también desactiva la cámara porque no quiere ver a nadie. 
“A veces rescata fotos de mi ex pareja y me recuerda que hay que comprar helado de chocolate”, explica Puertas. “Y se pone a buscar en Google a qué huele la nube”, dice. 
Apple ha admitido esta semana que la menstruación de sus dispositivos “es un proceso natural del que no hay que avergonzarse” y que puede traducirse en una mayor sensibilidad de la pantalla táctil y un mayor consumo de batería. La compañía recomienda que, durante el periodo, se guarde el dispositivo en el sofá, sin enlazar con otros dispositivos “y bien tapadito con su funda”.",0

6928,Sean Spicer: Obama Administration Gave Mike Flynn His Security Clearance - Breitbart,"The White House on Thursday said the Obama administration was responsible for issuing former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn a security clearance in 2016, amid news of a Pentagon inspector general investigation into a trip he took to Russia in 2015. [“His clearance was last reissued by the Obama administration in 2016 with full knowledge of his activities that occurred in 2015,” Spicer said.  News broke on Thursday that the Defense Intelligence Agency’s inspector general is investigating into whether Flynn was improperly paid by Russia Today, a government entity, for a speech he gave in Russia in 2015 before he joined the administration. “So the issue is, you know, he was issued a security clearance under the Obama administration in the spring of 2016. The trip and  —   and transactions that you’re referring to occurred in December of 2015, from what I understand,” Spicer said. “Obviously, there’s an issue that  —   that, as you point out, the Department of Defense inspector general’s looking into. We welcome that,” he said. Reporters at Thursday’s White House press briefing repeatedly questioned Spicer whether the White House was satisfied with its vetting of Flynn before he became the national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn  —   a retired   Army general who had led the Defense Intelligence Agency  —   “was a career military officer who maintained a   security clearance throughout his career in the military” and that his clearance had been reissued by the Obama administration in 2016 after Flynn’s trip to Russia. Spicer said that someone with a top security clearance only has to fill out a form known as the   every five years. “In between that period, you’re responsible for updating the information that you’ve provided in accordance with the agency that issued that,” he said. “When General Flynn came into the White House, he had an active security clearance that was issued during the Obama administration with all of the information that’s being discussed that occurred in 2015,” he said. The press secretary compared the situation to reporters not having to get their backgrounds rechecked for clearance to the White House when a new administration comes in: When you applied to come here to this briefing room as a member of the press, you applied you filled out certain forms with the Secret Service to have your background run. When I came in here on January 20th, the people that had been cleared the day before were cleared on the 20th, the 21st and et cetera. We didn’t   your background. We trust that when you were cleared the first time, whether if you were cleared on, you know, December 15th or January 20th, that you were still  —   that your background check still cleared. Every individual who came into this White House either applied for a security clearance or had one. Everyone in the government goes through the same   process  —   every single person. And so why would you   a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a   security clearance? That’s it. It doesn’t  —   there’s no difference between administrations when you come in from one, they   it. You  —   they  —   the reason they grant them for five years is that it’s a very extensive background where they check your contacts, your places of residence, your employment. They go out in the field. They do a lot of that work. And then you are required to maintain updates to that clearance. They readjudicate it every five years. That occurred in this case. And now the Department of Defense inspector general is looking into it. As to whether President Trump made the right decision to fire Flynn in February, after it came to light he had discussed U. S. sanctions on Russia when he told Vice President Mike Pence he hadn’t, Spicer said it was the right call. “I think the president made the right call at the right time, and it’s clearly paid off,” he said. The House Oversight Committee is looking into whether Flynn misled the government about his speaking engagements and payments from foreign governments before he became national security advisor. Spicer said he referred the committee to the Defense Department for documents related to Flynn’s security clearance, since they were the issuing agency. Spicer said requests for copies of his speaking engagements were referred to a speakers’ bureau, and they did have information on foreign contacts before his time at the White House. “I think we have complied with every document that they’ve looked for,” Spicer said.",0

6930,South Carolina Law on Disrupting School Faces Legal Challenge - The New York Times,"The video was startling and soon went viral: A white sheriff’s deputy in a South Carolina high school drags a black girl from her desk, slams her to the floor and then handcuffs her. The girl’s crime? She had refused a teacher’s order to put away her cellphone, then refused an order to leave the classroom. Taped by her fellow students at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, that jolting encounter last October was widely condemned as police overkill. It led to the officer’s rapid dismissal, a federal civil rights investigation and national reflection on the line between youthful misbehavior and criminal activity, and on the proper role of police in the schools. But the episode also threw into relief South Carolina’s “disturbing schools” law, which makes it a crime “to disturb in any way or in any place the students or teachers of any school” or “to act in an obnoxious manner. ” Now that law, which some legal experts say may be the broadest and vaguest of its kind in the country, is being challenged in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday. One of the plaintiffs is Niya Kenny, a classmate of the defiant girl in the video, who stood and yelled curses at the officer for his rough behavior. Both girls were arrested and charged with disrupting class. In an interview this week, Ms. Kenny, now 18, described her turmoil as she was handcuffed at school and taken in a paddy wagon to spend several hours at an adult detention center where she was fingerprinted and had a mug shot taken  —   all, she said, because she stood up for her classmate. “I was just terrified through the whole day,” she recalled. According to Ms. Kenny’s account and the police report of her arrest, she did nothing to physically interfere with the sheriff’s deputy as he grabbed and slammed her classmate. “I was cursing at him and saying it was unfair,” she recalled. More than 1, 200 students, disproportionately black, are arrested under this law each year, according to state data, for everything from disobeying a teacher’s order to fighting in the hallway. For many, like Ms. Kenny, it means a first, stinging encounter with the criminal justice system, bringing the stigma of an arrest record and often derailing their schooling  —   a potential step in what has been described nationally as a pernicious “schools to prison pipeline. ” With its vague evocation of criminal acts, the law “creates an impossible standard for school children to follow and for police to enforce with consistency and fairness,” according to the suit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of several students. The statute “sweeps within the purview of criminal law and the court system a broad swath of adolescent behavior,” according to the complaint, filed in the Charleston division of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. It asks that the law be thrown out as an unconstitutional violation of due process under the 14th Amendment. Matt Orr, a spokesman for the South Carolina attorney general’s office, said Thursday that officials were reviewing the complaint and could not comment further on pending litigation. Students through age 16 are charged under the law as juveniles, their cases handled in family court. Those who are 17 or older are charged as adults.   students are four times as likely as white students to be charged, state records indicate, and across the state, as a result of the vagueness in the law, the same act can draw a verbal warning in one school and a criminal charge in another. Conviction can result in detention of up to 90 days and a $1, 000 fine, but the more common results are diversion to counseling, probation or placement in special disciplinary schools. While about 18 states have laws covering disruption of schools, most focus on acts by nonstudents or more precisely defined criminal acts, said Josh   an expert on juvenile justice at the University of South Carolina School of Law. “South Carolina’s law is broader than what you see in other states,” he said. Criminalizing matters of school discipline can have destructive lifelong effects on young people, Mr.   noted, citing evidence that when children are arrested and have even a single court appearance they are less likely to graduate from high school and more likely to have further brushes with the law. In the October encounter, the girl dragged from her desk was a juvenile and the status of her prosecution is confidential. But Ms. Kenny was 17  —   an adult in state criminal court  —   so her case is in the public record. She did not expect the deputy to follow through on his threat to arrest her, she said, but when he   the classroom moments after taking out the first girl, she stood up and put her hands behind her back, submitting to cuffing without a struggle. She said that she cried and her knees buckled as she walked past teachers and other students to the paddy wagon. After the arrest, a school official told her mother that she would probably be expelled. In the end she was not, but she felt “humiliated and fearful of returning to school,” she said, and her mother also advised against returning to a place where she could be arrested for no reason. She withdrew and obtained a G. E. D. at an adult education center. “Because of this incident, I missed out on my last year of high school,” she said in a statement appended to the lawsuit. “I did not have the opportunity to go the prom with the people I have been in school with since the ninth grade, and I did not get to attend graduation with my classmates. ” The charge against Ms. Kenny is pending in court, with a hearing scheduled in September. Outrage over the October episode led to efforts this spring to amend the disputed   law. A proposal sponsored by State Representative Mia S. McLeod, Democrat of Richland County, would apply penalties to outsiders who disrupt schools, but not to existing students. “Law enforcement officers should be called in to deal with real criminal acts, not ordinary disciplinary issues,” Ms. McLeod said in an interview. Her bill gained bipartisan support but stalled when a prosecutor and a sheriff’s group defended the law as a necessary tool in an era when more children refuse to obey the rules. Jarrod Bruder, the executive director of the state sheriffs association, told legislators that while the definition of disturbing schools should be sharpened, the law allowed officers to arrest misbehaving students on minor charges rather than considering more serious charges like assault. Ms. McLeod is now running for the State Senate for the district that includes Spring Valley High School. She said she hoped to revive the bill next year. Even as debate continues over the criminal law, state education officials, in another response to the October encounter, are developing new guidelines for   police officers and disciplinary procedures. On Tuesday, after months of deliberations by an advisory group, the State Board of Education gave tentative approval to a plan that would limit officers’ involvement in disciplinary issues that do not involve serious crimes or threats to safety, and provide new rankings for student infractions and appropriate punishments. The proposed changes could go before the General Assembly next year.",0
6931,Voter Turnout High in First Round of French Presidential Elections,"PARIS (AP)  —   France’s Interior Ministry says the voter turnout so far in the first round of the presidential election is about the same as it was in 2012, when turnout was high. [At midday Sunday (local time) the ministry said that 28. 54 percent of eligible voters had cast their ballot, compared with 28. 29 percent in 2012.  Commentators have said a low voter turnout would benefit   candidate Marine Le Pen, whose voters are seen to have more enthusiasm and are more certain to vote in a low turnout election than supporters of some other candidates. Outgoing French President Francois Hollande has said the best message of this election would be “to show democracy is stronger than anything” by going out to vote. Hollande, who is not standing for   oversaw tight security measures for Sunday’s first round poll to help prevent disruption after Thursday’s deadly attack on the  . His government mobilized over 50, 000 police and gendarmes to protect polling stations. Voting in his political fiefdom of Tulle in Correze, southwestern France, Hollande said that “we are in such a time, and sadly it’s nothing new and not about to end now, when we must mobilize a lot of means. ” He called the measures a “guarantee to the French people this fundamental right of choosing their future. ” In Montreal, Canada, thousands of resident French nationals have waited in lines that snaked at one point to eight blocks to cast their votes in France’s presidential election. Polls opened Saturday morning in Canada’s main French speaking city, home to Quebec’s highest population of French nationals. French citizens lined up to vote at Montreal’s only polling station at Stanislas College in Outremont. The vote in mainland France is happening Sunday, but polling stations in France’s   overseas territories and in embassies around the world opened on Saturday to allow enough time to collate the vote results altogether.

6932,The Ugly Truth Of Six More Leftist “Heroes”,"Earlier I skewered nine dictators, thugs, demagogues, and politicians adored by leftists despite considerable failings in policy, ethics, and hygiene. Here are six more over-hyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
How the world remembers: FDR led America through the Great Depression and WWII, remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats.
The ugly truth: Some economists argue that FDR’s measures prolonged the Great Depression . All the New Deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional, except Social Security. He got the Supreme Court to back off by threatening to pack the Court with more members with views to his liking. That restrained their judicial opinion, though the Constitution doesn’t grant Congress the power to create a Federal retirement system.
Social Security works—though it’s slim pickings if it’s a retiree’s only income—and for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting Congressional overspending . However, the aging Baby Boomers who didn’t have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross. Further, the Social Security Number is now a de-facto universal ID number; a convenient database field for monitoring citizens . America’s Founding Fathers would have been appalled at today’s domestic spying , and the Soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy.
FDR pledged to keep the USA out of WWII . Meanwhile, he quietly did everything possible to antagonize Japan, a once-friendly nation, such as (among several items) freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply. When he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, he didn’t order the base to be locked and loaded.
If that wasn’t bad enough: So nearly a quarter million Americans died in battle, but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to “make the world safe for democracy”, right? Unfortunately, FDR was far too friendly with the USSR, giving them nearly $11 billion in food, weaponry, and other supplies (about $119 billion adjusted for inflation).
At the Yalta conference, FDR agreed to let “Uncle Joe” Stalin take over Eastern Europe. General Patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from Soviet tyranny, but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out . When the Iron Curtain rose and the Cold War began, Winston Churchill said, “We slaughtered the wrong pig.” If only Roosevelt had listened to his generals!
FDR wasn’t a Communist, but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were. Later, Joseph McCarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them.
Walter Cronkite 
How the world remembers: He was a long-time CBS anchorman, reporting many triumphs and tragedies. A friendly face on living room TVs for decades, he became everyone’s “Uncle Walter”. According to polls, he was the “most trusted man in America”.
The ugly truth: Although a decent fellow in person, Cronkite was the archetypal big-name liberal journalist , spinning the news for decades. Sometimes it was rather subliminal, including his signature subtle sneer. Most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truth-tellers; as Cronkite’s tagline went, “And that’s the way it is.”
Until Cronkite’s late career, the mainstream media had a veneer of respectability—perhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard, but a veneer nonetheless. There once were only three American corporate TV networks. From Manhattan, they were the public’s information gatekeepers; no other broadcast news (besides shortwave radio) was available. Baby Boomer liberals might get a bit misty-eyed remembering those days. Today, six mega-conglomerates own 90% of the media, but at least the Internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters .
If that wasn’t bad enough : His biggest whopper was about the Tet Offensive. The Viet Cong launched a desperate all-out assault, suffered very heavy losses, mostly it was over within a day, and ultimately the VC gained no territory. However, “the most trusted man in America” gave them a propaganda victory, reporting that the Vietnam War was hopeless. Public opinion promptly turned against the war. Ho Chi Minh should’ve given Cronkite a medal, an honorary VC generalship, and a dozen roses.
Many forget that the 1973 Paris Accords brought peace. Two years later, though, the shaky Ford administration couldn’t persuade Congress to respond appropriately to a Shit Test by North Vietnam. Then they invaded, and Saigon fell. All that’s a long story, but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didn’t help. That affected America’s prestige abroad, along with the lives of millions of South Vietnamese killed or sent to “reeducation camps” .
Allen Ginsberg 
How the world remembers: He was a pioneer of the beatniks, much beloved by the hippies who followed, and lauded with several literary prizes. Some even credit him with basically starting the 1960s counterculture singlehandedly.
The ugly truth: Ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate. He wrote a so-called poem about his sphincter (yes, really) but the rest isn’t much better. Anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as “profound” either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend, believed the hype and didn’t read it, or dropped too much acid.
“Howl”, his best-known poem, begins “I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness”. A brief excerpt (get some brain bleach) describing these “best minds”:
who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism,
who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,
who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,
who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,
who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may, …
Even overlooking the lunacy, buggery, and butthurt, Ginsberg’s “free verse” is stylistically lazy. Back when poetry meant Keats and Kipling, it rhymed and had meter.
He was a noted critic of the USA, for example:
America, I used to be a communist when I was a kid I’m not sorry
Ginsberg visited several Communist countries, getting himself deported from some of them for immorality. He abandoned his ancestral faith for Buddhism and had a Hare Krishna phase. What people believe is up to them, of course, but adding these two things up—along with his wretched poetry—reveals a tortured soul. Rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellion’s sake.
Granted, Ginsberg’s popularity was greatest during the screwed-up “kill your parents” 1960s. Still, what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking? Were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural Marxism running out of talented writers?
If that wasn’t bad enough: Ginsberg joined the North American Man/Boy Love Association, sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf. Explaining in an accurately titled interview—“Politics, Pederasty and Consciousness”—to the Harvard Crimson :
As I get older, having very specialised sexual tastes, it gets harder to make out… I like young boys. Why?… I’d have more chance at making out with younger guys if I were younger, dewier, dewy-limbed.
The media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates, and screeched about Donald Trump’s years-old private locker room talk, but the presstitutes (likewise the lefty “intelligentsia”) fawningly praised Ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys .
Ted Kennedy Best friends forever, east and west
How the world remembers: He was “the Lion of the Senate”, representing Massachusetts from 1962 until his death in 2009. This champion of social justice carried on the Kennedy legacy—hailed as America’s nobility—after his two brothers were tragically slain.
The ugly truth: He was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice, but the suckers kept reelecting him. His lack of character sank way deeper, though; all the way underwater.
After a night of partying on Chappaquiddick Island, Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge. He escaped, but failed to help his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Per one of the investigators, she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours. If he’d ran to a nearby house for help—rather than waiting nine hours to sober up—she would’ve survived. He got a two month suspended sentence, barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter. The judge basically said poor Teddy had suffered enough. (What about how Miss Kopechne suffered?) There’s one set of rules for the elites , and another for us. Shortly thereafter, he tried to spin-doctor it with a “woe is me” shtick. The suckers kept reelecting him, though a Presidential bid was now beyond reach.
As for his many legislative actions, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was the most notorious. He promised the public :
First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same… Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset… Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia…. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think… The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs .
The “Lion of the Senate” was lyin’ his fat ass off! This population replacement policy threatens America’s future , just as the Coudenhove-Kalergi Plan is doing in Europe. Still, the suckers kept reelecting him.
If that wasn’t bad enough: Besides giving away the country to which the Constitution granted “the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity “, Lyin’ Ted was in cahoots with the KGB . He proposed to help his Soviet pal Yuri Andropov with tidying up the USSR’s image problem during the Cold War’s endgame. The damning documents suggested that Walter Cronkite (see above) and Barbara Walters might be used for this effort. Conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on Communism; little did they know how cozy Ted Kennedy was in bed with Comrade Andropov.
John Lennon 
How the world remembers: He was a talented musician, arguably the most prominent of the Beatles. Their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame. Lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play. He’s remembered as a wonderful man, an embodiment of the 1960s (the good parts , anyway), and the conscience of the world.
The ugly truth: Despite Lennon’s considerable talents, not all his songs were excellent. Things slipped with the White Album . (“Revolution 9”, really?) After the Beatles broke up, he started a solo career, often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses. His last album produced during his life—after dragging himself out of a long heroin stupor—was Double Fantasy . Critics at first agreed that it sucked. After a nut shot Lennon, they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant.
Lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics. Granted, everyone has a right to their opinion, but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise. His song “Imagine” is particularly telling. As he put it:
Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,’ is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I’m not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.
Being under the shadow of the Berlin Wall back in their bar gig days should’ve precluded sophomoric posturing like this.
If that wasn’t bad enough: His failings are quite troubling, too numerous to fully detail. One item is abandoning his family the way his own father did. A truly wonderful man wouldn’t do that.
Another item was his extensive substance abuse. He spent 1974 guzzling booze, his “lost weekend”. One night, a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head. Then:
Lennon: “Do you know who I am?”
Waitress: “Yeah, you’re some asshole with a Kotex on his forehead.”
One Lennon biographer asked Timothy Leary, who’d been on hundreds of acid trips, what Lennon’s extreme LSD consumption would do. Leary had no idea! Finally, what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician, much beloved by the public, to get himself strung out on heroin?
Jimmy Carter In this heart-warming scene, Jimmy Carter and Uncle Fidel stand for the Cuban national anthem in Havana
How the world remembers: Carter is praised as a rare honest politician, exemplifying Christian principles and tolerance.
The ugly truth: The economy tanked during the Carter administration: double-digit inflation and high unemployment. Economists are still puzzled by stagflation; normally, unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated. At least Obama gave economists another data point to study.
Carter’s commendably not corrupt, but exemplified bleeding-hearted liberalism. Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize for not being George W. Bush (likewise Al Gore and The Lightworker), Carter was a lackluster embarrassment. He was known for TMI statements, for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart (at least Clinton had the balls to do it for real). He ranked lower than Mr. Whipple on a face recognition survey. The Boston Globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline “More Mush From the Wimp”; finally journalists got something right.
Carter’s shining foreign policy moment was the Camp David Accords, establishing peace between Egypt and Israel. America started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace, which ironically supplies their military. Why? The USA wasn’t even a combatant, aside from the USS Liberty incident which certainly shouldn’t inspire American tribute money. Taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket.
Worse, he badly bungled the Iran hostage crisis. One Iranian official later stated they would’ve released the hostages if the USA had threatened force in the beginning. Yep, Carter failed Iran’s Shit Test. Consequentially, the USA lost tons of international prestige, and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarily.
If that wasn’t bad enough: Carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators . Worse, Clinton trusted him to represent the USA during disarmament talks with North Korea. They gave him the Potemkin village show; he bought it hook, line, and sinker. Yet again, Carter was played for a chump—the USA opened its wallet and gave North Korea aid, and they pinky-swore to stop their nuclear program. Now the Norks have nukes—surprise! Awesome job, Mister Nice Guy!

6933,A Strong Dollar?,"GoldSwitzerland October 27, 2016 
There are a lot of people who are concerned about the performance of gold and the fact that the price after four years of correction is still so far from the high. The mistake that most people make is to measure gold in US dollars. We are seeing currently very temporary dollar strength. But the US$ is a weak currency in a mismanaged economy. Just look at the dollar in Swiss Francs. Since 1970 the dollar has lost 77% against the Swissy. That can hardly be called dollar strength. 
The dollar is a very weak currency 
If we measure the dollar in real money which is gold, of course, the not so mighty dollar has lost 80% in this century. 
So to talk about a strong dollar is totally ridiculous. The dollar is in a long-term downtrend which will continue for many years until it reaches zero. The temporary dollar strength gives the appearance that gold is currently weak. But we must remember that gold should be measured in your home currency and not only in dollars. It is pure laziness that makes non-Americans quote gold in dollars. International media don’t make it easier since they always show the dollar price. 
The US population is less than 5% of world population and most of the remaining 6.7 billion people are not linked to the dollar. If we instead use GDP as a measure, the US represents around 25% of global GDP but that still leaves 3/4 of global GDP which is not dollar based. My point is that gold in dollars is only relevant to a minority of the world and the rest of us should measure gold in our home currency. 
Gold in pounds up 47% in 2016 
Let us look at gold in the UK pounds for example. Any Brit who has kept his money in gold since December 2015 had gained a staggering 47% in the last ten months. Had he instead kept his money in the UK stock market, he would have made just 13% which is 1/4 of the gain he could have made in gold. 
The chart of gold in pounds below is an excellent example of the wealth preservation properties of gold. When a currency weakens, most investors don’t realize how much real value this is costing them. As opposed to most governments, gold tells the truth and the truth is that for UK citizens, their currency has lost a huge 1/3 of its purchasing power in the last 10 months measured in gold. 
But it is not just gold’s performance in pounds this year which is significant. Since 1999, gold in pounds is up 6.6x. That means that the pound has lost 85% of its purchasing power when measured in gold. During the same period, the FTSE100 index has gone nowhere since it is today at the same level as it was in 1999. 
UK stock market investors are deluding themselves when they believe they have preserved capital with a market that has gone sideways for 17 years when in real money – gold – they could have made almost seven times their investment. Also, since most investors around the world only look at the gold price in dollars, they believe that gold is far from the 2011 highs. But looking at the chart above, gold in pounds, for example, is only 8% from the September 2011 peak. 
Few UK investors, and that includes institutional investors, realize that if they had just kept their funds in real money – gold – for the last 17 years, they would have outperformed all other asset classes. That trend will continue for many years as all the bubble assets such as stocks, bonds and property will lose another 50-90% against gold.",0

6935,Ukraine's economy is further away from European standards than ever,"November 21, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


On November 21st, Ukrainian President Poroshenko admitted that Ukrainians' quality of life has not improved over the three years since the events on the Maidan and is still far from European standards. However, he did find an excuse for his failed economic policies, explaining the failures of Ukraine’s economy by “objective factors” and the need to spend more than 5% of GDP on “the defense and security sector and the creation of a new army.”  
In addition, Poroshenko tried to shift the blame onto his predecessors, saying that economic reforms necessary to ensure the necessary growth of the economy had not been pursued in the country for a long time. 
The Euromaidan, as we remember, stood under one main slogan: joining the EU, which the “criminal regime” of President Yanukovych hindered. After nearly 3 years since the victory of the Maidan and the overthrow of the “criminal” government, no one is waiting for Ukraine in the EU and Ukrainians’ living standards have declined dramatically. 
Poroshenko, however, still found positive changes in the life of Ukraine. A bit earlier, on November 20th, he stated that for the first time in several years, namely after 14 quarters of decline, the country noted a growth in the economy. He called the International Monetary Fund’s aid to the Ukrainian state the defining moment behind this. Moreover, Poroshenko promised to significantly raise wages in the near future, particularly for doctors, teachers, and other public sector workers. Poroshenko compared the Ukrainian economy with a patient finally leaving the hospital and going on the mend.  
Ukraine’s economy is, in my opinion, most likely not recovering, but is a stably critically ill patient. If any improvements happen, then they affect only certain industries that have very little growth. If we take longer periods and the entire economy as a whole, then the Ukrainian economy does not demonstrate any positive outlook. This was recognized by the ex-governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, according to whom Ukraine needs at least 15 years to regain the level of development it had under President Yanukovych. Poroshenko’s promises that the money provided by the IMF will bring social benefits sound like pure populism, or more like demagoguery.  
The IMF loan is too relatively small to have any significant impact on the macroeconomic situation in this country of 40 million (according to inflated official figures) with a depressed economy and enormous social burden (over 12 million Ukrainians are pensioners).  
Ukrainian experts themselves have noted that the lion’s share of the loan will go, first of all, to service debt, and, secondly, to infrastructural reform. Ukraine will see no real spending money from the IMF, as such is largely means provided to service debt problems. Poroshenko, like an experienced businessman setting up a new business, is openly lying when he says otherwise. 
A number of Ukrainian experts suggest that the IMF money is needed by Kiev for political concerns. When getting money, the government never forgets to remind everyone that as long as the loans are coming in, this means that the West has not ditched them.  
As calculated by the executive director of Blazer International Fund, Oleg Ustenko, Kiev is already forced to allocate 5% of its entire GDP to covering debt. In order for the economy to show growth, it would have to grow at a rate above 5%, otherwise GDP will decline.  

Poroshenko also compared the reforms supposedly underway in Ukraine to those carried out in Central and Eastern European countries. This analogy makes sense. The results of these reforms, which liberal experts consider successful, essentially transitioned the economies and financial systems of the socialist camp countries to the control of Western companies and transnational corporations. Therein, the countries of the former socialist camp lost their economic sovereignty.  
When Poroshenko compares supposedly successful reforms in Ukraine with the “successful” reforms in these European countries, he is right in only one  aspect: Ukrainians too will lose  their right to their own property and resources.

6936,"As U.K. Tightens Voting Rules, Critics Say Labour and the Poor Will Suffer - The New York Times","LONDON  —   The British government announced plans on Tuesday to crack down on voter fraud by requiring voters to show official identification at polling stations, tightening rules on absentee ballots and preventing political activists from handling absentee ballots. While some critics argued that fraud was not widespread and that the plans would hit the opposition Labour Party and the poor the hardest, the government minister in charge, Chris Skidmore, said that the new measures would “protect anyone who is at risk of being bullied, undermined or tricked out of their vote, and their democratic right. ” The government had commissioned a report on fraud after a scandal in Tower Hamlets, a borough in East London, where the elected mayor was stripped of his office last year and found guilty of corrupt practices involving voting fraud. The report was compiled by a former cabinet minister, Eric Pickles, who called Tower Hamlets a “  call” when introducing it. “There are sometimes challenging issues over divisive community politics and   polarization, but this is no excuse for failing to enforce British law and protect the integrity of our democratic process,” he concluded in the report. In his report, he cited research suggesting that certain Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities could be more vulnerable to fraud. He suggested that “kinship” traditions emphasized collective over individual rights and made it more likely that people would “hand over” their vote to others. Ken Livingstone, a former London mayor and a   member of the Labour Party before being suspended for   comments, said the new checks would make life more difficult for many to vote. “The real problem is the people most likely not to have a passport or a driving license are going to be the poorest and that I suspect will basically hit the Labour Party,” he told the BBC on Tuesday. Some suggested that the changes, to be used first for local elections in 18 areas in May 2018, would most affect Britain’s Asian communities, which tend to vote Labour. Among those areas considered most susceptible to fraud are Birmingham and Bradford, which have large Muslim communities. Cat Smith, the Labour member in charge of voter engagement and youth affairs, said the party as a whole supported the changes. But she criticized what she called Conservative Party moves in general to reduce the electoral rolls. A new requirement that students, once automatically registered by their schools, register individually is thought to have cut voter turnout in the June referendum on leaving the European Union, also known as “Brexit,” which young people generally opposed. Mr. Skidmore said that the trial in 2018 was partly intended to see what kinds of proof of identity were best in a country without a national identity card, unlike most of Europe. It is possible that other proof of address like utility bills or proof of voter registration may be used as well as documents with photographs, like driving licenses and passports. Mr. Skidmore also rejected the accusation that electoral fraud was associated with any one community, although he said racial and cultural sensitivities might have discouraged the police from earlier investigating the case of Tower Hamlets. After absentee ballots were made available to any registered voter in 2000 under the prime minister at the time, Tony Blair, there was evidence that some political activists were “harvesting” them from old addresses and filling them out, or collecting them in bulk from some voters. Voters in Northern Ireland, with a long history of electoral pressure in a divided community, have had identity checks at polling stations since 1985, and since 2002 have had to bring photographic IDs, since other forms of documentation were too easily forged. The Electoral Reform Society, a lobbying group, criticized the government’s plan as a “sledgehammer to crack a nut,” arguing that voting fraud was not widespread in Britain and that “the government should think very carefully before introducing barriers to voting,” said its chief executive, Katie Ghose. “Raising barriers to democratic participation could just put people off voting  —   and evidence from the U. S. shows that it’s generally those already most excluded from the political process that are worst affected by strict ID laws,” she said. “The government should think again and look at all the evidence on voter ID before deciding to use this blunt instrument. ” The group had previously criticized the referendum to leave the European Union for “glaring democratic deficiencies,” in particular because voters had been so   since “misleading claims could be made with total impunity. ” Separately, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, reacted angrily to comments by President Obama  —   made in the same interview in which he said he would have defeated   Donald J. Trump  —   that seemed to suggest that the Labour Party had lost its footing. Asked if, after Hillary Clinton’s election defeat, the Democrats could undergo “Corbynization” and “disintegrate” like Labour, Mr. Obama said he was not concerned. “I don’t worry about that, partly because I think that the Democratic Party has stayed pretty grounded in fact and reality,” he said. A party spokesman said that Mr. Corbyn “stands for what most people want” and suggested that the American Democratic Party needed to “challenge power if they are going to speak for working people and change a broken system that isn’t delivering for the majority. ”",0

6938,"Democrat Megyn Kelly Exposed, Will Move to ABC After Presidential Election","
Megyn Kelly will co-host “Live with Kelly” alongside Kelly Ripa on the morning after the presidential election, Nov. 9. It’s anyone’s guess what the Nov. 9 timing means.
The Fox News host of the “The Kelly File” will join Ripa much like Anderson Cooper, Seth Meyers and others have been doing as co-hosts since Michael Strahan left the show for a new role on “Good Morning America,” according to People magazine on Wednesday.
Actress Naomi Watts and actor Michael Ealy are also scheduled to appear that day.
The Wrap noted that Kelly’s co-hosting gig comes as speculation continues to swirl about her next move as her Fox News contract expires in 2017.
“Live with Kelly” which is nationally syndicated by Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution, noted People.
“Cue up speculation that Kelly is flirting with ABC News – ‘Live with Kelly’ being syndicated by ABC-parent Disney, and a timeslot competitor to NBC News’ cash cow ‘Today’ show,” said Lisa Moraes on Deadline.com.
“In one of those incredible coincidences, word of the booking on the significant election-cycle morning broke the same day Fox News interim CEO Rupert Murdoch gave an interview to his newspaper Wall Street Journal, to publicly announce Kelly is important to the network and he hopes to get her under contract ‘very soon,’ while adding, ominously, ‘we have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for her’ timeslot.”
CNN Worldwide chief Jeff Zucker praised Kelly earlier this month, calling her “a tremendous news anchor” but was coy in addressing her contract coming to an end at Fox News, according to Deadline.com, adding “I’ll leave it there.”
Kelly and fellow Fox News host Sean Hannity had publicly feuded this month over the presidential election, according to the Washington Post, and she told Variety in April she was unsure whether she would resign with Fox News.
“I really like my show, and I love my team,” Kelly told Variety then. “But you know, there’s a lot of brain damage that comes from the job. There was probably less brain damage when I worked in the afternoon. I was less well known. I had far less conflict in my life.”
“I also have three kids who are soon going to be in school from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. I come to work at 3:30. I like to see my children. Having said that, my boss has been good about working with me to make me happy – he knows I’m a hard worker. I’ve had few problems here where I couldn’t talk to him and say, ‘Can we work something out?,’ and come away happy,” she added.

6940,How to Interpret the Trump Administration’s Latest Signals on Mexico - The New York Times,"The White House floated an idea on Thursday afternoon that, in initial reports, sounded like a major tariff on Mexican imports  —   something that would have gone a long way toward unwinding one of the United States’ deepest economic relationships. The reality of what Sean Spicer, the press secretary, suggested is a lot less dramatic. But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code  —   and how they’re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president’s audacious campaign promises. It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes, trade and diplomacy is in flux. Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump’s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico. A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick, Mr. Spicer said. That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters. Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers, create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border, and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer’s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation. He was pointing out that in an overhaul of taxes that House Republicans are considering, imports from all countries would be taxed at 20 percent while American exports would be tax free. It’s called border adjustment, and it would make the United States corporate tax code more closely resemble the   tax that is commonplace in other countries. House Republicans see the policy as a way to reshape the tax code to give businesses less incentive to move operations overseas while also generating revenue they can use to reduce tax rates. Opponents of the plan, which include major retailers, are skeptical. Among the risks: It could drive up consumer prices for all sorts of imported goods, from German cars to Mexican avocados, if the dollar does not rise as much as economists predict. And the policy may violate World Trade Organization rules, which could tangle it up in legal proceedings. But that Mr. Spicer was floating that plan as a way to fulfill Mr. Trump’s Mexican wall promises is interesting on two levels. First, less than two weeks ago, the    threw cold water on the House plan. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal. “Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. ” On Thursday, Mr. Spicer was explicitly suggesting that a border tax could be used to pay for a border wall. Referring to the tax plan, he said, “This is something that we’ve been in close contact with both houses in moving forward. ” The border adjustment strategy has plenty of enemies, and there’s no certainty that it will become part of a tax overhaul bill. But the latest tea leaves suggest the administration is more open to it than it may have seemed. The second lesson from the incident is that the Trump administration looks inclined to be flexible in finding ways to satisfy campaign promises without doing major damage to the economy or international relations. Thursday was one of the roughest days for relations between the United States and Mexico in some time, with the cancellation of a planned visit by President Enrique Peña Nieto and tough talk from Mexico City, which adamantly refuses to pay for an expansion of a border wall. But Mr. Spicer’s comments, which he later said were meant more to offer an example than a concrete policy proposal, suggest that the administration will look for creative ways to proclaim victory on Trumpian promises. In other words, he will proclaim that Mexico has paid for the wall as promised  —   even if the Mexican government never literally cuts a check to pay for new concrete. Advocates of the border adjustment tax have been fond of it because it would produce enough revenue to allow a deep reduction in tax rates. But money is fungible. So if the president can claim political victory by stating that the revenue from Mexican imports is going to pay for the wall, no one is going to stop him. It is a messy time for the making of economic policy. The Trump campaign was notoriously light on policy detail, and the Trump administration still has many key vacancies in economic policy jobs. Nominees for Treasury secretary, commerce secretary and U. S. trade representative have not yet been confirmed, and key jobs on the Council of Economic Advisers and most undersecretary and assistant secretary jobs remain unfilled. So the gaps are still being filled in on what the Trump administration economic policy will really mean in practice. The way to read the latest Mexico comments is as one more hint.",0
6941,Sean Spicer Repeats Trump’s Unproven Wiretapping Allegation - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The White House on Friday revived President Trump’s unproven wiretapping allegations against the Obama administration, insisting that there is new evidence that it conducted “politically motivated” surveillance of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Senior government officials, including James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, and lawmakers from both parties, have repeatedly and forcefully rejected the president’s claim, saying they have seen no evidence of direct surveillance. A spokesman for former President Barack Obama has denied that Mr. Obama ever ordered surveillance of Mr. Trump or his associates. But Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, asserted to reporters during his daily news briefing that members of Mr. Obama’s administration had done “very, very bad things,” just as Mr. Trump alleged without proof on March 4 when he posted messages on Twitter accusing Mr. Obama of “wire tapping” his phones at Trump Tower. “The question is why? Who else did it? Was it ordered? By whom?” Mr. Spicer said. “But I think more and more the substance that continues to come out on the record by individuals continues to point to exactly what the president was talking about that day. ” Mr. Spicer appeared to be basing his assertions on reports from   news outlets that took out of context a   interview with a former Obama administration official. Mr. Spicer’s comments came in the midst of a drumbeat of developments in the multiple investigations into Russian contacts with Mr. Trump’s associates, and a week after the president failed to make good on his campaign promise to replace Mr. Obama’s signature health care law. The two story lines have helped drag down Mr. Trump’s approval ratings, which slumped to a low of 35 percent in Gallup’s tracking poll on Wednesday. Mr. Spicer’s remarks on Friday seemed designed to give new life to the allegations against Mr. Obama after weeks of trying to focus attention on the damage that Mr. Spicer said had been caused by leaks from the investigations into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign. The allegations dominated his briefing, crowding out other parts of the White House agenda, including the president’s signing of two executive orders on trade and meeting with manufacturing executives. Mr. Trump hastily left that signing ceremony without adding his signature to the trade orders as a reporter shouted a question about possible testimony in the Russia inquiry by Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser. The White House said Mr. Trump signed the directives later. At Mr. Spicer’s news conference, the press secretary chastised reporters for failing to accept that Mr. Trump had been right all along. “The substance we are talking about continues to move exactly in the direction that the president spoke about in terms of surveillance that occurred,” Mr. Spicer said, even as he deflected questions about the White House’s role in providing intelligence reports to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. The senior Democrat on that committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, arrived later in the day at the White House to view the intelligence reports. In a statement, Mr. Schiff confirmed that they were the same materials Mr. Nunes had seen, and said that nothing justified Mr. Nunes’s failure to share them with the entire committee. “The White House has yet to explain why senior White House staff apparently shared these materials with but one member of either committee, only for their contents to be briefed back to the White House,” Mr. Schiff said in a statement. Mr. Spicer provided no evidence of the surveillance allegations. But he pointed several times to news reports that he claimed backed up the president’s accusations. One was a March 2 interview with Evelyn Farkas, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration until leaving the government in October 2015. TheGatewayPundit. com, a   site, called it a “notorious” interview and said it proved Obama administration officials had disseminated “intel gathered on the Trump team. ” Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show that Ms. Farkas had made “just an incredible statement. ” Breitbart News reported on Mr. Priebus’s comments. The comments by Ms. Farkas, Mr. Spicer said, were evidence that Mr. Trump or his associates “were surveilled, had their information unmasked, made it available, was politically spread. ” He said that such stories were proof that Obama administration officials had “misused, mishandled and potentially did some very, very bad things with classified information. ” In fact, the reports do not back up the allegations that Mr. Trump or any officials in his campaign were ever under surveillance. In the March 2 interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program, Ms. Farkas said she had expressed concern to her former colleagues about the need to secure intelligence related to the Russian hacking of the American election. Ms. Farkas was commenting on a New York Times article a day earlier that documented how in the days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Obama administration officials had sought to ensure the preservation of those documents in order to leave a clear trail for government investigators after Mr. Trump took office. In a statement she gave to The American Spectator, a conservative publication, Ms. Farkas said the furor over her remarks was “a wild misinterpretation of comments I made on the air in March. ” She added, “I was out of government, I didn’t have any classified information, or any knowledge of ‘tapping’ or leaking or the N. Y. T. article before it came out. ” White House officials also confronted on Friday the disclosure that Mr. Flynn, who resigned in February over his contacts with Russian officials, has offered to testify before the two congressional committees investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia about those contacts in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Friday morning that he agreed with Mr. Flynn’s proposal. “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss) by media  Dems, of historic proportion!” Mr. Trump wrote. The president has been eager to dismiss as “fake news” all allegations that members of his campaign colluded with the Russians, and the post appeared to be an effort to discredit the congressional inquiries that are examining those claims. It also appeared to be aimed at defusing any speculation that Mr. Flynn might be seeking immunity because he has incriminating information to share about Mr. Trump or his associates. It was not clear from the president’s post on Friday whether he fully appreciated the potential effect on his administration if Mr. Flynn received immunity to participate fully in the investigation. Mr. Trump has said previously that seeking protection from prosecution is a telltale sign of wrongdoing. “If you’re not guilty of a crime, what do you need immunity for, right?” he said in September at a campaign rally in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Trump was referring to Hillary Clinton aides who received immunity during an F. B. I. inquiry into her use of a private email server. Mr. Spicer declined to address the inconsistency, telling reporters on Friday only that Mr. Trump “believes that Mike Flynn should go testify. ” “He thinks that he should go up there and do what he has to do to get the story out,” Mr. Spicer said. The F. B. I. is investigating whether any of Mr. Trump’s advisers colluded with Russia in its efforts to disrupt the 2016 election. An immunity deal would make it extraordinarily difficult for the Justice Department to prosecute Mr. Flynn. Mr. Schiff said Mr. Flynn’s decision to seek immunity from prosecution was a “grave and momentous step,” but not one that investigators were ready to consider at this stage. “While Mr. Flynn’s testimony is of great interest to our committee, we are also deeply mindful of the interests of the Justice Department in the matter,” Mr. Schiff said in a statement. He added that before considering immunity for any witness in the inquiry, “we will of course require a detailed proffer of any intended testimony. ”",0

6943,Soda Tax Passes in Philadelphia. Advocates Ask: Who’s Next? - The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Forty times, city or state governments had proposed taxes on sugary soft drinks, failing each time. Then, in 2014, liberal Berkeley, Calif. passed such a tax, but most people saw it as an aberration. Several measures, including one in New York, never won much support. But on Thursday, a measure to tax sweetened drinks passed in Philadelphia, one of the country’s largest cities  —   and also one of its poorest. Indeed, raising revenue was the winning argument in Philadelphia. Jim Kenney, the mayor, took a different tack from that of politicians who have tried and failed to pass   taxes. He didn’t talk about the tax as a   measure designed to discourage   soft drinks. And he didn’t promise to earmark the proceeds for health programs. Instead, he cast the soft drink industry as a tantalizing revenue source that could be tapped to fund popular city programs, including universal prekindergarten. “This is the beginning of a process of changing the narrative of poverty in our city,” he said in a news conference after the vote. The advocates who have pushed for the policy say the victory is a sign of growing public acceptance of soft drink taxes and presages more such measures around the country. Though city officials didn’t talk much about the health consequences of soda, experts said that sugary drinks’ increasingly bad reputation made it an appropriate political target. “If we go five years ahead and look back, I think this is going to be a watershed moment,” said Jim Krieger, executive director at Healthy Food America, an organization that is helping cities around the country that are considering soda taxes. “This is going to really provide momentum. ” San Francisco Oakland, Calif. and Boulder, Colo. are considering soft drink taxes this year. Mr. Krieger said the list of interested cities included some that were as large and diverse as Philadelphia. Mr. Kenney said he hadn’t yet spoken directly with officials from other cities, but he had advice for them. “Tie your efforts to tangible initiatives that people care about,” he said in his news conference. “When it comes up, acknowledge that it is a good thing to drink less   beverages, but tie it to things that people care about. ” The Philadelphia tax of 1. 5 cents an ounce will apply to all sugary or artificially sweetened drinks sold by distributors in the city. It is expected to increase prices  —   the tax is about 30 cents for a   drink, or $2. 16 for a  . If passed on to consumers, the increase is expected to substantially reduce sales of sweetened drinks. The city finance department estimates it will raise $91 million a year. Sugary drinks have been linked to health problems, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, but the public health effects of the taxes are still unclear. Philadelphia is likely to become the site of public health research. Thomas Farley, the city’s health commissioner, said the city had already planned to measure the tax’s immediate effects on sales.   studies will measure any impact on obesity. The soft drink industry and its allies, including the Teamsters union and local grocers, spent nearly $5 million on lobbying and advertising to fight the tax in Philadelphia. They held rallies and demonstrations downtown and ran   ads on television and the radio, right up until Thursday’s final vote. They branded the drinks tax measure a “grocery tax,” suggesting that more food products were next. The soda industry has argued that Philadelphia’s politics are unusual and that the vote here can’t be seen as predictive. The American Beverage Association, a trade group, has vowed to fight the measure in the courts. “It’s still a bad idea,” said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for the group. “People still oppose it. Nothing has changed. ” Thursday, the industry and its allies vented frustration. Daniel Grace, the secretary and treasurer of the Teamsters local, said advocates had “snookered City Council,” and he described the tax as a “brazen cash grab from one industry. ” The promise of prekindergarten energized the city’s education advocates, who joined with public health advocates. The coalition spent about $2 million on advertisements, according to Kevin Feeley, a spokesman for Philadelphians for a Fair Future, a group supporting the tax. That total included $1. 6 million in donations from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, who has long supported soda taxes. But Mr. Kenney’s focus on revenue also allowed him to help cut deals with skeptical city councilors. Ultimately, the soft drink tax revenue won’t pay just for prekindergarten, but for a host of city programs, reflecting the priorities of the council members who voted for it.",0
6944,WATCH – Comedian HUMILIATES Pro-Hillary Celebs: ‘Do You Realize How F Arrogant…’ | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print Hillary Clinton had many vocal celebrities on her side during the 2016 presidential election. However, the election proved that most Americans just don’t care what celebrities have to say about politics. In a recent interview, comedian Bill Burr blasted arrogant celebrities, saying, “Your ego is so f***ing big you think someone is going, ‘well, I want to vote for Trump, but if he gets elected, we lose Cher!’” I could not agree more with what Burr said. These people are celebrities and have no knowledge of foreign relations, economics, or anything other than entertainment for that matter. The liberal celebrities feel their ability to read a script translates to the right to pontificate on the most important issues facing our country. Liberals have had Hollywood in their pocket for years. Other celebrities, such as Katy Perry, Robert De Niro, and Salma Hayek, all came out to support Hillary during the election. Why on earth do these people think anyone will change their vote just because an entertainer threatens to leave the country if his or her candidate doesn’t win? Even if we did care, we all know they won’t really move their entire lives to live in another country. Case in point: have any of these anti-Trump celebrities left yet? I didn’t think so. But we should hold them to their vow! Every Hollywood liberal who threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected should start packing their bags. Send us a postcard when you are freezing your bums off in Canada! Celebrities only demonstrate one thing when they threaten to leave the US over election results: their disgusting arrogance. Do they honestly think they have a better idea about the economic conditions of the middle class than those actually living in the middle class? No. They just think they’re entitled to the support of their fans. If they could come down to reality for two seconds and look at the election results, clearly regular Americans don’t agree. To be frank, we care more about the future of our country than we do about any of these celebrities. Don’t worry—we’ll remember your hypocrisy and self-absorption when you threaten to leave if Trump is re-elected in 2020. What do you think of Bill Burr’s comments on Hollywood liberals?

6945,17 Shot Dead As Chicago Records Deadliest Weekend Of 2016,"17 Shot Dead As Chicago Records Deadliest Weekend Of 2016 Published:   Zero Hedge 
After a summer of extreme violence, homicides in Chicago were supposed to slow down going into the fall and winter months. But, that certainly does not appear to be happening as the city just recording its most violent weekend of the entire year with 52 people shot and 17 of them killed. This weekend's violence brings the tally of year to date killings in Chicago to 646, an annual run-rate which implies the most violent year since the mid-90s. 
According to the Chicago Tribune , of the 17 victims from this weekend's violence, 7 of them were under the age of 20, with the youngest victim being only 14. 
The weekend toll also was deadlier than the three long summer holiday weekends when violence typically spikes because of the warm weather. Six people were fatally shot over the Memorial Day weekend, five over the Fourth of July weekend and 13 people over Labor Day weekend, according to Tribune data. 

This past weekend there were shootings in every area of the city but the Far North and Northwest sides, according to police. Of the 17 people who were killed, seven were younger than 20. 

The youngest was 14-year-old Demarco Webster Jr ., described by his grade school principal as one of her best students. Demarco had planned to run for student council and try out for basketball, and he was being recruited for an NAACP leadership program. 

A little more than 24 hours later, 17-year-old twins Edward and Edwin Bryant were killed in an apparent drive-by shooting in Old Town. Police responding to calls about gunfire found one of the boys lying on the sidewalk in the 400 block of West Evergreen Avenue and another around the corner in the 1300 block of North Hudson Avenue. 

""The two brothers, as far as we can tell, they didn't have any documented gang affiliation,"" said Johnson, who noted police recovered video of the shooting. ""But the individuals they were with did."" 
While journalists suggested that the police department was caught off guard by gang violence linked to large crowds around Wrigley Field, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson insists that extra resources were deployed to the most dangerous neighborhoods around Chicago. 
""It was a tough weekend, but that just goes back to what I've been saying all the time,"" he told reporters. ""Listen, until we start holding repeat gun offenders accountable for these crimes, we're going to keep seeing cycles of gun violence like this."" 

Johnson denied that the department was caught off guard by the mostly gang violence on the South and West sides while deploying hundreds of extra officers for crowd control outside Wrigley Field for the Cubs' three World Series games over the weekend. 

""We had canceled days off as well as (required) 12-hour shifts over the entire weekend, so I'm confident that we had the resources out there"" in the most dangerous neighborhoods, he said. 

According to HeyJackass! , killings from this weekend bring YTD Chicago homicides up to 646, a 51% increase versus last year. 

Meanwhile, YTD killings imply a run-rate of 775 homicides for the year which would be the highest since the mid-90s. 

And, of course, the majority of the violent crime continues to occur in the gang-ridden South and West side neighborhoods. 

Finally, roughly 95% of the violent crime committed so far in 2016 has been against minority citizens with nearly 80% of the shootings going unsolved. Share This Article...",0
6946,Exciting Microbe Research? Temper That Giddy Feeling in Your Gut - The New York Times,"While we have long known about the existence of microbes  —   the tiny bacteria, fungi and archaea that live all around, on and in us  —   our full relationship has become one of the hottest topics for research only in recent years. Scientists believe that every person contains as many independent microbial cells as human cells. This collection of life, known as the microbiome, provides useful functions for us. Indeed, some of the things we think our bodies do are actually the abilities and enzymes of   living within us. They can help with digestion, vitamin synthesis and even immunological responses. But, as with many new breakthroughs and advances, the hype of the microbiome often outweighs the reality. This seems especially likely in the field of nutrition. Doing research on the microbiome is not easy, and there are many opportunities to foul things up. To accomplish human studies, large samples of people and microbiomes are needed to account for potential confounding variables. Specimens have to be collected and stored carefully because contamination has been a big problem. DNA has to be extracted, amplified and sequenced. Finally, powerful bioinformatics tools are necessary to assemble and analyze the huge amount of data contained in a sequence of nucleotides  —   all of which has resulted in a wide range of new “omics,” including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics. Of course, if we think that microbes play a large role in health, we have to rethink the role that antimicrobials play in our lives. In this thinking, antibiotics and antifungals could be   or  . But that’s not the case. There are many reasons to avoid unnecessary use of these medications, but the microbiome appears able to withstand most treatment. Still, antimicrobials clearly have an effect on the microbiome. Many studies, along with common sense, suggest that when we treat people with antibiotics, we change the amount and type of microbes that live in our gut. We’ve seen this with Clostridium difficile. C. diff, as it is also known, is a bacterium that lives in many healthy people. The presence of other microbes keeps its numbers in check. But when we treat people with antibiotics that kill off other bacteria, but not C. diff, it can increase its presence and lead to serious illness. Infection with C. diff is hard to treat, and it’s not uncommon. In 2011 in the United States, there were more than 450, 000 cases, causing 29, 000 deaths. A number of studies have shown promise in using the microbiome to treat C. diff. Fecal transplant (which is exactly what it sounds like) effectively fixes a damaged microbiome by infusing it with a healthy one. This type of therapy could theoretically work in treating other diseases. But there’s a huge gap between “holds promise” and “definitive treatment. ” After all, there’s a direct biological explanation for why the microbiome and antibiotics play a role in C. diff. That direct link is much harder to describe when talking about other disorders. Many have postulated that the microbiome has an important part to play in inflammatory bowel diseases, which, because of my condition, I follow quite closely. Others have attempted to link it to disorders of development and behavior, like autism. Because the microbiome takes root in childhood, studies have explored if pregnancy, method of delivery or even the environment might hold some meaning in the microbiome’s development and later health. Even more significantly, many have begun to hypothesize that it has a significant role in the current obesity epidemic. Studies have shown that transferring the microbiome from a thin mouse to an obese one, or vice versa, could lead to a change in body size to match. It was this type of study that roused much of your ire when I dismissed it in my discussion of artificial sweeteners. Other studies show that changes in diet can change the microbiome in human beings. But when you analyze all these studies together, as scientists did in a   last summer, the certainty of those links becomes much less certain. This doesn’t mean that the microbiome doesn’t play a role in nutrition. Some important research has begun to show that chronic malnutrition probably causes changes in the microbiome that make treating the problem much harder than many anticipate. Problems with substandard sanitation can also contribute to microbial changes in very poor environments, compounding the problems of malnutrition. But we haven’t yet figured out how to translate these findings into easily used treatments. The problem with getting too enthusiastic about the microbiome isn’t much different from the problem with getting too enthusiastic about any research advances. Many mistake correlation for causation just because some people have a different microbiome doesn’t mean that microbes are responsible for other differences. Studies in mice are not the same as studies of humans diet is incredibly complex, and rarely do results in genetically similar animals easily translate to diverse groups of people. And the microbiome is very, very complicated. We understand so little about it, and the idea that we can make accurate representations about it, let alone manipulate it, is somewhat  . As with the genome before it, our greater understanding of the microbiome has spurred great excitement and interest. Last May, the White House began the National Microbiome Initiative, with huge public and private investment into research. We hope these investments will yield great returns, but it will be important to temper our enthusiasm with an appropriate amount of skepticism. Health advances usually proceed more slowly than the hype.",0
6947,Electronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: “Trying to Steal Texas”,"Home » Headlines » World News » Electronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: “Trying to Steal Texas” 
If TEXAS goes Blue, you know something is seriously, seriously wrong… 

From Michael Snyder : 
Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. 
Most Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. 
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article, I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times… 
“I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. 
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . 
“I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. 
She said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.” 
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. 
“Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News. 
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. 
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. 
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning. 
And of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country. 
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. 
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper… 
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. 
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas… 
Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. 
I don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. 
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas… 
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! 
And of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon… 
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines? 
According to Breitbart, one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots… 
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . 
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. 
Let’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. 
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. 
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states. And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“… In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state 
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead“… 
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. 
Americans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. 
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is gettingharder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. 
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up… 
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. 
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. 
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. 
Now that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious. 
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. 
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. 
And let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. On Sale At SD Bullion… This Week Only…",0
6948,"Trump Signs Bill Securing NASA Funding, Plans to Reach Mars","President Donald Trump signed a bill on Tuesday securing funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with the aim of sending a crew to Mars within 20 years. [Bill S. 442, named the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017, was   by Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) provides NASA with $19. 5 billion worth of funding for the 2018 fiscal year, with the aim of sending a “crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s. ”   The bill also urges NASA to “extend human presence, including potential human habitation on another celestial body and a thriving space economy in the 21st Century. ” The level of funding is above what Trump outlined in his first White House budget, which called for $19. 1 billion investment in NASA programs. It is the first NASA authorization bill to be signed in seven years. On signing the bill, Trump remarked that “America’s space program has been a blessing to our people and to the entire world. ” “Almost half a century ago our brave astronauts also planted our American flag on the moon. Now, this nation is ready to be the first in space once again. Today we are taking the initial steps toward a bold and bright new future for space exploration,” he continued. Trump also praised the new high paying jobs the bill will create, as part of his plan to radically reduce unemployment.

6949,French Foreign Minister: Assad’s Denials of Chemical Attack ’100 per cent Lies’,"(AFP)  —   Syrian President Bashar  ’s comments that last week’s chemical weapons attack was a fabrication to justify a US military strike are “100 percent lies” French Foreign Minister   Ayrault said Friday. [“It’s 100 percent lies and propaganda,” Ayrault said during a visit to Beijing, responding to an exclusive AFP interview with Assad on Wednesday.  “It’s 100 percent cruelty and cynicism. ” The French minister mirrored language used by Assad himself, who dismissed the allegation that his regime perpetrated the attack that left 87 civilians dead, including many children. “Definitely, 100 percent for us, it’s fabrication,” Assad said in the interview. The Syrian leader questioned whether the attack had in fact occurred, claiming that “fake videos” and “propaganda” were being used against his government. He also accused the United States of colluding with terrorists and “fabricating the whole story in order to have a pretext” for a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base last week. The French minister made the remarks during a joint press conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. “The reality is that more than 300, 000 have died, 11 million people have been displaced or become refugees, tens of thousands have been placed in Syrian prisons and a country has been destroyed,” Ayrault said. “That is the reality. It is not a fantasy. ” He emphasised the need for an end to the conflict with a “real ceasefire, one which restricts the Syrian air force and military and is upheld by the international community. ” Ayrault praised China’s role in the matter, noting its abstention from a United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution to condemn the Syrian gas attack. In the past, China has voted alongside Russia to veto UN resolutions on the Syrian conflict. Wang expressed his agreement with the French minister, noting that an “independent, fair and professional investigation” into the chemical weapons attack should be conducted “as soon as possible. ”",0
6950,Family Sues After Cops Shot 6yo Autistic Boy and Watched Him “Suffer Immensely” As He Died,"Home / Badge Abuse / Family Sues After Cops Shot 6yo Autistic Boy and Watched Him “Suffer Immensely” As He Died Family Sues After Cops Shot 6yo Autistic Boy and Watched Him “Suffer Immensely” As He Died Claire Bernish October 29, 2016 Leave a comment 
Marksville, LA — A federal lawsuit has now been filed against several Louisiana law enforcement agencies for the fatal shooting of six-year-old Jeremy Mardis, who “suffered immensely” on November 3, 2015, due to “a barbaric and excessive use of deadly force.” 
Attorneys representing Christopher Few, Jeremy’s father, who suffered serious injuries in the incident; mother, Catherine Mardis; and Candace Few, whose vehicle her brother, Christopher, drove the night of the shooting, filed a federal civil lawsuit on Thursday in an attempt at justice for the needless death of the young child. 
In fact, video footage of the incident so shocked Louisiana State Police Col. Mike Edmonson, he told reporters in November, “It is the most disturbing thing I’ve seen, and I will leave it at that.” 
According to the lawsuit, referenced by KLFY , defendants include “Norris Greenhouse Jr. and Derrick Stafford, the two former Marksville Ward 2 deputy marshals facing second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in the case. Both pleaded not guilty and are facing separate trials. 
“But the lawsuit also names as defendants Marksville City Marshal Floyd Voinche, the Marksville City Court, the town of Marksville, Avoyelles Parish, Progressive Paloverde Insurance Company and the other two officers involved in the chase of Few that night — Jason Brouillette and Kenneth Parnell III.” 
On November 3, 2015, according to the original police account, the four officers were attempting to serve a warrant for Few — who then fled in his sister’s Kia Sport, with Jeremy buckled in the passenger seat. 
Police had claimed Few was armed and posed an imminent deadly threat — so Officers Greenhouse and Stafford opened fire — emptying 18 rounds at the vehicle, critically injuring Few and killing the 6-year-old, who had autism. 
In actuality, no warrant had been issued for Few, and both father and son were unarmed — indeed, as video evidence shows, Few had his hands in the air when he received “two or three” bullets to the head and chest, while Jeremy suffered “four or five” shots to the head and neck. 
Appallingly, Jeremy languished in agony, still holding onto life for over five minutes after being shot multiple times — but officers failed to even check for a pulse or render assistance. 
“During this time, Jeremy was bleeding profusely and suffered immensely due to the gunshot wounds,” the lawsuit states, according to KFLY . 
“It was not until approximately some seven and one-half to eight minutes or so after the hail of gunfire, that an officer at the scene, believed to be Parnell, finally checked Jeremy for a pulse and discovered that he was still alive, despite having been shot multiple times including in the head and neck,” it reads. 
“However, none of the officers at the scene, including Stafford, Greenhouse, Brouillette and Parnell initiated or rendered any form of first aid, nor did they undertake any other measures in an attempt to stop Jeremy’s bleeding or otherwise alleviate or mitigate Jeremy’s suffering, or made any attempts to save his life. 
“Sadly, Jeremy was left to suffer — and die — while the officers casually searched for ‘gloves.’” 
An exact motive for the original traffic stop — given the fictitious claim of a warrant and that Few did not have a weapon — has yet to be publicly released by officials. Attorneys for Greenhouse and Stafford stated during court proceedings Few had been standing in the road, blocking traffic, ignored officers’ commands, and then fled the scene. 
But the lawsuit contends there had been no clear reason for police to pursue the vehicle Few was driving, and when he ultimately did pull over, the vehicle, “even if it were moving forward or backwards — did not and could not have presented an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to any of the officers at the scene or innocent bystanders.” 
As video clearly shows, Few pulled to the side of the road, raised his arms above his head and made no threatening gestures — in other words, he posed not even the slightest legitimate threat to their safety. The lawsuit continues : 
“Moreover, at the time the pursuit of Christopher was initiated, and thereafter during the pursuit, none of the officers had reasonable or probable cause to believe that Christopher had committed some crime, was committing a crime or was about to commit a crime. The pursuit was unlawful, as was the subsequent use of deadly force.” 
Fatally shooting a 6-year-old child wasn’t the first brutal act by either Stafford or Greenhouse. As The Free Thought Project reported, the pair of rageful cops have a history of brutalizing their town with impunity — and as the lawsuit notes, it seems no vetting procedure was in place when Greenhouse and Stafford were hired. 
Additionally, when attorneys made a public records request with Marksville City Marshal Floyd Voinche for hiring, training, and disciplinary guidelines concerning deputy marshals, they received a telling one-sentence reply: “No such records exist.” 
“The need for such policies is so obvious,” KFLY quotes the lawsuit, “for the safety of the public and the protection of constitutional rights that the lack of such policies constitutes deliberate indifference and a reckless disregard for the public and plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.” 
But the fact it took an innocent 6-year-old’s death to force the city to examine such policies is endemic of brutal policing in the United States — and one means officers can employ to work around appropriate discipline is to resign and simply move on to the next department. 
In late September, in a stunning act of hubris, Stafford again requested charges be dropped since he acted in self defense — despite damning evidence to the contrary. 
The family of Jeremy Mardis is requesting a jury trial in this lawsuit. Share Social Trending",0
6951,WATCH As A Trump Advisor Has A HISSY FIT When Asked About White Supremacist Supporters,"WATCH As A Trump Advisor Has A HISSY FIT When Asked About White Supremacist Supporters By Andrew Bradford   
Maybe you’ve noticed that in recent weeks the people who advise and speak on behalf of the Donald Trump campaign seem to be more angry and defensive than usual. No doubt that has something to do with the fact that they realize their candidate is about to lose badly on Election Day. 
The perfect example of this was provided last night by Trump senior advisor AJ Delgado, who was appearing with GOP strategist Rick Wilson, who is supporting third-party candidate Evan McMullin. When host Chris Hayes mentioned Trump’s ties to white supremacists, Delgado got very agitated and said she was offended by the accusation. Hayes replied : “I just want to distinguish between two claims. If you’re a Trump supporter you’re there for a racist or white supremacist which I would never say and don’t think Rick would say. The people out there that are racist and white supremacist, they’re overwhelmingly and publicly supporting Donald Trump.” 
Delgado yelled: “That’s not true!” 
Wilson then joined the conversation, telling Delgado: “AJ, it is true. The people on the white supremacists alt-right movement in this country flock to Donald Trump.” 
Later in the debate, Delgado claimed that the average voter doesn’t care about Trump’s support from white supremacists such as David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Wilson let Delgado have it for that comment: “This is a guy who is feeding these people with a nod and a wink every single day. A guy who constantly denigrates women, Muslims, minorities in a host of different ways. I’m not saying every person who supports Donald Trump is a racist, that’s absurd. Every racist you turn over — every time you turn over a rock and find a racist, they have a red MAGA hat on. There is not a — there’s not a coincidence here.” 
Exactly! Trump has been playing footsie with neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other white supremacist/white nationalist groups since he started his campaign. For him or anyone who supports him to now appear offended when someone makes that connection is not only disingenuous, it’s downright ludicrous. As the old saying goes, If you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas.

6952,DHS Vows to Enforce Donald Trump’s Executive Order - Breitbart,"The Department of Homeland Security plans to enforce President Donald Trump’s executive order to dramatically reduce immigration from high threat countries in the Middle East. [“The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trump’s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people,” the agency made in a statement sent to reporters on Sunday.  They reminded Americans that only a small percentage of travelers were affected by the new restrictions.  The agency noted that although some individuals were held for further screening, some of them were allowed entry into the United States, despite protesters at area airports describing the order as a “Muslim ban. ” “These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,” the department said. The agency did not signal that they were prepared to back down from the rigorous enforcement of Trump’s executive action. “The Department of Homeland Security will comply with judicial orders faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump’s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people,” the statement concluded.",0
6953,Swedish Minister: Country Needs To Integrate Returning Islamic State Fighters,"Swedish Minister for Culture and Democracy Alice Bah Kuhnke has suggested that Swedes who left to fight for radical Islamist groups in the Middle East should be welcomed back and helped to integrate into society. [Ms. Kuhnke made the comments Sunday evening on the television programme Agenda which is transmitted by the Swedish state broadcaster SVT. The programme focused on the fact that some 300 Islamic radicals from Sweden had gone to the Middle East to fight for groups like Islamic State and around half of them had returned to Sweden.  “They need to be channelled back into our democratic society,” Kuhnke said. The minister added she and the government had no idea how many of the returnees were still radicalised versus how many left because they had become disillusioned with Islamist beliefs. When asked how many radical Muslims were involved in deradicalisation programmes, she estimated between 10 to 30 people based on information given to her by various municipalities. “There are far too few. We have to work together much better,” she noted. Kuhnke also could not confirm that those who had been through the programmes had been successfully deradicalised, saying the process could take a decade or more. “We can not say that we have succeeded because it’s been such a short time. It is only in   years we can say that they actually managed to leave these environments,” she said. Many on social media criticised the minister’s comments including terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp who took to Twitter to note that at least two returning Swedish jihadists were involved with the terrorist attacks that occurred in Paris in late 2015 and in Brussels in 2016. Dessutom har TVÅ av våra   Osama Krayem  Mohammed Belkaid varit delaktiga i terrorattackerna i Paris  Bryssel. #agenda,  —   Magnus  Ranstorp (@MagnusRanstorp) March 12, 2017,  “The interview speaks for itself. This is how   we are to deal with returnees,” Ranstrop noted. The Swedish attitude toward returning jihadists is seen as strange by many, as several municipalities have gone above and beyond to cater for returning fighters. In the medieval city of Lund, the government is considering a range of measures including debt forgiveness, driving lessons, and free housing in the name of integrating returning extremists. Last week, another damning report showed the Swedish government had still been paying many Islamists through the generous Swedish welfare system whilst they were fighting in Iraq and Syria. Ranstorp, who was one of the authors of the report, said the main problem was the Swedish government refusing to follow up on welfare claimants to check whether they were in the country or ensuring that someone else wasn’t collecting benefits on their behalf.

6954,San Francisco Chronicle Admits: Some Anti-Trump Protesters are Paid - Breitbart,"Despite the left’s attempt to deny it, some   protesters are indeed paid to show up  —   including those from a growing number of tech companies who are paying their employees to participate in   rallies. [The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Saturday, in an article titled “Bay Area demonstrators may be paid to protest, by employers,” that the “common accusation lobbed at liberal protesters” that “they’re being paid to protest” is at least partially based in fact.  According to the Chronicle, “an increasing number of companies have unveiled policies that allow employees to take paid time off work for political or civic activities, such as protesting, canvassing, voting, volunteering or even running for office. ” The progressive movement’s vocal opposition to President Donald Trump has translated into employers (at least, those who can afford it) providing paid leave as a way to increase political engagement after what many of them took as a devastating loss. Adam Kleinberg, CEO of San Francisco marketing firm Traction, reportedly allows employees two paid “Days of Action” to participate in political rallies and protests annually. “It’s not sufficient anymore to say we’re a profit engine and we’re making money and screw everything else. It’s part of our responsibility to be engaged, to be active,” William Morgan, CEO and founder of   startup Buoyant, told the Chronicle. His company reportedly offers about three to four weeks of paid time off to its workers, who are able to use the time for political activity or vacations. “We as individuals, we as companies exist in an ecosystem. We’re only here because there’s this environment around us. It can’t just be a   relationship. ” The Chronicle notes that while the majority of these companies are on the smaller side, and tend to have more liberal workforces, larger companies like Facebook are looking to entertain similar policies. They reportedly told employees that they could use paid leave time to attend and participate in   May Day demonstrations. However, the Chronicle also notes that some companies who offer their employees paid leave for political action have experienced an intense backlash.",0

It was nighttime, and a Palestinian young man came and stabbed him and many, many others with a knife. He killed him and also injured many, many others  …     He did a great service to his country. He served in Iraq and served in Afghanistan. And he came to Israel on a tour in the framework of his school. ” Force was a    West Point graduate who served as a U. S. Army officer in Iraq and Afghanistan before enrolling in graduate school at Vanderbilt University. He was killed in a tourist area in Jaffa Port. At the time of the terrorist murder,   President Joe Biden was meeting with   President Shimon Peres in Tel Aviv when the    Palestinian terrorist went on the stabbing spree claiming Force’s life and injuring many others. “It’s a tourist area,”   said. “The city of Jaffa is near  . It’s a very hopping place at nighttime. There is a boardwalk. Very late, there is a lot of people walking by the beach. And it’s the kind of a place that you do not expect to be killed or stabbed. Anywhere in Israel, it’s not supposed to be dangerous a place. This is a mixed area and there are a lot of Arabs in Jaffa, but the Palestinian who stabbed Taylor Force to death was not an Israeli Arab. He came from the territories and simply decided that he’s going to out tonight and stab Jews. He did not recognize that Taylor Force was not a Jew, and simply killed him with the rest of the people there. ” In response to the terrorist attack that claimed Force’s life, members of the U. S. Congress drafted legislation in his name —  the Taylor force Act —  which would cut U. S. funding to the Palestinian Authority until the organization stopped paying terrorists behind attacks like this and their families. “The Taylor Force Act would take away the amount of money the Palestinians obtain,”   said. “The Palestinians Authority is paying their prisoners, the secure prisoners who are sitting in the Israeli jails being sentenced for killing and for taking acts of murder and acts of terror against civilians, and also the amount of money the Palestinians are paying the families of the suicide bombers. They have been rewarding the families of those who detonate themselves and have killed the civilians. [The bill would take the money out] from the U. S. aid that the U. S. provides the Palestinian Authority. It’s a total sort of deduction. They take the awards that the Palestinian Authority has given, they take it from the prisoners and families, and they take it from what the U. S. gives the Palestinians. ” She explained that it is “shocking” right now that the United States government is funding the Palestinians, who turn around and use the money to fund terrorists and their families after they commit these attacks. “This money is inducing others to go and kill, and as you can see not only Israelis are getting killed on the streets of   and Jerusalem,”   said. “A lot of tourists are getting killed. Israel is a popular country and gets a lot of visits from people all over the world, and Taylor Force was not the first American getting killed in   and unfortunately will not be the last one. The United States knows that part of the money they are giving to the Palestinian Authority is going to pay these prisoners and to pay the families of those who have killed their own civilians, American citizens, and as you say it’s totally ironic, horrible and unbelievable that the administration keeps supporting the Palestinian Authority without demanding right now to bring to a halt right now all these payments to the prisoners and the families of suicide bombers. ” She added that unless the money flow from the United States is completely cut off, there is “not a chance —  not a chance” that the Palestinian Authority would stop using it to fund terrorists and the families of terrorists. The reason being, she said, is because it is in the “culture” of the Palestinians to commit these acts of horror against Israelis and the entire Western World. “They are not going to stop these payments,”   said. “It’s basically their culture. The culture is to promote violence against Israel. They incite people to go and kill. There is indoctrination of the people in the Palestinian Authority, areas to go and learn how to kill. The Palestinian Authority simply sees this payment as its sort of control over the Palestinian population. If they stop paying these funds, they will lose any authority. They will lose any support. They will lose the people. And the Palestinian Authority is doing basically what Hamas is doing, the terrorist organization in Gaza that controls Gaza and Gaza’s government in Gaza. They give their prisoners funds. They pay stipends to their prisoners and their families who went and lost people bombing themselves. They can’t really leave the market, leave the area just to Hamas, otherwise people will go and be loyal to Hamas. There is competition between the Palestinian Authority, which is headed by the PLO, and Hamas, which is a terrorist organization which controls the Gaza Strip —  which complicates the situation. Therefore, talking about it, as President Trump is doing, will not get the job done. ” President Donald Trump, in his White House meeting with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas per White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s readout of the meeting, pressed Abbas on the payments to the terrorists. “President Trump raised his concerns about payments to Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails who have committed terrorist acts, and to their families, and emphasized the need to resolve this issue,” the White House readout from Spicer’s office read. White House sources tell Breitbart News that Spicer was instrumental in raising this issue with President Trump ahead of that Abbas meeting, providing the president with key information about the issue of Palestinian payments to terrorist and terrorists’ families. In a   meeting in Israel between Trump and Abbas during President Trump’s   foreign trip, Trump was reportedly furious with Abbas after learning that Abbas apparently misled him in the Washington, D. C. White House meeting. “You tricked me in Washington,” Trump reportedly said to Abbas behind closed doors in Israel, per an Israeli television station. On Monday, Abbas confidante Ahmad Majdalani told the Jerusalem Post that the reports of a heated meeting with Trump are “a total fabrication and a lie. ” Netanyahu has also bashed Abbas for inaccurately claiming Palestinians promote peace. “I heard President Abbas yesterday say that the Palestinians teach their children peace,” Netanyahu said. “Unfortunately, that’s not true. They name their schools after mass murderers of Israelis and they pay terrorists. ”   said that for President Trump to extract real action on this front and make progress toward peace, real action must happen —  and that starts with the Taylor Force Act. “There must be an act to be taken,” she said. “There must be more than just simple words, more than just an idea. We all know that the Palestinian Authority is paying this money. We all know, a few years ago they removed themselves from these payments asking the PLO to go make these payments, not the Palestinian Authority, so Mahmoud Abbas can come to President Trump and say, ‘listen, it’s not me. I was paying more. It’s the PLO.’ But let us not forget that Mahmoud Abbas is the head of the PLO in addition to his position as the head of the Palestinian Authority. So, to make a long story short, the Palestinian Authority will not halt these payments, and if President Trump is not going to take a serious step, they will just keep paying this money that induces and incites more terror attacks against civilians. ” She added that while there is widespread support for the Taylor Force Act in both chambers of the   U. S. congress, “there is no guarantee that it would pass. ” “Therefore there must be a push —  listeners of your radio show must call up their elected representatives and urge them to push to get this law passed,”   said. “The State Department always objected to any deduction to the Palestinian Authority, to any prevention of ‘aid’ to the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians always have to get their money. The United States is always one of the largest providers of the Palestinian Authority’s finances. They pay a large amount of their budget and therefore they have great leverage on the Palestinian Authority, but it’s not going to get done if there won’t be a public support and public urge to pass this law. So the listeners, the American citizens who care about civilian life, who care about human rights, who care about the life of Israelis and Americans in Israel have to push for this law to pass by urging their representatives to make it happen. ” Representatives for House Speaker Paul Ryan have not responded to requests for comment when asked why Ryan has not yet held a vote on this bill when there is clear bipartisan support for the legislation and it would easily pass the House of Representatives at this time, per Breitbart News sources on the Hill. The White House did not have a comment when asked about this bill or about the Israeli news reports on Trump’s reportedly heated meeting with Abbas in Israel.

6956,Obscured American: Eddie the Housepainter,"  => Eddie and Friends 
When 46-year-old Eddie found out I’d been interviewing people, he wanted to talk. “You can write a book about me!” and that’s true enough, but then again, I’ve never met an uninteresting person. 
Within a minute, Eddie was showing me photos of women on his cell phone. There was plenty of skin and at least one crotch shot. These voluptuous ladies had sent these boudoir selfies to him, Eddie growled, his eyes sparkling. 
Eddie’s a beefy dude, with a head like an Olmec statue. Though he wears a permanent scowl, it’s a friendly scowl. 
Eddie was in Friendly Lounge with his housepainting boss, Tony, an Italian dude who used to live in the neighborhood. 
After talking to Eddie, I checked out his FaceBook page. “im a fun loving guy who just wants peace in my life,” he introduces himself, and the first two photos feature Eddie with white women. In one, he’s in some bar and wearing a white T-shirt, “WHITE GIRLS LOVE ME.” With his arms outstretched, Eddie’s surrounded by eight white females and one bald white guy. The women appear to be in their 30’s and 40’s, though one, wearing granny glasses, has sweated, cursed and imbibed her way through nearly six decades, it seems. You go, grandma! In the other photo, two beaming blondes drape themselves all over Eddie. 
Below these shots, there’s a video of Oprah Winfrey begging her audience to vote for Hillary Clinton, and down the page, there’s a computer animation of Donald Trump making his most grotesque faces while sitting on a toilet. 
Talking to me, Eddie brought up the pains of being rejected by his dad all his life. The rates of American children being born out of wedlock have been rising, calamitously, for decades, and currently stand at around 40%. Among blacks, it’s 72%. 
I’ve known Tony since high school. He lives in the suburbs too. I grew up in West Philly, right around the corner from the zoo, then I moved to the suburbs. I’ve been working with Tony for two years. 
I was in Boston for ten years. The only reason I came back here was because I had the cancer and everything. After they did the surgery, my family wanted me to come back, you know, be closer to home, in case it happens again. 
I was doing work. The customers loved the work. Their relatives were from Boston, and they were like, “Do you travel?” I said, “If it’s worth it, yeah.” 
So they put me on a job up there, and my ex-girlfriend, I stayed at her house for a while, then I bought my own place. When I moved up there, I just got work, work, work, work. 
I loved it up there! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! 
It’s funny because I’m not like most black guys, black people, you know. I love the water, being out there on the water, fishing and all types of stuff, and there are so many bodies of water up there. That’s where I get my peace of mind, you know what I mean? I sit there and don’t have a care in the world. I didn’t have my own boat. I was renting the stuff right there. 
Here, it’s not the same because you can’t get in the water. I love fresh water. Fresh water is beautiful. I like deep sea fishing, salt water and all that, but freshwater is beautiful. 
This whole summer, I didn’t hit the water at all. I didn’t even swim this summer. Did you hear what I just said, Tony? This whole summer, I didn’t even swim. Like, what the fuck! 
They have lakes up there, and they have park rangers and they’ve got grills up there, where you can grill, volleyball nets, all that stuff. 
It’s $4 a car-load, so you can have six people in a car. It only takes $4 to get in there. You can swim, fish, play volleyball, and you can do that almost any time. 
Everybody kept telling me that it’s crazy to move up there, like they’re so prejudiced up there, but they’re not. They were so nice. 
The first day I got up there, people were opening doors for me. They were like, “Hey, how are you doing?!” It was totally different from here, you know, and I loved it, just loved it. 
It’s not racial at all. There were so many mixed couples, so many Brazilians, Ecuadorians, all types. Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Asians, all, all, everything. 
They did have a bad rap, but it’s just not correct. 
They do still have certain areas. They still have these little gangs. Like, one of my buddies wanted to take me to a club. We get there, and I have to park down the street. They had already gone inside the club, but I had to park. When I got close, walking, two dudes stopped me. There was a black guy and a Puerto Rican guy. They were like, “Yo, you got the wrong color on.” 
So I opened my mouth, and I said, “You’ve got to be kidding me,” and I was laughing. “You don’t know my lifestyle. You’re coming at me like that?” 
As soon as I opened my mouth, though, they were like, “Oh, you’re not from around here. Where are you from?” I said I’m from Philly, so they were like, “You’re cool, man.” I laughed at them, basically. 
There are different levels with me. You get mad, you get angry and you get upset, you know what I’m saying? I try not to get angry, at all. Angry takes me to a totally different place, which is not good, so I try not to do that. I try to stay at one focal point and, even though I’m mad at you right now, I’ll still say something stupid so that you laugh. 
Let’s say you’re just bothering me. I’ll walk outside or something, then come back in, and I’ll start fucking with you back, but in a fun way. Even though you were fucking with me in a bad way, I’ll come back and fuck with you, in a good way. ORDER IT NOW 
I always try to turn a negative into a positive. 
You’re not going to defeat me by your words or whatever, you know, because I’m very smart. In the 7th grade, I used to smoke weed and stuff like that, came to class all high, and I still got A’s on my tests. 
They kept me after school, you know, because I was cheating, and I still got the same grade, so they were like, “You’re so smart to be so dumb.” 
My sociology teacher said, “You shouldn’t be getting high. You’re too intelligent for that.” It stuck with me all my life. 
Like, me and him are FaceBook friends. I texted him, “Hey Mr. Coleman, blah, blah, blah. Yo, thank you for saying that to me when I took your class,” and he was like, “Well, Eddie, I don’t remember what I said.” I told him, “You said that I was so smart to be so dumb,” and I always took that into my brain. 
My kids are mixed. I love white women. Ha, ha, ha! 
We all bleed the same damn color. People don’t realize that racism is taught. If you take an Asian kid, a black kid and a white kid and put them in the sandbox, they’re going to play, until somebody say they can’t play with that child. 
It’s the parents. The parents may come up to that kid, “Get out of there! You can’t play with them!” You know what I mean? The kids will act how kids act. They don’t know no better. They’ll play! 
Me, I have no problems at all. You respect me, I respect you. 
Like I said, I have mixed kids, but growing up, I was shot at because I was black. I walked through the wrong neighborhood. Somebody tried to shoot me with a harpoon! I’ve been through some shit. I can’t help it if I’m black. I can’t help that. 
That’s what he does, you know, scuba diving. He didn’t hit me. I was lucky I got pushed out of the way. This was growing up in the suburbs, Lansdowne, Yeadon, Upper Darby. I got shot at, you know what I mean, because I walked on the sidewalk. 
Cops in Darby, they beat me up. It was a domestic call. My wife was white, OK? We had kids, mixed kids. The argument was next door, not my house, but they came at my house, threw me down the steps, beat me up, put me in a cop car, then turned around and told me, “If you don’t want to go to the hospital, you better give me your address,” so I gave them my address. 
They were like, “You don’t live there. A white girl lives there.” They were like, “Where you live at?” I gave them the address again. They were like, “You don’t live there! You go to the hospital,” so guess what? I went to the hospital. They beat me the fuck up! 
They took me from my house. She was living there, with me! 
I couldn’t even fight back. My wife said, “That’s my husband,” but they made her go back in the house. This was ‘92. 
I came home the next day. They ripped my shirt. I had a button shirt. They cut it in the back, with a razor, so I’m walking in my shirt with a hole in it. They made me walk home without no shoes. 
So I went to my old neighborhood. I talked to my mom and all that, and we went to the Lansdowne police station, because we knew an officer there. They said there was nothing they could do about it, because there’s a code of silence among the police officers, or so they said, so my sister took it to a different level. 
I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of Mary Mason? WHAT? My sister took it to a radio station. They had a picture of me. They had a picture of my clothes. They had a picture of me all beat up and everything. 
Over nothing! Over nothing! Literally. I was beaten up over nothing! 
I ended up suing them but, again, I was young, so I settled out of court with them. I ended up getting, like, $45,000. If I kept it going, I would have gotten a whole lot more. 
Like I said, again, then I was selling drugs. I had an arsenal. I had guns and stuff like that, you know. I was going to blow the police station the fuck up, you know what I mean, but the police station was right next to a school, so I couldn’t do that. 
No, I didn’t have a record then. I never got caught. 
They were arguing next door. It wasn’t us! They went to the wrong house and fucked me up! 
I’ve got three friends that are police officers. I trust them, but I don’t trust those other ones. As soon as I saw them, it’s, “Yes, sir,” whatever, but they threw me to the ground and worked me over! 
For two years, they harassed me. They banned me from that town. If they saw me driving, they’d pull me over. They were like, “You’ve got two minutes to get out of this town!” 
I had to move back to my mom for a little while. My wife and kids, too. 
I never got bitter over that. I get sick of reading stuff now in the news. I think about my children’s security. It pisses me off, you know. 
Like I said, again, I already lived that life. Innocent people getting beaten up by the cops, getting killed, that could have been me, I could have gotten killed. That night. 
What I was doing was, I was avoiding that act, you know, which was kind of hard to do, because certain roads led that way, so I had to take back streets just to keep away. Again, I was still young too. 
I was going to blow the hell out of that police station, you know what I mean? I had the artillery to do it, but, again, glory to God and all that. God had my back! Otherwise, that police station and whoever was in it was gone! ORDER IT NOW 
There’s a kid that I went to school with, they killed him in a cell. Now, when they put you in that cell, they take your shoe strings, they take your belt and they take your shirt from you, so how are you going to hang yourself? He’s 6-4. How do you hang yourself when you’re 6-4 and you’re in a 6-foot cell? You can’t! 
He was a good kid, but he was a bad kid, you know what I mean? I forget how he got locked up. He got locked up for something. They killed him the same night. They locked him up, then they killed him. You can look it up. It’s on the internet still. 
My wife stayed with me. Five years later, we split up, but it wasn’t over that. I had three children with her, my oldest three. 
She got mad because I moved on. I had another woman. I was just having another kid. I had a reason to dump her, you know what I mean? If you’re in a relationship, and you’re not growing. You’re supposed to grow together. She cheated on me. I’m sure she did. She got caught twice, so when she started doing it, I started doing it. 
She did it first, she did it first, she started it. 
All I did was work. I worked, then came home, I swear to God! I was bringing home $1,300 cash a week. I was taking out vent systems, heaters, boilers and all that. I was bringing all this money home. It’s heavy work, back-breaking stuff. All you wanted to do was go home to your shower and that’s it. Eat, then sleep. 
I was mad because she was collecting welfare. It’s like, “Why are you collecting welfare?” We’ve got plenty of money. We had a good life. It’s because of her girlfriends. It was like, “You can get this, you get that.” Now, I had no insurance and stuff. I told her, “You can get the medical, and you can get the food stamps, but don’t get the cash,” but she went out and got it all. She got all the benefits, so I ended up in the system. 
I told the judge, “How are you locking me up, when my kids live with me? Like, what are you talking about? This is my house. My kids live with me and everything.” Well, it was because of her, she was getting welfare, but I didn’t know. 
I was getting locked up for a month here, a month there, you know. When they locked you up in the state of Pennsylvania, they suspended your license, so how could you get to work? If you had a driving job, you couldn’t do it. It’s fucked up! 
I told the judge, again, here you go, “My kids live with me. I don’t owe her nothing. Why am I here? If you look at the record, you’ll understand what I’m talking about here. I’m confused. You guys locked me up, like, six fuckin’ times,” so he said, “Ma’am, why is he here?” 
“Oh, I’m trying to get more money, blah, blah, blah blah,” so he looked and found out that she had a warrant out, so he said to me, “Mr. Calvin, you want me to lock her up? What she’s doing is welfare fraud.” 
I said, “Your honor, no.” I said no. “We’re not together no more. I didn’t suffer from you guys. I was in the system. I was in jail six times, but I’m done now.” I said, “No, that’s my kids’ mother. Don’t lock her up.” 
He went to her, and he said, “Ma’am, this is a hell of a nice guy. Why did you do this to him?” She had no answer. 
She was acting real stupid. I looked at her and I said, “I told you you wasn’t going to get no money.” That’s what I said to her. “I told you you weren’t going to get no money. The judge could have locked you up, no matter what I said. You heard what he said. It was welfare fraud. You’re stupid for even bringing me in here.” 
I had three kids with her, my oldest three. 
I have a kid that’s getting ready to turn four, up in Boston. All of my other kids are here. I’ve got 24, 21, 20, 16, 15 and one that’s getting ready to turn four. I grew up without a father, so I was going to make sure I’m not going to be like my father, you know what I mean? 
My three oldest, I put money into their accounts, in their names. They each have $50,000 in their bank account, right now. They’ve got more money than I do. Now, my younger ones, my 16 and 15-year-old, they’ve got about $10,000. The baby don’t have shit, you know what I mean, but she’s going to get hers. 
I was doing the smart thing with the money. Like I said, I grew up without a father, so I’m going to provide for my kids, no matter what. I’ll suffer later, but as long as my kids are OK, then I’m happy. 
When I did get to know my father, I met him in church. I was 16 years old when I got to meet my father. I went to church with my mom. 
I was 16. Again, I was selling drugs, but I was also working at McDonald’s and going to school. 
He comes into church, sits behind us and goes like this to my mom. Taps on her shoulder, “Who’s that?” She almost cursed in church. “It’s a shame you don’t know your own son!” I turned around and almost flipped, but then I realized I was in church. I was like, “You made me and you don’t know who I am?!” 
When she got pregnant by him, she was with him for, like, five years. She said, “I’m pregnant,” and the next day, he was gone. My father did this to five other women, the same exact thing, because I have five brothers. He did the same thing to each one of the women. 
My father, I almost killed him, in church. I was so angry. Yeaah. Yeaah. I was like, “How can you not know who I am? Where was you at?” Like, “Why don’t you want me? What did I do to you? I didn’t do anything to you. You made me,” but there was nothing, not a fuckin’ word, not a fuckin’ word. ORDER IT NOW 
I never called him dad. I never called him pop. There was nothing until I turned 18. When we graduated high school, I paid for his parking to come see me graduate. That’s fucked up. 
Now, my grandfather and grandma loved the shit out of me. I knew them. I knew them since I was three! 
My grandparents, they loved me. They knew who I was. My grandpop and grandmom used to always brag about me when I walked down the street, when I walked by the house, everything like that. They’d say, “There goes my grandson.” They would tell people,” There’s my grandson.” 
My father came to my graduation because I begged him to come. Face to face, I was like, “I’m your son. Aren’t you proud of me for graduating, at least?” He was like, “Well, she has money.” 
I paid for his parking. I paid for his ticket. We got, like, three graduation tickets, and you had to pay for two more. I paid for it. I paid for him. It was $10 or something. He didn’t want to pay $10 to see his son graduate. 
That’s why I made a promise to myself. I said that when I have kids, no matter what happens between me and the girl, my kids are going to know who I am, and that I was there, so that’s what I’ve done. 
Tony gets mad that a lot of his crew don’t have cars and stuff, but when my son, my first born, made me a grandpa, I gave him my truck. 
I know what it’s like to be on a bus with kids, grocery shopping and all that, with the kid wrapped around you, and you carrying bags and getting on a bus. I know what it’s like, so I gave him my truck. 
I told Tony, “I ain’t got no vehicle, man. I gave it to my son. I ain’t got no car!” But it made me feel good, because I would never be like my father. Never! 
When I hear people, because I hear people all the time, like how they hate their mom, how they hate their dad, and I’m like, I can see how you hate your dad, and you must have a reason, but at least you’re living together. I didn’t have that. All I had was my mom. You’ve got a mom and a dad, so you should be happy, you’re lucky, because I didn’t have that.

6957,"FBI’s Suspect for Anti-Semitic Threats: Bernie Voter, Fake News Reporter - Breitbart","The Department of Justice unsealed a complaint against a journalist who made national headlines for fabricating stories after he allegedly conducted a campaign of harassment against at least eight Jewish community centers while cyberstalking his   on Friday. [The FBI arrested Juan Thompson in St. Louis on Friday, and he’s due to appear in court in Manhattan. Thompson’s arrest is the first since Jewish community centers and schools were targeted for threats and harassment across the country.  “Together with the FBI and the NYPD, we have been investigating the recent threats made on Jewish Community Centers in New York and around the country,” said U. S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. “Today, we have charged Juan Thompson with allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the   League. ” “Thompson’s alleged pattern of harassment not only involved the defamation of his female victim, but his threats intimidated an entire community,” added FBI Assistant    William F. Sweeney Jr. in the statement. This isn’t the first time Thompson has appeared in headlines. Last February, The Intercept revealed he fabricated sources in stories and made up quotes out of whole cloth. When confronted about this egregious breach of journalistic standards, he blamed racism and “testicular cancer” in a letter sent to the Intercept’s    and the   Gawker. “I’ve been undergoing radiation treatment for testicular cancer and, since I no longer have health insurance, I’ve been feverishly struggling and figuring out how to pay for my treatment. All of this, of course, has taken up my time and energy except for the few moments I’ve spent searching for some relief,” Thompson said, adding: “I lack access to my notebooks (which I took for most stories) to address these matters. ” “I had a habit of writing drafts of stories, placing the names of ppl I wanted to get quotes from in there, and then going to fetch the quotes,” he continued in his letter. “Was it sloppy? Yes? But I’m a cub reporter and expected a sustained and competent editor to guide me, something which I never had at your company and something with which The Intercept continues to struggle as everyone in this business knows. ” Thompson blamed the “Great Problem” of “white media organizations” for failing to understand his approach to journalism: If I couldn’t obtain a quote from the person I wanted, I went somewhere else, and must’ve forgot to change the names —  clearly. Also, yes I encouraged some of my interviewees to use another name they’re poor black people who didn’t want their names in the public given the situations and that was the only was of convincing them otherwise. That also explains why some of them didn’t want to talk with your company’s research team or denied the events. These weren’t articles in Harpers or The Nation. Instead, these are the lives of people forgotten by society and their being in public and talking to white, NY people, no less, could harm and turn them off. They’ve lost loved ones to violence you and others couldn’t possibly imagine. Ultimately, the journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically. This dilemma is the Great Problem with the white media organizations that dominate our media landscape. As   Coates wrote: “The standard [white] progressive approach of the moment is to mix   moral invective with   public policy. ” Such an approach ignores the differences in the way we must navigate these various fields: including journalism. The Intercept published an apology after discovering three of Thompson’s fake news reporting while he worked from November 2014 to January 2016 for them. “Thompson went to great lengths to deceive his editors, creating an email account to impersonate a source and lying about his reporting methods,” the letter said. In one fake news story that went viral, Thompson made up a fictional source called “Scott Roof,” a   cousin of   Dylann Roof’s, who claimed Roof slaughtered nine black parishioners after “he kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back. ” Thompson’s Twitter account also reveals he supported socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. “I voted for Bernie Sanders, but his supporters are annoying as fuck. ‘I almost cried when I got a Bernie sign’. Yuck,” he tweeted in July. This puts Sanders in an awkward position. Only days before Thompson’s arrest, he told J Street: “I hope very much that President Trump and his political adviser Mr. Bannon understand that the entire world is watching, that it is imperative that their voices be loud and clear in condemning  . ” Thompson posted many harassing messages about his  . “Two wks ago it was a visit from the FBI. Right now the Secret Service. This racist white garbage [omitted] is trash,” read one tweet. “. @SecretService [My  ] has made death threats against Trump. And talked about how she wanted to kill him and his kids. Look at her,” Thompson continued on Twitter, before tweeting at Secret Service that she made threats against the president. “. @SecretService [Omitted] a disgusting nasty racist white woman, who filed a false lie against me, has threatened to kill Trump. ” “The @SecretService visited me looked at my tweets, questioned my politics   some awful white woman I date reported me. I won’t be silenced,” he continued. “Y’all know how to get a social worker in NY barred? I’m being stalked and harassed by a white nasty white woman  …     in NYC. ” Thompson also pinned a tweet with a   rant against the victim, adding: “Know any good lawyers? Need to stop this   #whitegirl I dated who sent a bomb threat in my name  wants me to be raped in jail. ” The Twitter account was verified as Thompson’s by the U. S.

6958,Assange: Donald Trump Won’t Be Allowed to Win – Clinton & ISIS Funded by Same Interests,"
In an excerpt of a John Pilger Special interview, Julian Assange says that emails released by Wikileaks show that Hillary Clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which US allies are supporting ISIS, and that Donald Trump will not be allowed into the oval office.
Assange explains that the same financial interests funding ISIS are funding Clinton. He references a 2014 email from John Podesta to Clinton, in which we find the following:
While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.

“I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection,” said Assange. “All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ‘rogue’ princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.”
Pilger asked Assange about the possibility that Trump would steal the election with the help of Russia, as many in the Democratic party claim.
Assange thinks that this is highly unlikely, but not because he is unpopular. “My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them establishment,” he explained.
Assange says that Hillary is the establishment pick. “Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.” Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/un-votes-to-ban-nuclear-weapons-in-2017.html On October 27, 2016, the United Nations Committee For Nuclear Disarmament voted in favor of a resolution to begin negotiations on a treaty in 2017 which will aim to outlaw destructive(fission) nuclear weapons. 123 voted in favor of the resolution, which was created by Austria, Brazil, South Africa, Ireland, Mexico and Nigeria, while 38 voted against and 16 abstained from voting either way.Not surprisingly, four of the five big UN Security Council nuclear powers voted against the resolution, which included France, U.S. Britain and Russia. The fifth country, China, abstained from the vote. 123 countries voted in favor of the resolution. Ref. Interestingly, Japan voted against the resolution, even though nuclear fission bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki many years ago.In a very surprising move, North Korea voted in favor of the disarmament resolution and said they will bring in a, “legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination.” Kate Hudson, who is the Chair for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said : “It’s very encouraging to see so many countries say loud and clear it’s time for the world to move on from nuclear weapons. We have united before to ban biological and chemical weapons, landmines and cluster bombs, and now the international community is taking decisive steps to ban nuclear weapons.” The world wants peace. Ref. In addition to the U.N. vote, the European Parliament adopted it’s own resolution which was supported by 415 votes, opposed by 124 and 74 chose not to vote. This is another positive step forward as the European nations can help to add great weight to a resolution to finally disarm the world of destructive nuclear weapons.The resolution will be put forth to the UN General Assembly in December and is now likely to pass, which will then pave the way for further negotiations to take place in March, June and July of 2017.Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, described the vote as a “historic moment” in the decades-long drive for a nuclear-free world. “This treaty won’t eliminate nuclear weapons overnight. But it will establish a powerful, new international legal standard, stigmatizing nuclear weapons and compelling nations to take urgent action on disarmament.” Fission vs. Fusion It must be remembered though that there are differences when someone says or writes “nuclear energy.” Nuclear fission is the destructive kind. It’s the kind that was used for the atomic bombs in Japan. Nuclean fusion is harmless, clean and can produce what is known as “free energy.”According to Duke Energy :Both fission and fusion are nuclear reactions that produce energy, but the applications are not the same.Fission is the splitting of a heavy, unstable nucleus into two lighter nuclei, and fusion is the process where two light nuclei combine together releasing vast amounts of energy.For example, the Sun is a massive producer of nuclear fusion energy, which is what scientists are working on to try and create “free energy.”The world must push for the disarmament of nuclear fission technology and must simultaneously push for the advancement of nuclear fusion technology. The world is moving in a peaceful direction and this is further evidence of such claims. What do you think will happen in 2017 with these negotiations? By Lance Schuttler  ",0

Ancient manuscript tells of ancient giant race visiting Earth. 
The Qumran caves in the West Bank have been considered a veritable treasure trove for historians, particularly those specialising in ancient literature and mythology. Sixty years ago, archaeologists unearthed an ancient book in these caves which is referred to as ‘The Book of Giants’. This text gives the details about an ancient race of otherworldly creatures who existed and eventually died out on Earth. 
At this current time, there is very little that historians can deduce about the authorship of ‘The Book of Giants’. However, it has been noted that there are remarkable crossovers between this mysterious text and other known ancient manuscripts such as the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh and the apocryphal Book of Enoch. Related Articles Dogs mysteriously fall ill after being walked in British UFO location Rendlesham Forest 
[Mahway] mounted up in the air like strong winds, and flew with his hands like eagles […he left behind] the inhabited world and passed over Desolation, the great desert […]and Enoch saw him and hailed him, and Mahway said to him […] hither and thither a second time to Mahway […]The Giants await your words and all the monsters of the earth. If […]has been carried […] from the days of […]their […] and they would be added […] we would know from you their meaning […] two hundred trees that from heaven came down… 
The Book of the Giants describes the creatures as ‘two hundred trees from heaven’ which came down and populated the planet Earth. They are described as a corrupt and debased species, prone to hideous acts of violence and unnatural acts with animals and human beings. After a period of years, one of the giants Mahway, started to experience prophetic dreams. These dreams saw a tablet bearing the names of everyone on Earth being submerged beneath the water. When the tablet rose again, all but three of the names had been washed away by the waves. This particular passage has been interpreted as referring to the survival of Noah and his family after the great flood. 
It was when Mahway shared these visions with his fellow giants that they realised the futility of attempting to resist the forces of heaven. They decided to seek out Enoch and ask him to plead to God on their behalf. Enoch is an ancient Jewish mythological figure believed to be the great-grandfather of Noah. He has a reference in the Book of Genesis where he is described as having a special, personal relationship with God. He lived for an astonishing three hundred and sixty-five years before simply disappearing with God one day. Enoch interceded on behalf of the Giants and delivered a damning judgement to them from God. However, he promised them that there was some hope for their redemption. 
It is assumed that the Giants were washed away in the great flood that devastated the world several generations after that. What the race did in the interim is still a matter of great mystery. Another mystery is what this giant race could have been. The fact that they are described as coming down from heaven strongly suggests that there were of an extra-terrestrial origin, which has led some to speculate that the ‘giants’ may have been the heavily mythologised race of ancient aliens called the Nephilim. 
The Book of Giants explains how the Nephilim caused chaos on Earth and changed everything during that time. A summary statement of the descent of the wicked angels, bringing both knowledge and havoc. Compare Genesis 6:1-2, 4. 
1Q23 Frag. 9 + 14 + 15 2[ . . . ] they knew the secrets of [ . . . ] 3[ . . . si]n was great in the earth [ . . . ] 4[ . . . ] and they killed manY [ . . ] 5[ . . . they begat] giants [ . . . ]

The outcome of the demonic corruption was violence, perversion, and a brood of monstrous beings. Compare Genesis 6:4. 
4Q531 Frag. 2 [ . . . ] they defiled [ . . . ] 2[ . . . they begot] giants and monsters [ . . . ] 3[ . . . ] they begot, and, behold, all [the earth was corrupted . . . ] 4[ . . . ] with its blood and by the hand of [ . . . ] 5[giant’s] which did not suffice for them and [ . . . ] 6[ . . . ] and they were seeking to devour many [ . . . ] 7[ . . . ] 8[ . . . ] the monsters attacked it.

The giants begin to be troubled by a series of dreams and visions. Mahway, the titan son of the angel Barakel, reports the first of these dreams to his fellow giants. He sees a tablet being immersed in water. When it emerges, all but three names have been washed away. The dream evidently symbolizes the destruction of all but Noah and his sons by the Flood . 
2Q26 [ . . . ] they drenched the tablet in the wa[ter . . . ] 2[ . . . ] the waters went up over the [tablet . . . ] 3[ . . . ] they lifted out the tablet from the water of [ . . . ] 
The giant goes to the others and they discuss the dream. 
4Q530 Frag.7 [ . . . this vision] is for cursing and sorrow. I am the one who confessed 2[ . . . ] the whole group of the castaways that I shall go to [ . . . ] 3[ . . . the spirits of the sl]ain complaining about their killers and crying out 4[ . . . ] that we shall die together and be made an end of [ . . . ] much and I will be sleeping, and bread 6[ . . . ] for my dwelling; the vision and also [ . . . ] entered into the gathering of the Giants 8[ . . . ] 
6Q8 [ . . . ] Ohya and he said to Mahway [ . . . ] 2[ . . . ] without trembling. Who showed you all this vision, [my] brother? 3[ . . . ] Barakel, my father, was with me. 4[ . . . ] Before Mahway had finished telling what [he had seen . . . ] 5[ . . . said] to him, Now I have heard wonders! If a barren woman gives birth [ . . . ] 
4Q530 Frag. 4 3[There]upon Ohya said to Ha[hya . . . ] 4[ . . . to be destroyed] from upon the earth and [ . . . ] 5[ . . . the ea]rth. When 6[ . . . ] they wept before [the Giants . . . ] 
4Q530 Frag. 7 3[ . . . ] your strength [ . . . ] 4[ . . . ] 5Thereupon Ohya [said] to Hahya [ . . . ] Then he answered, It is not for 6us, but for Azaiel, for he did [ . . . the children of] angels 7are the Giants, and they would not let all their poved ones] be neglected [. . . we have] not been cast down; you have strength [ . . . ] 
The Giants realize the futility of fighting against the forces of heaven. The first speaker may be Gilgamesh. 
4Q531 Frag. 1 3[ . . . I am a] giant, and by the mighty strength of my arm and my own great strength 4[ . . . any]one mortal, and I have made war against them; but I am not [ . . . ] able to stand against them, for my opponents 6[ . . . ] reside in [Heav]en, and they dwell in the holy places. And not 7[ . . . they] are stronger than I. 8[ . . . ] of the wild beast has come, and the wild man they call [me].

Ohya’s dream vision is of a tree that is uprooted except for three of its roots; the vision’s import is the same as that of the first dream. 
6Q8 Frag. 2 1three of its roots [ . . . ] [while] I was [watching,] there came [ . . . they moved the roots into] 3this garden, all of them, and not [ . . . ] 
Ohya tries to avoid the implications of the visions. Above he stated that it referred only to the demon Azazel; here he suggests that the destruction isfor the earthly rulers alone. 
4Q530 Col. 2 1concerns the death of our souls [ . . . ] and all his comrades, [and Oh]ya told them what Gilgamesh said to him 2[ . . . ] and it was said [ . . . ] “concerning [ . . . ] the leader has cursed the potentates” 3and the giants were glad at his words. Then he turned and left [ . . . ] 
More dreams afflict the giants. The details of this vision are obscure, but it bodes ill for the giants. The dreamers speak first to the monsters, then to the giants. 
Thereupon two of them had dreams 4and the sleep of their eye, fled from them, and they arose and came to [ . . . and told] their dreams, and said in the assembly of [their comrades] the monsters 6[ . . . In] my dream I was watching this very night 7[and there was a garden . . . ] gardeners and they were watering 8[ . . . two hundred trees and] large shoots came out of their root 9[ . . . ] all the water, and the fire burned all 10[the garden . . . ] They found the giants to tell them 11[the dream . . . ] 
Someone suggests that Enoch be found to interpret the vision. 
[ . . . to Enoch] the noted scribe, and he will interpret for us 12the dream. Thereupon his fellow Ohya declared and said to the giants, 13I too had a dream this night, O giants, and, behold, the Ruler of Heaven came down to earth 14[ . . . ] and such is the end of the dream. [Thereupon] all th e giants [and monsters! grew afraid 15and called Mahway. He came to them and the giants pleaded with him and sent him to Enoch 16[the noted scribe]. They said to him, Go [ . . . ] to you that 17[ . . . ] you have heard his voice. And he said to him, He wil1 [ . . . and] interpret the dreams [ . . . ] Col. 3 3[ . . . ] how long the giants have to live. [ . . . ]

6961,Comment on Death of the 2-party system: GOP bigwigs formally endorse Hillary Clinton by aroamingcatholicny,"Posted on August 4, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 51 Comments 
Whatever happens on November 8, Donald Trump can claim this achievement: His candidacy exposed the fact that the two-party system of Democrats and Republicans is an illusion. 
What we have in the U.S. instead is a corrupt polity where Democrat and Republican élites form a single ruling party, as Professor Emeritus Angelo M. Codevilla stunningly asserted in 2010. (See “ America’s Bipartisan Ruling Class vs. the People “) 
The evidence? 
The following list of Republican bigwigs who, by publicly declaring their support for Hillary Clinton — the pathological liar who had accomplished nothing as secretary of state, but violated U.S. laws and jeopardized national security with her unsecured private email server; lied about and left four Americans to die in Benghazi; and supports the absolute “right” of women to kill their unborn — instead of Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump, have peeled away their masks, revealing their true faces. 
Here’s a list of the Republican élites who have declared they’ll vote for Hillary: Dan Akerson , former chairman and chief executive of General Motors: ‘‘Serving as the leader of the free world requires effective leadership, sound judgment, a steady hand and, most importantly, the temperament to deal with crises large and small. Donald Trump lacks each of these characteristics.’’ Marc Andreessen , venture capitalist: ‘‘[Silicon] Valley wouldn’t be here, we wouldn’t be doing any of this if we didn’t have the amazing flow of immigrants that we’ve had in the last 80 years. And the idea of choking that off just makes me sick to my stomach.’’ Richard Armitage , deputy secretary of state and adviser to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush: Trump ‘‘doesn’t appear to be a Republican, he doesn’t appear to want to learn about issues. So I’m going to vote for Mrs. Clinton.’’ Max Boot , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to GOP presidential candidates: ‘‘I’m literally losing sleep over Donald Trump. She would be vastly preferable to Trump.’’ Sally Bradshaw , former top Jeb Bush adviser, who told CNN that she left the GOP and became an independent because of Trump: “As much as I don’t want another four years of Obama’s policies, I can’t look my children in the eye and tell them I voted for Donald Trump.’’ Arne Carlson , a former two-term Republican governor of Minnesota who supported Obama. Jim Cicconi , former Reagan and George H.W. Bush aide: ‘‘Hillary Clinton is experienced, qualified and will make a fine president. The alternative, I fear, would set our nation on a very dark path.’’ Eliot Cohen , former Bush administration official who has been called “the most influential neocon in academe,” declared Clinton “the lesser evil, by a large margin.” Maria Comella , former spokeswoman for governors Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani: ‘‘Instead of speaking out against instances of bigotry, racism and inflammatory rhetoric whether it’s been against women, immigrants, or Muslims, we made a calculus that it was better to say nothing at all in the interest of politics and winning elections.’’ Doug Elmets , former Reagan spokesman: ‘‘I could live with four years of Hillary Clinton before I could ever live with one day of Donald Trump as president.’’ Elmets spoke at the Democratic National Convention, along with other Republicans now backing Clinton. Mike Fernandez , $4 million to GOP candidates in recent years: ‘‘If I have a choice — and you can put it in bold — if I have a choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton, I’m choosing Hillary. She’s the lesser of two evils.’’ Charles Fried , US solicitor general under Reagan and current Harvard Law School professor: ‘‘Though long a registered Republican, this will be the third consecutive presidential election in which my party forces the choice between party and, in John McCain’s words, putting America first. . . . It is to [Mitt] Romney’s credit that this year, like John Paulson and George Will, he is standing up against the brutal, substantively incoherent, and authoritarian tendencies of Donald Trump.” Richard Hanna , a “moderate” Republican Congressman (NY) who is retiring this year, told The Syracuse Post Standard he will support Hillary because Trump is unfit to lead: “I think Trump is a national embarrassment. Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?” Ben Howe , contributing editor at RedState.com. Robert Kagan , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; former Reagan State Department aide and adviser to the campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney; will vote for Hillary. Peter Mansoor , retired Army colonel and former aide to disgraced general David Petraeus: ‘‘It will be the first Democratic presidential candidate I’ve voted for in my adult life.’’ Hamid Moghadam , chairman and chief executive of Prologis: ‘‘Our country is about tolerance and inclusion and that’s why, as a lifelong Republican supporter, I endorse Hillary Clinton for president in this election.’’ William Oberndorf , $3 million to GOP candidates since 2012: ‘‘If it is Trump vs. Clinton, and there is no viable third-party candidate, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.’’ Henry Paulson , treasury secretary to George W. Bush. Paulson wrote: “When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump. ‘I will not cast a write-in vote. I’ll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world. To my Republican friends: I know I’m not alone.’’ Larry Pressler , former three-term Republican senator from South Dakota: ‘‘I can’t believe I’m endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, but I am. If someone had told me 10 years ago I would do this, I wouldn’t have believed them.’’ Chuck Robbins , chief executive of Cisco. Mark Salter , former top adviser to John McCain: ‘‘Whatever Hillary Clinton’s faults, she’s not ignorant or hateful or a nut. She acts like an adult and understands the responsibilities of an American president. That might not be a ringing endorsement. But in 2016, the year of Trump’s s campaign, it’s more than enough.’’ Kori Schake , National Security Council and State Department aide. Robert Smith , former judge on New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals: ‘‘This year, I’m going to vote for a Democrat for president — the first time I’ve done it in 36 years — and I think the decision is easy. Hillary Clinton is the only responsible choice, and I don’t understand why so few of my fellow conservatives see it that way.’’ Brent Scowcroft , chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board and adviser to three previous GOP presidents: ‘‘The presidency requires the judgment and knowledge to make tough calls under pressure . . . [Clinton] has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.’’ Craig Snyder , former chief of staff to then-Republican former senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and also an ex-colleague of former top Trump adviser Roger Stone and current top Trump adviser Paul Manafort. Alan Steinberg , regional EPA administrator. Mike Treiser , former Mitt Romney aide: ‘‘In the face of bigotry, hatred, violence, and small-mindedness, this time, I’m with her.’’ Meg Whitman , Hewlett Packard executive; former California gubernatorial contender. 
Add to the above list Glenn Beck , the billionaire Koch brothers , Bill Kristol ( National Review ), Mitt Romney , Karl Rove , and Ben Shapiro ( National Review ), who, although not declaring they’ll vote for Hillary, are reported to be adamantly opposed to Trump. 
Here are the Republicans who will vote for the Libertarian Party’s Johnson-Weld ticket and so effectively assure a Hillary win : Martin Avila , CEO of Terra Eclipse, former Digital Campaign Director to former Rep. Ron Paul, member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld’s steering committee. Julie Germany , Interim Executive Director of the White Coat Waste Project, former COO of Generation Opportunity, member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Mason Harrison , head of communications for Crowdpac, former strategist for the campaigns of Gov. Mitt Romney and ex-Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Jon Henke , former adviser to US Sen. Fred Thompson, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and former Sen. George Allen; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Dawson Hodgson , former member, RI State Senate; former Rhode Island State Prosecutor; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Cyrus Krohn , former Republican National Committee e-Campaign Director; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Ed Lopez , former national vice chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus; former member of the national campaign at Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry; co-chair of Republicans for Johnson-Weld initiative. Liz Mair , longtime GOP operative whose group is behind the Facebook ad buy in Utah featuring a racy photo of Melania Trump; the RNC’s first and only online communications director, and has advised US Senator Rand Paul, Governors Scott Walker and Rick Perry, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina on communications; co-chair of Republicans for Johnson-Weld initiative. Kevin Martin , former chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus of Massachusetts; small business owner; co-chair of Republicans for Johnson-Weld initiative. Michael Melendez , former leader of Young Americans for Liberty in Utah and Utah State Central Committee member; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee.

Bush and John McCain presidential campaigns, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s gubernatorial campaign, and at the Republican National Committee; co-chair of Republicans for Johnson-Weld initiative. Moira Bagley Smith , former communications director to Sen. Rand Paul and multiple members of House GOP leadership; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Lyle Stamps , attorney; former White House staffer; leader of Latter-day Saints for Bush during the 2004 election cycle; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Michael Turk , President of Opinion Mover Strategies; former Republican National Committee e-campaign director; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. Luke Williams , New York Times and USA Today best-selling author; Vice President at AECOM; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee.

Keith Velia , finance industry leader; Republican Liberty Caucus of Connecticut Treasurer; Ridgefield Republican Town Committee Associate; member of Republicans for Johnson-Weld steering committee. 
As The Daily Bell observes: 
There is only one party: pro-war and pro-technocratic (corporatist). 
The fundamental mythology of US politics is that the Democrats are socialist-oriented and Republicans believe in freedom and individual human rights. 
But Hillary is corporatist, not socialist…. 
Important Republicans call Trump’s stances “brutal, substantively incoherent, and authoritarian.” 
Strangely, Hillary’s actions and statements provide evidence of the very authoritarianism and brutality that Trump is being accused of. 
When she and her husband entered the White House, one of the very first things Hillary did was fire the staff of the travel office in order to put her own people in place. 
She didn’t just fire the staff however, she also tried to get the head of the office, Director Billy Dale, put in jail for embezzlement. He was subsequently found not guilty and Hillary herself was investigated for initiating the firings and making false accusations. 
Her intimidation and blackmailing of her husband’s lovers is well known by this point- and thus her campaign’s emphasis on “women’s rights” is ironic to say the least. 
Her voting record and statements reveal an individual who is most comfortable with US serial wars abroad, no matter the reason (or lack of reasons). 
Additional accusations against Hillary and her husband include violence and even murder of individuals whose interests diverged from theirs. 
Most notably, Hillary has been accused of orchestrating the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. 
None of this seems to register with Republicans who are “crossing over”…. 
Conclusion: Whatever else takes place during this federal election, the disintegration of the credibility of the two-party system is perhaps the most important development of all.

A full-grown Amur tiger has been caught near the Russian Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and sent for rehabilitation to a special center. The large feline predator is a male weighing 170 kilograms (roughly 375 pounds) that had killed a cow in the town of Artyom about 40 kilometers from Vladivostok, the Amur Tiger Center’s press service reported. 
""On the morning of Oct. 26, a resident of the Artyom town suburb reported to the police that a tiger had killed a cow… That same evening a response team from the hunting supervision agency spotted the tiger using an infrared camera. The predator was immediately caught and brought to the Tiger Rehabilitation and Reintroduction Center in the Alekseyevka settlement,"" the Amur Tiger Center said. 
The tiger will stay at the rehabilitation center while experts determine his future. He may be released into the wild in an area far from human settlements but inhabited with enough ungulates (or hoofed mammals). Ecologists had a similar experience last year, when a tiger named Uporny (or ‘Persistent’) who had been attacking dogs in the Khabarovsk region, was caught and later released into a distant area. Tiger cub found prowling the streets of Vladivostok 
Only a few days ago, another male tiger was caught 20 kilometers away from Vladivostok. The predator not only walked near the city but also entered the city territory. He, too, has been sent to the rehabilitation center. It is a young male tiger weighing 140 kilograms (roughly 308 pounds) who is likely to be released into the wild. 
Several weeks ago reports of a tiger were received from Vladivostok’s neighboring town of Artyom but the search ended without any success. 
The Amur tiger is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. According to the last year’s data, at present only 480-540 members of this species live in the wild, with 90 percent of them inhabiting Russia’s Far Eastern Primorye and Khabarovsk regions.",0

The Russian economy will need at least 10 years to end its oil dependence, according to a statement made by the head of Sberbank, German Gref. 
""A very large amount of today's GDP is based on oil and gas,” he said at a Sberbank conference on Oct. 28. “And it takes time to create an economy with half of the existing digital businesses, to digitize traditional forms of business. I think it will be at least 5 or even 10 years,"" he said.",0
6965,"In Fall of Gorsuch’s Mother, a Painful Lesson in Politicking - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Judge Neil M. Gorsuch’s first taste of    Washington politics was bitter and lingering. He was 15 years old and his mother was a   official in the Reagan administration caught in an ugly showdown with Congress. When she was forced to step down, her reputation in tatters, young Neil was furious. “You should never have resigned,” he told his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, by her later account. “You didn’t do anything wrong. You only did what the president ordered. Why are you quitting? You raised me not to be a quitter. Why are you a quitter?” More than three decades later, Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, has been nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump and faces a political culture even more caustic than the one that destroyed his mother’s public career. Like her, he is a committed conservative and can expect strong opposition, but where she was bold and brash, he has advanced to the pinnacle of the judiciary with understatement and polish. Now 49, he arrives at his own moment of testing as a child of the Reagan revolution who saw up close the promise and the perils. He inherited a frontier skepticism of government rooted in his home of Colorado and nurtured in Washington during the 1980s. An examination of his early, formative years finds that he swam in the liberal waters of Columbia and Harvard and rebelled against the dominant thinking to develop a fully formed conservative philosophy that has propelled him to the threshold of the Supreme Court. Those early years shaped his views on the law and life and provided a searing lesson in the realities of the political world. Despite the family ordeal, friends and relatives said, he emerged from the crucible of his youth tempered about politics yet not soured on public service. He decided to pursue goals similar to his mother’s if only by a different path. The first woman to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Ms. Burford argued that states were better custodians of resources and that market forces would bring more discipline to regulation. As she cut spending and pared back rules, critics called her an enemy of the environment. Her downfall came when, at White House direction, she refused to turn over documents related to a   program. Congress cited her for contempt. “It was an example to him of what the realpolitik of Washington could be like,” said Richard M. Segal, a Harvard Law School classmate who is now a lawyer in San Diego. “He viewed his mother as an environmentalist, and his mother viewed herself as an environmentalist. And meanwhile she was made the poster child of the view that the Reagan administration was just out there to rape the environment. ” The teenager was his mother’s conscience. “Neil knew from the beginning the seriousness of my problems,” she wrote in a memoir before her death in 2004. He was “smart as a whip” and “had an unerring sense of fairness, as do many people his age. ” When she resigned, “he was really upset. ” By most accounts, he did not dwell on it later in life, but it clearly echoed in his work. In preparing a moot court brief at Harvard on workplace safety, he tried to add material concerning the E. P. A. that did not fit, recalled a classmate, Ellen M. Bublick, who is now a law professor at the University of Arizona. In his time as an appeals court judge in Denver, his most notable writings have concerned the power of government regulators. “We talked about that prior history in relation to that,” Professor Bublick said. “He definitely was proud of his mom and had a sense that in the Reagan era certain people took a fall for him in order to protect him. And I think that was really his view of what happened to his mom. ” Neil McGill Gorsuch’s earliest years were spent in the West, where at Rocky Mountain campsites and fishing streams he internalized a faith in rugged individualism. He grew up in a     house in the east Denver neighborhood of Hilltop. His parents, Anne and David Gorsuch, were lawyers who had three children: Neil in 1967, Stephanie in 1969 and J. J. in 1973. His mother raised them Catholic his father was not religious. (Judge Gorsuch is now Episcopalian, according to his brother, possibly inspired by his time studying at Oxford University.) Studious but not standoffish, Neil shared a bedroom with his brother and attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic school. Relatives and friends recalled him lugging stacks of books and once rounding the baseball diamond in   cowboy boots after leaving his athletic shoes at home. “If anybody was going to be the president, it was going to be Neil Gorsuch,” said Gina Carbone, 49, a classmate. In 1976, Ms. Gorsuch was elected to the State Legislature, often aligning herself with a small but powerful group of conservatives, called the “House Crazies,” who were determined to cut taxes and loosen regulations. Women’s groups supported her campaign, but in office she led a fight to kill the Colorado State Commission on Women. Fervently   she was, one politician told The Washington Post in 1983, “almost paranoid about any kind of abortion legislation. ” She rose quickly. “She was very prominent in the shaping of policy,” said Steve Durham, a leader of the House Crazies. She had a “knack and ability to get along with people and put them at ease. ” But she was famously tough. The Rocky Mountain News wrote that she “could kick a bear to death with her bare feet. ” After two terms, Ms. Gorsuch became one of three Coloradans to take prominent posts in the Reagan administration, along with James G. Watt, the interior secretary, and Robert Burford, the director of the Bureau of Land Management. Called the “Colorado mafia,” they managed the nation’s natural resources with a fierce belief that the government had gone too far in regulating private enterprise. It was widely believed that they had the backing of Joseph Coors, the conservative Colorado beer magnate. By the time Ms. Gorsuch moved to Washington in 1981, she was headed for a divorce, and the children toggled between the capital and Colorado. It was an adjustment for children used to the informal ways of the West. “All of a sudden we were across the country, having to dress up in coats and ties and having to act like   at prep school,” said Michael Trent, a Californian whose father was deputy transportation secretary at the time and who found in Mr. Gorsuch a similar spirit. The two boys took walks after dinner discussing the world. “The two of us were huge fans of Reagan,” said Mr. Trent, who was later best man at Judge Gorsuch’s wedding and made the judge godfather to his children. “And it was because of our family upbringings. It was so much a part of our lives at the time. ” Mr. Gorsuch soon had a stepfather when his mother married Mr. Burford, whom she had met in the State Legislature. Known for wearing furs and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, Ms. Gorsuch became a prominent face of the new administration as she cut back lawsuits against polluters and tried to relax parts of the Clean Air Act. “There was obviously a lot of controversy regarding her work as she was carrying out the president’s program,” Ed Meese, a top Reagan adviser, recalled. “I’m sure that undoubtedly had an impact on her son. ” J. J. Gorsuch, 43, now a vice president of a Denver marketing technology company, said his mother’s political life had shaped the family psyche but ultimately made his brother stronger. “If anything, it probably prepared him for the experience ahead in a great way,” he said. “He knows better than most how ugly the political process might get. So in that sense it’s hopefully prepared him for the nomination process. ” His mother emerged from her 1983 resignation demoralized about Washington, which she called “too small to be a state but too large to be an asylum for the mentally deranged. ” But if her tribulations scarred him, Judge Gorsuch gave little indication while at Georgetown Preparatory School, a   Jesuit school outside Washington. His classmates  —   many the children of politicians themselves  —   knew the family connection, said Bill Hughes, son of a Democratic congressman, but left it unmentioned. As Mr. Trent said, “I can’t imagine what a difficult thing it would have been to go through that, but he never let it show. ” Judge Gorsuch focused on schoolwork and excelled at debate, competing nationally. “Even as a kid, he would be able to step back from situations and be able to make judgments about them,” said Stephen Ochs, a history teacher. “He had the ability to be curious and look at both sides without being threatened. ” His conservative identity was already forming. The school yearbook jokingly listed him as founder of a “Fascism Forever” club, which an editorial note clarified “happily jerked its knees against the increasingly ‘ ’ tendencies of the faculty. ” Mr. Trent called that “sort of his little dig getting back” at a teacher with whom he disagreed. His views apparently cost him little among his peers, who elected him student president. Classmates speculated that his poise would lead to the law and perhaps politics, said one classmate, Brian Cashman, who is now general manager of the New York Yankees. “He looked the part and acted the part. ” Judge Gorsuch arrived at Columbia in 1985 as the historically liberal university was recovering from student protests the previous spring and beginning to divest from corporations operating in South Africa. In three years on campus  —   he graduated a year early  —   he emerged as the intellectual leader of a resurgent right. It was “a happy band of dissenters,” as Brian Domitrovic, a classmate and fellow conservative, put it. His eloquence impressed many. That he was tall, clean cut and handsome only helped. He danced and drank Manhattans and martinis, Mr. Domitrovic said. He joined Phi Gamma Delta, a fraternity with a reputation for partying, and quietly attended religious services. But principally, Judge Gorsuch became known as a fierce and lucid writer in the Columbia Daily Spectator, where he published columns, and later The Federalist Paper, which he helped found. Part newspaper, part opinion journal, The Federalist Paper drew comparisons to the conservative Dartmouth Review. “There was a   system at Columbia in the ’80s: the liberals and the socialists,” said Stephen Later, who worked on the paper. “The Fed was a response to this echo chamber. ” Judge Gorsuch was out of step with campus zeitgeist. He bristled at attempts to bar military recruiting on campus, minimized the   affair and dismissed a shantytown built on campus to protest South African apartheid. The main subject that animated his writing was the political hegemony he perceived at the university. A “tyrannical atmosphere of ‘ideas,’” he called it in February 1987. “There is little or no room at Columbia for dissenting voices: one is either Right or Wrong, Moral or Immoral, Compassionate or Heartless. ” In March 1987, as students debated the fraternity system’s treatment of women and minorities, Judge Gorsuch   a piece defending   clubs. In a familiar rhetorical move, he reframed the issue as free speech. In their “heavy handed moralism,” he wrote, the system’s critics missed “the fact that Columbia is a pluralistic university, that its fraternity is equally pluralistic, with options available for everyone. ” That spring, as students boycotted Coors beer, posters on campus alleged that The Federalist Paper, which accepted the company’s advertising, had received funding from the Heritage Foundation, financed by the Coors family. Mr. Gorsuch mocked the “professional protesters” who had created the posters, and he threatened a libel suit. “He had a real regal way of writing about this stuff that made us look small,” said Tom Kamber, a leader of the liberals. “His role was really to write these screeds that would try to take the winds out of our sails. ” The battle continued at Harvard Law School, where Judge Gorsuch arrived in 1988 along with a young man from Chicago named Barack Obama. The two did not intersect much  —   Mr. Obama was six years older  —   but they mirrored each other as intellectual leaders who managed to disagree without being disagreeable. “Neil was not quite as public a person as Barack was, but at the same time, for the people who knew him, he was very well respected,” said Mr. Segal, the classmate. Young conservatives were inspired as the Soviet Union and its empire collapsed. “It was an incredibly optimistic time, and it was a time when a lot of us developed a strong belief in the power of free markets and rule of law,” said Ken Mehlman, another classmate who went on to become chairman of the Republican National Committee. Harvard was the epicenter of a debate over whether the Constitution was a living document to be interpreted in evolving times or a neutral, unchanging charter judged by its original text. “It was a pretty contentious time at Harvard Law School,” said Adam H. Charnes, a classmate. “There were conservatives who were provocateurs. He wasn’t anything like that. ” Judge Gorsuch befriended liberals, including Norm Eisen, later a White House aide and ambassador under Mr. Obama. “He stood out among the conservative group in not being loud,” Mr. Eisen said. “He managed to stay above that while making his conservative positions clear. I thought it was impressive. ” Through all of this, Judge Gorsuch made little mention of his famous mother. Indeed, one friend who stayed close after law school said he had realized the relationship only years later. Once when a fellow student said something disparaging about her on the assumption that he was not actually related, he brushed it off. “He deflected it in a very classy way that made me think it was not the first time somebody had said something like that,” Mr. Eisen said. Judge Gorsuch’s mother did not live to see the day he was nominated to the Supreme Court. But for the family, his rise represents a vindication of sorts. If he survives confirmation, he will have conquered the capital that did her in.",0
6966,A Narrow Path of Hope Remains for the Cubs - The New York Times,"CHICAGO  —   If the Chicago Cubs rally to win this World Series, the degree of difficulty will make the victory even sweeter. They would need to win three in a row from the Cleveland Indians, including two on the road, to make it happen. No baseball team has won quite that way since the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates upended the Orioles in Baltimore. But there is a recent precedent in sports: The Cleveland Cavaliers trailed the Golden State Warriors, three games to one, in the N. B. A. Finals in June, only to storm back and win the title in Oakland. It would be a cruel kind of karma for the Indians to lose in roughly the same way the Cavaliers won. But after four games of this World Series, there is little to show that the Cubs are up for it. The Indians’ formula  —   timely hitting and a few great pitchers  —   offers a narrow pathway to victory, but the Cubs have opened the lanes for them three times. “It’s just been abnormal in some ways,” Cubs Manager Joe Maddon said, in a true understatement. The Indians carry 12 pitchers but basically rely on four, and yet they are one win from a championship. “They’ve been outstanding through the entire postseason, and you can see it,” Maddon continued. “We’re obviously having a tough time, like the other teams did. ” The Indians swept Boston in their division series, holding the Red Sox to a . 214 batting average. They won four of five from Toronto in the American League Championship Series, holding the Blue Jays to a . 201 average. Now, through four games in the World Series, the Cubs are hitting . 204. Remember, these are the Cubs: the team that rocked the game’s best pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, to win the pennant last weekend and outscored opponents by 252 runs in the regular season. The Red Sox had the   lead in run differential (184) in the majors, and the Blue Jays (93) ranked fifth. The old baseball adage rings true again. Good pitching (specifically from Corey Kluber, Andrew Miller, Bryan Shaw and Cody Allen) has throttled good hitting. Those pitchers have thrown 22 of the Indians’ 36 innings in this World Series, with a combined earned run average of 0. 82. The bonus was Josh Tomlin, who collected the first 13 outs of Game 3. Manager Terry Francona replaced him  —   during a   shutout  —   with Miller, who teamed with Shaw and Allen to preserve a   win on Friday. In Game 4, it was Kluber for six innings, Miller for two and, with a   lead, Dan Otero for one. Francona said Allen might handle the middle innings in Sunday’s Game 5, with Miller positioned to finish off the Cubs at the end. Francona was too polite to frame it that way, but the Cubs are wounded now, and easily teased into taking the bait of the Indians’ power breaking stuff. “They attack you, but I don’t even know if it’s that,” said the Cubs’ Kris Bryant, who is 1 for 14 with three walks. “You see Miller and Allen, they don’t walk a lot of people because they get a lot of chases. If we’re able to do that  —   lay off those sliders down and in  —   maybe we walk a little more. ” The Cubs led the majors in walks this season but have drawn just four in their three Series losses. They also have just one homer in the World Series, a solo shot by Dexter Fowler off Miller in the eighth inning Saturday. When asked if there was anything positive for the Cubs to take from Game 4, first baseman Anthony Rizzo cited that moment, with a rueful smile. “Yeah  —   Dexter hitting a home run off Andrew Miller, getting him to give up a run, finally, in the postseason,” Rizzo said. “But we lost. In the playoffs, a win’s a win, a loss is a loss. That’s tough. ” After the Cubs lost Game 3 of the National League Championship Series, falling behind two games to one to the Los Angeles Dodgers, catcher Miguel Montero said they needed to stop swinging for the fences and think smaller. The next night, a bunt single by Ben Zobrist started a rally that led to the first of three comfortable victories. Montero, a veteran who has not started in the Series, sounded a similar theme on Saturday. “We’re all trying to hit a grand slam with nobody on,” he said. “It’s not gonna happen. We need to be a little more patient at the plate, play a little small ball. We’re all trying to hit the ball 110 miles an hour off the bat  —   no. We need to get a ground ball through the hole. Simple as that. ” On Sunday, at least, the Cubs should have a decided advantage at the start, sending Jon Lester to the mound against Trevor Bauer, who lost Game 2 in Cleveland on Wednesday and has never pitched on short rest. But the Indians are changing the way to think about postseason games: If the starter falters  —   and sometimes even if he doesn’t  —   an overpowering bullpen can take over early. The strategy has helped pushed the Cubs to the brink of elimination at Wrigley Field, where the Tigers celebrated a title in Game 7 of the last World Series played here, in 1945. A party seven decades in the making on the North Side of this city has turned into a letdown, and only a   can save the Cubs now. “It’s fun for us to see the pictures of everybody outside, but we can’t get too caught up in that,” Bryant said. “Hopefully we win out, and the last four games will be forgotten. ” But the odds will be firmly against the Cubs. Since those 1979 Pirates, only the 1985 Kansas City Royals have climbed from a   hole to win the World Series  —   but they had the last two games at home. Over all, the last 10 teams to drop three of the first four games in the World Series have ended up losing.",0
6967,Syria’s Horrors Visit Turkey Again as Bomber Attacks Kurdish Wedding - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   The wedding on Saturday night was winding down, and some guests had already left. But the music was still playing and people were still dancing in the narrow streets of Gaziantep, a city not far from the Syrian border. Just then a child  —   no more than 14 years old, Turkey’s president said later  —   meandered into the gathering and detonated a vest of explosives. Suddenly, the most joyous of occasions became a scene of blood and gore, with body parts scattered all around. Once again, the horrors of Syria’s civil war had visited Turkey. The devastating bombing of the Kurdish wedding in Gaziantep killed more than 50 people, for which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the Islamic State, the terrorist group that controls a swath of land straddling the frontier between Iraq and Syria. “In this area, we live in a ring of fire,” said Hilmi Karaca, a Kurdish activist who witnessed the explosion. “We live in a place where mothers are weeping for their dead children just hours after crying tears of joy at a wedding. ” The attack was the deadliest in a string of terrorist bombings that have struck Turkey this year, as it grapples with the spiraling chaos of spillover from the war in Syria. Bombings this year that Turkish officials have blamed the Islamic State for have struck Istanbul’s old city, near the Blue Mosque its most famous shopping boulevard, Istiklal Avenue and, in June, Istanbul’s main airport, among the busiest in Europe. For years, critics have said that Turkey contributed to the chaos  —   allowing extremist rebels to cross its territory on their way to fight in Syria  —   to advance its goal of toppling the Syrian government of President Bashar  . At the outset of the war in 2011, Mr. Erdogan was confident that Mr. Assad would quickly fall, as the dictators of Egypt and Tunisia had. But as the war ground on, Turkey increasingly found itself drawn in, with millions of refugees fleeing across the border and, over the last year, a spate of attacks within Turkey. At the same time, Kurdish militants in the southeast resumed a stalled war against the Turkish government, emboldened by the success of their brethren in Syria, where Kurds have carved out a region of autonomy in the country’s east. Now, Turkey finds itself with three enemies in the Syrian civil war  —   Mr. Assad, the Islamic State and Kurdish rebels  —   and escalating chaos within its own borders. The attack on Saturday in Gaziantep demonstrated how those conflicts sometimes overlap. The Islamic State, which has fought Kurds in Syria in cities like Kobani, have also targeted Kurds within Turkey, as they apparently did on Saturday by striking the wedding. Turkey is also reeling from a failed military coup last month that aimed to topple the government of Mr. Erdogan and left at least 240 people dead. That conspiracy was blamed on followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric in   in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan said on Saturday that there was no difference between the various terrorist organizations  —   the Islamic State, Kurdish militants or followers of Mr. Gulen  —   that are attacking the country. Hours before the attack on Saturday, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, met with journalists over breakfast at an old Ottoman palace, once used by sultans for hunting excursions, that overlooks the Bosporus in Istanbul. He said Turkey would take a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the war, working closely with world powers like Russia and Iran, two of Mr. Assad’s most ardent backers. Calling the Syrian conflict “the bleeding wound of the globe,” he said Turkey would accept a role for Mr. Assad during an interim period while the   future of the country was being resolved. This was a slight shift in policy, as Turkey has long been adamant that Mr. Assad must go before any serious peace talks could take place. But it was unclear whether that matters this far into the conflict, and with Mr. Assad strengthened by Russian military support. “In the long term, can Syria bear Assad?” Mr. Yildirim said. “No way. ” In normal times, Gaziantep is famous for its cuisine, especially baklava, the sweet pastry made with pistachios grown nearby. Before war broke out, busloads of Syrians crossed the border almost daily to shop in Gaziantep, as Mr. Erdogan pushed stronger economic ties with Syria. Yet in recent years the city became a hub for lives upended  —   and preoccupied  —   by the civil war in Syria. Spies, foreign fighters, diplomats, journalists, relief workers and refugees passed through the city, sometimes all gathering at the same Starbucks. In the earlier days of the conflict it was a place of intrigue, transformed much as the Pakistani border city of Peshawar was during the 1980s, when   rebels moved through on their way to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. And then Gaziantep became more sinister and violent. The police found an Islamic State   facility in the city, which they said was used in an attack in Ankara last year that killed more than 100 people. The bomber who struck Istanbul’s Istiklal Avenue came from there, officials said. The Islamic State also carried out murders of Syrian journalists in the city. On Saturday, the city’s place as not just a remote transit hub for the war but a battleground itself came into focus again. “We had just walked past the wedding and offered our good wishes when we heard the blast,” said Ibrahim Ates, a local man. “Suddenly people started running past us. When we went back to see what had happened, everyone was on the floor, and there were body parts scattered everywhere and blood splattered on the walls. ” Mahmut Togrul, a lawmaker with the Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party who on Sunday visited the scene of the attack, said the wedding had been a traditional Kurdish ceremony and had taken place in a predominantly Kurdish neighborhood. He said that many of the victims  —   at least 51 people were killed and 69 more wounded, Mr. Erdogan said on Sunday  —   were children. That the perpetrator of the attack and so many of its victims were so young was a potent illustration of the degradation of the Syrian war as it has inflamed the region. Children have suffered immensely  —   one devastating image of a Syrian boy injured in an airstrike in Aleppo last week appeared on the front of newspapers around the world, a jarring reminder of the human cost of the war. The Islamic State, meanwhile, recruits boys as suicide bombers across Iraq and Syria. The bride and groom on Saturday, Besna and Nurettin Akdogan, survived without serious injuries. Neighbors said they were cousins who had been engaged for six months. After being released from the hospital, the bride said, “They turned our wedding into a blood bath,” according to the   Anadolu News Agency. In Gaziantep on Sunday, a mass funeral was held at the Yesilkent cemetery. One of the mourners was Arif Yugmen, 35, who had left the wedding just before the attack. When he heard of the bombing, he said, he went back and took some of the wounded victims to the hospital in his car. Mr. Yugmen said the victims included so many children because they had gathered away from the folk dancing, in a place closer to the site of the blast. Nearby, Mizgin Gurbuzun, grieved over her dead    son, falling to her knees beside his coffin. Rocking back and forth, and crying, she wailed, “My martyr son has gone. ”",0
6968,"Shall We Save Civilization, or Not? - American Herald Tribune","2 Shares
1 0 0 1
It looks as though civilization is under attack. Fundamentalists of various stripes, survivalists, and certain ideologues seem to be, at worst, determined to bring about its collapse. Worst of all, to my mind, the general population gazes upon the looming demise of civilization with an apparent indifference that is astonishing.
Scientifically, the exact process by which civilization got started is not known. It is known to have something to do with the development of farming.
Even the Bible endorses that, for those who know the story of Cain, the farmer who killed his brother Abel and is credited with building the world's first city. (Technically, ""civilization"" means ""living in cities."") Also, any estimated age of Earth that I have seen that was calculated using the Bible (which calculations always start with Cain's parents, Adam and Eve) has turned out to be a fair-to-excellent estimate of the age of civilization.
At any rate, farming made relatively large surpluses of food possible. That allowed for the existence of significant numbers of people who were not concerned with procuring food, other than to own a farm, buy food, or, in the case of slaves, have it provided by their owners.
There is no doubt that slavery was present from the beginning of civilization. My theory is that groups of warrior-like people offered farmers protection from raiders in exchange for food. Then they realized that they could turn their enterprise into a protection racket, in which they extorted most of the food from the farmers. Before long, they realized that maximum efficiency would be achieved by simply enslaving the farmers.
The enslavers also used slaves to build fortresses. Those fortresses became the seed crystals of cities, where people could live and be protected from the worst the world had to offer by submitting to the local tyrant.
As local tyrants conquered more territory their wealth grew and so did their cities. The Roman Empire was the apotheosis of that process.
[Serfdom, the slightest possible moral improvement over slavery, was the basis of feudalism, which technically was not civilization because it was not predicated on the existence of cities.]
Civilization is now threatened with extinction. It might not be much morally, but materially it is all we've got. Civilization as we know it does at least protect the farmers without extorting or enslaving them.
If civilization were to collapse there is no doubt that some human beings in small groups would be able to scratch out a subsistence existence here and there. Life would surely be, as Thomas Hobbes would say, ""nasty, brutish, and short,"" but human life would continue in some form.
Or, we can make the effort to save civilization. If we want to avoid the worst, we have to start immediately.
The primary threat to civilization is a material threat. It is a scythe aimed at the legs upon which civilization has always stood: farming.
The threat is global warming. The temperature of the air and the water on surface of this planet is increasing.
People who deny that global warming is happening are being irrational. I don't endorse locking them up, but I do endorse ignoring them while those of us who are not irrational (in that way, anyway) get on with saving civilization.
For as long as civilization has existed, Earth has had a stable-enough climate that has supported large-scale agriculture. Now that is changing.
Some people seem to think that we can simply shift crops northward to suit the new temperatures. That would be wrong.
Global warming will create such climatic dislocations that agriculture as we know it will cease to exist. If agriculture as we know it ceases to exist, civilization will cease to exist.
The ultimate cause of global warming is beside the point. Arguing about that is like standing in the yard while one's house is on fire, arguing with one's spouse about the cause of the blaze. As the late, great Gene Wilder would doubtlessly say, eyes and hair equally wild, The... HOUSE... is on... FIRE . PUT... the FIRE ... OUT !
Whatever is the cause of global warming, we only have one response available to us. We have to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases being disgorged into the atmosphere.
One big thing we can do immediately is to turn off our air conditioners wherever that is at all feasible. (Modern high-rises don't permit it, but it can be done everywhere else.) Fans consume a small fraction of the electricity that air conditioners do. It is a great irony that burning mountains of coal to make ourselves cooler has contributed to getting us into this mess, but there you go.
The survival of civilization depends upon stopping global warming... now! If we fail to do that, civilization is kaput.",0
6969,"Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Iraq Inquiry: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Congressional Republicans, infuriated by the F. B. I. ’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton, summoned the bureau’s director, James Comey, to hearings on Thursday. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she accepted the bureau’s recommendation, ending the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said Mrs. Clinton’s use of private email servers as secretary of state showed that she could not be trusted with classified material. But some Republicans fretted that Donald Trump and his small campaign organization were not capitalizing on Mr. Comey’s harsh criticism of Mrs. Clinton. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton tried to redirect attention, disparaging Mr. Trump’s business practices at a stop in Atlantic City. “He always rigged it so he got paid no matter how his companies performed,” she said in front of one of his failed casinos. At a separate event in North Carolina, she responded to the leftward pressure exerted by Bernie Sanders’s campaign, announcing plans to eliminate college tuition at   public colleges and universities for families with annual incomes under $125, 000. _____ 3. “Donald Trump is not   and he’s not a racist. ” That’s Jared Kushner, his    and the publisher of The Observer, declaring that Mr. Trump should not be held responsible for the views of fringe followers who barrage some Jewish reporters with   comments. In a lengthy   Mr. Kushner disclosed how his family members suffered and died in the Holocaust. He said terms like “ ” were “being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless. ” On Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump delivered a speech that seemed to clash with Mr. Kushner’s   defending a broadly criticized image posted to his Twitter account that showed a picture of Hillary Clinton next to a   star. _____ 4. Gretchen Carlson, the longtime Fox News anchor, stunned the TV industry with a lawsuit accusing the network’s chairman, Roger Ailes, of firing her after she refused his sexual advances. The suit says Mr. Ailes propositioned Ms. Carlson in response to her complaints of rife sexual harassment in the workplace. It says he responded to her rejection by cutting her salary and airtime, and then declining to renew her contract. _____ 5. The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into a fatal police shooting in Baton Rouge, La. A video of the episode shows that two officers had a black man, Alton Sterling, 37, pinned to the ground before opening fire. Louisiana’s governor, John Bel Edwards, pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, acknowledging, “The video is disturbing, to say the least. ” _____ 6. Hoverboards don’t hover, but the Consumer Product Safety Commission says they do combust. The agency recalled more than a   of the     scooters, saying they had caused at least 60 fires and were responsible for at least $2 million in property damage. _____ 7. At war with clutter? Reinforcements are near. Marie Kondo, the Japanese organizer whose lodestar is joy, has an army of proselytizers in training to bring her “  Magic of Tidying Up” to a wider audience. One acolyte is taking her system a step further: raising the bar to letting stuff in the house in the first place. _____ 8. Oscar Pistorius was resentenced for fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, this time drawing six years in prison. A higher court had sent back his initial   sentence for manslaughter, saying the disabled South African runner should be sentenced for murder. The judge explained her rejection of prosecutors’ request for at least 15 years: “He’s a fallen hero who has lost his career and is ruined financially. “The worst is that having taken the life of a fellow human being in the manner that he did, he cannot be at peace. ” _____ 9. Britain got its moment of reckoning for the Iraq war. An independent panel’s findings excoriated former Prime Minister Tony Blair for blindly accepting flawed U. S. intelligence and promising George W. Bush loyalty. Mr. Blair responded with a nearly   news conference in which he acknowledged profound mistakes but pleaded for understanding. After the   terrorist attacks on the U. S. he said, “We were in a new world. ” _____ 10.  The other war the U. S. entered after the   attacks grinds on. President Obama slowed his already delayed drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, saying, “The security situation remains precarious. ” He plans to leave 8, 400 troops there, handing his successor a military commitment he had intended to end before he left office. _____ 11. Finally, two French entrepreneurs are trying to change the way Parisians view immigrants. They recruited chefs from Syria, Chechnya, Iran, India, Sri Lanka and, above left, Ethiopia, and have catered 20 events since February, including lunches, dinners and buffets. “The cuisine of a place gives pleasure,” said one of the businessmen. “This is part of immigration, too. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

6970,Report: Only 6% of Millennials Said Their Social Media Was a ’Completely True’ Depiction of Them - Breitbart,"Just 6 percent of millennials claimed that their social media accounts were a “completely true” depiction of them, according to a report by LendEDU. [54 percent of the nearly 8, 500 college students surveyed claimed that their online accounts were “somewhat true of me,” while 25 percent claimed their accounts were “mostly true of me,” and 15 percent claimed they were “not true of me at all. ”  “While not entirely surprising, the fact that only six percent of millennials said their social media accounts portrayed their lives completely truthfully confirms a long standing belief,” wrote LendEDU in their report. “Anything posted on social media should be taken with a grain of salt, because with a little cleverness and craftiness, a social media post can completely distort reality. ” “The interesting thing about this poll was that millennials were admitting to their own   on social media,” they continued, adding that “The 15 percent that said their social media was ‘not true of me at all’ know that they are totally fabricating their lives and have not only accepted it, but are are seemingly fine with it. ” “Remember, the next time you see someone post an awesome looking picture on Instagram or Facebook do not get jealous, but temper your reaction,” the report concluded. “There is a 94 percent chance that poster is either completely lying or stretching the truth. ” In a previous survey of 3, 701 students by LendEDU, Instagram was rated the most narcissistic social media platform. 65 percent of those surveyed placed Instagram at number one on the list, followed by Snapchat at 15 percent, Twitter at 11 percent, and Facebook at 10 percent. “For most of this demographic, social media is a powerful tool with the ability to create an entirely new persona, void of reality,” claimed LendEDU in their previous report. “The formula is quite simple. If you post enough artsy, chic pictures of yourself that rack up plenty of ‘likes,’ then real life accomplishments will not matter because the popularity of your social media accounts will determine your status on the social hierarchy. ” “This is especially true with Instagram, where ‘likes’ are the main way of interacting with pictures and videos that are posted by users,” they concluded, adding that “The large majority of Instagram users have formed unspoken alliances with each other to ensure they each tally enough ‘likes’ to make their posts stand out. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

6971,"Flash Mob of Black Teens Assault Whites, Media Silent On If It's A Hate Crime. | Daily Wire","Aaron Bandler October 27, 2016 
A flash mob of over 150 blacks teens assaulted numerous people on Friday in Philadelphia in an attack that appears to have been racially motivated, and yet the media is silent about this possible motivation. 
LifeZette reports that the racial component of the attack was evident in a Facebook post written by Joe Lauletta , whose daughter, Christina, was attacked by the flash mob on Friday. Lauletta wrote that he received a phone call from Christina, who tearfully explained that she ""was jumped"" and ""beat up pretty bad."" 
""I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game,"" Lauletta wrote. ""This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened."" 
While no bones were broken, Christina was ""badly bruised"" throughout her body, Lauletta said ""it makes me cry just thinking about it."" 
Lauletta's post seemed to indicate the racial aspect of the attack, and on Tuesday he posted on Facebook that ""the FBI is investigating"" and ""are analyzing all video coverage,"" signaling that the FBI is looking into the attack as a hate crime. 
In an interview with the New York Post , Lauletta wouldn't explicitly say the attack was racially motivated but sort of implied it: 
“Well, I haven’t been saying that because everybody is trying to get me to say it and I don’t know if I want to be that person,” Lauletta told The Post. “Everyone can draw their own conclusions.” 
Lauletta said the possibility of the attacks being motivated by race – perhaps as a sort of gang initiation – was part of the reason why his story was shared so frequently and as far away as Africa. 
“That’s why it spread so fast,” Lauletta said. “If you read my Facebook page, everybody’s saying it.” 
However, Philadelphia Police Lt. John Stanford insisted to the Post that ""there hasn’t been any indication that race is involved in this in any shape or form."" 
Even still, the media hasn't reported that the attack is possibly a hate crime, as LifeZette points out: 
Friday violence as teen mob attacks Temple students, police; four arrested,” read the headline on Philly.com, while the Philly Voice reported “Teens arrested after flash mob leads to assaults on Broad Street.” The Associated Press headline read: “STUDENTS BEATEN, HORSE PUNCHED IN MOB ATTACKS AT UNIVERSITY. 
The Washington Post buried the possibility in their story and then dismissed it with Stanford's quote. 
LifeZette also noted that Temple University described the attack as ""a large group of approximately 200 juveniles causing disruption along Broad Street."" 
Maybe Stanford is correct that it was a random attack, or maybe the black flash mob was targeting whites. But there is no doubting the media's hypocrisy: if this were a flash mob of white teenagers that attacked blacks, the media would be screaming about it being a hate crime. But since the incident in Philadelphia does not advance the media's racial narrative, they will not treat it in the same manner. Tags ",0
6972,N.B.A. Finals: How the Warriors and Cavaliers Match Up - The New York Times,"2016 N. B. A. Finals: Golden State Warriors ( ) vs. Cleveland Cavaliers ( ) Game 1: 9 p. m. Thursday at Oracle Arena, Oakland, Calif. How to watch: ABC has the television broadcast. Game 1 will be streamed live on WatchESPN. N. B. A. Finals Game 1 live updates  Stephen Curry, for the first time since last year’s N. B. A. finals, encountered something resembling adversity in the Western Conference finals. The Warriors fell behind, three games to one he was turning the ball over far too much and his opponents were mocking his defensive ability. Some fans even questioned his anointment as the game’s best player. With no margin for error, Curry responded by averaging 32. 7 points, 7. 3 rebounds, 7. 7 assists and 2. 3 steals in the final three games of the series, dismantling the Oklahoma City Thunder. It may be scary for the Cavaliers to think about, but an argument could be made that Curry was only his team’s   player in that stretch. Klay Thompson, the other half of the   Splash Brothers, showed a national audience what Warriors fans have known for years: When his shot is falling, he is as dangerous as his more famous teammate. He and Curry combined for 62   against the Thunder, an N. B. A. record for teammates in a playoff series. Thompson averaged 29. 7 points in the final three games, and his   performance on the road in Game 6 will perhaps be the most memorable showing of that series. The road to the finals was far less winding for the Cavaliers. They were steamrollering through the East, winning their first 10 playoff games, before a pair of brutal losses to Toronto in the conference finals. It proved to be a mild detour: There was little to no drama in Games 5 and 6, and now LeBron James is set to play in the N. B. A. finals for a sixth consecutive year. At their best, the Cavaliers can nearly keep up with the Warriors in   shooting. That should be the main story line of this showdown, not the overdone notion that James could find redemption by winning a championship for Cleveland. In any case, while the finals will be a rematch of last season’s triumph by the Warriors, both teams have grown. Expecting a    remake would be unwise. The most obvious change for the Cavaliers is the return of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. They played a total of  44 minutes in the N. B. A. finals last year, with Love hampered by a shoulder dislocation and Irving dropping out after Game 1 with an injured knee. Getting back a pair of   takes some of the burden off James, who   prevented the Warriors from having a cakewalk to a championship last year but was outdone by the defensive tenacity of Andre Iguodala and the overall offensive excellence of the Warriors. Love and Irving seemed to coexist better with James this season, accepting their roles while occasionally being asked to supply star power on nights when James was not at his best. Love averaged 16 points and 9. 9 rebounds a game while shooting 36 percent from   range, and while he is not known as an effective defender, most advanced defensive statistics showed him holding his own this season. Irving averaged 19. 6 points and 4. 7 assists a game while growing accustomed to the idea of being a point guard who gives up the   duties in crunchtime to James. The Cavaliers still probably use J. R. Smith and Matthew Dellavedova more than they would prefer, but Channing Frye proved to be a brilliant   acquisition, capitalizing on the   looks he gets when James is  . There is an argument to be made that the Cavaliers are to blame for the Warriors’     season. With his team looking overmatched and down by two games to one in last year’s N. B. A. finals, Kerr listened to an unorthodox suggestion from Nick U’Ren, his manager of advanced scouting, and deployed a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Iguodala, Thompson and Curry. Playing a center who is generously listed at 6 feet 7 inches, a power forward who is a slight   and three guards would seem crazy in nearly any era of basketball, but the group, which came to be known as the Death Lineup, proved to be among the most effective units ever put together. The misconception about the lineup is that it is strictly an offensive ploy to run teams into the ground. While that is certainly a part of the equation, the lineup also features three tremendous defenders in Green, Iguodala and Thompson, and they are a nightmare on both ends of the court. Kerr tends to limit their minutes together to protect Green, who takes abuse from larger centers. Before Curry and Thompson went supernova and saved the Western Conference finals for the Warriors, the Thunder overwhelmed Golden State’s approach with the size and ferocious attitude of Steven Adams, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter and Kevin Durant. But the Cavaliers do not have the personnel to pull that off. Tristan Thompson is an undersize power forward who is expected to handle the bulk of the rebounding duties. Love, who is listed at   but was measured at   at the N. B. A. draft combine, is unlikely to be much of a threat inside against Green. The Cavaliers responded to the Death Lineup last season by essentially burying Timofey Mozgov on the bench, but they may want to give Mozgov, a Russian   a second look this time. The Warriors struggle with size, and Green is two technical fouls or one flagrant foul away from a mandatory suspension, meaning his typical strategy of physically assaulting opposing big men will not be in play. The Warriors beat the Cavaliers both times they played this season, but it was the second game, a brutal   shellacking, that might have cost  David Blatt his job as coach. In that game, Curry went off for 35 points, and Iguodala, the Cavaliers’ nemesis, had 20 points while shooting 7 for 8 and playing his typical stellar defense. If Blatt was fired for not being able to beat the Warriors, that is somewhat understandable. But it was certainly unusual to see a coach with an     record over two seasons fired midway through a campaign in which his team was on track to be the top seed in its conference. The University of Arizona may not be considered a typical N. B. A. feeder program, but this series is an excellent advertisement for what it produced in the Lute Olson era. The   Wildcats featured Luke Walton, the Warriors’ top assistant, along with Iguodala and Frye. Steve Kerr, the Warriors’ coach, was a   player at Arizona, teaming with Bruce Fraser, who in his capacity as Golden State’s   coach serves as Curry’s shot doctor. The Cavaliers’ Richard Jefferson joined Walton on the 2001 team that lost the national championship game to Duke, and Bret Brielmaier, a Cavaliers assistant, was a   player for the Wildcats. Both teams have efficient offenses, with a heavy reliance on  . The big difference between them is pace. The Warriors want to move as quickly as possible while the Cavaliers, regardless of what Coach Tyronn Lue may have wanted when he started coaching them, tend to grind out games at a snail’s pace. If Cleveland allows Golden State to dictate the speed of the game, the series could be a serious mismatch. The Warriors have a far deeper roster and are more balanced on the defensive side. While Klay Thompson, Green and Iguodala are likely to pose a defensive challenge to Irving, Love and James, it is hard to see anyone on the Cavaliers other than James being much of a threat to the Golden State offense. There is a path to victory for Cleveland that involves turning the series into a slugfest. The   Green is on thin ice with the league and can be temporarily removed as a threat by getting him to lash out just once. Thompson can also be drawn into foul trouble if Cleveland plays things correctly, and Golden State can be exploited with intentional fouls on Festus Ezeli, a comically bad   shooter. The problem, as so many teams have found out, is that the shooting of Curry and Thompson means that almost no lead is safe and that a team must press for all 48 minutes to secure a victory. It sounds simple enough, but Golden State’s record of   over the last two seasons, including the playoffs, indicates it is a daunting task. Pick: Warriors in five games",0
6973,Sleepy Behind the Wheel? Some Cars Can Tell - The New York Times,"It’s something that many of us have experienced while driving, though we may not like to admit it. It’s called a microsleep, a brief state of drowsy unconsciousness that can happen even if your eyes remain open. Drowsy driving kills. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drowsy driving caused 824 deaths in 2015, the last year for which figures are available. Several manufacturers, including Audi, Mercedes and Volvo, currently offer drowsiness detection systems that monitor a vehicle’s movements, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation, time driven and road conditions. When drowsiness is detected, drivers are typically warned with a sound and the appearance of a coffee cup icon. But manufacturers and automobile suppliers are now working on advanced technological solutions that go beyond visions of coffee cups. To find out if drowsiness can be detected even earlier, Plessey Semiconductors has developed sensors, to be placed in a seat, that monitor changes in heart rate. Algorithms developed by the company indicate when breathing changes to patterns that are typical of someone who is sleeping, giving a warning before someone actually feels tired. “We could see this in a vehicle in five years,” said Keith Strickland, chief technology officer of the company, which is based in Plymouth, England. Bosch, a German supplier of technology to many automotive companies, is developing a   system that will monitor head and eye movements, as well as body posture, heart rate and body temperature. When such a system is used in vehicles that allow for limited autonomous driving, the vehicle could take over once drowsiness is detected  —   either coming to an emergency stop or pulling itself off to the side of the road, said Kay Stepper, Bosch’s head of driver assistance and automated driving. In addition, sensors on the outside of the vehicle will monitor the state of traffic in which the fatigued driver is engaged. Once vehicles can communicate with each other  —   a capability expected in the next few years  —   other cars will be able to take appropriate maneuvers to avoid the drowsy driver. In France, Valeo, another supplier of automotive technology, is developing an infrared camera system that will monitor children in the rear seat as well as the driver’s shoulder, neck and head movements, looking for deviations from the norm. Checking body temperature and even how the driver is dressed, the system will also be able to customize the interior temperature for each driver, said Guillaume Devauchelle, the company’s innovation director. Nvidia, chip supplier to Audi, Mercedes, Tesla and others, is developing the   an   tool that can learn the behaviors of individual drivers and determine when they are operating outside their norms. The system will eventually learn a driver’s standard posture, head position,   rate, facial expression and steering style, among other indexes. Based on a vehicle’s capabilities, the driver will be warned or automatically driven to a safe spot when conditions warrant. Until vehicles can drive themselves, it will be up to drivers to pull over once they feel drowsy. But drivers tend to make excuses, believing there is no danger because they are just a few minutes from home, or they are not really as tired as they may feel. “The more tired you are, the less able you are to change your behavior,” such as by pulling off the road for a short rest, said Mikael Ljung Aust, a technical specialist working on drowsiness mitigation technologies at Volvo’s Safety Center in Gothenburg, Sweden. To encourage drowsy drivers to take a break, Volvo, with a grant from the European Commission, is studying the effects of offering drivers free coffee once erratic steering wheel movements, lane departures and other signs detect that they are falling asleep, using the navigation system to direct them to the nearest coffee stop. Audi is faced with a unique problem because of its scheduled introduction next year of a car capable of driving up to 35 miles per hour without any driver intervention. When its Traffic Jam Pilot feature is engaged, the vehicle will need to determine if a driver is alert enough to take control after being a passive passenger for long periods. Through its Driver Availability Detection system, sensors will scan the head and face to ensure that the eyes are open and the driver is alert before the car turns over the steering wheel. Advanced drowsiness detection systems exist today. For example, Mercedes’s Attention Assist monitors a driver’s behavior for the first 20 minutes behind the wheel to get a baseline of behaviors. Then, the system checks those against as many as 90 indexes, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation and external factors such as wind gusts and pothole avoidance. The system can currently detect drowsiness with 80 percent accuracy, said Christoph von Hugo, head of active safety for  . If drowsiness is detected, the driver is alerted to the nearest rest stop. For the past decade Volvo has offered its Driver Alert system. “To detect drowsiness, we study the car, not the driver,” said Mr. Aust of Volvo, looking at differences in the ability of the car to stay in lane, and other factors. The system detects drowsiness with 97 percent accuracy, Mr. Aust said. While N. H. T. S. A. reported 824 deaths in 2015 because of drowsiness, that number is likely to be considerably higher, the agency said. Drowsy driving can only be   and not measured like drunkenness. Also, drowsiness is not reported when it is a complication of other factors like excessive drinking. “We’re a nation of tired drivers. People talk about sleep deprivation as if it’s a badge of honor,” said Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. “As a society we have to realize that drowsy driving is really dangerous. ” Until fully autonomous vehicles are a reality, “drowsiness is something everyone needs to worry about,” said Mark R. Rosekind, former head of N. H. T. S. A. and an expert on human fatigue. “Our tendency is to say we’re   when in reality we can fall asleep in a second. ” Still, the obvious solution for a driver who feels fatigued is to pull over and rest. According to Mr. Rosekind, studies with airline pilots show that those who took a nap for 26 minutes improved their performance by 34 percent and alertness by 54 percent, compared with those who did not. Regardless of how good technology is at detecting drowsiness, fighting off sleep is futile. Because sleep is a biological need, the best solution for drivers is still a   one: Pull over and take a nap.",0
6974,Netanyahu’s Critical Foreign Tour,"Netanyahu’s Critical Foreign Tour Israel's strategic repositioning. 
Originally published by the Jerusalem Post . 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming trips to Australia, Singapore, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office. The trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast Israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it. The states that he will visit are all well-positioned to help Israel navigate its next moves. The first shift is the US’s political crackup. 
Next week American voters will choose their next president. The major candidates, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land. Their rise is a testament to the weakening, if not the unraveling of the glue that has held America together since the Civil War. The unraveling of the US electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of US military power. The US’s multi-trillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the Middle East over the past 15 years has come at the expense of military modernization. The F-35 program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds. And it has yet to produce a reliable airplane. Worse, the F-35’s long and problematic gestation period has given Russia and China the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the F-35’s stealth systems. Those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the US and its allies. The deterioration of the US’s military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the US’s apparent loss of strategic rationality. This is apparent worldwide, but is nowhere more obvious than in the Middle East. President Barack Obama’s decision to effectively abandon the US’s major allies in the Middle East in favor of cultivating ties with Iran has made the region far more dangerous to the US and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago. True, in theory, Obama’s decision to prefer the Shi’ites to the Sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of Sunni jihadism. But in light of the genocidal, totalitarian and imperial nature of the current Iranian regime, his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive. Moreover, Obama’s willingness to rack up the US’s national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup. In other words, even under the best circumstances, it is hard to imagine that the US will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade. The implications for Israel are far reaching. For decades, Israel’s strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on US power. This strategic posture is no longer tenable. The second major international shift is Russia’s sudden rise as the primary global power in the Middle East. As Channel 2 reported Sunday night, Russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of Israel’s air and naval operations. In a matter of months, Israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades. The air force reportedly is convinced that the F-35’s stealth systems will be able to neutralize Russia’s detection capabilities. But given the well-documented current problems with the F-35’s stealth systems, this conviction is unwise. And even under the best circumstances, in which Israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its F-35 without American interference, it will take Israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving Russian systems present to our air force. According to Channel 2’s report, air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events. Rather than panicking though, Israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation. The obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that Russia’s military primacy does not reach. Specifically, Israel needs to expand massively its capacity for under-the-radar operations. The first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities, particularly human intelligence capabilities. Israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region. Second, Israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies’ ability to strike us. Israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems. Israel’s reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies’ military chain of command as possible. If our offensive capabilities are being checked, so must the capabilities of our enemies. Indeed, our enemies need to be subverted. Part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that Israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in Iran. At the same time, Israel should be empowering anti-regime sectors in Iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance Israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the 1979 Islamic revolution. Third, Israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces. Israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores. It needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment. And it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of Russian regional primacy. Fourth, Israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power. It needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with Asia. Such economic growth and power will positively influence Russia’s willingness to allow Israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies – and Russia’s allies in Lebanon, Syria and beyond. In other words, the more economically powerful Israel is, the more Russia will be willing to side with Israel against Hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the Russian umbrella. This then brings us to Netanyahu’s upcoming trips. Each state that he will visit has something to offer Israel in expanding its intelligence, cyberwarfare and economic capabilities. Australia, a major Western economy, is moving toward China as America has become less engaged in the Pacific. Israel has an acute interest in using Australia as a platform for expanding its ties to China and other Asian countries, both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to China’s strategic importance to Russia. As for Singapore, Israel effectively built the Singaporean military in the 1960s and 1970s. The country remains extremely supportive of Israel. Like Australia, Singapore has close ties to China. It has technological and other capabilities that can be extremely advantageous for Israel today. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are critically important to Israel today. Their strategic proximity to Iran, and their ties to Russia, along with their ethnic composition and their natural resources make securing good relations with both critical to Israel’s ability to advance and security its strategic interests in every sphere. Israel has tremendous assets to offer each of the four countries that Netanyahu will visit. These assets must be deployed wisely to ensure that Israel gains as much as possible from his trip and from its future ties with all of them. Given the dramatic changes in the global power balance, and their implications for Israel, Netanyahu’s decision to fly to visit these four countries just after the US elections tells us that he gets it. At a time of regional and global turbulence and uncertainty, in the context of swiftly multiplying threats, this is no small matter.",0
6975,British ex-soldier cuts off own toes with pliers to avoid hospital delays,"British ex-soldier cuts off own toes with pliers to avoid hospital delays British ex-soldier cuts off own toes with pliers to avoid hospital delays By 0 61 
A former soldier cut off two of his gangrene-ridden toes with a pair of tin metal pliers without anesthetic in his living room after becoming frustrated at a six-week delay to being operated on by the National Health Service (NHS). 
Paul Dibbins, 57, from Buckfastleigh, Devon, had been told he needed to have his right leg amputated at the knee due to complications from diabetes, combined with suffering serious frostbite in his feet while repairing a car in freezing conditions. 
Dibbins says his foot turned “soot black” and he was rushed to hospital. However, his operation was cancelled at the last minute because of problems with the previous patient. 
He says he then discharged himself from hospital and thought surgeons would call him in a few days to re-book an appointment, but claims they never did. 
“I’d been told my leg would be cut off and I was taken into surgery. But it was cancelled. I just wanted to go home and see my wife and kids.” 
Dibbins says he resorted to treating his own wounds over nine months using a Swiss army knife, sterile scissors and homemade dressing. He says he saw doctors every six weeks afterwards and they told him he could keep treating his frostbite until “things turned nasty.”

He says he eventually developed gangrene and his doctor said his infected toes would have to be removed. Rather than wait six weeks for the operation, Dibbins took matters into his own hands. 
He says the operation, performed without pain killers and in his living room while biting on a rolled up towel, took about an hour. His wife of 40 years was in the house but says she did not want to look. 
“Knowing that it would take at least another six weeks to get me in front of a surgeon again, that’s when I bit the bullet and cut off the toes,” Dibbins told the North Devon Journal. 
“I did it because it’s what had to be done. My doctor told me my toes were going to kill me. 
“I’ve had one surgeon say to me it was more luck than judgment, but then I had another surgeon saying I was mad but it was textbook.” 
A spokesperson for Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust told the Times: “The safety of all our patients is our top priority and occasionally it does become necessary for operations to be postponed, if there is another patient with a more critical medical need.”

6977,"Continuing Email Flap Won't Derail Clinton, But There's Still Danger","Headlined to H3 10/28/16 - Advertisement - 
GOP presidential contender Donald Trump giddily and predictably wasted no time when FBI Director James Comey announced that the agency was looking at more Clinton emails. For the umpteenth time, Trump branded her a criminal and demanded that Americans not let her ""criminal enterprise"" into the Oval Office. No matter that Comey made it clear that there is no evidence at the moment that there was anything improper, let alone illegal, in the emails. But the revelation that the Feds were looking at them coming in the stretch run to the White House was more than enough to set off talk of the perennially mentioned October surprise that could derail a presidential candidate's presidential bid; in this case the candidate being Clinton. 
Even if there is something amiss in the emails, it won't change the race's outcome. Trump's path to an electoral vote win was always dicey at best, but more likely, impossible. The big electoral states such as California, New York, Illinois, Maryland, Washington, and a handful of other less electoral rich states are solid lock down Democratic states. The six or seven key swing states that are crucial, either trend Democratic. In nearly all cases, they voted for President Obama in his election and re-election bids, and are almost certain to stay that way through Election Day. 
Having said that, the email flap just won't go away. This does pose something else that could be problematic for Clinton in the White House. That's turning the GOP into an even more ferocious, obstructionist, take-no-prisoners party that will wage open war against her administration. Trump and the GOP have hammered home the line that Clinton is shady, untrustworthy and, less charitably, a serial liar. It's had an effect. Her approval and popularity ratings have hovered just slightly above those of Trump. In some pithy polls, voters vote ""neither"" for and not for either her or Trump. The race to the bottom in the presidential campaign has been fed by the near fetish focus by much of the mainstream media and far too many pundits on the sex and corruption allegations against respectively Trump and Clinton. 
The FBI's announcement of more email probes means that Clinton will have to take precious time out from her campaign focus on the issues that should and do really matter to again answer questions about what she did and why she did it with her emails. Reporters will shout this at her no matter what point she's trying to make about jobs, health care, or a foreign policy matter. 
Once in the Oval office, this fetish isn't likely to end, Trump and the GOP will see to that. The opening salvo came from Arizona Senator John McCain when he saber rattled Clinton by calling for the rejection of any Clinton SCOTUS pick. Even if the Democrats take back the Senate, that threat is still not just hot air. The GOP will still have enough Senate votes to delay, foot drag, obstruct, harass, pick and probe endlessly at, and ultimately filibuster a Clinton pick. The hope being that this will force Clinton to withdraw the pick, and send the message that the choice for the High Court must pass the hard-nosed conservative ideological litmus test that's the GOP set piece for a SCOTUS judge. 
The warfare will be even worse in the House which the GOP almost certainly will control. House Speaker Paul Ryan gave a huge signal just how fierce that warfare against her will be. He was barely a step behind Trump in climbing all over the Comey announcement about the emails to lambaste Clinton. - Advertisement - 
If Clinton moves quickly as she's promised with her plan to ramp up spending on jobs and economic reconstruction to the tune of $300 billion, this will send the GOP scurrying even faster to the barricades. It will try and toss every barrier it can in her way, making all kinds of wild charges that the spending is nothing more than a pork barrel, gravy leaden, pay out to the urban poor, and disadvantaged, at the expense of the long suffering, high tax paying white middle-class. 
Clinton takes office with the GOP manufactured and Trump fed cloud of suspicion hanging heavily over her. The great danger is that this will plant the seed even deeper in the public that the Clintons are the personification of sleaze. This in turn would blur, ignore and flat out dodge any real talk about tax reform job growth and the economy, health care, wealth and income inequality, civil rights, environmental concerns and criminal justice reforms. 
Clinton's continuing email problems can't make Trump into what he isn't and never was. And that's a credible, qualified choice to occupy the Oval Office. It just makes it that much easier for the GOP to do even more to make it harder for Clinton who is that choice to do the job that she will be elected to do.

6978,Congregants’ Quiet Agony at the Dylann Roof Trial - The New York Times,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   Each morning they flowed into Courtroom Six, escorted by federal officials from a holding room reserved for survivors and families of the victims. The accused, Dylann S. Roof, never turned from the end of the defense table to acknowledge the parents, widows and widowers, children, grandchildren and fellow congregants of the nine   he confessed to killing in June 2015 at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Felicia Sanders, who survived the rampage but lost her son and her aunt, watched from the first of six rows of wooden benches, along with her husband, Tyrone. The Rev. Eric S. C. Manning, who now inhabits the office once occupied by the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was among those killed, sat one row back. The Rev. Anthony B. Thompson, whose wife, Myra, led the evening Bible study that Mr. Roof joined, always took his place in the fifth row, along with John Pinckney, the former pastor’s father. Until the jury returned a guilty verdict on Thursday afternoon, family members stoically endured a week of tormenting testimony in United States District Court, where Mr. Roof, 22, faced 33 counts. Many will be back on Jan. 3 when the same jury considers whether to sentence Mr. Roof to death. On Thursday morning, there were firm hugs between family members outside the courtroom after a prosecutor delivered a stirring closing argument, illustrated by gruesome crime scene photographs. On Wednesday, they heard from a medical examiner about the more than 60 wounds inflicted by his Winchester   bullets. On Tuesday, they watched three unnerving videos that Mr. Roof filmed of himself taking backyard target practice with the murder weapon in a   grip. Here is what it has been like for some in the courtroom: Mr. Thompson attended Mr. Roof’s trial each day except last Thursday, when he knew prosecutors would show photographs of the blood bath inside the fellowship hall. “I didn’t want to see the images,” he said in his office at Holy Trinity Reformed Episcopal Church, where he is vicar. “I didn’t want to have that in my head every day for the rest of my life, and of course I didn’t want to see my wife like that. ” His decision meant he also missed the videos, captured by a church security camera, of some of the final moments of his    wife’s life: the   clip of her striding purposefully in the side door at 5 p. m. dressed in a black suit and white blouse then the footage of her slipping out an hour later, warmly hugging two church members. Two hours after that, the camera captured Mr. Roof entering, a black pack around his waist, weighted by a .  Glock and eight loaded magazines. “It has been an emotional roller coaster,” Mr. Thompson said. “We have shed tears. There has been fear of the unknown. ” Mr. Thompson, 64, was one of the five family members who, in a spontaneous demonstration of grace, expressed forgiveness for Mr. Roof at his bond hearing less than 48 hours after the shootings. That has not changed, he said, despite watching Mr. Roof’s nonchalant and largely remorseless admission to plotting the assault to foment racial strife. “I have no intentions of taking that back,” the   clergyman said, stressing that his forgiveness had been more for himself than for Mr. Roof. “He is not a part of my life anymore. Forgiveness has freed me of that, of him completely. I’m not going to make him a lifetime partner. ” That said, he wished the Justice Department had accepted Mr. Roof’s offer to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. “The bad part is having to relive it, the going back to the beginning,” he said. “It’s just a lot to bear. ” Mr. Thompson said he finds Mr. Roof a pathetic figure but not mentally defective, as Mr. Roof’s lawyers would like the jury to believe. As a result, although he opposes the death penalty, he does not much care what happens to Mr. Roof. “His sentence won’t affect the way I live, won’t bring my wife back,” he said. “Whatever he gets I look at it as, well, that’s what he’s supposed to get. I have no choice in the matter. ” Mr. Manning had no connection to Mother Emanuel until January, when he won appointment to the historic pulpit after a tumultuous six months in which the church’s leadership changed three times. Other than his predecessor, Mr. Pinckney, he did not know any of the victims. But he has been in court each day, all day, since jury selection began, often joined by a fellow Emanuel minister, Brenda Nelson. Ms. Nelson would have joined the Bible study on any other Wednesday, but on that sweltering night she drove home to meet an   repairman. Mr. Manning, 49, said he felt it important to be at the courthouse to demonstrate “a ministry of presence. ” “You might not be able to say everything, but just that you can smile and they can smile back and you can hug, they know you’re there,” he said. The pastor has been preaching from the Book of Psalms during the trial, reminding his congregation on Sunday that “in the midst of all of this, God’s joy is the one constant. ” Mr. Manning said he had been moved by the stoicism of those around him, and of the two survivors who testified. “What has been displayed,” he said, “is just the determination to show once again the resilience and how strong our faith and trust is in God. ” The video taken before the murders of his church’s stalwarts affected him deeply. “They were just there doing what they have done on so many other Wednesdays, just there to study God’s word,” he said. “And in the midst of that, evil presented itself. ” Although his church opposes the death penalty, he acknowledged that Mr. Roof’s lack of remorse had given him “momentary pause. ” “But you have to always still do what is required, you have to forgive,” he said. “Now, am I there? I don’t know yet. Maybe that’s a question I’ll be able to answer after the trial. ” Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney, who was married to the Rev. Clementa Pinckney for 16 years, and Johnette Pinckney Martinez, the pastor’s adoring younger sister, have been inseparable during the trial. Ms. Pinckney and her    daughter were in the pastor’s study when the killings began, and huddled beneath a desk as bullets pierced the office wall. One of her first calls was to her    in Irmo, near Columbia. “Get to Charleston,” she implored. Eighteen months later, the trial has brought it all back. “It’s been pretty difficult to hear some of the things, well, most of the things,” Ms. Martinez, a corrections officer, said. “But for me it was another step in the healing process. ” The most painful moment was seeing the photographs of Mr. Pinckney, dressed as ever in his dark suit (he even wore them to high school) dead on the linoleum floor, blood pooling from his upper torso. Ms. Pinckney, a school librarian, said that the experience had been “emotionally excruciating” and that her reactions had coursed from tears to fury. Both women said it had been comforting to see the surveillance video of the Pinckney family arriving at church, the pastor holding his   daughter’s hand. He hugged a woman on her way out, patted another on the back, helped a third down a step. “That was him all the time,” Ms. Pinckney said of her husband, who was also a state senator. “He’s always greeting people, always hugging people, always interacting with people. It was his final moment, and it’s something I’ve seen dozens of times over. ” Both women said they were stunned to see evidence downloaded from the GPS in Mr. Roof’s car that he had cased the church on six trips to Charleston from his home near Columbia. “It was an eerie feeling to know he had been there for that period of time,” Ms. Pinckney said. “He was in the midst of everyone, knowing what he was planning. ” She remains bewildered that he targeted Mother Emanuel. Given the devastation he caused, what confounded Ms. Martinez as she observed Mr. Roof was his boyishness and his slight      frame. “It’s just unbelievable,” she said. “I would never have thought a child that young  —   a man that young  —   would have so much hate in his heart. ”",0
6979,Whom to Blame for Oroville -- and How President Trump Can Fix It,"The forecast is for more rain around the Oroville Dam  —   and potential disaster for hundreds of thousands of Californians living downstream from its poorly designed emergency spillway. [Many bear responsibility for the real prospect of a catastrophic failure of that spillway.  But ultimately, the buck stops with an obscure government agency 3, 000 miles away: the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  FERC has known about systemic defects of the Oroville Dam for over a decade. In fact, back in 2005, this dam was supposed to be relicensed for  . But objections were heard from various citizen groups.  They warned about   at the emergency spillway giving rise to the  potential for its catastrophic failure during high water conditions like those now present. Their calls for the spillway to be reinforced with concrete were ignored by the FERC which, instead, began granting annual   operating licenses in 2007. Those licenses have been renewed on the basis of a “Potential Failure Mode Analysis” of the Oroville Dam.  According to an October 14, 2016 letter sent by FERC’s Office of Energy Projects to the California Department of Water Resources, the latest Failure Analysis  —    which was submitted to FERC in December 2014  —   was “a significant improvement” over its predecessor.  The public is being kept in the dark about this justification for ignoring the actual, high potential for failure of this dam, however, because FERC treats these these Failure Analysis documents as secrets. Unfortunately, this     in California is just one example of FERC’s shortcomings. The agency is overwhelmed by its extensive regulatory responsibilities and it is often captured by regulated interests. Consider the following contributing factors: Bad as the dangers associated with FERC’s failure to assure the safety of the Oroville dam are, these factors have contributed to the agency’s culpability for even more serious malfeasance: the uncorrected vulnerability of the U. S. electric grid to physical, cyber and electromagnetic pulse attack, as well as to the effects of intense solar storms. Should the grid  —   our most critical of critical infrastructures  —   suffer widespread and sustained collapse as a result of one or the other of those very real dangers becoming reality, the consequences would dwarf those associated with massive flooding of areas below the Oroville Dam. These potential catastrophes underscore a   reality: The safety and security of the American people requires that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have as commissioners individuals who have been, are and will remain genuinely independent from the industries that their agency regulates. This is especially so as the commissioners are, by statute, essentially unaccountable to either the President or Congress. As it happens, three out of five FERC commissioner slots are currently open. It is imperative that President Trump nominates, and the Senate confirms, only commissioners who will have the requisite technical expertise, independence and vision to use their considerable power to protect the people of this country, and not simply the utilities they regulate.",0
6980,Comment on Physicists discover humans have souls by William Brandon Shanley,"Posted on November 6, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 1 Comment 
Religion and science need not be at loggerheads for, once again, science discovered something Christians have long believed — that we each have a soul. 
Yesterday, an article in the UK rag, The Sun , told of a scientific discovery that that actually is several years old: Physicists have discovered the equivalent of the soul, i.e., something that endures after the death of our bodies. 
To begin, physicists like renowned British physicist Sir Roger Penrose now believe that human consciousness is something ineffable that’s “beyond the computational laws of physics”. Watch and listen as Penrose grapples at describing our consciousness in the video below, beginning at the 2:11 mark: 
“To me, there is something outside the computational laws of physics. And when I wrote my book, ‘The Emperor’s New Mind,’ I was trying to develop this idea, and I was trying to say, ‘Well, there is something else out there.’ What could it be? Where is the biggest gap in our understanding of physics? . . . most of these things don’t have a direct bearing on what the brain does . . . . This big gap is within present-day quantum mechanics . . . maybe that gap is where the theory has to be outside a computational system.” 
According to Penrose and other physicists, our consciousness is “a packet of information” that’s stored at a quantum or sub-atomic level in microtubules within human cells. When a person dies, his or her quantum information (or consciousness) leaves the body and is released into the universe, only to return to the body’s cells if the host is brought back to life. Penrose argues that this explains why people can have near-death experiences, and believes that this quantum information amounts to a soul leaving the body : 
“If the patient dies, it’s possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body, perhaps indefinitely, as a soul.” 
From Wikipedia : 
“Microtubules are a component of the cytoskeleton , [cellular skeleton] found throughout the cytoplasm . . . . The outer diameter of a microtubule is about 24 nm [nanometre * ] while the inner diameter is about 12 nm . . . . Microtubules are very important in a number of cellular processes. They are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell and, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments , they form the cytoskeleton . They also make up the internal structure of cilia and flagella .They provide platforms for intracellular transport and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the movement of secretory vesicles , organelles , and intracellular macromolecular assemblies (see entries for dynein and kinesin ). They are also involved in chromosome separation ( mitosis and meiosis ), and are the major constituents of mitotic spindles , which are used to pull apart eukaryotic chromosomes .” 
* Note: One nanometre is one-billionth of a metre. 
Dr. Hans-Peter Dürr , former head of Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, said: 
“What we consider the here and now, this world, it is actually just the material level that is comprehensible. The beyond is an infinite reality that is much bigger. The body dies but the spiritual quantum field continues. In this way, I am immortal.” 
As reported four years ago by Australia’s News.com on Oct. 31, 2012, Sir Roger Penrose and Dr. Stuart Hameroff , Professor Emeritus at the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychology and Director of the Center of Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona, developed a quantum theory of consciousness asserting that our souls are contained inside structures called microtubules within our brain cells. Our experience of consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects inside these microtubules – a process they call orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR). In a near-death experience the microtubules lose their quantum state, but the information within them is not destroyed. Or in layman’s terms, the soul does not die but returns to the universe. 
Dr Hameroff explained the theory at length in the documentary Through the Wormhole , which was aired on the Science Channel: 
“The quantum information within the microtubules is not destroyed, it can’t be destroyed, it just distributes and dissipates to the universe at large. If the patient is resuscitated, revived, this quantum information can go back into the microtubules and the patient says ‘I had a near death experience’. [If the patient dies, it is] possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body indefinitely – as a soul.”

6981,"Skating, and Scoring, for God’s Glory - The New York Times","NORTH ARLINGTON, N. J.  —   College roller hockey teams from across the Northeast, including Pennsylvania State University, competed at an indoor arena here recently, shooting, skating and stickhandling with gusto as they battled to climb the standings and win for their teammates and for school pride. But one team, the Maccabees of Yeshiva University, was playing for something loftier  —   religious devotion and the quest to bring glory to Orthodox Jews. “When we go out there, wearing Yeshiva across our chest, it reflects not just on our school but on our whole religion,” Avi Margulies, 22, one of the team’s founders, said after the team improved its record to  . In their second season, the Maccabees, named for a band of ancient Jewish freedom fighters, are doing their faith proud and bringing athletic acclaim to this college in northern Manhattan better known for training religiously devout students than turning out powerhouse sports teams. This unlikely band of Orthodox Jewish students is tearing up the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association, against teams with few or no Jewish players and more resources. The   squad was founded last season with little fanfare or financial assistance from the university. The players spend most of their time immersed in intense studies of the Talmud and the Torah, but Sundays are for hockey. Because of Sabbath restrictions, they cannot play the usual Friday and Saturday games scheduled by the league. Instead, they must play multiple games Sunday mornings, starting as early as 7 a. m. and playing up to four games, sometimes back to back against fresher teams. On a recent Sunday morning at the New Jersey rink, the Maccabees’ fans far outnumbered  —   and stood out  —   from those rooting for the other teams. The men wore skullcaps and the women dressed in prim dark skirts. Joe Klein, part of a group of classmates at the rink, said the team’s credo was “Play hard to pray hard” and likened the team to a biblical David bringing down Goliaths. “They live for the fact that they’re going to be the underdogs,” said Akiva Blumenthal, another Yeshiva student. After all, most of the teams at the rink hailed from large universities like Penn State and the University of Delaware, with   hockey programs that receive money from their schools and are unencumbered by religious strictures. The Yeshiva team showed up at the rink before 7 a. m. and squeezed into a cramped locker room. Putting on a uniform included pulling a helmet over a yarmulke and strapping padding over a white, tasseled religious shawl, known as a tallit. They had already finished a lengthy prayer session and were facing a grueling three games. Last season, they played in Division 4, which is for newer teams. They lost one game all season and won the league championship, earning them the right to play this season in the more competitive Division 2 league against teams like Boston University and Northeastern. Still, they are currently in first place and are a favorite to win the league championships in March in Pennsylvania. The Maccabees will most likely qualify for the national championship in Florida in April, said William Bourque, the commissioner of the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association, and their performance there could enable them to move to the top division, whose teams have bigger budgets that include team buses and plane travel to games. Mr. Bourque said he was impressed by the team’s quick success, especially since new teams typically struggle to achieve a winning record. “It’s very rare that a team comes in and becomes a top team right away,” he said. “They’re probably the   team out there. They probably don’t have the most talented players, but they have the best teamwork. They want it more than anyone else. ” The game is essentially played on an ice hockey rink with a hard surface. Body checking is forbidden but play is still scrappy, with plenty of contact. Players use a hard plastic puck and wear   skates and padding. Maccabee players and supporters regard the team’s unlikely accomplishment as something of a miracle. “Growing up as an Orthodox kid, you can’t play in the roller hockey leagues because they don’t cater to the orthodox lifestyle,” said Amir Gavarin, who also helped start the team and is the captain. “So you wonder if you can play with the gentiles. We’re trying to prove to the community that we can hang with them. ” The team is largely an outgrowth of the avid floor hockey scene in orthodox high schools in and around New York City. Some top players who ended up attending Yeshiva University were recruited by Mr. Margulies and Mr. Gavarin. Many of the players, including one of the goalies, Joseph Robin, had to develop skating skills. Two of the team’s stars, Avi Edell and Ari Drazin, grew up in Canada playing ice hockey and had to learn how to play on wheels instead of blades. Being a club rather than a varsity sport means the team is not eligible for athletic department funding, school officials said. Still, the team is hoping to persuade the school to provide some financing, Mr. Gavarin said. The players had to raise money to buy uniforms and equipment, pay league fees, cover travel expenses and even to hire a coach, Ely Gemara. League officials warned the Yeshiva players that holding games on Sunday mornings could mean having to play before sunrise. “We told them, ‘Guys, it’s going to be really, really hard,’ but they’ve taken everything in stride,” Mr. Bourque said. Because of the players’ rigorous study schedules, it has been tough to schedule practices, and rental fees are steep at rinks on Long Island and in New Jersey. They also practice at an outdoor public rink on First Avenue in Manhattan. This season, the team had to skip preseason games because they fell during the High Holy Days in October. Players said their travel logistics could be as challenging as their opponents. While other teams show up in team vans, the Maccabees scramble to assemble car pools. With kosher and Sabbath restrictions, even hotel stays are tricky. Team members often stay with orthodox families, sometimes sleeping on attic floors or in cold garages. There was also the necessity of packing their own kosher food  —   which usually meant cold meals  —   and fitting morning, afternoon and evening prayer sessions between car trips to games across the Northeast. The toll of travel hit the team at its very first game, in Rhode Island. After praying in a cold, dark parking lot, the team seemed in a daze as their opponents scored 15 seconds into the game. The Maccabees, however, woke up and rallied to a lopsided   victory. By season’s end, several of the players won league honors, but could not attend a Friday night banquet. Instead, league officials presented the awards the following Sunday in a locker room. There have been awkward moments. Last season, at a rink on Long Island, the opposing team could not conceal its surprise after walking into a locker room to find the Maccabees in   prayer together in Hebrew. “You should have seen the shock on their faces,” Mr. Gavarin said. Some   fans travel hours to road games. At the rink in New Jersey, they were crestfallen when the team blew a   lead against Stony Brook University, and lost   in overtime. But they revived when the Maccabees beat Delaware University and trounced Penn State in a game that featured Mr. Drazin and Jesse Gordon combining on a dazzling Maccabees goal. The two players initially met while studying the Talmud in Israel before playing together. Now they make up the team’s first offensive line. Mr. Gavarin acquired his love for the game from his father, Barry Gavarin, who began playing a primitive form of hockey at his own yeshiva in the 1960s, first kicking the puck on an outdoor makeshift ice rink and then buying sticks and skates with his classmates as a break from religious study. The younger Mr. Gavarin said he and his teammates considered being both devout Jews and ferocious competitors a way to encourage other young observant Jews to break out of the often “insulated” world of Orthodox Jewish life. “We’re opening up a whole new viewpoint and worldview for Orthodox kids,’’ Mr. Gavarin said, “because they can see that if you work hard enough you can play with anybody. ”",0

A French state watchdog has called for the suspension of a database that could end up holding the biometric details of 60 million people. The aim of a single “mega-database” is to fight identity fraud and improve efficiency. But, as Paul Kirby explains, there are fears the database could be abused not only by hackers but by state intelligence too, What’s the database for? The single database would not be used in judicial investigations, ministers insist. Rather, it would help tackle identity fraud by comparing one set of digital fingerprints with another. France’s interior ministry wants the Secure Electronic Documents (TES) to collect all the information on an individual held on two separate databases that have details of people’s passports and national ID cards. Only children under 12 would be exempt. It would include an individual’s name, address, marital status, eye colour, weight, photograph and fingerprints. It’s merely an administrative register, argues Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas. Its only legal use would be when data need to be requisitioned.",0
6984,Shocking! Scientists Reveal The Universe Could Delete Itself At Any Moment!,"The end of everything is nearing us all! Or perhaps not, but we won't know when it's here.

It's a mysterious universe we are living in, so magnificent and complex that researchers and experts have come up with hundreds of theories on how it originated, how it works and when it ends.

The infinite questions that we hold about the universe will keep us thrilled for the rest of our lives, and the universe will probably end before we can even figure it out.

We fear the universe will trigger either a Big Crunch or a Big Rip during it's course, colliding into a singularity state or ripping itself apart . 


Scientists have revealed that the universe could delete itself, without anyone even noticing it. Experts believe that our universe has reached it's lowest state with every particle in existence except for the ""Higs Field"".

6985,"Hillary Clinton staffer: ""Black Voters Are Stupid""","
A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being “stupid”.
The Wikileaks email ID 31909 , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured “many black faces”.
Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didn’t care about black people.
Budowsky is not impressed with Brock’s outburst, writing in the email, “Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.”
“I guess Brock’s plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,” writes Budowsky.
“I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,” adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad.
The email once again underscores the Clinton camp’s paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could.
Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as “super predators”.

6986,Sieben Sprachen in nur vier Jahren: Ist Bella ein Wunderkind?,"Окт 5 2016 в 5:26 PDT 

Mit zwei Jahren konnte Bella kurze Sätze bilden und in drei Sprachen schnell lesen. Kurz vor ihrem dritten Geburtstag fügten ihre Eltern Chinesisch zum Ausbildungsprogramm hinzu. Laut Julia zeigte ihre Tochter ein großes Interesse an der neuen Sprache und wollte selbst Cartoons auf Chinesisch schauen. 
Mit drei Jahren und zwei Monaten lernte Bella mit Begeisterung Spanisch und Deutsch, aber nicht nur: Nebenbei tanzte sie, spielte Geige und sang. Später kam noch die arabische Sprache hinzu. Damals wie heute geht Bella spazieren, spielt Verstecken und liest normale Kinderbücher –in verschiedenen Sprachen. Grundsätzlich haben Spiele einen wichtigen Platz in ihrem Lernprozess. 
Die kleine Bella verbringt ihre Zeit mit Reisen mit Muttersprachlern, besucht eine englischsprachige Theatergruppe, hat Malunterricht auf Französisch, Tanzunterricht auf Spanisch und lernt Eiskunstlauf mit einem deutschen Muttersprachler. Außerdem organisieren ihre Eltern für sie Sprachunterricht mit ihren Freunden, die genauso mehrsprachig aufwachsen. Sprachen lernen ist gut für das Gehirn Авг 25 2016 в 10:32 PDT 

Wissenschaftler fanden heraus, dass die Fähigkeit, verschiedene Sprachen zu sprechen und zwischen ihnen zu wechseln, von unterschiedlichen Gehirnarealen abhängt. Sie werden je nach phonetischen Sprachmerkmalen, der Grammatik, Vorstellungen und sogar der Tonalität der Aussprache aktiv. 
„Jede neue Erfahrung führt dazu, dass unser Gehirn neue Nervenverbindungen herstellt”, erklärt Psychologin Tatjana Djatschenko. „Der für unser Gedächtnis zuständige Hippocampus stimuliert das Wachstum von neuen Neuronen. Dadurch wachsen wortwörtlich einige Gehirnareale.“ 
„Die Mehrsprachigkeit wirkt sich positiv auf die allgemeine Entwicklung des Kindes aus, obwohl es manchmal Sprachentwicklungsstörungen im frühen Alter verursachen kann. Dies tritt bei Kindern, die einsprachig aufwachsen, seltener auf”, sagt Kira Iwanowa, Mitarbeiterin des Instituts für linguistische Studien der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. 
Sprachunterricht im frühen Alter sei jedoch keine Garantie dafür, dass ein Kind diese Sprache später gut beherrschen werde, erklärt Maria Molina, wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin des Instituts für Sprachwissenschaften der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. “Ich kenne ein Beispiel: Eine Mutter hat mit ihrem Sohn nur Englisch gesprochen, bis er drei Jahre alt wurde. Dieser Junge kann derzeit nicht einmal sein Pensum in einer ganz normalen Schule schaffen.”",0

6989,Why Some of Your Holiday Gifts Might Not Fly - The New York Times,"The presents have been unwrapped. The batteries have been charged. Chances are, a few of those new gizmos may be designed to make air travel less stressful and more productive. Even so, when it is time to board the flight home after the holidays, some gifts simply might not fly. Devices powered by   batteries can cause problems, and airlines balk at virtual reality headsets. Even nonelectronic travel aids can cause concern. Last holiday season, hoverboards went on airlines’ own Do Not Fly lists because of their propensity to catch fire. This year, expect drones to draw scrutiny, depending on the strength of their batteries. Under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s dangerous goods regulations,   batteries with power greater than 100   are not allowed on passenger aircraft without advance approval of the airline. Batteries with power greater than 160   are not allowed in passenger   or checked baggage. Kyle Christy, 30, an auto repair manager with the State of Minnesota, said he often flies with the drones he uses for his freelance job as an aerial photographer. “The airlines should make it easier,” Mr. Christy said. “A lot of drone batteries are based off milliamp hours,” he added. “The airlines don’t give the formulas to crunch the numbers to see if they fall under the proper   restrictions. ” With their phones, tablets, cameras and laptops, many passengers carry several   devices onboard. On a   jet, that could add up to more than a thousand batteries in the passenger cabin. And sometimes they do catch fire. That’s why when the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone was recalled in September, the United States Department of Transportation banned them from all flights. Airline websites typically offer detailed lists of banned, restricted or dangerous goods. But it is difficult to keep up with the marketplace  —   as with this year’s   virtual reality headsets. More than six million of them have been shipped in 2016, according to SuperData, a market research firm. Virtual reality gives users a total visual and auditory experience for games and movies. But wearing the goggles and   headphones can make users oblivious to their surroundings. This is why some airlines have begun prohibiting their use during taxi, takeoff and landing. “If you are switching off your own situational awareness, you are increasing the risk of injury to yourself if there is an evacuation,” said Jonathan Jasper, also known as JJ, manager of cabin safety for the International Air Transport Association, an airline trade group. “The guidance across the airlines is they won’t allow them” during those portions of the trip, Mr. Jasper said of the headsets. “They need their passengers to be aware of what is going on. ” Mr. Jasper gets together every six weeks or so with the safety representatives of 17 airlines to analyze the risks and hazards of new technology and consider whether restrictions are necessary. “The job of an airline is not to upset passengers before they board,” Mr. Jasper said. But airlines feel a need to be vigilant about the things passengers carry with them onto planes. A flight attendant for a large United States carrier said she was startled recently when she saw that two passengers had attached a small device to a window with a suction cup. The attendant thought it looked like a bomb. The couple explained it was a GPS device with which they were tracking their route. The flight attendant could not find GPS mentioned in her airline’s policies and procedures manual. And so, after questioning the couple again, she allowed the device to remain. The flight attendant told the story on the condition that her name not be used, to avoid a possible reprimand from her employer. Before letting passengers use electronic devices in flight, the Federal Aviation Administration requires airlines to conduct tests to be sure the items do not interfere with planes’ avionics and communications equipment. “GPS does emit more magnetic interference than a mobile phone, and a mobile phone with a GPS is even more,” Mr. Jasper said. If the airline is not sure, it must take the side of caution and say no, he said. The next step would be transmitting that information to flight attendants. Not all questionable   are electronic. Nicola Burke is a British expat and family travel blogger living in Hong Kong. When she flies with her daughters, ages 7 and 5, she takes a   cushion, the creation of two California mothers who are also frequent fliers. The inflatable   fits on the floor in front of the seats and creates a flat surface where children can stretch out during the flight. “I have used the   on several airlines, including British Airways, Virgin, Cathay Pacific and Thai Airlines,” Ms. Burke said. “I have never been questioned about it. ” But safety officials are scrutinizing the   for its potential to cause heat to build up around   entertainment boxes beneath the seats on some aircraft. Mr. Jasper said  ’s maker was working to modify the product to reduce that likelihood and the risk the device might block decompression vents on the floor. “We have been working closely with the cabin safety committee of I. A. T. A. to ensure that our product meets all safety guidelines for airplane use,” said Winnie Lu, one of the inventors. A travel aid that was not under any Christmas trees  —   it does not begin shipping until early 2017  —   is the Modobag. But it is already creating airline controversy. The Modobag is a motorized suitcase meant for travelers to ride as they make their way through the airport, and then take onto the plane with them as   luggage. When Kevin O’Donnell, a Chicago entrepreneur and inventor, announced the product last summer, he promised that the Modobag would “change the way the world travels. ” Not if Delta Air Lines has its way. The airline has already banned such riding suitcases from its flights, citing the same potential battery hazards that got hoverboards prohibited from most aircraft. “The poorly labeled, powerful   batteries powering these devices are the problem,” said Ashton Morrow, a spokeswoman for Delta. She said the airline had reviewed product specifications and found that manufacturers did not consistently provide sufficient detail about the size or power of the batteries. Mr. O’Donnell declined to provide the power specification for Modobag’s battery. He said in an email that the product was going through a second series of tests “to make sure our batteries meet or exceed the safety requirements of the aviation industry. ” Customers have already ordered 400 bags that will be shipped in February, he said. That should allow plenty of time for other airlines to weigh in before the next holiday   season begins.",0
6990,Putin: Is America now a Banana Republic?,"
The US should stop brazenly blaming Russia for the situation in Syria as it may face an equally harsh response, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned at the Valdai forum in Sochi, also addressing American exceptionalism, Trump and other issues.
Does anyone seriously think that Russia can somehow influence the choice of the American people? Is America some sort of a banana republic? America is a great state. Correct me, please, if Iâ€™m wrong.
On the US media switching from portraying Trump as Russiaâ€™s enemy to Kremlinâ€™s favorite:
This is complete and utter rubbishâ€Ś a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential election
Simply watching airstrikes in the heart of Europe (in Yugoslavia) at the end of the 20th century, I donâ€™t know about you, but for me â€“ it felt like savagery.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States decided that thereâ€™s no need to coordinate fundamental issues with anybody. And it all just went off…

6991,"Go Fuck Yourself, Kurt Eichenwald!","Perhaps, you have not heard of Kurt Eichenwald. He is a Vanity Fair contributing editor and Newsweek senior writer. He has around 182,000 followers on Twitter. Many of the messages sent from his account receive hundreds if not thousands of retweets. He has influence so that is why I am taking the time to say what Eichenwald will not write. And that is go fuck yourself.
Why should Eichenwald go fuck himself? Does Eichenwald deserve to be told to do this? Or am I, as people commonly say when met with profanity, better than that? Let’s see.
Eichenwald published a nearly 3,000-word screed centered on an encounter in the Philadelphia International Airport with someone who said they were a fan of his work. In fact, as Eichenwald admits, he almost assaulted this person.
The man recognized him from a news program. According to Eichenwald, the man thanked him for his reporting on Donald Trump. He expressed outrage that Trump won and added, “Get back to work.” Eichenwald apparently lacks the ability to engage in basic social interactions with those who say they are his fans because he thought he detected a bit of “arrogance.” So, he asked who the man voted for.
Instead of telling Eichenwald it was none of his damn business, the fan was friendly. He said he voted for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. A gasket blew inside Eichenwald. He interrupted his fan and said, “You’re lucky it’s illegal for me to punch you in the face.” He told his fan to go fuck himself (although Newsweek and/or Eichenwald apparently do not want to print it so the column says he told the fan to “have sex with himself”).
Eichenwald bashes Stein and Bernie Sanders supporters and blames them for spreading “conspiracy theories” that helped cost Democrats the election. The entire column is a toxic slab of slime with a level of contempt and hostility that is staggering, given that he centers it on someone who claimed to be a fan of his work. One can only imagine what he would have done if that person said they were not a fan but tried to talk to him.
This is absolutely the wrong reaction to the outcome of the election, however, it is the culmination of the worst genre of reporting and writing pumped out to the masses and popularized in the last year: vote shaming.
Journalists like Kurt Eichenwald feel it is their place to shame voters for their choices and tell them what to do. At the same time, trust in journalists, who work for mass media, is at a historic low. Is it any wonder why people trying to navigate a broken and corrupt electoral system that only gives them two choices every four years do not have confidence in the press, which elevates people who will attack them for refusing to fall in line?
“Shut the Hell Up” Eichenwald goes off on a “certain kind of liberal” he cannot stand, the kind that preens about their “narcissistic purity as they cast their ballot for a person they know cannot win.” This is truly rich coming from someone, who is a contributing editor for a magazine with a synonym for narcissism in its name, and who updates his followers on what he is doing with his stocks and uses his Twitter to prattle on and on about himself. The post does not address the substance of the so-called myths until about 1,000 words after he calls more attention to the struggle he endured trying to diligently write about Trump for the past months.
In blunt terms, Eichenwald states, “I have no problem with anyone who voted for Trump, because they wanted a Trump presidency. I have an enormous problem with anyone who voted for Trump or Stein or Johnson—or who didn’t vote at all—and who now expresses horror about the outcome of this election. If you don’t like the consequences of your own actions, shut the hell up.”
Eichenwald acts like he performed a public service, and without him, the electorate never would have been able to tell the difference between Clinton and Trump. He somewhat contradicts his demand to shut the hell up, too.
“If they supported Trump or truly didn’t care who won after acquiring a real understanding of both candidates’ positions—rather than spouting some self-indulgent, bumper-sticker logic—I have no complaints,” Eichenwald asserts. “If they opposed Trump while refusing to do what they could to keep him out of office—that is, vote for the only other candidate who could win —then they need to go perform sex with themselves. And I mean that in much cruder terms.”
Which brings us back to the basic idea that Eichenwald should go fuck himself. And I can print that without writing it out in some censored form so I can later pat myself on the back for maintaining some semblance of civility.
Stein Voters Could Not Have Helped Clinton Win If They Were “With Her” During election night, Carl Bialik of FiveThirtyEight.com reported , “As of current vote counts, the number of voters who cast ballots for candidates other than Clinton and Trump exceeds Trump’s winning margin — or lead, in races that haven’t yet been called — in many important states, including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But don’t pin Trump’s win on those voters who eschewed the two major candidates. Not all of them would have voted for Clinton had they been forced to choose only between her and Trump. And some might not have voted at all. Far more Democrats in Florida in 2000 voted for George W. Bush than voted for Ralph Nader.”
Nate Cohn of the New York Times even said Stein is not responsible for Clinton’s defeat.
Trump earned a sizable chunk of votes from Obama voters. Bialik reported on November 11, “A smaller share of eligible voters cast ballots in 2016 than in either of the previous two presidential elections,” and it was lower in states that went for Clinton.
This is probably the case because the Clinton campaign did not craft a message geared toward winning white working class or white middle class voters. She did not make overhauling free trade agreements a cornerstone of her campaign, and that hurt her in states like Michigan . It also could be that the Clintons represent something in establishment politics that millions of Americans felt they needed to reject.
However, Eichenwald is so enraged by the self-determination of voters—citizens who would vote for candidates on the ballot that the system intentionally tries to suffocate—that he insists the reason Clinton lost is because liberal Democrats are “consumed by provably false conspiracy theories.”
Oh Boy! Someone Gave Eichenwald A Peek at a “Republican Playbook” Against Sanders The “conspiracy theories” liberal Democrats (i.e. Sanders supporters) “believe” is the Democratic National Committee is an “all-powerful” entity that rigged the election against Sanders and Sanders would have won against Trump.
Eichenwald maintains “Sanders had not yet faced a real campaign against him” so he would not be able to win. By the end of May, the Clinton campaign had misrepresented Sanders’ role in the civil rights movement, accused Sanders of attacking President Obama for being “weak,” disingenuously claimed Sanders’s plan for single-payer healthcare would “dismantle Obamacare” to scare voters, and suggested the Sanders campaign planned to commit voter fraud in Iowa, allowed “Bernie Bros” to spread “vicious lies and sexism,” and sided with right-wing Republicans against immigration reform.
The campaign also dishonestly attacked him as a supporter of anti-immigrant Minutemen vigilantes, had a surrogate grotesquely claims Sanders’s wife, Jane, palled around with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, insisted Sanders supported the indefinite detention of immigrants, fabricated attacks on him for supposedly voting against the auto bailout, and pushed the inaccurate idea that he supported market deregulation in 2000. They also went after him for being a “single issue” candidate and pushed the notion that he ran for Democrat just to get “media attention” for himself, like he was an egomaniac.
At a Univision debate in March, a video clip of Sanders praising Cuban leader Fidel Castro was played. Clinton attacked Sanders over his remarks and used Cuban exiles in Florida to attack him for opposing U.S. imperialism in Cuba.
Despite all of those attacks, Sanders still appeared to do better than Trump in the polls and was ahead of Trump in a few state polls, where Clinton was behind Trump.
What’s most incredible about Eichenwald going off on Sanders supporters for “conspiracy theories” is the fact that he peddles and fabricates conspiracy theories in his work. For example, he published an entire piece claiming NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden acted as a Chinese spy because he told the Washington Post to publish documents on the same day the U.S. had a meeting with China about surveillance. He also pushed propaganda that Snowden left all the documents in Hong Kong.
Eichenwald claims to have seen the “Republican playbook” for attacks on Sanders. They bear a striking similarity to attacks already pushed out to the public. Sanders was asked about a rape fantasy essay he wrote when he appeared on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” He said, “It was bad fiction. I learned my lesson.” The Sanders campaign told the Washington Post it was a “dumb attempt at dark satire intended to attack gender stereotypes in the 1970s, and it looks as stupid today as it was then.”
That Sanders “sponsored a bill to ship Vermont’s nuclear waste to a poor Hispanic community in Texas, where it could be dumped,” was an attack pushed by the David Brock-funded Blue Nation Review , and it was part of a viral graphic fact-checked by PolitiFact in September 2015. PolitiFact deemed it “ largely accurate .”
Republicans may have enjoyed attacking him for his sympathy to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, but Clinton tried the attack on him for his comments on Castro and that did not gain much traction outside Cuban exile communities in Florida. Simply, that kind of attack that hearkens back to the days of Ronald Reagan does not have much currency with the electorate these days.
A lot of these attacks Republicans planned to deploy were already peddled by Clinton. In that regard, whether they would have been effective is highly questionable.
The next fan who encounters Eichenwald should probably run into him and knock his coffee over so it lightly burns his crotch because this sentiment is vile:
When Sanders promoted free college tuition—a primary part of his platform that attracted young people—that didn’t mean much for almost half of all Democrats, who don’t attend—or even plan to attend—plan to attend a secondary school. In fact, Sanders was basically telling the working poor and middle class who never planned to go beyond high school that college students—the people with even greater opportunities in life—were at the top of his priority list.
Asshole, they do not plan to go to college because they cannot afford it. He pushed for free college tuition so poor, working class, and middle class Americans could go to college without graduating in an ocean of debt. Once more, go fuck yourself, Kurt Eichenwald!
Eichenwald is oblivious to the fact that Democrats may have deployed these Republican attacks or perhaps he does not care. Sanders supporters on Twitter have sent messages directed at him suggesting Sanders would have beat Trump and that is enough to piss him off and lead to this awful excuse for a political rant.
Of Course The DNC Should Have Backed Clinton Before Primary Ended Turning to the other myth, Eichenwald argues it was “stupid” for anyone to believe the Democratic National Committee had rigged the Democratic primary. He maintains that they do not have the power to do such a thing.
Eichenwald cleverly crafts a frame that makes it easy to obscure political corruption that upset voters. What really happened is the DNC was a captive of the Clinton campaign that did everything the Clinton campaign wanted to serve its needs, even if that meant Sanders was put at a disadvantag e.
The DNC and Clinton campaign falsely accused the Sanders campaign of “stealing” voter file data. The Hillary Victory Fund funneled millions of dollars through state parties to the DNC. Democratic women supporting Sanders faced forms of retaliation .
Nearly half of superdelegates in the Democratic establishment lined up to support Clinton by July 2015, before a single vote was cast in a primary.
Now, Eichenwald makes a big to-do about the allegations that the debates were rigged without bothering to specifically mention the contents of a memo written by Clinton campaign chief administrative officer Charlie Baker in April 2015.
It reads:
Through internal discussions, we concluded that it was in our interest to: 1) limit the number of debates (and the number in each state); 2) start the debates as late as possible; 3) keep debates out of the busy window between February 1 and February 27, 2016 (Iowa to South Carolina); 4) create a schedule that would allow the later debates to be canceled if the race is for practical purposes over; 5) encourage an emphasis on local issues and local media participants in the debate formats; and 6) ensure a format that provides equal time for all candidates and does not give the moderator any discretion to focus on one candidate.
The campaign mostly succeeded because from February 11 to March 6 there were no debates even though there were major primaries. Regardless of whether more debates were added to the schedule in 2016, it also worked with the DNC to fight Sanders’ efforts to schedule more debates.
Eichenwald declares, “Once only one candidate can win the nomination, of course the DNC gets to work on that person’s behalf.” He contends after May 3 there was no chance Sanders would win. But before the primary, the DNC and Clinton campaign were coordinating on opposition research in preparation for a campaign against the Republican nominee. This is hugely alienating to the millions of Democratic voters, who do not support the corporate Democratic politics of Clinton, and had the DNC approached the election differently they may not have faced such discontent during the general election.
As if all of the above weren’t enough, here is another reason to thrust your middle fingers in the air next time you see Eichenwald at an airport:
Debates cost money, and the more spent on debates, the less available for the nominee in the general election. Plus, there is a reasonable belief among political experts that allowing the nominees to tear each other down over and over undermines their chances in the general election, which is exactly what happened with the Republicans in 2012.
This is quite anti-democratic. To Eichenwald, Democrats should not debate issues and defend their records in numerous debates, even though the election lasts for around 18 months, because it gives Republicans ammunition to attack the Democratic nominee. He also advocates against spending money on debates so it can go to a nominee that already benefits from side-stepping loopholes expanded by Citizens United . For that alone, I hope he gets stuck on an elevator with millennial Sanders supporters for hours but loses his voice and can’t chime in to lecture them.
Eichenwald is not the only journalist with prejudice toward democracy. But let’s be clear: at minimum, all presidential candidates able to get a percentage of support in a national poll, qualify for federal matching funds, or get on enough state ballots to win the number of electoral votes needed to become president should have a right to run in elections in the United States.
Yet, Eichenwald concludes, “If you didn’t vote for the only person who could defeat [Trump] and are now protesting a Trump presidency, may I suggest you shut up and go home. Adults now need to start fixing the damage you have done.”
For all of the crass, sanctimonious, and self-righteous bullshit, because this is the kind of journalism we need to destroy, I say put your middle fingers proudly in the air and shout it loud. Go fuck yourself, Kurt Eichenwald!

6994,What to Do If You Get Sick Abroad - The New York Times,"Getting sick can put a damper on any vacation, but it can be especially unsettling and even scary when it happens in another country. Here, Matthew Klapetzky, a registered nurse and the clinical director of Passport Health, the travel clinic at the University of Rochester School of Nursing, shares tips on what to do if illness hits you while abroad. “The majority of minor health issues that international travelers contend with can easily be   with a good   kit,” Mr. Klapetzky said. It should include an   medication such as Imodium   or   because diarrhea is the most common ailment among travelers from the United States and hits around half of them. “This happens when your body gets a stomach bug as a reaction to a natural bacteria of a given land, and though it’s not usually serious, it lasts two to four days and can be extremely dehydrating,” he said. Other musts in the kit: ibuprofen to reduce fevers, muscle inflammation and joint pain bandages in assorted sizes along with an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin for cuts and wounds oral rehydration supplements such as CeraLyte to replenish electrolytes lost through sweating and diarrhea blister pads and fiber supplements to ease constipation, also common during travel. Also, be sure to carry an EpiPen if you have allergies such as to tree nuts. If you twist your ankle, develop heat rash or have another    situation where you need to see a doctor, don’t hesitate to use local care. “Remember that the doctors where you are in the world are used to treating ailments specific to that region, such as severe sunburn, which is common in the tropics, so they are going to be your best bet to treat such issues,” Mr. Klapetzky said. Travelers can find local medical care through the State Department website but should be aware that the department does not take responsibility for the quality of service provided by any doctor or hospital on the list. In more dire health situations such as a heart attack or serious car accident, Mr. Klapetzky suggested contacting the local embassy of the United States. “The embassy can help get you airlifted out of the country and back home if that’s what’s required and can also help you, if you need it, arrange to have money wired over to pay for your care,” he said. Travelers should note that while the embassy is a valuable resource, it does not pay for these services or any medical care.",0

6996,Former British Ambassador Claims Source Of Podesta Leaks “Comes From Within Washington”,"
With the media gripped by accusatory speculation regarding the identity of the source behind the Wikileaks leak of hacked Podesta and DNC emails, much of it focused on Russia, a new theory has emerged from Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, who tells Sputnik (a Russian media outlet) that the source of the leaks are not Russian hackers but a Washington insider.
“The source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with Russia at all. I discovered what the source was when I attended the Sam Adam’s whistleblower award in Washington. The source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow .”

Asked about whether or not WikiLeaks have ever published information at the behest of Moscow, Murray said that “WikiLeaks has never published any material received from the Russian government or from any proxy of the Russian government. It’s simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material.”
While blasted by Washington, first by Republicans several years ago, and most recently by Democrats, the WikiLeaks revelations have often been hailed as a champion of accountability.
“I think whistleblowers have become extremely important in the West because the propaganda model — as Chomsky puts it — has been reinforced to the extent that people don’t get any true information out of the media at all. It’s worth saying that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks are publishers; they publish what whistleblowers leak to them,” Mr. Murrary told Sputnik.
Yet, whistleblowers in the US continue to be subject to lengthy prison sentences. A key example is Chelsea Manning, who was sentenced on August 21, 2013 to a thirty five year sentence for providing WikiLeaks with sensitive military and diplomatic documents highlighting, among other things, US military conduct in Iraq. Murray also mentions the case of John Kiriakou, a former investigator of international terrorism with the CIA who turned whistleblower.
“The people who did the torture have suffered no comeback at all,” adds Mr. Murray.
Taking a step back and discussing the risk of geopolitical escalation between Russia and the US, Murray told Sputnik that “there is no chance whatsoever that Russia is going to ever attack the United States, that simply isn’t going to happen.”
“Just as Russia is not going to attack the United Kingdom. There never has been a chance that Russia would ever attack either of these two countries. But of course the narrative is all to do with power and funneling huge amounts of American taxpayer money into the defense industry and the security industry and these people are both from the class that benefits.”
It’s an extremely dangerous game, says Mr. Murray, and it feeds into a foreign policy that is completely mad.
“In Syria — and I should say I’m no fan of the Assad regime at all — but the idea that backing assorted groups of jihadists to tear the country apart is a better solution is crazy and it’s especially crazy when we’ve already messed up Iraq, Afghanistan and now we’re doing exactly the same thing again and you can see it doesn’t work, it only works in terms of promoting continued instability and continued spending for the military and the security services.”
Finally, Murray also believes that the public can’t get clear analysis of these issues from mainstream media, because they are part of the same money/power nexus.

6997,A Peek Inside the Strange World of Fake Academia - The New York Times,"The caller ID on my office telephone said the number was from Las Vegas, but when I picked up the receiver I heard what sounded like a busy overseas call center in the background. The operator, “John,” asked if I would be interested in attending the 15th World Cardiology and Angiology Conference in Philadelphia next month. “Do I have to be a doctor?” I said, because I’m not one. I got the call because 20 minutes earlier I had entered my phone number into a website run by a Hyderabad, India, company called OMICS International. “You can have the student rate,” the man replied. With a 20 percent discount, it would be $599. The conference was in just a few weeks, I pointed out  —   would that be enough time for the academic paper I would be submitting to be properly reviewed? (Again, I know nothing about cardiology.) It would be approved on an “expedited basis” within 24 hours, he replied, and he asked which credit card I would like to use. If it seems that I was about to be taken, that’s because I was. OMICS International is a leader in the growing business of academic publication fraud. It has created scores of “journals” that mimic the look and feel of traditional scholarly publications, but without the integrity. This year the Federal Trade Commission formally charged OMICS with “deceiving academics and researchers about the nature of its publications and hiding publication fees ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. ” OMICS is also in the less   business of what might be called conference fraud, which is what led to the call from John. Both schemes exploit a fundamental weakness of modern higher education: Academics need to publish in order to advance professionally, get better jobs or secure tenure. Even within the halls of respectable academia, the difference between legitimate and fake publications and conferences is far blurrier than scholars would like to admit. OMICS is on the far end of the “definitely fake” spectrum. Real academic conferences evaluate potential participants by subjecting proposed papers and presentations to a rigorous   process. Some 15, 000 people attend the American Educational Research Association’s annual conference, for example, and only about a third of submitted proposals are accepted. In October, a New Zealand college professor submitted a paper to the   “International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics,” which was held last month at the Hilton Atlanta Airport. It was written using the autocomplete feature on his iPhone, which produced an abstract that begins as follows: “Atomic Physics and I shall not have the same problem with a separate section for a very long long way. Nuclear weapons will not have to come out the same day after a long time of the year he added the two sides will have the two leaders to take the same way to bring up to their long ways of the same as they will have been a good place for a good time at home the united front and she is a great place for a good time. ” The paper was accepted within three hours. An OMICS employee who identified himself as Sam Dsouza said conference papers are reviewed by its “experts” within 24 hours of submission. He couldn’t provide a list of its reviewers or their credentials. Having dispensed with academic standards, OMICS makes money on volume. Its conferenceseries. com website lists hundreds of   academic meetings, many at vacation destinations like Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla. On Dec. 1 and 2, the “2nd International Congress on Neuroimmunology and Therapeutics,” the “13th International Conference on Vaccines, Therapeutics and Travel Medicine: Influenza and Infectious Diseases,” and the “International Conference on Clinical and Medical Genetics” were all held, simultaneously, at the Hilton Atlanta Airport. Stacking multiple fake conferences at the same hotel is a common practice, says Jeffrey Beall, a tenured University of Colorado Denver librarian. He maintains a website for identifying “predatory open access scholarly publishers” that masquerade as scholarly journals, but are actually in the business of pumping out worthless articles and exploiting scholars with hidden fees. “You just rent a hotel, make up a name and stand around while everyone is reading their papers,” Mr. Beall says. “It’s easy money. ” Mr. Beall’s list, which has grown to 923 publishers from 18 in 2011, also includes a British company called the “Infonomics Society. ” Like OMICS, it publishes a raft of journals, 17 in all, with legitimately   titles like “International Journal of Sustainable Energy Development. ” Mr. Beall calls Infonomics an “impostor scholarly society” that is “designed to generate as much revenue as possible. ” All 17 journals are run by a single person named Charles Shoniregun out of a modest   attached brick home in the outer suburbs of London. Infonomics also sponsors a series of conferences. But when I looked into one of them, the “World Conference on Special Needs Education,” or W. C. S. N. E. the story was more complex than I expected. Like many predatory publishers, the Infonomics website for W. C. S. N. E. has a certain        quality familiar to anyone who reads the spam folder in their email. “The Infonomics Society has an established reputation for promoting research esteem that is valued by research community,” it says. The W. C. S. N. E. is attended by “Policy Makers and Stakeholders who care deeply about bringing creative, innovative and rigorous learning practices barriers. ” The W. C. S. N. E. paper submissions guidelines warn that all papers must be strictly limited to “a total of 4 to 6 pages. ” That includes all figures, tables and references. Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall, says that this is “a red flag. ” Education research papers are typically much longer, he notes  —   the tables and reference pages alone can run to double digits. But short papers are easier to pack into a single “journal. ” The website included a long list of “Program Committee members” with impressive academic credentials, as well as “Keynote Speakers” for the coming conference, scheduled to be held in August at Temple University, the W. C. S. N. E. host for the last three years. But when I contacted those identified as committee members and speakers, many immediately replied that they had no idea they were on the website and had no affiliation with the W. C. S. N. E. The announced keynote speakers told me they were nothing of the kind. Within 24 hours of my inquiries, someone removed their names and biographies from the site and replaced them with a page that said “Keynote Speakers to be Announced!” A spokesman for Temple, Hillel Hoffmann, said the university condemned “predatory   publishing” and said no university money had been spent on the conference. He said that   learners in the community, including adult literacy students, had attended parts of the conference and had benefited from it, but that none had paid to participate. He added that the W. C. S. N. E. would no longer take place at Temple. Richard Cooper, the director of disability services at Harcum College, a private   institution in Philadelphia, helped create W. C. S. N. E. along with Mr. Shoniregun. He says he has no involvement with the paper selection process or financial aspects of the conference, simply serving as an organizer, presenter and master of ceremonies. He described it as a worthwhile gathering of scholars, many of whom live in Africa and India and pay hundreds of dollars in conference fees to attend. The papers presented at previous W. C. S. N. E. conferences don’t appear to have been composed using the autocomplete function on an iPhone. They mostly describe small qualitative studies and surveys that examine   ideas, break little new ground and use statistical jargon to make their findings seem more complicated than they really are. They very likely would be rejected by the American Educational Research Association. But they are also well within the bounds of what gets published in many scholarly journals that, while not prestigious, have never been called a fraud. Barba Patton, an education professor at the University of   in Victoria, Tex. defended the W. C. S. N. E. unreservedly. “I have attended ten to fifteen of the conferences in the U. S. Canada and in Europe,” she wrote via email. “I have no concerns about the website. You must remember that the conference reaches many who are using the British English rather than the American. ” Mr. Shoniregun did not respond to messages sent to his several email addresses. But he appears to have created a kind of hybrid conference that combines the shady,   internet marketing practices of OMICS with the more quotidian inattention to academic rigor that characterizes much of legitimate academia. Take the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S) by all accounts a legitimate organization. This year, Peter Dreier, chair of the Urban and Environmental Policy department at Occidental College, described how he submitted a proposal full of jargon, misquotation, non sequitur and general academic gobbledygook to an international conference sponsored by the 4S. It was accepted. “I look forward to meeting you in Tokyo,” the panel organizer wrote. Lucy Suchman, a sociologist at Britain’s Lancaster University and the president of 4S, acknowledges that the abstract review process is “not perfect” and that she would have rejected Mr. Dreier’s submission. But, she notes, 4S reviews hundreds of submissions every year with an “assumption of good faith. ” It would not have occurred to them that someone of Mr. Dreier’s standing in academia was engaged in such an “unfortunate prank,” she said, emphasizing the overall high quality of 4S presentations. There are real, prestigious journals and conferences in higher education that enforce and defend the highest standards of scholarship. But there are also many more Ph. D.  than there is space in those publications, and those people are all in different ways subject to the “publish or perish” system of professional advancement. The academic    system is subject to no real outside oversight. Standards are whatever the scholars involved say they are. So it’s not surprising that some academics have chosen to give one another permission to accumulate publication credits on their C. V.’s and spend some of the departmental travel budget on short holidays. Nor is it surprising that some canny operators have now realized that when standards are loose to begin with, there are healthy profits to be made in the gray areas of academe.",0
6998,"Trump’s New Travel Ban Blocks Migrants From Six Nations, Sparing Iraq - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump signed an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations, even with changes intended to blunt legal and political opposition. The order was revised to avoid the tumult and protests that engulfed the nation’s airports after Mr. Trump signed his first immigration directive on Jan. 27. That order was ultimately blocked by a federal appeals court. The new order continued to impose a   ban on travelers, but it removed Iraq, a redaction requested by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who feared it would hamper coordination to defeat the Islamic State, according to administration officials. It also exempts permanent residents and current visa holders, and drops language offering preferential status to persecuted religious minorities, a provision widely interpreted as favoring other religious groups over Muslims. In addition, it reversed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria, replacing it with a   freeze that requires review and renewal. But the heart of the sweeping executive action is still intact, reflecting Mr. Trump’s “America first” pledge to safeguard against what he has portrayed as a hidden influx of terrorists and criminals  —   a   campaign promise that resonated deeply with white   voters. The new order retains central elements of the old one, cutting the number of refugees admitted to the United States each year to 50, 000 from about 110, 000. Mr. Trump is also leaving open the possibility of expanding the ban to other countries, or even putting Iraq back on the banned list if the country’s leaders fail to comply with a requirement that they increase intelligence sharing, officials said. “Unregulated, unvetted travel is not a universal privilege, especially when national security is at stake,” said John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, appearing alongside Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building in Washington on Monday. Mr. Kelly said the order was now “prospective” and applied “only to foreign nationals outside of the United States” who do not have a valid visa. None of the men took questions. The Trump administration quickly tried to break the legal logjam, filing papers in United States District Court in Washington late on Monday seeking to lift an order blocking the fulfillment of the initial ban. But the president’s revisions did little to halt criticism from Democrats and immigrant rights advocates, who predicted a renewed fight in the courts. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, described the new order as a “  ban” that was still “meanspirited and  . ” Margaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that the new order would “cause extreme fear and uncertainty for thousands of families by, once again, putting   hatred into policy. ” The new measure will be phased in over the next two weeks to avoid the frenetic,   execution of the order in January, which prompted protests across the country and left tearful families stranded at airports abroad and in the United States. The redrafted order, delayed by a week so it would not overshadow Mr. Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress last Tuesday, represented a recognition that the rushed first attempt at the ban did not pass muster legally or politically. Administration officials privately conceded that the initial version of the order was a political debacle that damaged Mr. Trump’s nascent presidency. But they were much more sanguine about the second order, arguing that the new, multiagency review process could be used in the future to bend Mr. Trump’s uncompromising messages toward Washington’s bureaucratic realities. Mr. Trump signed the first ban with great fanfare, in front of reporters, at the Pentagon. “We don’t want them here,” Mr. Trump said of Islamist terrorists. “We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country, and love deeply our people. ” This time, the White House issued a photograph of the president signing the order alone at his desk in the Oval Office. Justice Department lawyers said the revisions rendered moot legal cases against the original travel ban. But opponents said the removal of a section that had granted preferential treatment to victims of religious persecution was a cosmetic change that did nothing to alter the order’s prejudicial purpose. Immigrant rights lawyers had argued that the provision was intended to discriminate against Muslims, pointing to recent statements by Mr. Trump. “This is a retreat, but let’s be clear  —   it’s just another run at a Muslim ban,” said Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that sued to stop the first order. “They can’t unring the bell. ” Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York and a plaintiff in a suit seeking to block the first order, said his office was reviewing the new ban, adding, “I stand ready to litigate  —   again  —   in order to protect New York’s families, institutions and economy. ” Congressional Republicans, who were split over the first travel ban, had a more muted reaction. But Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who backed the first order, issued a statement saying the revised order “advances our shared goal of protecting the homeland. ” Citizens of Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya will face a   suspension of visa processing as the administration analyzes how to strengthen vetting procedures, according to a homeland security summary of the order. The removal of Iraq from the list came after talks with security officials in Baghdad and at the urging of Mr. Mattis and State Department officials, who have been in communication with Iraqi officials alarmed that the ban will turn public sentiment in their country against the United States. “On the basis of negotiations that have taken place between the government of Iraq and the U. S. Department of State in the last month, Iraq will increase cooperation with the U. S. government on the vetting of its citizens applying for a visa to travel to the United States,” homeland security officials wrote in a fact sheet given to reporters. The timing of the ban seemed intended to reset the White House political narrative, after a turbulent week that began with Mr. Trump’s   address to Congress. That success was quickly overshadowed by the controversies over Mr. Sessions’s failure to inform the Senate of his contacts with the Russian ambassador and Mr. Trump’s unsupported accusation that President Barack Obama tapped Mr. Trump’s phones during the 2016 campaign. Critics say that Mr. Trump’s vow to impose “extreme vetting” on migrants, especially those fleeing the war in Syria, disregards already stringent screening measures, and the fact that none of the recent terrorist attacks or mass shootings on American soil were perpetrated by people from the nations listed in the ban. Last week, The Associated Press reported that it had obtained a draft homeland security assessment concluding that citizenship was an “unlikely indicator” of a threat. Homeland security officials, speaking to reporters by telephone on Monday, pushed back against that news report, arguing that it was culled from public sources and excluded classified information that paints a more dangerous picture. An official speaking on the call said the Justice Department had identified 300 “refugees” who were being investigated for their links to Islamist terrorist groups or for holding   State positions. Some of those people already have permanent resident status, the official said. But homeland security and Justice Department officials declined to provide further details, and would not say how many of the 300 people being investigated came from the countries covered by the revised travel ban.",0
6999,"Raising 5 Sons Alone, 3 With Autism, Takes a Toll on a Mother’s Body - The New York Times","Though Melissa Ferrer moved into her new home in July, she has refused to paint her sons’ bedroom walls blue. She does not dare get too comfortable, a symptom of her years of homelessness. Ms. Ferrer, 33, is a single mother of five sons. All of them have spent portions of their childhoods in New York City’s shelter system. What made the experience even worse, Ms. Ferrer said, was that her three youngest children  —   Aiden Soto, 3 Angel Soto, 7 and Justin Ferrer, 8  —   are autistic. They also have   disorder and anxiety disorders. “It’s not a good life,” she said. “It’s hard and it’s stressful and it hurts. Not only for me to live that life but to see the children living that life and to know you’re not stable. ” Last year, she made a successful bid for affordable housing in the Bronx. But in her haste to move, she signed the rental agreement without proper due diligence. The apartment flooded every time it rained. Mold grew on the walls. The heat did not work. Insulation was shoddy. Bugs wiggled up through broken floorboards, traumatizing Justin, who has an insect phobia. “I’ve never seen anything like that in my life, and I lived in shelters,” Ms. Ferrer said. “Animals were coming in and my kids, my children, are sleeping, getting bit by ants. ” This summer, with the help of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund, the family moved into a safer, cleaner home in the Bronx. Drawing from the Neediest funds, Catholic Charities also provided $321 in school clothes for the children. Despite escaping the gloomy shelters and crumbling apartments, a steady beat of chaos remains. On a recent afternoon at the family’s apartment, her sons’ mercurial temperaments were on display. They slammed doors and shouted and wailed in constant fits. Glass trinkets were removed from a coffee table and placed in a less precarious spot. One of her sons repeatedly threw a water bottle around the living room. Another snatched a tablet from his brother as he was watching a video. “God must be giving me the strength, because I don’t know where a woman like me can have so much patience,” Ms. Ferrer said. Her oldest children, Matthew Ferrer, 18, and Javon Murphy, 13, do their part to corral and calm their younger siblings. Ms. Ferrer speaks glowingly about Matthew in particular. He is rarely home, often working a   job to keep the house afloat. Her pride is coupled with guilt. “He’s young, he doesn’t have any children,” she said. “He shouldn’t be having to deal with that. ” Ms. Ferrer is responsible for paying the roughly $1, 000 monthly rent. She receives $1, 486 every month in Social Security disability benefits for her three youngest children, $270 in food stamps and $300 that Matthew pitches in from his job. She does not receive child support from her children’s fathers, and because of her autistic sons’ care requirements, she has not worked in more than eight years, since shortly before Justin was born. “I never thought I’d see myself the way I’m seeing myself, struggling so much,” she said. The family’s tight finances are a steady source of anxiety for Ms. Ferrer, who worries her family may once again be without a home. As long as she has one, she is meticulous about keeping it pristine. She said she simply cannot tolerate dirty things. Each morning, she races to get her four   children ready. They all attend different schools, riding different buses that arrive at different times. She does it all alone. The children’s fathers cannot be relied on, Ms. Ferrer said, and although she has many family members nearby, they do not help. “You would think, having such a big family, that we’d be together but we’re not,” she said. “Everybody’s in their own world. ” Her stress is visible. Large clumps of her hair have fallen out. She has cut her hair short to make it less noticeable. Her knees and legs ache from spending long hours on her feet, and she has begun to have panic attacks. “I might look 33, but I’ll tell you one thing, inside my body, I don’t feel 33,” said Ms. Ferrer. “I feel like I’m 70 years old. ” She dreams of going on vacation, even for a day or two, but she knows it will not be reality. Instead, respite comes in short doses at the end of the day. When her children are in bed, she showers, reflects and thanks God for giving her and her family another day. “I’m so tired,” Ms. Ferrer said. “Then I’ll get up at five in the morning, and do this all over again. ”",0
7000,Low Support for U.S. Syria Strikes Compared to Previous Foreign Wars,"Public support for Donald Trump’s decision to launch airstrikes against the Syrian regime is low compared to support for previous foreign actions, according to the latest Gallup poll. [Polling data reveals that just 50 percent of Americans approve of airstrikes against the Assad regime, while 41 percent disapprove, while 10 percent have no opinion.  This figure is historically low compared to other military interventions, such as in Afghanistan in 2001, which had 90 percent approval rating compared to just 5 percent disapproval. George. W. Bush’s decision in 2003 to go to war with Iraq also had 76 percent approval at its inception, and 20 percent disapproval. The only military action in recent years with less public support was Barack Obama’s intervention in Libya, which had 47 percent approval and 37 percent disapproval. Meanwhile, current military action against the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq has far greater supporter than that against the Syrian regime, with 60 percent approval and 31 percent disapproval. Trump’s airstrikes in Syria, which were a response to an alleged chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime, have split politicians across party lines. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) argued last Thursday that “prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different. ” Meanwhile, figures such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi all praised the strikes, calling them as an effective deterrent against further chemical weapons attacks. The attacks have also heightened tensions with Russia and Iran, who are still providing military assistance to the Assad regime. On Tuesday, both countries warned the U. S. that they will “respond with force” if they believe their own “red lines” are crossed in Syria. Furthermore, Furthermore, Russian officials have confirmed that Vladimir Putin will not be meeting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he visits Moscow later this week, despite Putin awarding Tillerson a Russian Order of Friendship award in 2013.

7001,A High-End Kitchen on the Cheap - The New York Times,"Collin Bond had no intention of buying a $1, 400 Thermador warming drawer when he and his wife, Ashley, popped into the Habitat for Humanity ReStore in New Rochelle, N. Y. in the spring of 2015. But when he spotted one at the nonprofit   store for the   price of $50, he immediately scooped it up. No matter that the couple were living in a rental in Downtown Brooklyn and had only just begun their search for a Westchester County   in earnest. “I didn’t have a place to put it at the time, but I took it,” said Mr. Bond, 36, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, who had an idea of how expensive the drawer normally was from his work in the industry. “Fifty dollars, that’s crazy!” he said, recalling his thoughts at the time. “I wonder what else I can do?” Ms. Bond, 31, who works in public relations for the home and design industry, approved. “I honestly didn’t see the need for a warming drawer, but liked the way he was thinking. ” And so, with his wife’s blessing and a warming drawer in the trunk of his car, Mr. Bond began his quest for a   kitchen on the cheap. It wasn’t long before he spotted a Wolf microwave, normally at least $1, 000, for $200 on Craigslist and found himself at the warehouse of the seller, a contractor in New Jersey who works on luxury developments. In chatting with the contractor, Mr. Bond learned that many of the   developers he worked with would replace all the appliances in model apartments with new ones once the apartments had sold  —   even though the “old” ones may have been used just to boil tea or store bottled water for visitors to the building. “He was basically telling me, ‘I’m paying an assistant to list these,’” Mr. Bond said. “I told him, ‘Just give me a call next time. ’” About a month later, Mr. Bond’s phone rang and he was back in New Jersey with a rented   and a hand truck, picking up an $7, 400   wine refrigerator for $1, 000 from the same man. Mr. Bond paid some members of the contractor’s construction crew $20 each to help him load it. With his collection of discount kitchen appliances growing, Mr. Bond invested in a small storage unit, paying around $150 a month. Now his search became strategic. To match his newly acquired wine refrigerator, a    integrated model, Mr. Bond created alerts on Craigslist for a corresponding       with the same width, depth and height, normally $7, 540. Soon, he had a Craigslist ad in his inbox posted by a contractor who was renovating a house in Westchester for clients who wanted a change in style. “It was a relatively new kitchen,” Mr. Bond said. But according to the contractor, he added, “The people who had bought it were like, ‘We don’t like this kitchen we just want a new kitchen. ’” Mr. Bond showed up with cash in hand,   in tow. “I went in there for one fridge and ended up negotiating and getting two fridges and the dishwasher,” he said. He paid $2, 400 for the lot, down from about $3, 000. To ensure that the appliances worked, he asked the sellers to have them up and running before he arrived. “I’d make sure I’d call them and say, ‘I’m going to meet you at 2 p. m. on Wednesday. Can you please make sure it’s plugged in and at temperature when I get there? ’” Not everything went flawlessly. After being transported to the storage unit, the wine refrigerator wouldn’t hold the proper temperature in one of its zones. “Something had become disconnected,” said Mr. Bond, who paid a local repairman $200 to fix it. But with   refrigerators normally selling for as much as $8, 000, he figured, “If I’m buying it for $1, 000 and I put another $1, 500 into it  —   that’s still an incredible savings. ” But there was still the matter of finding a new home to house all the fancy appliances. “We really wanted something that we could make our own,” said Mr. Bond, who worked in carpentry in high school and as a general contractor during summers between college. “We were looking for something we could put some sweat equity into. ” That summer, they found their  : a     prewar apartment in Scarsdale, N. Y. “The place was    white carpet, which was horrendous,” Mr. Bond said. “I think it had actually been a pink carpet that had just gotten bleached over the years, because when we moved the dining room table, there was a pink ring under it. ” Mirrored wall panels in the living room had been painted over, and the appliances hadn’t been upgraded since the 1980s. “We just saw a lot of potential,” Mr. Bond said. Underneath the old carpet, there were beautiful oak floors, and the walls that boxed off the kitchen, living and dining rooms could come down. Not to mention that the place cost about a quarter of what it would have in Brooklyn. They closed on the apartment in July 2015, paying about $240, 000, and immediately began renovating the kitchen, a process that took about five months. Mr. Bond acted as the general contractor, filing for permits and finding subcontractors to build out their vision. A family friend drew up the plans based on the appliances Mr. Bond had in storage. But his obsession with Craigslist did not end. In search of an elusive Miele espresso maker and Viking range, he checked his emails nightly. He admitted he was getting a little carried away when he decided they should buy a   range he found online, although they had already agreed on a   model. “My wife was like, ‘We don’t need that big of a stove in our kitchen. As it is, we have three refrigerators. This is not a commercial kitchen. ’” Putting it more mildly, she added: “He had the best of intentions, but I had to reel him in on the   range, because it just didn’t fit and we would have had to rework all of our cabinet sizes. ” Mr. Bond ended up buying a   Viking (normally $5, 000) for $1, 500, even though it was set up for propane and their apartment uses natural gas. To salvage the deal, he picked up a conversion kit for about $50 at a local hardware store and did the installation himself after watching a video on YouTube. Then, just as he had resigned himself to drinking regular coffee, a Craigslist alert landed in his inbox for a Miele espresso maker that normally sold for $3, 500. “A really, really sweet couple” who happened to live nearby were selling it for $500, he said. To find out if it worked, Mr. Bond asked them to make him a cup of coffee, but an error message kept popping up on the espresso maker’s display. Mr. Bond left without the machine, but called a few repair shops and learned that it could be fixed for $300. He returned, offered the couple $200 and it was his. In all, the Bonds paid about $6, 000 for their kitchen appliances, including repairs. Purchased new, the same appliances would have cost roughly $35, 000. Dinner parties are a regular event in their new home, and all three refrigerators are put to use. Although, Mr. Bond admitted, “It’s all a little overkill  —   I feel like a food hoarder. ” And the warming drawer that started the whole thing? It was one of the best purchases they made, Ms. Bond said. “We use it every time we have a group of people over. ”",0
7002,‘Penis Seat’ Causes Double Takes on Mexico City Subway - The New York Times,"A seat in a subway car in Mexico City’s metro system caused a stir earlier this year. There were awkward glances. Visible discomfort. Baffled looks. Some laughs. And of course, the inevitable pictures from passengers’ camera phones. It was meant to be provocative, and it was. A seat was changed to look like the lower half of a male’s body, including the penis, part of a campaign by UN Women and the Mexico City government to raise awareness about sexual harassment on subways. On the floor beneath the seat, there was a sign reading, “It is annoying to travel this way, but not compared to the sexual violence women suffer in their daily commutes. ” The campaign has now released a video titled ”Experimento Asiento”  —   “an experiment with a seat”  —   that has had more than 800, 000 views on YouTube since March 20. It shows people reacting with a mixture of discomfort and shock throughout. One man even tried to cover the seat with a coat to sit on it. It didn’t work. He abandoned the seat, as did others who tried to sit in it during the experiment in January. UN Women and the Mexican government collaborated on a second video as well, which has also begun picking up traffic. It is called “Experimento Pantallas”  —   or “experiment screens. ” That experiment involved installing cameras that would take tight shots of male buttocks and display them on screens for all to see. In the video, a number of men are shown expressing disgust and embarrassment. “We wanted to do something different,” said a Yeliz Osman, a program coordinator with the Mexican UN Women office. “We wanted to target men because on a global level, the majority of programs talking about sexual violence or sexual harassment always target women and girls. We wanted to change that because we don’t think that women are the problem. ” The campaign is called #NoEsDeHombres (a rough translation would be “this isn’t manly”) and it is aimed at men, both with the video ads and with newly unveiled print ones that show guys giving lascivious looks with slogans like “this is how your mother gets looked at every day. ” These particular ads came about after UN Women and the Mexican government took open submissions for ideas on a campaign to target a male audience. Around 40 agencies submitted pitches and J. Walter Thompson won.  “We need to make clear that this is violent, not flattering, and incentivize men to intervene if they witness it” said Ana Güemez, director of the Mexican UN Women office, during the presentation of the campaign this Thursday. According to a national survey done in 2016 by the Mexican Institute of Women, Inmujeres, nine out of 10 women or girls who use public transportation feel unsafe while doing it. A   Reuters survey done in 2014 also showed that the Mexico City transport system is the   dangerous for women overall out of 15 world capitals. However, Mexico City was squarely in first place for specific questions like “have your been verbally harassed?” or “have you been groped?“ “In order to generate change, you need to create empathy,” Ms. Osman said. “The idea is that men can get a sense of what it is all like. By creating empathy, we hope that this might change their behavior. ” The Mexico City government has begun to take action: It is now possible to file an administrative complaint if you get catcalled (the perpetrator either pays a fine or spends a night in jail) and last year it started handing out rape whistles on the subway so that women could “warn of possible crimes” (a plan that was not without its critics). The issue has gained prominence in the past few weeks after a   blogger, Tamara de Anda, was publicly criticized for talking about filing a complaint against a taxi driver who accosted her verbally while she was walking down the street. Insults on social media ranged from telling her she wasn’t attractive enough to be offended by the driver’s catcall to issuing death threats. Ms. De Anda was one of several Mexican public figures who participated in the presentation of the #NoEsDeHombres campaign, alongside the wrestler El Hijo del Santo and the actor Alfonso Herrera, familiar to United States audiences from Netflix’s show, “Sense8. ”",0
7003,"Before the Wedding, a Test: 3,000 Miles of Barbecue - The New York Times","We’d drive southwest on Interstate 81, eating barbecue until we hit Memphis. The idea was juvenile in its simplicity, but amid planning a wedding and being a month from turning 30, something juvenile and simple was what I craved. I am a native New Yorker, in a family of waning Italian heritage, so my opinions on barbecue have been treated as an eccentricity. Was my hot dog no good? Perhaps I’d like a burger instead? To my fiancée, Mary Beth,   and North   I was eccentric only in the wide tent I pitched for smoked meat. To most anyone from the Piedmont Crescent in North Carolina, barbecue is not a style of cooking it’s a specific dish: chopped pork topped with a spicy vinegar sauce. Zeal for such a noble meal is only appropriate in her eyes. Ribs, however, are not barbecue. Ribs are ribs. Beef is a wholly different dish. And God help those   South Carolinians, with their heathenous   condiments. Our first stop would be in the heart of Pennsylvania. Criticism was swift from the left side of the aisle. “That’s too far north for good barbecue,” Mary Beth’s family told me. But that was the point of the trip: to prove that barbecue, though miraculous, is not a miracle of geography. My own family was critical for another reason: why spend vacation days driving all the way to Tennessee, and not just fly to a beach? Regardless, Mary Beth was (inexplicably) enthusiastic about splitting a   drive with me, so she’s clearly the best person I know. The trip felt like a fitting stress test before we would vow to share the rest of our lives with each other. Outside of Harrisburg, past an overgrown football field, we found ShakeDown BBQ. A huge   grill on wheels had been wrapping the building in apple wood smoke for hours. I’m a sucker for a wood log fire, but I knew that wouldn’t guarantee good food. Behind a small counter was a towering blackboard detailing the owner’s newest sandwich creations. Rules are anathema to road trips, but I felt it important to lay out some guidelines, if only to focus the debate. Guideline No. 1: If the restaurant offered a sampler or combo platter, we should order it. Guideline No. 2: Pork products would be our focus of scrutiny. We expected few joints east of the Mississippi would hazard an attempt at   brisket. Guideline No. 3: Our highest priority for sides would be beans and greens, the true destiny of those overdone nubs of barbecued meat called burnt ends. Not every restaurant seasons its greens with burnt ends but I imagined that a week of nonstop barbecue, without vegetables, could put us at a legitimate risk for scurvy. We began to deviate from guideline No. 2 on our first stop. ShakeDown’s pulled pork was easily overshadowed by a dark beef brisket. But the pork sausage was the obvious breakout: sweet, robust and right at home between two sides of a bun. The platter had been dusted with a chile and spice blend, and the beans were  . The meal had a very earthy profile, nontraditional for barbecue, at least from a Southerner’s perspective  —   but perhaps not to the area’s German descendants. And there were sauces aplenty: “Regular” Tennessee sauce a very “Spicy” variant a   “Carolina” and a “Creamy Carolina” dipping sauce, seemingly inspired by white coleslaw. More accurate than most tests, the selection of the house sauces, we would find, was the best sign of good barbecue. Shakedown’s lineup scratched every itch I had, but my resident Carolinian thought that most of their sauces were approximated facsimiles. Just over the border in Maryland, in Hagerstown, we stopped at the coyly named Hempen Hill BBQ, a sprawling sports bar crowded with folks looking to cure the munchies. It would be one of the only restaurants on our trip with a wait. The menu tries to do a bit of everything, from   crab chips (hey, it’s Maryland) to smoked prime rib (too large to finish, though we tried). Here, too, the pork sausage (a new menu item, our server told us) outclassed all other offerings: skin crisped from fire, a soft and savory interior, and arresting flavor. But even with three house sauces, an exemplary pork sandwich eluded us. The following morning, we arrived in Virginia. Down the street from the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley, a lovely collection of galleries and gardens, we found Bonnie Blue Southern Market  Grocery in Winchester. The roadside cafe and bakery is in a renovated auto body garage, with plenty of indoor and outdoor tables, all painted fire engine red. Route 81 hadn’t carried us far enough south for the kielbasa not to be a standout: The biscuits and gravy were a tremendous   meal. But now the pulled pork was getting serious: juicy, smoky, a balancing act between salt and spices. The beans practically included a second helping of pork, and the greens, tangy and tender, were the best of the trip. Spirits high, we turned off to travel a strip of the Blue Ridge Parkway, a treasure in itself. The campsites that service motorcades of picnickers are equipped with public grills, and they would see a lot of use once the leaves turned. At over 5, 000 feet, with the air so big and thin, folks would smell your dinner a mile away, and it made me wonder if hospitality is knowing you should expect company. Was barbecue first defined only by its open, inviting aroma? If so, my family’s hot dogs and hamburgers might not be off the mark after all. No guest goes hungry in my mother’s house. Driving down the mountain, we stopped at BeamMeUp BBQ, found in a little beige house on the far edge of Lexington, Va. The last rack of ribs walked out the door before we could order, a disappointment but also a good sign. This was the first pulled pork to make Mary Beth give that signature giddy smile. The pulled meat had great texture and, even before sauces, a complex flavor. The brisket, gleaming like a slab of petrified wood, dissolved instantly upon first bite. That texture doesn’t come without a robust knowledge of temperature, salt and even humidity. The house’s classic “Carolina” sauce was an obvious match for the pork, but the “dark and spicy” sauce ruled the brisket. Nearer the state border, we were surprised by the South Carolina expats at Due South Pit Cooked BBQ in Christiansburg, Va. The interior was    pig tchotchkes and punny pig shirts for sale  —   even the bathroom has a framed pig painting. We were aware of the unofficial rule that a barbecue restaurant must have on premises at least one anthropomorphized pig. This was something else. But Due South was the most committed to sauces of any restaurant on our route, with five bottles at every table: Kansas City “Sweet Brown,” Tennessee “Sweet Red,” spicy “Hot Red,” tangy “Lexington,” and their home state’s mustard “Yellow. ” Nearly all of them were delicious (the sweet brown was too heavy with molasses) but the yellow was Due South’s prodigal sauce. Mary Beth, staring down her state’s rival, wasn’t having any of this mustard stuff. But both sides are guilty of dogmatism: Stephen Colbert, a proud South Carolinian, once suggested that North Carolina’s Piedmont vinegar sauce is better employed as a toilet bowl cleaner. I blanketed my brisket in smoky mustard and, yellow lips and all, offered a satisfied grin. “Well, it’s different if you put it on brisket,” she argued. So the wedding was still on. After days of travel, we finally entered Mary Beth’s home turf: the Piedmont Crescent. I had been surprised by how many restaurants strained themselves to serve every cut, every sauce, every regional quirk their customers might desire. Lexington Barbecue in Lexington, N. C. is on a different level: The   pork shoulder can be sliced, chopped or coarsely chopped, and a laboratory of condiments (“smokehouse” sauce, Texas Pete, Tabasco   …    ) is on every table. The decades appear to have taught Lexington not to argue the details with barbecue fans. But the details are what make Lexington so good. The sandwich itself was a   act of sweet, tangy, tender, smoky, spicy, and even crunchy from the slaw. It’s a joy as simple as it is complex. Farther west, into the North Carolina Appalachians, is Countryside Barbeque in Marion. The restaurant usually has a booth available and, if not, there are rocking chairs on the porch for taking in the mountain air. Like the one at Lexington Barbecue, the pork sandwich rules the menu at Countryside. When the neon “RIBS” sign is on, you’ll know you’re in luck it’s the only item that   the sandwich. While Countryside’s meat isn’t quite as perfected as Lexington’s, its three house sauces are    —   in our case, literally. Years ago, Mary Beth invited me on a trip to the Carolinas and insisted on lunch at Countryside, an old family tradition. She would later tell me, “Only someone who loved you could watch you inhale that rack of ribs and still want to go home with you. ” Some couples have their song Countryside’s Western Carolina is our sauce. We fell in love to that sauce. Barbecue fans will understand. Cars are always   around mealtime at the Original Ridgewood Barbecue in Bluff City, Tenn. not easily done at a big restaurant in a small town of about 1, 700 residents. The restaurant, run almost entirely by women, serves smoked hams, sliced and then crisped on a griddle in the open kitchen. The house sauce is aggressively sweet without tasting imbalanced. The beans are a must, balanced with onion and celery, a   recipe served in cute brown crocks. While waiting to pay for our meal at the register, I let out a sigh of satisfaction. “I know that noise,” said the very tall man next to me. We stood together and chuckled. That’s good barbecue: It’s simple, easy to enjoy and it makes us all neighbors. Near a small marina on the outskirts of Knoxville, we hit Sweet P’s BBQ and Soul House. No musicians were playing that day, but the signs and extra bar made it clear the “Soul House” wasn’t for kicks. The pork and brisket in the sampler were delicious but the ribs were masterfully laid with flavor, a smack in the face with a “Welcome to Tennessee” sign. Dusted with cracked pepper, large sugar granules and dark paprika, there was no need for sauce  —   though we tried it anyway. The “Hot,” a combination of its “Piedmont” sauce and a chipotle purée, was heaven or heatstroke. I didn’t care which. Here we lost guideline No. 3: beans and greens. Mary Beth and I decided instead to cool off with banana pudding. It was so good, we detoured for seconds on our drive back home. In the car, we marveled at the endless mountains and sang along to our favorite musicians from the region (Gabe Dixon and Delta Rae). The rest of the time we talked barbecue. Comparing joints was difficult. Nearly every spot had some breakout dish, and it turned each new menu into a treasure map: What was going to wow us next? The most interesting note our conversations found was how some spots, especially in North Carolina, seemed to intentionally serve slightly dry meat, so as to help it absorb a sauce. Indeed, more than a few restaurants seemed to serve a meat just to have something for the sauce to go on. The biggest disappointment was that, despite no small amount of agony over sauces and meats and wood smoke, few restaurants could be bothered to use   buns. Not so in Nashville. There, we visited with Mary Beth’s cousin, who pointed us toward Edley’s    on 12 South. Befitting its location in the home of country music, the large renovated garage is done up with warm wood beams and benches, hanging lights and pumping music. Despite such a polished experience and   service, the prices were no higher than the roadside places we’d grown accustomed to. A rib’wich was offered as the daily special, something I didn’t expect to find on this trip, so there went our last surviving guideline: order the combo. There were no regrets. The buttered bun was plated to the side to showcase two delicately fried pickles atop a chewy pile of burnt ends  —   an   meal. Mary Beth kept to her pulled pork, which also emphasized those burnt ends. The cost of managing smoke in an urban area can be huge. In Memphis, Charlie Vergos’ Rendezvous is able to operate next to a   and that’s because they serve charbroiled ribs much less smoke required. If any concession had to be made to my hypothesis about geography, it was that cities and barbecue have an    relationship. Or at least they did. Now, even that barrier has fallen. Martin’s    Joint opened a downtown Nashville event space in August and Sweet P’s opened a second location last year in downtown Knoxville. But some of the best barbecue hasn’t moved from its original spot. Scott’ ’s Barbeque in Lexington, Tenn. didn’t look like much but, at that point, we hadn’t seen a Lexington we didn’t like. A   sign out front still showed the 1980 “Coke Is It” slogan. And they still meant it: There was not a sweet tea to be had, but plenty of Pibb Xtra, Mello Yello and other Coke products. Inside is an   refuge from the boiling highway, with big   wood paneling and plenty of   knickknacks. Scott’s pigs are smoked whole hog (think of a luau) then minced, sauced, slapped on a bun, and wrapped like any common deli sandwich. Only that wasn’t a common deli sandwich it gave most of North Carolina a run for its money. The ribs, practically a confit, lacked a spicy bark or crust, but were tremendously tender. Even at 9 in the morning, customers were picking up racks of ribs to serve for lunch. But these were not the dry and spicy Memphis ribs I’d heard of. Had we been driving in the wrong direction? Yet soon there we were on Central Avenue, staring down a blue statue of the University of Memphis’s Tom the tiger, which guards Central BBQ. The line was already out the door. Behind the parking lot was a large mural of farm animals playing in a jazz band and inside was    merchandise. Even with the music turned low, the whole joint felt loud. The scant indoor seating filled up quickly, so we ate under a tent rigged with water misters to allay the   heat. The pork and brisket were great, but the ribs, dry and red as Australia’s Simpson Desert, were clearly the best:   tender with a rolling spiciness. Across town is the    Shop. A bar and grill tucked into a mostly residential block on Madison Avenue, it was quiet for lunch but would attract a crowd for dinner. The waiters knew to push their claim to fame: barbecue spaghetti, basically a sweet and meaty pasta Bolognese. Even after a week of solid barbecue, it was still a pleasure to eat, if a guilty one. Like Lexington’s chopped pork,    Shop’s ribs were another   act of flavors and textures. Sauce might have been the main draw in the Carolinas, but the    Shop produces such a perfect rack of meat, sauce is rather unnecessary, almost unwelcome. It was the end of our trip, but I wanted to keep driving west. To have a grand barbecue road trip that didn’t even enter Missouri or Texas   …     what would people say? It had begun to rain aggressively after we left the    Shop, but I drove us out to the Memphis Riverfront. Parked in front of the Mississippi, I began to lay out Barbecue Road Trip Part 2 and the idea that maybe we should hit a few spots in Alabama? I mean, the state border is right there. Mary Beth just smiled at me. I think she knew that after a week of barbecue, I was all talk, and once our last plate of ribs kicked in, I couldn’t manage much talking either. We were tired and we were full and all we really wanted to do was go home and get married. So we did.",0

7005,Why It’s Absolutely Worth It To Learn Game,"Home This Month Popular Why It’s Absolutely Worth It To Learn Game Why It’s Absolutely Worth It To Learn Game 
Jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog: Masculine Development and recently launched his eBook on 7 Strategies to Develop Your Masculinity. November 12, 2016 Game 
After my previous article , which advocated that men learn game as a form of self-development, I got a good amount of disagreement—most of it was not inaccurate. The majority of ROK readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game, simply because Western women are not as attractive as they once were. 
This isn’t to say that we’ve abandoned learning game as a whole; certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship. But, nonetheless, there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesn’t believe that game is worth it anymore. 
In this article, I would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game. In retrospect, my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects; I do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. 
As a veteran myself, I’m quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game. I’ve been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes, I’ve had drinks thrown on me, I’ve had guys threaten to slit my throat, and more. Despite this, however, I still believe that it is 100% worth it to learn game. Beginner’s Hell “HOW DARE YOU TRY TO ASK ME MY NAME YOU FUCKING RAPIST!” 
I believe that the reason why most men don’t feel that game is worth it, is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as “beginner’s hell.” This is when you’re just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning , and you haven’t developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed. 
Most beginners walk around, not really knowing how to talk to women , how to carry themselves, or how to flirt in general. Because of this, women will typically have one of two responses: They pity you and ignore you They lash out and berate you for being a “creep,” or “weird.” 
Of course, you may get the occasional girl who’s drunk enough to be into you, but these are few and far between. For the most part, the “Beginner’s Hell,” phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous. 
You will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags, who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you, and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you, he’ll come over and steal her. You will have women smack you, ignore you, and tell you off—again, it’s called “beginner’s hell,” for a reason. 6’s Who Think They’re 10’s 
This initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our culture’s general lack of femininity. It is extremely obvious, to anyone with eyes to see, that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on. The once praised virtues of nurturing, empathy, and kindness, have now been replaced by resting bitch face, sociopathy, and social climbing. 
This coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters, means that they’ve been conditioned to believe they’re highly sought after goddesses, who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions (and in fact, they’re sometimes praised for doing so). 
This is, perhaps, one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game. Couple this with severe approach anxiety, a complete lack of masculinity, and a weak body that hasn’t been trained, and it’s very easy to see why most men don’t see that game is worth it. The Turning Point 
Once one gets beyond this initial bump, however, most of game is smooth sailing. Once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity, how to balance assertiveness with consent , and has improved his game in general, he enters what I call the turning point. 
The turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle, but it’s actually enjoyable. This is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success, such as: Drawing state from within, rather than from without Being in a state of abundance, rather than scarcity Improving other areas of your life, which creates an upwards spiral 
If you’re a newbie struggling to learn game, and you don’t feel like it’s worth it, I fully empathize with your pain—the problem is that when you don’t have much game, of course learning game will be hard, because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls. 
When you start to develop the three characteristics that I mentioned, however, a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level. This allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want, rather than being at the mercy of the ugly 5 who “might” want to come over and hang out. Internal vs. External Drawing Of State “By my age, you realize that bitches ain’t shit, but hoes and tricks.” 
The transition from drawing state from outside of you, to drawing state from within you, is literally the difference between a guy that doesn’t pull at all, and a guy that can pull Victoria’s Secret models. 
Let me explain: women typically draw state from without. This means that their emotions are governed by their environment. This is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men, why they “just want to dance,” when a song they like comes on, and it’s why they’re generally so emotionally volatile. 
Due to their changing environments, their emotions change rapidly as well. This is why they want men to draw state from within, or in other words, not be affected by their outside environments. This is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions: it’s indicative of a man who draws state from without. 
As a man, drawing state from within has numerous benefits, the most obvious of which being that you’re perpetually in a good mood. Once you learn to make this shift, and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances, women will pick up on it like a hawk—they’re very attuned to this type of thing, and you’ll definitely notice a difference in their behavior. 
This will get them vying for YOUR attention, which will start to give you tremendous power. This will make game fun, which will lead to even more women in your life, which will begin the start of your upward spiral. The Beginning Of The Upward Spiral 
Once you begin to make this simple mindset shift, game will no longer feel like it’s not worth it. You see, game feels like it’s not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl, with a horrible personality. But, when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort, for a very gorgeous woman? That’s when game starts to be fun. 
This basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like, and to simply be happy by yourself, will create a chain reaction within your life. First, you’ll start to get much more women much more easily. This will allow you to start a harem, which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship. 
This state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold. Women will sense that you’ve got a ton of other women vying for your attention, and they will do the same—it’s like a magnet that just draws them in. Plus, if a girl does or says something that you dislike, you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women. 
Then, when you start to have so many women in your life, you’ll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits , because you simply can’t handle sleeping with all of them. They’ll invite you to parties, and try to hook you up with their friends, and you’ll receive many of the social benefits that they do. Game Is Worth It (It Just Sucks At First) Getting over beginner’s hell is a lot like this. Once you get to the other side, it’s all downhill, though. 
As I have made clear, learning game at first is a huge struggle—you will encounter massive cock blocks, a lot of negativity from women, and not to mention you’ll have to deal with all of the white knights, too. But, if you can learn to get over this initial Beginner’s Hell, as I’ve coined it, you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from. 
I realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first, and can feel like it isn’t worth it, but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it, your world will literally be 1000x better than before. If you’re struggling with learning game initially, be sure to maximize your appearance. 
Get some height increasing soles, read through some of the style articles on ROK, get a good designer haircut, and learn to perfect your appearance, at least as much as you can. Consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence, as well. 
Ultimately, however, if you want to learn game and experience what it’s like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up, you just have to bite the bullet and go out. Go clubbing, go to bars, go on trips to Las Vegas or Miami. Approach women during the day and approach them during the night—eventually you’ll get over this “Beginner’s Hell,” and will experience an abundance of women in your life.",0
7006,Europe’s Morality Crisis: Euthanizing the Mentally Ill,"The Washington Post 
Excerpts: Once prohibited — indeed, unthinkable — the euthanasia of people with mental illnesses or cognitive disorders, including dementia, is now a common occurrence in Belgium and the Netherlands. 
This profoundly troubling fact of modern European life is confirmed by the latest biennial report from Belgium’s Federal Commission on the Control and Evaluation of Euthanasia, presented to Parliament on Oct. 7. 
Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for patients suffering “unbearably” from any “untreatable” medical condition, terminal or non-terminal, including psychiatric ones. 
In the 2014-2015 period, the report says, 124 of the 3,950 euthanasia cases in Belgium involved persons diagnosed with a “mental and behavioral disorder,” four more than in the previous two years.

7007,Poll: 56 Percent of Democrats Want All of Trump’s Nominees Blocked - Breitbart,"A majority of Democrats and liberal voters want Democrats in Congress to block every nominee and bill from the Trump administration, a Morning Consult poll released Wednesday finds. [Building off the Democrats’ vows of “resistance,” pollsters asked: “Democrats in Congress should stick to their principles when it comes to working with President Trump, even if that means blocking all legislation or nominees for government posts?”   percent said Democrats in Congress should block all of Trump’s nominees and bills, while 34 percent said they should find a way to work with the administration and get things done. Similarly, 62 percent of   liberals said Democrats should obstruct Trump by any means necessary.  A majority of independent voters, 59 percent, said Democrats in Congress should work with Trump. So did 82 percent of Republicans. Another 57 percent of   moderates agreed. “The survey —  conducted Feb. 2 through Feb. 4 —  is instructive, as Trump and Republicans begin to plot their legislative plans on everything from repealing and replacing Obamacare to tax reform. Democrats, in the minority in both chambers, are being squeezed by their base to stop Trump’s agenda in its tracks, even if they lack the power to do so,” Politico reports. Democrats hold 46 seats in the Senate while two independent senators caucus with them, so they’re powerless to stop the confirmation of Trump’s nominees unless Republicans break rank to join them. Pollsters questioned 2, 070 registered voters from Feb. 2 to Feb. 4, with a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.",0
7008,Beyoncé Leads With 9 Grammy Nominations - The New York Times,"The Grammy Awards may come down to a battle of the superdivas. Beyoncé leads the nominations for the 59th annual Grammys, announced on Tuesday, with nine nods for her album “Lemonade. ” But in each of the three top categories she will square off against Adele, who was nominated five times. Both women had extraordinary years. “Lemonade,” an ambitious album and film, tackled issues of race and infidelity, and its release became the kind of   cultural phenomenon that perhaps no artist but Beyoncé could muster. Adele’s album “25” sold more than 10 million copies in less than a year, a blockbuster that eclipsed all others. With enormous commercial success and the adoration of fellow musicians, those stars represent the very best of how the music industry sees itself, which should make their competition tight. “Lemonade” and “25” are both nominated for album of the year, and Beyoncé’s track “Formation” will go up against Adele’s “Hello” for both record and song of the year. This year’s Grammys, on Feb. 12 in Los Angeles, will mostly hew to the biggest pop hits of the moment  —   itself a notable development for a show that has often celebrated aging stars at the expense of vital young talent. The other leading nominees include Drake and Rihanna, each with eight nods, and Chance the Rapper, who climbed the charts as an independent and had seven nominations in five categories, including best new artist. Yet every list of Grammy nominations comes with surprises. For album of the year, “Lemonade” and “25” will compete against Drake’s “Views,” a monster streaming hit “Purpose,” Justin Bieber’s comeback vehicle and, in what might be the year’s wild card, “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth,” by the country singer Sturgill Simpson, a critical favorite but modest seller. For record of the year, an award for the performer and producers of a single track, “Formation” and “Hello” face off against “7 Years,” a mellow hit by the Danish group Lukas Graham “Stressed Out,” by the   pop duo Twenty One Pilots and Rihanna’s “Work,” which features Drake. (“Formation,” “Hello” and “7 Years” are also up for song of the year, which recognizes songwriters.) When the nominations were announced early Tuesday, many artists took to social media to express thanks or surprise. The Chainsmokers, a D. J. duo, are up for three awards, including best new artist. When they got the news, they said on Twitter, they were in line at a Dunkin’ Donuts, “and   everyone in the store. ” Kanye West, whose album “The Life of Pablo” and related tour also drew wide attention, received eight nominations in five categories like Drake and Chance, he is up for all four rap awards. But members of the Recording Academy, the organization that presents the Grammys, did not choose Mr. West  —   a frequent Grammy critic  —   in any of the top categories for his own work. He is, however, one of the 20 credited producers on Drake’s “Views. ” On the other hand, Beyoncé was nominated for seemingly every award possible. Besides the top fields, she is up for awards in the pop category (“Hold Up,” pop solo performance) rock (“Don’t Hurt Yourself,” with Jack White, for rock performance) RB (“Lemonade,” for urban contemporary album) and rap (“Freedom,” with Kendrick Lamar, for best   performance). “Lemonade” was also nominated for best music film, and “Formation” for best music video. Beyoncé has been nominated 62 times in her career, more than any other female artist. She has already won 20 awards, and if she wins eight this year, Beyoncé would surpass Alison Krauss as the   woman in Grammy history. Members of Twenty One Pilots are up for a total of five awards David Bowie, who died in January after releasing his album “Blackstar,” is up for four. In his lifetime, Mr. Bowie won only one Grammy, along with a lifetime achievement award. In recent years, the Recording Academy has worked, with mixed success, to better reflect the diversity and pulse of current pop music. “There was a time when the membership of the academy may have skewed a little older,” Neil Portnow, its president, said in an interview. “But as we have evolved and the community of membership has broadened, you probably see some reflection of that in how the nominations come out. ” Yet there were still some striking absences from this year’s nominees, including Drake’s song “One Dance. ” By far one of the biggest hits of the year  —   it was No. 1 for 10 weeks  —   the song received no nominations. (“Hotline Bling,” Drake’s other pop smash, had two nominations.) Another absence is the result of an apparent protest. The Grammys have fared far better than the Oscars and other awards in recognizing diversity, yet have also been criticized for favoring white artists in the top categories. Frank Ocean, the RB singer and songwriter whose album “Blonde” was another major pop event, declined to submit his material for consideration. In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Ocean called the Grammys’ nomination system “dated,” and added: “I’d rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience. ” In response to that, Mr. Portnow said, “If you look at the   entries in our process, it’s pretty clear to me that the vast majority of artists feel that we are important, that they do aspire to be honored by their peers, and that the process we’ve created is democratic and transparent. ” Mr. Ocean’s stance makes him an exception, with many artists and their business representatives spending months campaigning for the nominations. This year Chance the Rapper benefited from a rule change that allowed   albums like his “Coloring Book” mixtape to be considered for awards. In a “for your consideration” ad in Billboard, Chance asked simply, “Hey, why not me?”",0

7010,Trump Shows How to Smother a Scandal: With a Bigger Story - The New York Times,"The bar for scandal in the Trump administration keeps being raised. Every week brings potentially damaging developments that in other contexts could have generated weekslong controversies. With so many competing stories, however, they are frequently ignored or forgotten. As a result, even negative coverage can sometimes benefit   Donald J. Trump by displacing potentially more damaging stories from the news agenda. For instance, many of Mr. Trump’s nominees for cabinet positions have faced relatively little scrutiny of their backgrounds or records. Many failed even to complete background checks before the start of Senate hearings, a break from decades of precedent. Or consider the case of Monica Crowley, an incoming National Security Agency aide found to have engaged in extensive plagiarism in her book (which Harper Collins pulled from the market) her Ph. D. dissertation and her Washington Times column. These developments have struggled to gain traction amid the many competing stories about Mr. Trump and his presidential transition, including Tuesday night’s release of unverified allegations against the  . Scandals need time and space to develop. When the news cycle is congested, potential scandals are deprived of attention, causing the media to move on to other stories and the political opposition to anticipate that any criticisms will probably have little effect. Many observers suspect that Mr. Trump seeks to exploit this dynamic by distracting the press and the public with stunts like meeting with Kanye West after delaying a news conference on conflicts of interest or tweeting about Meryl Streep before hearings to consider his nominees on Capitol Hill. It’s impossible to determine his motivations, of course, but the effect is often to divert attention from less flattering issues. On Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Trump’s   news conference on conflict of interest issues was scheduled on the same day as hearings for six nominees. (After Democrats accused Republicans of scheduling the hearings in part to exploit this dynamic and divert the news media’s attention, some were rescheduled.) History shows that potential scandals can easily be crowded off the news agenda by other events. During the chaotic    period, for instance, the focus on more important events kept Army Secretary Thomas White in office despite numerous questionable decisions. (The    surge in news continued all the way through the invasion of Iraq in early 2003, helping to insulate George W. Bush from fallout over the collapse of the Enron corporation and other matters Bush didn’t suffer a major scandal until Valerie Plame was outed as a C. I. A. officer that summer.) Another example came during the summer of 2009, when the death of Michael Jackson helped push the furor over the affair of the South Carolina governor, Mark Sanford, out of the news. By contrast, relatively slow news periods may increase the likelihood of a scandal’s developing, as with the travel habits of former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu in 1991, which became an issue in the months after the end of the first Persian Gulf war, and as with Chris Christie’s Bridgegate scandal in 2014. In an article published in The British Journal of Political Science, I provide quantitative evidence suggesting that competition from other news stories can prevent potential scandals from reaching critical mass. Using data from more than three decades of news media coverage of the president and the executive branch, I show that when the incidence of major disasters and tragedies causes an unexpected surge in news coverage, the likelihood of a new scandal developing and the intensity of scandal coverage both decrease significantly. (I find that a similar dynamic appears to apply to governors.) In this sense, the continuing reality show that Mr. Trump creates may help protect him from deep damage by any particular scandal. As in the campaign, he makes so much news every day that few stories ever generate sustained controversy. Instead, public attention lurches from one story to the next, never quite focusing on any particular controversy. He may prefer it that way.",0
7011,DELINGPOLE: BBC Throws Jenni Murray To The Transgender Wolves,"The BBC has thrown its feminist High Priestess to the transgender wolves because she dared to suggest that a man born with a penis isn’t really a woman. [As blue on blue SJW infighting goes, you could scarcely ask for a more perfect popcorn movement.  Up until now, Dame “Jenni” Murray has maintained a reputation for stern, disapproving,   feminist political correctness (but is there any other kind  …    ?) of the most impeccably fingerwagging rectitude. Listening to her morning BBC radio show Woman’s Hour is like being subjected to a 60 minute lecture on the shortcomings of men, the superiority of women and the manifest injustice of the patriarchal hegemony, delivered by a school games mistress wearing iron underwear and a kaftan knitted by a Turkish oppressed women’s collective, while being forcefed organic breast milk laced with Hormone Replacement chemicals and the collected works of Germaine Greer, Erica Jong and Susie Orbach. So for Dame Jenni [she’s very proud of her title and uses it a lot] to find herself caught out on the wrong side by the PC Gestapo is about as deliciously unlikely as Meryl Streep raising her next Oscar statuette high and saying: “I’m dedicating this one to my hero The Donald!” But where, if anywhere, should our sympathies lie in this hilarious “Death of Little Nell on steroids” tragedy? On the one hand, it’s true, Murray has long deserved her comeuppance. She may not be quite as shrill or deranged as some of the younger generation of Third Wave feminazis, but she has definitely helped poison the wells for   relationships by promulgating her grisly, joyless Marxist feminist view that any time a woman does the dishes, cooks a souffle or puts on a sexy maid’s outfit then basically she has failed as a meaningful human being. Earlier in her career, she was famed for saying that marriage humiliated women. When, in 2003 she finally married David, her partner and the father of her sons, she made it clear that she was only doing it for financial not for sentimental reasons  —   namely to avoid inheritance tax. The new Mrs   (as she certainly did not want to be known) said she had no intention of introducing David as her husband and would not be pleased if he had the temerity to say: ‘Meet my wife.’  That put him in his place. Poor David. (Actually, bloody stupid David. What were you thinking?) On the other hand, Murray deserves credit for braving the wrath of her nauseatingly   employer the BBC by stating clearly something that really ought to be said more often: that a man who has gender reassignment surgery  —   like the transexual she recently interviewed called India Willoughby  —   can never be a real woman. It’s a shame Murray had to phrase it in such a PC way, using it to have yet another dig at male privilege: “India held firmly to her belief that she was a ‘real woman’ ignoring the fact that she had spent all of her life before her transition enjoying the privileged position in our society generally accorded to a man. But at least she said it. And there’s no doubt that when an impeccably PC, uber feminist doyenne and BBC presenter says this kind of thing, it carries a lot more weight than it does when an irreverent, sexist, transphobic, polemicist like me says it. This really is a battle that needs fighting right now. Transgenderism is one of the very hottest of the many fronts of the wars which Cultural Marxism is waging on Western Civilisation. It matters so much because it goes to the heart of one of the most important and contested issues which divide right and left: is there such a thing as truth? If you believe  —   as the Social Justice Warriors,  liberal “intellectuals” and other relativistic cretins do  —   that truth is just a matter of opinion then clearly, you are whatever you say you are, be it a man, a woman,   polygender, intersex, trans and the rest of that nonsense list of LBGTetc terms. If, on the other hand, you subscribe to the more traditional, rational view that biological sex (not “gender”  —   a   invention) is determined by chromosomes and organs like wombs and penises, then it’s pretty damned obvious that you’re born either one thing or the other, regardless of how much surgical mutilation you undergo or how many hormones you take. Crusading progressives want to portray this as a war between nice people who have feelings and horrid people who are stuck in the dark ages because of their vile prejudices. But it’s not that at all. Ultimately, it’s a battle over who gets to define what truth is: the rationalists or the idealistic fantasists. Murray is not, of course, the first Social Justice crusader to find herself undone by her own side’s increasingly deranged    moral value system. Before her, there was fellow feminist icon Germaine Greer who in 2015 found herself berated online and   for making similarly sceptical remarks about transgenderism, albeit a lot more amusingly than Murray: “Just because you lop off your penis and then wear a dress doesn’t make you a ******* woman,” Ms Greer said in a statement given to the Victoria Derbyshire show. “I’ve asked my doctor to give me long ears and liver spots and I’m going to wear a brown coat but that won’t turn me into a ******* cocker spaniel. And before that, in 2013, even the arch feminist and   harridan Suzanne Moore found herself being berated by the prickly and   trans activist movement for having failed to speak about trans people with sufficient reverence. One could take heart from the fact that   like Murray, Greer, and Moore are finally beginning to recognise just how poisonous,   and fascistic liberalism is becoming these days. But I suspect their moment of enlightenment will be shortlived. It’s not penetrating insight which has led these   progressives to see the awful truth about the oppressive lunacy of their movement: it’s quite simply their age. Being all well over 50, they’ve just inherited the  prejudices of their generation. Had they been born more recently with their   politics, they would surely have been far less capable of resisting their contemporaries’ fashionable nonsense about “gender” being a “social construct. ” Meanwhile, if any transgender activists want to have a crack at me on Twitter for saying this stuff, I look forward to the attention. I do like a bit banter with the lads  …    .  ",0

7013,"After Torture, Ex-Detainee Is Still Captive of ‘The Darkness’ - The New York Times","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  —   At first, the Americans seemed confused about Suleiman Abdullah Salim. They apparently had been expecting a   Arab, and instead at a small airport outside Mogadishu that day in March 2003, they had been handed a   African. “They said, ‘You changed your face,’” Mr. Salim, a Tanzanian, recalled the American men telling him when he arrived. “They said: ‘You are Yemeni. You changed your face. ’” That was the beginning of Mr. Salim’s strange ordeal in United States custody. It has been 13 years since he was tortured in a secret prison in Afghanistan run by the Central Intelligence Agency, a place he calls “The Darkness. ” It has been eight years since he was released  —   no charges, no explanations  —   back into the world. Even after so much time, Mr. Salim, 45, is struggling to move on. Suffering from depression and   stress, according to a medical assessment, he is withdrawn and wary. He cannot talk about his experiences with his wife, who he says worries that the Americans will come back to snatch him. He is fearful of drawing too much attention at home in Stone Town in Zanzibar, Tanzania, concerned that his neighbors will think he is an American spy. When he speaks, not in his native Swahili but in the English he learned from his jailers, Mr. Salim nearly whispers. “Many times now I feel like I have something heavy inside my body,” he said in an interview. “Sometimes I walk, and I walk, and I forget, I forget everything, I forget prison, The Darkness, everything. But it is always there. The Darkness comes. ” Mr. Salim was one of 39 men subjected to some of the C. I. A. ’s most brutal techniques  —   beatings, hanging in chains, sleep deprivation and water dousing, which creates a sensation of drowning, even though interrogators had been denied permission to use that last tactic on him, according to a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the agency’s classified interrogation program. In a series of recent interviews in Dubai, Mr. Salim described his incarceration by the C. I. A. and the United States military as a terrorism suspect. His account closely parallels those provided by other detainees, witnesses and court documents, and confirms details in the Senate report about his treatment. Today, back in Stone Town, Mr. Salim is trying to support his family, though some of his attempts at jobs have not worked out. He now breeds pigeons, raising them for a local market. They are both his livelihood and his solace. They help him, Mr. Salim said. They quiet his mind. Exactly why Mr. Salim fell into American hands remains murky leaks to the press at the time of his capture suggested that intelligence officials suspected he had links to Al Qaeda, but the C. I. A. has never publicly disclosed the reasons. An agency spokesman declined to comment for this article. Mr. Salim had been drifting into a nomadic life in one of the world’s poorest regions, where the C. I. A. after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had promised allies cash rewards for terrorism suspects. Governments and warlords turned over hundreds of men to the United States, in many cases with little evidence of wrongdoing. Mr. Salim grew up on Africa’s eastern edges, but from boy to man never quite found himself. One of eight children in a family in Stone Town, a historic district of Zanzibar City, he apprenticed on the local fishing piers, then joined the crews going out for kingfish and barracuda in the Indian Ocean. He dropped out of school after ninth or 10th grade and headed for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s largest city, where he worked in a clothing shop. He moved a few years later to Mombasa, on Kenya’s coast, where he ferried cargos of dried fish, rice and oil with a crew of two. Then the outside world intruded. In August 1998, Qaeda suicide truck bombers blew up the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Mr. Salim said a man whose boat he used for the cargo runs was suspected of involvement in the plot. (Mr. Salim said that while he was in prison, American officials told him that the man had died, but he knows no other details.) The boat was soon seized by a Somali pirate, he said. Mr. Salim moved on to Kismayu, a Somali port town, and was hired as a harbor pilot. It was a good job, maybe too good for a foreigner with no ties to Somalia’s powerful clans and militias. “You had to pay off militias every time you moved a ship,” he said. “The clans were trouble, so I left. ” By 2000, he was sleeping in a mosque and begging on the streets of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Eventually, a shop owner offered him odd jobs and work as a driver for him and his sister, who Mr. Salim said worked for Mohammed Dheere, a Somali warlord. In March 2003, Mr. Salim was driving his employer through the capital when they pulled over to help a stalled vehicle. Suddenly, three gunmen appeared, dragged Mr. Salim out and started beating him, he said. He got away, but the men found him at the hospital where Mr. Salim’s boss had taken him. The men said they worked for Mr. Dheere, and they claimed he owed the warlord money, Mr. Salim recounted. “I said no, but they kept saying, ‘You stole money from Mohammed Dheere. ’” The men drove him to a small airport outside the city. The Americans were waiting. They asked him over and over about his appearance, Mr. Salim said. “They said: ‘You are not Suleiman. You changed your face.’ I say: ‘Go to Tanzania. Go see my mother and take a picture of me. ’” He was turned over to the Kenyan authorities, who flew him to Nairobi. But after questioning him, the Kenyans sent him back to Somalia and the Americans. (Kenyan officials did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Salim’s case.) This time the Americans kept him. News accounts, including an article  in The New York Times, soon appeared quoting United States and Kenyan officials describing the capture of a Qaeda operative from Yemen identified as Suleiman Abdalla Salim Hemed, who was wanted in connection with the 1998 embassy bombings. Mr. Salim said he never used the name Hemed and had nothing to do with Al Qaeda or terrorism. The news reports also said Mr. Dheere, who died in 2012, had agreed to hunt down suspects, including the man identified in the press as Mr. Hemed, for the C. I. A. in return for money. From Somalia, the C. I. A. flew Mr. Salim to a United States base in Djibouti. He was blindfolded and stripped, and an object was inserted in his rectum while the Americans photographed him, according to court documents. Just before he left Djibouti, Mr. Salim recalled, one of the captors told him that he was going to the “prison of the pharaohs. ” He was flown to Afghanistan, not Egypt as he guessed from what his captor said, and taken to the   stinking and cavernous building that Mr. Salim calls The Darkness. Music blasted nearly 24 hours a day while he was chained in solitary confinement so dark that he could not see the shackles on his arms or the walls of his cell. He said he could no longer listen to any of the songs that were on the prison playlist. The Americans routinely hauled him from his cell to a room where, he said, they hanged him from chains, once for two days. They wrapped a collar around his neck and pulled it to slam him against a wall, he said. And they shaved his head, laid him on a plastic tarp and poured gallons of ice water on him, inducing a feeling of drowning. “A guy says to me, ‘Here the rain doesn’t finish,’” Mr. Salim recalled. Several men wrapped him in the tarp and kicked him “many times, many times,” he added. At one point, a cast that a prison doctor had put on his hand  —   a finger had been broken by the Somali gunmen  —   became waterlogged. The doctor cut it off, and the water dousing continued. Mr. Salim described other grisly practices by his jailers: placing him in a   box, his arms stretched and chained, on top of cleaning chemicals strapping him to a gurney and injecting him with drugs that made him woozy bringing dogs into a room to threaten him. The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report noted that Mr. Salim was one of at least six detainees in 2003 who were “stripped and shackled nude, placed in the standing position for sleep deprivation, or subjected to other C. I. A. enhanced interrogation techniques. ” The report said officials at C. I. A. headquarters had approved the use of some of the harsh tactics against Mr. Salim, but rejected interrogators’ requests for water dousing. While 39 men endured the enhanced techniques, they were among at least 119 captives who went through the C. I. A. ’s network of secret prisons. Many were later released without charges. A quarter were men who were picked up by mistake or on evidence that proved unreliable, a Senate inquiry later found. Others were   militants some were suspected terrorist leaders, including accused plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Salim said the interrogators had repeatedly questioned him about his ties in Kenya and Somalia. Among other things, he said, they claimed that he had falsified cargo documents on his boat, apparently to hide supplies for terrorists. “They always asked the same questions. I say I don’t know. They say, ‘You know.’ Same question, same answer, and two guys would beat you, and same question, and they beat you. ” Desperate, Mr. Salim decided that suicide was his only escape. He hoarded the ibuprofen pills he sometimes was given, hiding them in the waistband of his pants. When he thought he had enough  —   26 tablets  —   he tried to take them all at once. A guard, probably alerted by images from a video camera in the cell, rushed in and stopped Mr. Salim just as he began swallowing. As he recounted the episode to a reporter, Mr. Salim began to cry uncontrollably, placed his arm across his face and rushed from the hotel room. Two days passed before he agreed to finish telling his story. Five weeks after arriving in Afghanistan, Mr. Salim said, he was moved to the “Salt Pit,” a secret underground C. I. A. prison. Mr. Salim, who was blindfolded while being transferred, said that he did not travel far. The available evidence suggests that The Darkness was most likely a different section of the same facility. Conditions improved slightly, though Mr. Salim was still interrogated regularly. “Every day questions: ‘You know him? You know him? ’” After 14 months, the C. I. A. in July 2004 handed Mr. Salim over to the United States military, which moved him to Bagram prison, outside Kabul. The young guards there nicknamed him Snoop because of his resemblance to the rapper Snoop Dogg. The military held him for four more years. “Many times, they would say, ‘We know you are innocent,’” Mr. Salim said, referring to American personnel at the prison. “And many times they said that ‘you can go home, but it will take time.’ But they didn’t do it. ” In Bagram, he was kept in a large cage with as many as 22 other prisoners. Pigeons flew in and out of the large, drafty prison. “I remember one flew in, and was just outside our cage,” he said. “I was thinking, the pigeon was free and I was in the cage. ” In August 2008, Mr. Salim was released. The United States military gave him a document stating that there were no charges against him and that he had been “determined to pose no threat to the United States Armed Forces or its interests in Afghanistan. ” The military freed him with no possessions save the long red trousers and top that were his prison uniform, and no place to go. Mr. Salim had to borrow   clothes from an International Red Cross representative in Afghanistan, who arranged for him to fly home to Zanzibar. Mr. Salim has kept the   clothes from the Red Cross man ever since. At the airport in Zanzibar, he was met by a   members of his family and Tanzanian security officials. “They asked me the same questions the Americans had always asked me,” he said. But after two days, the Tanzanian government left him alone, with no restrictions on his activities. Tanzanian officials did not respond to a request for comment on his case. In late 2008 or early 2009, two F. B. I. agents came to Tanzania to check up on him, Mr. Salim said. One agent said he had a gift: a   that said “Hakuna Matata”  —   no worries  —   from “The Lion King. ” Mr. Salim angrily tossed it back. An F. B. I. spokesman said he had no information about the episode. Mr. Salim returned to the world a stranger. He had gotten married just two weeks before he was taken captive in Mogadishu, but his wife disappeared while he was gone and he could not find her. Back in Stone Town, Mr. Salim found simple tasks difficult. He was depressed and experienced nightmares and flashbacks about his time in prison, he said. They felt so real that he could not understand what was happening to his mind. His attempts to work proved frustrating. His sister offered to pay him to drive his niece to school, but he got lost on the first day. He wanted to go back to sea, but local fishermen thought they might get in trouble associating with him. In 2009 or 2010, Mr. Salim went to Dar es Salaam seeking a license to become a merchant seaman, but he did not pass the test. He briefly worked for a cargo shipping company in Japan, but he said that loading containers hurt his back, already injured in prison. He listed other chronic physical problems from his time in custody: headaches, neck and shoulder pain, and severe gastrointestinal problems, common among detainees. Without a job, he lived with his mother and his sister at different times, humiliated that he was having so much trouble supporting himself. In 2010, Dr. Sondra Crosby of the Boston University School of Medicine, a physician, a Navy reservist and an expert on torture, was asked by Physicians for Human Rights, a New   group, to evaluate Mr. Salim. She was shocked by what she found. Mr. Salim, who is    was emaciated “like a skeleton,” Dr. Crosby said in an interview. In her assessment, she wrote that “he is plagued by profound distress, inability to eat and inability to sleep. ” “He describes himself as a ghost walking around the town,” she added. She noted other symptoms: flashbacks,   and   memory loss, distress at seeing anyone in a military uniform, hopelessness about the future and a strong avoidance of noise. “He reports that his head feels empty  —   like an empty box,” she said. Dr. Crosby concluded that Mr. Salim showed many symptoms of   stress disorder and major depression. He appears, she wrote, “to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration by U. S. forces. ” He is now a plaintiff in a lawsuit against two C. I. A. contractors who helped devise and run the brutal interrogation program of which he was a part. “I want the people who did this to be judged,” he said. Mr. Salim remarried and has a    daughter, but he finds it impossible to talk to his wife about what happened to him, or how it still haunts him. He says others around him do not understand what he went through. He lives in a   house owned by a relative in a poor neighborhood outside Stone Town. Until recently, he made some money by taking tourists fishing on a boat owned by his   . But it was swamped in a storm several months ago. His pigeons now help him get by. He has shopped at bird markets in Dubai and Johannesburg for exotic varieties  —   Jacobin pigeons, Dutch pigeons, Chinese owl fancy pigeons, Moorhead pigeons. He breeds and sells them in Zanzibar. In the yard outside his house, he built a block and wire pigeon cage, 26 feet by 10 feet, larger than most of the cells in which the Americans kept him. When he needs to be alone, he goes there. “I like to sit with the pigeons. I like to get away from people,” Mr. Salim said. “I sit there a long time. ”",0
7014,Kim Jong-un Says North Korea Is Preparing to Test Long-Range Missile - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   North Korea’s leader, Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  —   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New Year’s Day speech, which was broadcast on the North’s   KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. “We have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,” he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea, President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trump’s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim’s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. Kim’s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Cheong said. “We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year’s speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,” he said. In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump’s election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the North’s launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the North’s satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  —   far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the Earth’s atmosphere without breaking up. In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. Kim said the North “can tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range. ” On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.",0

7016,"131 countries support Russia's anti-Nazi UN resolution, but is this enough?","November 18, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On November 17th, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution to combat the glorification of Nazism proposed by Russia in collaboration with 54 states. The delegations of 131 out of 193 states voted to support the resolution, which also concerned combatting contemporary forms of racism. 48 delegations abstained, including some EU countries. Only three countries voted against the document: Palau, the US, and Ukraine. Thus, the situation from 2015 was repeated, the only difference being that back then Canada voted not to condemn Nazism. 
At first glance, what is surprising is the absence of the Baltic states, specifically Latvia and Estonia, on this extra short list of those opposed. It is in Latvia and Estonia that the glorification of the “exploits” of local Waffen SS divisions has taken a most radical and consistent form. However, this can be explained by the fact that the Baltic states are EU members and are therefore compelled to restrain some of their desires.  
Everything is more or less clear with the United States’ vote. After the Second World War, numerous Nazi collaborators were settled in America, especially Ukrainians from both factions of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Apparently, the influence of the Ukrainian (Galician) diaspora has a, if not decisive, then at least important impact on US policy. 
Ukraine is even less restrained than the Baltic states of the EU. The idolization of Nazi collaborators has begun to be widespread at least since the victory of the Maidan (if we don’t count Viktor Yushchenko’s presidency), so Ukrainians are striving to catch up and surpass Latvia and Estonia in the open glorification of Nazism.   
In the future, additional legislative measures against the glorification of the Waffen SS and Hitlerite collaborationists will need to be adopted. It is entirely unclear why Russia has become the victim of attacks by the neo-Nazi Baltic regimes for “Soviet occupation” but is in no hurry to make counter-claims against those countries which now openly hold marches for veterans and adherents of the Waffen SS, a criminal organization which was convicted at the Nuremberg Tribunal.  
Measures of an economic nature should be taken. On November 18th, a report surfaced that Rosselkhoznadzor (the Russian state organization overseeing agricultural imports) gave permission for canned fish to be delivered from Latvia and Estonia. This has caused great bewilderment and indignation. First of all, these states, as EU members, have imposed sanctions against Russia. Secondly, their Waffen SS marches make any trade concessions from Russia morally unacceptable. After all, no other country suffered more from the crimes of Nazism than Russia.  
The Baltic Waffen SS divisions fought (or, more precisely, carried out punitive operations) largely on the territory of Russia’s northern regions. After the war, the Soviet communist regime treated these ex-executioners fairly gently and, in doing so, likely committed a big mistake. the Baltic Nazis did not appreciate humanity, and the same thing can be said of the Banderites in Ukraine. 
Russia should follow the example of Poland and adopt legislation on a state level which names the criminal deeds of the organizations in the former USSR countries (above all, Ukraine and the Baltics) which collaborated with the Hitlerite occupation regime. This means the national formations of the Waffen SS and collaborationist groupings such as OUN-UPA, etc.).  

Russia has the right to impose economic, legal, and social measures against these countries and urge the international community to join the fight against the glorification of Nazism at the state level.

7017,UK Police Six Times More Likely To Stop And Search Black People,"Videos UK Police Six Times More Likely To Stop And Search Black People Black people in Britain are more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people, according to new official figures. | October 28, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Stop and search has always been a controversial method used by police officers in England and Wales and has always disproportionately targeted black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in Britain. 
According to official figures released in 2013, 27 percent of stop and searches were not based on reasonable grounds for suspicion and concerns, as well as disproportionately targeting young people from BME backgrounds. 
In 2014, then-Home Secretary Theresa May, decided to crack down on stop and search, penalizing police forces who used it and imposed restrictions on officers in 2014. 
A year later in 2015, the head of London’s Metropolitan Police blamed an increase in knife crime on the home secretary’s stop and search reforms. In the same year, the number of fatal stabbings increased by 18 percent in London. 
London knife crime is now at a four year high, according to a report published by the Police and Crime Committee which suggests violent crime, including knives, guns, sexual assaults and robbery have all risen year on year, with knives increasingly becoming a weapon of choice amongst young people . 2 Officers assaulted whilst detaining person with a knife. Glad to hear they are ok! Thank you #dedication #proactivepolicing #stopandsearch https://t.co/UnpIZ1wSEe 
— Nick Downing (@NickDowningMPS) October 26, 2016 
While the latest figures released by the Home Office, reveal that the use of stop and search by police had reduced by more than a quarter across the board — stopping white people fell more sharply. 
The statistics reveal that people from BME backgrounds were still three times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people in 2015/16 and black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. 
Amber Rudd, Britain’s relatively new home secretary, says the statistics are “unacceptable” yet added that the powers are “vital” for police to fight crime. 
“A similar story has been seen for the black group, which fell from over six times more likely to just over four times more likely between the years ending March 31, 2011 and 2015, before rising again to over six times more likely in the year ending March 31 2016,” the Home Office report said. 
Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott, said: “The decline in stop and search clearly shows there is some effort to use these police powers more reasonably. But there are clear signs that some communities are being disproportionately targeted.” 
Amber Rudd, the same home secretary who suggested companies draw up a list of their foreign workers, said that, “no one should be stopped on the basis of their race or ethnicity.”

7019,Nuclear Option: ’Elections Matter’-Trump Campaigned on Extreme Vetting - Breitbart,"Look, global elites, nobody said   would be easy. Or pretty. But it is what it is. Get over it. [The     hysteria over President Trump’s executive order directed at finally getting a grip on who exactly is coming into the United States from the Middle East has been amusing.  Or, as their   former President Obama once said: Elections matter. President Trump’s “extreme vetting” proposals were thoroughly and exhaustively debated in the election, an election which he won handily. Moreover, his proposals were roundly smeared in the most negative terms as some kind of “Muslim ban” even before the election. No matter how crazy mad these protesters are, President Trump is carrying out precisely the plans he promised he would. Only in politics would a politician keeping his promises be so utterly scandalous. Sen. Charles E. Schumer was literally   on national television. And then all these other “serious” Democrats raced off to the nearest airport to get ahead of the angry mob. It is depressing that these hacks are the best representation some voters get in Congress. And you watch: The very Democrats who are doing the most caterwauling today will be among the first to pay a political price in this new Era of Trump. I get that these spineless politicians are just scared for their jobs. But it is hard to understand exactly what it is the actual protesters are protesting. Are they actually opposed to “extreme vetting” of people streaming into the United States from known terrorist breeding grounds? Do these protesters object to more strenuous screening of people coming from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya? Who, again, was the   bigot who identified these countries as terror hot spots anyway? Oh, that’s right, it was President Obama. “Thanks, Obama,” as the president himself liked to say in the waning days of his failed presidency. And now some people are claiming that stiffer screening will become yet another jihadi recruitment tool  —   oh that boogeyman of every single tactic ever used to combat the diabolical bullies of  . No, being alive while Jewish, Christian or atheist is the single biggest jihadi recruitment tool. Being gay or female or a sunbather anywhere in the world is the   jihadi recruitment tool. Let’s not even start talking about all the crap that Hollywood produces that sets the jihadis off like a cheap cellphone detonator. Also, it seems like poor form for these protesters to be whining about “extreme vetting” inside actual airports, where every single day more than a million actual   Americans endure humiliating, obnoxious and insulting “extreme vetting” at the hands of   bureaucrats with serious police complexes. We remove our shoes, our belts, our hairpieces and the lint from our pockets and then stand prone with our arms aloft in an   tube that penetrates the deepest of our fat rolls. And the small town I am from wasn’t even a terrorist breeding ground! The most maddening thing about the extreme vetting of excessive airport groping is knowing that never, not one single time, has all that nonsense, inconvenience and insult prevented a single terrorist attack. The only way to thwart this adaptive and merciless enemy is to find them before they get to America and kill them over there so we don’t have to kill them over here.

7020,Reductress » ‘How Am I Supposed To Explain This To My Children?’ Asks Melania Trump,"‘How Am I Supposed To Explain This To My Children?’ Asks Melania Trump Thoughts - Nov 9, 2016 By: Sarah Pappalardo SHARE: Tweet 
It’s been a long and draining election cycle, and I don’t think any of us could have expected the result that we saw today. For many of us with young children, you probably woke up this morning asking yourself, “How am I supposed to explain this to my children?” 

I, Melania Trump, am asking myself the same thing. 

How can any of us metabolize what happened to a ten-year-old? Should I be honest and let him know just how bad things are, or do I let him enjoy his childhood, his innocence a little while longer? How much longer can we pretend the bathroom door lock is “broken” while Donald is stuck in there? 

Many of us are concerned about how our sons will learn to treat women in this dangerous, sexist climate. In the case of my son, the nation’s biggest tragedy since 9/11 just told him to stop being a pussy. 

How am I supposed to explain that our next president is a bully, and also his father? 


And how do I explain to my son that our next president is a man who intimidatingly looked over at my ballot, just to make sure I was still voting for him? Should I remind my son that this man is a terrible role model and his behavior unacceptable, just like I’ve been quietly whispering to him for his entire short life? 

And when he gets older, how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault, never shared his tax returns, was endorsed by the KKK, and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work, but now I’m not so sure. I hate that my son has to come of age in such a time of uncertainty and also have blood relation to the cause of it all. 

What am I supposed to tell my only son about the loud, nasty man on TV who insults immigrants while hiring thousands of them, including me, his wife? Do I need to tell him anything at all when he is on the TV standing right next to that man? 

It seems like it’s always on the tip of my tongue these days; that “Donald Trump is a bad man.” But I can’t bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said he’d “send me back to Slovenia” if I did. But in my heart, I am concerned for the future of our country. I’m concerned for the world my son has to grow up in, and that his father is the next leader of the free world.

7021,‘We The People’ Against Tyranny: Seven Principles For Free Government,"Videos ‘We The People’ Against Tyranny: Seven Principles For Free Government “As I look at America today, I am not afraid to say that I am afraid.”— Former presidential adviser Bertram Gross | November 7, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Dozens of protestors demonstrating against the expansion of the Dakota Access Pipeline wade in cold creek waters confronting local police, as remnants of pepper spray waft over the crowd near Cannon Ball, N.D., Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. 
As history teaches us, if the people have little or no knowledge of the basics of government and their rights, those who wield governmental power inevitably wield it excessively. After all, a citizenry can only hold its government accountable if it knows when the government oversteps its bounds. 
Precisely because Americans are easily distracted—because, as study after study shows, they are clueless about their rights—because their elected officials no longer represent them—because Americans have been brainwashed into believing that their only duty as citizens is to vote—because the citizenry has failed to hold government officials accountable to abiding by the Constitution—because young people are no longer being taught the fundamentals of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, resulting in citizens who don’t even know they have rights—and because Americans continue to place their trust in politics to fix what’s wrong with this country—the American governmental scheme is sliding ever closer towards a pervasive authoritarianism. 
This steady slide towards tyranny, meted out by militarized local and federal police and legalistic bureaucrats, has been carried forward by each successive president over the past fifty years regardless of their political affiliation. 
Big government has grown bigger and the rights of the citizenry have grown smaller. 
However, there are certain principles—principles that every American should know—which undergird the American system of government and form the basis for the freedoms our forefathers fought and died for. 
The following seven principles are a good starting point for understanding what free government is really all about. 
First, the maxim that power corrupts is an absolute truth. Realizing this, those who drafted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights held one principle sacrosanct: a distrust of all who hold governmental power. As James Madison, author of the Bill of Rights, proclaimed, “All men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.” Moreover, in questions of power, Thomas Jefferson warned, “Let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.” As such, those who drafted our founding documents would see today’s government as an out-of-control, unmanageable beast. 
The second principle is that governments primarily exist to secure rights, an idea that is central to constitutionalism. In appointing the government as the guardian of the people’s rights, the people give it only certain, enumerated powers, which are laid out in a written constitution. The idea of a written constitution actualizes the two great themes of the Declaration of Independence: consent and protection of equal rights. Thus, the purpose of constitutionalism is to limit governmental power and ensure that the government performs its basic function: to preserve and protect our rights, especially our unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and our civil liberties. Unfortunately, the government today has discarded this principle and now sees itself as our master, not our servant. The obvious next step, unless we act soon, is tyranny. 
The third principle revolves around the belief that no one is above the law, not even those who make the law. This is termed rule of law. Richard Nixon’s statement, “When the President does it, that means it is not illegal,” would have been an anathema to the Framers of the Constitution. If all people possess equal rights, the people who live under the laws must be allowed to participate in making those laws. By that same token, those who make the laws must live under the laws they make. However, today government officials at all levels often act as if they are royalty with salaries and perks that none of the rest of us are afforded. This is an egregious affront to the citizenry. 
Fourth, separation of powers ensures that no single authority is entrusted with all the powers of government. People are not perfect, whether they are in government or out of it. As history makes clear, those in power tend to abuse it. The government is thus divided into three co-equal branches: legislative, executive and judicial. Placing all three powers in the same branch of government was considered the very definition of tyranny. The fact that the president today has dictatorial powers would have been considered a curse by the Framers. 
Fifth, a system of checks and balances, essential if a constitutional government is to succeed, strengthens the separation of powers and prevents legislative despotism. Such checks and balances include dividing Congress into two houses, with different constituencies, term lengths, sizes and functions; granting the president a limited veto power over congressional legislation; and appointing an independent judiciary capable of reviewing ordinary legislation in light of the written Constitution, which is referred to as “judicial review.” The Framers feared that Congress could abuse its powers and potentially emerge as the tyrannous branch because it had the power to tax. But they did not anticipate the emergence of presidential powers as they have come to dominate modern government or the inordinate influence of corporate powers on governmental decision-making. Indeed, as recent academic studies now indicate, we are now ruled by a monied oligarchy that serves itself and not “we the people.” 
Sixth, representation allows the people to have a voice in government by sending elected representatives to do their bidding while avoiding the need of each and every citizen to vote on every issue considered by government. In a country as large as the United States, it is not feasible to have direct participation in governmental affairs. Hence, we have a representative government. If the people don’t agree with how their representatives are conducting themselves, they can and should vote them out. However, as the citizenry has grown lazy and been distracted by the entertainment spectacles of modern society, government bureaucrats churn out numerous laws each year resulting in average citizens being rendered lawbreakers and jailed for what used to be considered normal behavior. Local institutions are to liberty what primary schools are to science; they put it within the people’s reach; they teach people to appreciate its peaceful enjoyment and accustom them to make use of it. Without local institutions a nation may give itself a free government, but it has not got the spirit of liberty. 
Unfortunately, we are now governed by top-heavy government emanating from Washington DC that has no respect for local institutions or traditions. 
These seven vital principles have been largely forgotten in recent years, obscured by the haze of a centralized government, a citizenry that no longer thinks analytically, and schools that don’t adequately teach our young people about their history and their rights. 
Yet here’s the rub: while Americans wander about in their brainwashed states, their “government of the people, by the people and for the people” has largely been taken away from them. 
The answer: get un-brainwashed. 
Stand up for the founding principles. 
Make your voice and your vote count for more than just political posturing. 
Never cease to vociferously protest the erosion of your freedoms at the local and national level. 
Most of all, do these things today. 
If we wait until the votes have all been counted or hang our hopes on our particular candidate to win and fix what’s wrong with the country, “we the people” will continue to lose. 
Whether we ever realize it not, the enemy is not across party lines, as they would have us believe. It has us surrounded on all sides. 
Even so, we’re not yet defeated. 
We could still overcome our oppressors if we cared enough to join forces and launch a militant nonviolent revolution—a people’s revolution that starts locally and trickles upwards—but that will take some doing. 
It will mean turning our backs on the political jousting contests taking place at all levels of government and rejecting their appointed jesters as false prophets. It will mean not allowing ourselves to be corralled like cattle and branded with political labels that have no meaning anymore. It will mean recognizing that all the evils that surround us today—endless wars, drone strikes, invasive surveillance, militarized police, poverty, asset forfeiture schemes, overcriminalization, etc.—are not of our making but came about as a way to control and profit from us. 
It will mean “ voting with our feet ” through sustained, mass civil disobedience. 
As journalist Chris Hedges points out, “There were once radicals in America, people who held fast to moral imperatives. They fought for the oppressed because it was right , not because it was easy or practical. They were willing to accept the state persecution that comes with open defiance. They had the courage of their convictions. They were not afraid.” 
Ultimately, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , it will mean refusing to be divided, one against each other, by politics and instead uniting behind the only distinction that has ever mattered: “we the people” against tyranny.

7022,Michael Oliver – This Key Signal Will Indicate Liftoff For Gold & Silver And The Mining Stocks!,"123 Views October 31, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
Today King World News is pleased to present an extremely important update on the war in the gold market from Michael Oliver at MSA. Oliver allowed KWN exclusively to share this key report with our global audience. 
By Michael Oliver, MSA (Momentum Structural Analysis) October 31 ( King World New s) – MSA has recently shown many long-term momentum charts of gold, all of which demonstrate that the sharp pullback in no way broke the structural integrity of the long-term momentum uptrend that emerged with multiple momentum breakouts (quarterly and annual) in February. Period. The same applies to GDX… IMPORTANT: To find out which high-grade silver mining company billionaire Eric Sprott just purchased a nearly 20% stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
Our main focus now is in identifying points of upturn. We begin with a long-term momentum chart of GDX (see chart below). 
This 40-wk. avg. oscillator is effectively the same as the 200-day avg. or 3-qtr. avg. oscillator. 
Firstly, we aren’t 100% sure the decline is over, but where it landed suggests it might be. A further drop won’t alter our positive view of GDX, as the zone of potential support extends lower than we’ve seen to date. 
It’s unlikely this long-term chart will be the best place to look for a credible sign of upturn. Instead, this chart has already pretty much accomplished its task in defining both the upturn (first up-arrow) and a target zone for a low (second up-arrow). 
There is rarely a market situation in which only one technical factor will provide entry or exit signal. It usually takes looking at several, in an ongoing basis, to identify turns. 
Here we use a 15-day avg. (effectively a smoothed 3-wk. avg.) to measure (see chart below). 
Note that the process of decline since July produced three down waves in momentum, with the third wave not confirming the new price lows. 
The Key To The Gold, Silver, And Mining Share Liftoff If momentum can close a day out above the recent high close and the downtrend connecting those three peak closes then assume weekly momentum is turning. This does not mean cannot have selloffs, but it probably means you have seen the low. Basically any day that can close somewhat over $25 accomplishes the task. 
King World News note: What Michael is trying to identify is a signal that the mining stocks are reversing back into an uptrend, thus marking the end of the correction. He highlights the level of 25 on the GDX as the key to see a clear sign of a reversal. If GDX closes above 25 on a daily basis that will be a good indicator. If it closes above that level on a weekly basis that would be even better. A reversal in the mining shares will also be accompanied by a reversal in gold and silver to the upside, so keep an eye on that key level that Michael highlighted because the mining shares will continue to lead the way in this bullish leg of the secular bull market in gold, silver, and the shares.

7023,"If they could, most Democrats would reelect Obama over Clinton","Print 
[Ed. – It’s that bad.] 
President Obama has received higher approval ratings in his final year than he has for most of his presidency. While most voters expect Hillary Clinton to continue many of his policies if she wins, a sizable majority of her current supporters would vote for Obama instead if the rules allowed it. 
A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey shows that 70% of Likely U.S. Voters who support Clinton in the election say they’d vote for Obama if it was a legal option. Just 11% of Republican Donald Trump’s voters agree. (To see survey question wording, click here .) 
Among all Likely Voters, 41% say that if Obama was legally allowed to run for a third term in office, they would vote for him over Clinton and Trump. Just over half (52%) still say they would not vote for him in that case. 
Earlier this year before the presidential nominees were decided , 31% said they would vote for Obama if he legally could seek a third term, but twice as many (62%) said they would not support him. Those findings were little changed from last year after Obama commented about winning a third term in a speech in Africa.",0
7024,"Hillary Clinton’s Lead Has Shrunk, but She Still Has an Edge - The New York Times","Nate Cohn, The Upshot’s elections analyst, based in Washington, and Toni Monkovic, an Upshot editor in New York, discussed a big day of polling results, posting a lightly edited transcript of their written exchange.  Toni After a quiet period, the polls poured in over 24 hours. What are the big takeaways? Nate I think the quick ones are that Hillary Clinton’s standing has deteriorated a bit since last month, but that she still has an advantage. Toni Let’s start by looking at the bad news for her. The first polls of the day, from Quinnipiac, probably panicked a lot of Democrats. FLORIDA: Trump 42, Clinton 39 PENNSYLVANIA: Trump 43, Clinton 41 OHIO: Clinton 41, Trump 41 Nate Yeah, the Quinnipiac polls aren’t great for Clinton. Quinnipiac polling has generally tilted toward the G. O. P. all year, so it’s reasonable to suppose that Clinton’s standing in those states would be a bit better in other polls. But they’re still consistent with a narrower race than the one suggested by most polls over the last month. The    polls were in that category as well. Their   numbers were better for Clinton than the Quinnipiac surveys, but they were still weaker for Clinton than their past surveys. Toni  Despite that Republican lean from Quinnipiac, it’s not as if it’s a terrible pollster. Yes, it’s just one poll, but it can’t be dismissed. Nate Well, I do think their Republican lean is a bit concerning. They conduct a lot of polls and they have big samples. As a result, it’s unusually clear that they have a real Republican tilt. But it’s not really clear why they should tilt that way, and that gives me pause. That said, you’re right that the polls shouldn’t be dismissed: Add them to the average. Toni There’s another bit of bad news for Clinton. Again, the mantra is to focus on the polling average, not on one poll. In this case it’s the   poll. It hasn’t been released to the public as we write this Wednesday night, but it will be by the time this is published. It will show her tied with Trump, which is one of her worst recent national results. (Sure, Rasmussen had Trump up by 2, but that’s actually a rare poll that can be disregarded, as you wrote Wednesday.) Nate You certainly can’t dismiss the   poll: It’s a very   survey. And yes, you really can dismiss the Rasmussen poll (unlike Quinnipiac). But as you said, it’s best to focus on the average. Right now, the balance of data remains consistent with a modest Clinton lead. A single   poll showing a tied race isn’t enough to change that: If Clinton is up by, say, 3 or 4 points, you would expect a few   polls to show a very tight contest, while others would show a larger Clinton lead. It’s also possible that the   result is   and a wave of new data will confirm a closer race than the balance of recent evidence. I’m not sure we’ll get to find out, since the convention is just around the corner. Toni This is the speculative part of the program. Her lead is shrinking. Why? On the one hand, you have the rebuke from the F. B. I. director over the emails, and you also have a calamity in which an   killed five police officers in Dallas amid a sense of racial strife. On the other hand, Bernie Sanders endorsed her, although that was very recent (so it wasn’t captured by the polling). Nate Well, I think the F. B. I. is the easiest explanation. I wouldn’t discount racial tension, either. I’d note that Obama’s approval rating in Gallup dipped to 48 percent today, the lowest in a while. I’ll be interested to see whether other polls show that, too. Toni Stating the obvious, but there are more whites than   so   strife is not normally a political winner for Democrats. When we talk about whites favoring Trump, we tend to skip the explanation. Republicans have won whites for decades, but readers should take a look at Nick Confessore’s article for how Trump is taking white identity politics to a new level. Or read Jamelle Bouie in Slate, who’s been writing about this a lot. Nate I certainly agree that racial polarization would be bad for the Democrats. But Trump isn’t doing much better than Mitt Romney among white voters, if at all. He’s losing as many   white voters as he’s gaining among less educated white voters. I think Clinton’s polling numbers may be particularly vulnerable to these sorts of fluctuations in the media environment. She’s counting on the support of a lot of people who simply don’t like her very much. I’d guess a lot of them know, deep down, that they’ll support her eventually. But right now, the act of telling a pollster that they intend to support someone they don’t really want to support might be fairly agonizing. Toni Election 2016: “Fairly agonizing. ” That’s a great summation. Nate One further thought on this: I think it’s relevant that Clinton is falling in these polls more than Trump is gaining. Toni Why? Nate We know that these voters have supported Clinton, even if in modestly more favorable conditions. There’s no way to be sure they’ll return to her side, but surely they’re more likely to revert to her in a more neutral media climate than to support Trump. Toni And the email issue may not resonate quite as much four months from now, especially if Republicans batter it into the ground. Nate It might still resonate quite a bit, but it’s hard for it to resonate much more. I think it’s going to be interesting to see where she’s at after the convention, after she gets some strong character witnesses in President Obama and Elizabeth Warren. Toni Earlier, you mentioned, “I’m not sure we’ll get to find out” about a better measure of the race “since the convention is just around the corner. ” We’re heading into a “noisy” season with polling. Can you explain? Nate Generally, a candidate gets a “bounce” of a few points after a convention. This year, it’s pretty messy. The two conventions basically happen back to back. It’ll be hard to read too much into the polls for a few weeks with the conventions (unless Trump leads coming out of Clinton’s convention, which would obviously be a very strong sign for him). The good news, though, is that the polls start getting fairly accurate a few weeks after the conventions. So that’s something to look forward to. Toni Let’s turn to some of her positive results, and they got more positive as the day wore on. Colorado was particularly a bright spot. Fox had her up by 10 points, and Monmouth by 13. Nate Yeah, that’s a great result for her. It’s not hard to see why it could be a good state for her: It’s very well educated and it has an   Latino vote. The same story basically holds in Virginia, where the Fox poll also showed her doing well. And I think it’s worth remembering that Virginia and Colorado would basically be almost enough to get Clinton over the top. If you give her all of the states carried by Obama where she’s not airing advertisements (which includes Wisconsin and Pennsylvania) then Colorado and Virginia would get her to 269 electoral votes. It would only take one more, and she has a lot of options. It’s hard to look at the polling right now and say that Trump has a discernible edge in any battleground, even if a few  —   like Ohio and Iowa  —   look very close. Toni I was going to ask you about Ohio and Iowa. We’ve gotten quite a few polls from those states recently, and they seem dead even. Nate It does seem that way. Iowa and Ohio are two states where Democrats are heavily dependent on   white voters. Same story in Wisconsin, where Clinton was up by just 4 points today. In all three states, Clinton is running about 3 or 4 points worse than Obama four years ago. It’s kind of the reverse of Colorado and Virginia. Toni But a slight difference with Wisconsin it has been consistently leaning for Clinton. Nate True. My point is just that it’s a state where she’s underperforming Obama, unlike the states where Romney was more dependent on   voters like Colorado and Virginia. Toni The map you discussed supposes she’ll win Pennsylvania, and we had some divergent results in the state today. We also had this tidbit: Pennsylvania white voters: Trump, 40%  —   Clinton, 40% Pennsylvania black voters: Trump, 0%  —   Clinton, 91% It cannot be possible that Trump is getting 0 percent support from black voters. I mean, he made a big production of “my  ” a while back. Nate   well, he’s probably not actually getting zero percent of the black vote. But here, let’s use some data. I have this polling data from 2012 loaded on my computer. It’s 20, 000 interviews, or about 24 times more respondents than the    poll in Pennsylvania. In that data set, there are 1, 881 black respondents, and just 55 of them supported Romney. So in 2012 you would have expected there to be about two voters who were black and supported Mitt Romney in an     national poll. With numbers like that, you’re going to get more than a few polls where there are no black voters for the G. O. P. And here’s a flashback from 2012, from the   poll heading into the G. O. P. convention: Obama ahead   among black voters. Sound familiar? Toni That makes sense, but maybe you’re ruining it  —   the zero somehow seems more meaningful. (Like turning the stereo up to 11.) Nate Here’s something fun: In my data set, which includes 880 respondents from Pennsylvania, the black vote was   for Obama (and that’s with 60 black respondents). I don’t think it’s very meaningful. We know that Clinton is up by a huge margin among black voters. There are going to be polls where Trump gets zero black voters. Toni One thing that’s very meaningful is whether Clinton can win Pennsylvania. You mentioned one overall path to victory, through Colorado and Virginia. It’s also true that if the Democrats hold onto Pennsylvania and win Virginia and Florida, it’s essentially game over. But we didn’t learn that much from the Pennsylvania results today, did we? Nate No, it was a split decision, with Quinnipiac showing a tight race and    showing a considerable Clinton lead. I’m inclined to lean toward    considering that the Clinton campaign isn’t taking Pennsylvania especially seriously [no ad spending, although a   super PAC is spending money there]. But it’d be nice to have more data there. Toni It was a rich day of polling. If you had to assess Clinton’s national lead right now, what would you say, 3 points? Four points? That’s a pretty close race against a candidate who has struggled in  many ways. Nate  I’d probably say 4 or 5 points, but that’s not very  . The newest data does provide reason to pause and wonder whether the race has gotten even tighter, even if the preponderance of evidence doesn’t point that way quite yet. The only other thing I’d say, though, is that we know Clinton has had a rough week or two. The polls are going to bump around, and I think there’s reason to think this is a relatively low point. On Wednesday, Nate and Toni looked at the groups Donald Trump would win if the election were held today. ",0
7025,Will Hillary Select Her Own Prosecutors?,"By Bill Sardi November 1, 2016 Journalist Carl Bernstein, who played a key role in uncovering the Watergate scandal in the Nixon era, says Hillary Clinton’s email fiasco is in no way “bigger than Watergate.” [ Politico Oct 29, 2016] But Watergate was a simple break-in at a Democrat electioneering office. Hillary Clinton not only operated her email system outside normal security procedures but did so to hide the fact she was operating her pay-to-play schemes at the State Department and was lining her pockets with millions of dollars in the process. Hillary Clinton literally put the State Department up for sale says a report published in the New York Post. [ New York Post Aug 9, 2016] Even more criminal is that the Democrat Party is attempting to cover up Clinton’s scheme that keeps offering favors to even foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation, making the Democrat Party a complicit to criminal activity (as if that is something new to them). The Justice Department sought to bar the Justice Department (FBI) from proceeding ahead with its investigation of Hillary’s emails, which is the reason why Anthony Weiner’s emails were not scrutinized early on. [ Daily Mail UK Oct 31, 2016] Is America going to elect Hillary Clinton and watch her use her power to appoint an Attorney General and a new FBI chief to get off the hook? Hillary Clinton may still be under investigation after she is elected. [ Daily Mail UK Oct 30, 2016] Hillary Clinton could go to prison for 20 years if charged with obstruction of justice. [ Info Wars Oct 31, 2016] Expect a Presidential pardon if that ever happens. While Hillary Clinton is now playing the role of victim of an “October Surprise” that the FBI chose to run against her, 24 years ago Bill Clinton cheered an 11 th -hour indictment in his bid for reelection. [ Washington Examiner Oct 30-2016] Meanwhile, another email gets uncovered where Hillary Clinton’s top aides were drooling over a Super Pac that planned to work hand-in-hand with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, something that is legally forbidden. As Hillary’s team ponders this development, one of Hillary’s top aides says in her email: “That’s fine. But skirting if not violating the law doesn’t help her INMHO” (slang/acronym: in my humble opinion). [ Zerohedge.com Oct 31, 2016] Hillary Clinton opened her last week of campaigning with a TV advertisement that revisits the 1964 “Daisy” ad that attempts to claim Trump is a reckless leader who can’t be trusted with the “bug red button” that would launch a nuclear war. Clinton has said there is only a 4-minute window to decide to launch a nuclear war. [ Washington Post Oct 31, 2016] The irony is that a vote for Hillary Clinton has been said to be a vote for war.

7026,"In American Towns, Private Profits From Public Works - The New York Times","BAYONNE, N. J.  —   Nicole Adamczyk’s drinking water used to slosh through a snarl of pipes dating from the Coolidge administration  —   a rusty, rickety symbol of the nation’s failing infrastructure. So, in 2012, this   port city cut a deal with a Wall Street investment firm to manage its municipal waterworks. Four years later, many of those crusty brown pipes have been replaced by shiny   ones, reflecting a broader infrastructure overhaul in Bayonne. But Ms. Adamczyk’s water and sewer bill has jumped so much that she is thinking about moving out of town. “My reaction was, ‘Oh, so I guess I’m screwed now? ’” said Ms. Adamczyk, an accountant and mother of two who received a quarterly bill for almost $500 this year. She’s not alone: Another resident’s bill jumped 5 percent, despite the household’s having used 11 percent less water. Even as Wall Street deals like the one with Bayonne help financially desperate municipalities to make   repairs, they can come with a hefty price tag  —   not just to pay for new pipes, but also to help the investors earn a nice return, a New York Times analysis has found. Often, these contracts guarantee a specific amount of revenue, The Times found, which can send water bills soaring. Water rates in Bayonne have risen nearly 28 percent since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  —   one of Wall Street’s most storied private equity firms  —   teamed up with another company to manage the city’s water system, the Times analysis shows. City officials also promised residents a   rate freeze that never materialized. In one measure of residents’ distress, people are falling so far behind on their bills that the city is placing more liens against their homes, which can eventually lead to foreclosures. In the typical private equity water deal, higher rates help the firms earn returns of anywhere from 8 to 18 percent, more than what a regular   water company may expect. And to accelerate their returns, two of the firms have applied a common strategy from the private equity playbook: quickly flipping their investment to another firm. This includes K. K. R. which is said to be shopping its 90 percent stake in the Bayonne venture, a partnership with the water company Suez. Rich Henning, a Suez spokesman, said that “Bayonne had chronically underinvested in their water and sewer infrastructure, which has certainly contributed to rate increases during the past few years. ” He added, “We understand that these increases create stresses for ratepayers. ”   Donald J. Trump has made the privatization of public works a centerpiece of his strategy to rebuild America’s airports, bridges, tunnels and roads. Members of his inner circle have sketched out a vision, including billions of dollars of tax credits for private investors willing to tackle big infrastructure projects. And Mr. Trump himself promised in his victory speech “to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. ” Private equity firms like K. K. R. have already presented themselves as a willing partner, and Bayonne provides an important case study. Its arrangement is one of a handful of deals across the country in the last few years in which private equity firms have managed public water systems. While these deals are a small corner of private equity’s sprawling interests, they represent the leading edge of the industry’s profound expansion into public services. For residents, the financial   from these water deals can be painful. The Times analyzed three deals in which private equity firms have recently run a community’s water or sewer services through a   contract. In all three places  —   Bayonne, and two cities in California, Rialto and Santa Paula  —   rates rose more quickly than in comparable towns, which included both publicly and privately run water systems. In Santa Paula, where Alinda Capital Partners controlled the sewer plant, the city more than doubled the rates. A fourth municipality, Middletown, Pa. raised its rates before striking a deal. Now, some of these cities are trying to take back their water. Missoula, Mont. wrested away its water system, which had been owned by the Carlyle Group. Apple Valley, Calif. whose waterworks were also owned by Carlyle, has filed a similar lawsuit. Santa Paula bought its sewer plant from Alinda last year. Of course, there’s a reason many communities look for private partners to begin with: Their water systems are in poor shape. Budget shortfalls and political mismanagement can represent a real threat to both infrastructure and citizens. For evidence, look no further than the crisis in Flint, Mich. where the drinking water became tainted with lead. “Keeping rates down may sound like the ultimate righteous good for ratepayers, but the truth is, not if you’re failing to provide basic care and maintenance,” said Megan Matson, a partner at Table Rock Capital, the boutique private equity firm that invested in Rialto’s water and sewer system. She added that it helps for deals to “provide more obvious public benefits,” noting that her firm partnered with Ullico, the nation’s only   insurance and investment company. Proponents of the   partnerships, citing recent studies in Canada and Europe, argue that private businesses operate more efficiently than governments do and that this translates into cost savings for citizens. And private equity firms, lacking technical expertise in how to manage infrastructure, often team up with private water companies. Supporters also say that the deals require private equity to spend millions of dollars a year to fix things (money that towns may not spend on their own) and that the firms sometimes pay towns millions more up front. Bayonne, for instance, got $150 million up front from K. K. R. ’s team, which the city used to pay off a pile of debt. In a statement, a K. K. R. spokeswoman said, “Our partnership has provided Bayonne residents with better service, modernized technology to detect leaks and conserve water, improved infrastructure and safer conditions for workers  —   all without a tax increase or public expenditure. ” In Bayonne, a city of about 65, 000 on a peninsula in the shadow of the fallen twin towers, a crucial test for its private equity deal came in July 2012. By then, Bayonne had already spent nearly a year haggling with some of K. K. R. ’s top negotiators. Next, city officials presented the deal to a more skeptical crowd: their own residents. Bayonne’s sales pitch to its citizens illustrates the bold steps town officials can take  —   including making promises that are at odds with the actual terms of the deal  —   to attract private equity money. Private equity, in turn, can earn significant returns. At a public meeting in city hall, a lawyer for the city promised that, after an initial rate bump, there would be “a rate freeze for four years,” according to a meeting transcript. Bayonne’s mayor, Mark Smith, later reiterated the   freeze in a magazine article. That promise turned out to be fleeting. The contract allowed additional rate increases after only two years. There was no   freeze. In fact, rates rose even more than the Bayonne contract predicted  —   in part because K. K. R’s team had to make unexpected infrastructure upgrades, but also because residents were using less water than expected. The contract guarantees revenue to the team  —   more than half a billion dollars over 40 years  —   so water rates have jumped, in part, to make up the difference. The city said it saw the revenue requirement as a way for K. K. R. ’s team to earn steady returns, but not a windfall. But the Times analysis showed that Bayonne’s water rates grew almost 28 percent under the deal, growth that far exceeded that of three other municipalities to which Bayonne has compared itself. (Daniel Van Abs, an associate professor at Rutgers University who specializes in water management, said that a true    comparison of water rates in different towns was “extremely difficult” because of the different factors that can influence rates, including the size of the utility, the municipality’s population, droughts and infrastructure investment  —   or lack thereof. The Times analysis for Bayonne did not include sewer rates.) Former Bayonne officials who had promised the   rate freeze said in interviews that they had not meant to mislead residents. They said they had earmarked some of the K. K. R. team’s $150 million   payment to offset rate increases in the contract’s early years. But then voters ousted Mayor Smith. And once he left office, the new administration put that money elsewhere. “I think we could have accomplished that   minimum,” the former mayor said in an interview. The town’s water rates, he said, are now “exorbitant. ” Tim Boyle, who took over Bayonne’s utilities authority after Mr. Smith was voted out of office, said that various regulations required the city to use that money for property tax relief rather than to stabilize rates. He also blamed the previous administration for guaranteeing too much revenue to K. K. R. ’s team in the early part of the deal, calling those figures “wildly optimistic. ” Bayonne officials also stress the deal’s benefits, including the   payment that let Bayonne pay off more than $100 million in old debts. Within three months, Moody’s Investor Service revised the city’s debt outlook from “negative” to “stable” for the first time in five years, and it has since upgraded the city’s credit rating. K. K. R. ’s team contributes about $2. 5 million annually to pay for repairs to water infrastructure, plus $500, 000 to the city itself. K. K. R. and Suez said they have upgraded their safety equipment and replaced inoperable hydrants around town. They also installed sophisticated water meters that can detect leaks in people’s homes, and sent nearly 2, 000 letters to customers warning when such leaks occurred. As such, use has declined, according to Mr. Henning, who said Suez had received “many notes of thanks” for the warnings. But   meters could lead to higher bills for some residents whose water use wasn’t fully captured in the past. When negotiating the deal, K. K. R. called this process “meter uplift,” according to emails obtained through records requests. “We gave away too much,” said Gary La Pelusa Sr. a city councilman and former commissioner of Bayonne’s utilities authority, which approved the deal over his objections. Bayonne originally promised residents that the city’s utilities authority would oversee K. K. R. and Suez. But the City Council recently decided to shutter the agency and handle the oversight itself. Stephen Gallo, who headed that authority when the deal was struck, still believes that it benefits Bayonne. “But you’ve got to watch them, you’ve got to keep an eye on things,” he said. “I don’t know who’s doing that now. ” In interviews with The Times, more than a dozen Bayonne residents, including Ms. Adamczyk, expressed dismay over the rate increases. One reason is that people who fall behind on payments face   risks: Unpaid water and sewer bills can be sold to investors who try to collect on that debt, a common practice across the country. Failure to pay can ultimately lead to foreclosure. In 2012, the year Bayonne struck its deal, water bill delinquencies led to 200 government liens against local properties, tax records show. That figure more than tripled the next year, the first full year under K. K. R. ’s team. In 2015, the most recent year with data available, the number remained elevated, at 465. The city publishes its lien notices in the local newspaper and residents receive mailed delinquency letters. Still, when a reporter asked one Bayonne resident, Carlos Jimenez, about a water and sewer bill lien that had been listed against his property, he expressed surprise, saying he wasn’t aware of it. “I didn’t know this could happen,” Mr. Jimenez said. “It’s a different ballgame. ” One of the few things Republicans and Democrats can agree on is that the nation faces an infrastructure crisis. In water infrastructure alone, the nation needs about $600 billion over the next 20 years, according to federal estimates. And yet federal spending on water utilities has declined, prompting state and federal officials to try to play matchmaker, courting private investors to fix what needs fixing. For years, the Obama administration has been cheerleading   partnerships. In a statement, the White House said it backed them “when they are well structured, include strong labor standards, and when there is confidence that taxpayers are getting a good deal. ” During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s team outlined a new plan to incentivize private investors to take on large infrastructure projects. Wall Street has responded to the call to action. There are now 84 active financial infrastructure funds, according to Pitchbook, a private financial data platform, up 25 percent in just three years. Some belong to big banks like Goldman Sachs, but many are run by private equity firms. “Across our country, we need solutions for infrastructure deficiencies,” said James Maloney, a spokesman for the American Investment Council, the private equity trade group. “Private equity serves as one of these solutions. ” Some critics are wary of expanding private investment in public infrastructure. Although cities may get cash up front in these deals, “there is no ‘free’ money” in   partnerships, says a 2008 Government Accountability Office report. Using roads as an example, the report observed “it is likely” that tolls will increase more on a privately operated highway than one run by the government. Ms. Matson, of Table Rock, who has attended White House meetings on infrastructure, has tried to dispel concerns about these deals. Table Rock is part of a team that finances and manages the water system in Rialto, Calif. a deal that provided the city about $41 million to improve the water and wastewater infrastructure, she said. Rialto residents have seen their water rates increase about 68 percent since the deal, according to the Times analysis, more than any other comparable city. But Table Rock said rates were artificially low after the city had declined to raise them for about a decade, giving it the lowest rates among those towns. And unlike in most other deals, Rialto residents had a say in the increases and ultimately approved them in a public vote, as required under state law. This year’s rate increase was delayed. When the deal closed in 2012, all the public water utility employees kept their jobs. Everyone has since received raises. And Table Rock, like its partner Ullico, has committed to all 30 years of the arrangement. “We don’t do flips, we invest for life,” Ms. Matson said, meaning that Table Rock doesn’t seek quick profits by unloading its investments. She also said that Table Rock declined to make deals that provided big   payments to towns without a sufficient commitment to infrastructure repairs. “Those deals give the rest of us a bad name,” she said. In an upscale Washington, D. C. restaurant in 2012, an executive from the Carlyle Group, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, put his arm around the mayor of Missoula, Mont. “Mayor,” the executive said, “are you ready to buy a water system?” Three years later, the comments by the executive, Robert Dove, were recounted from a witness stand in the Missoula County Courthouse. The city was suing Carlyle, which ultimately refused to sell to Missoula, to gain control of its water system. Missoula is one of several places in recent years that have tried getting back their water systems from a private company. But after waging costly battles, the towns cannot always guarantee the same services at lower rates. At the time of that dinner in Washington, Missoula was the only city in Montana that did not own its water system  —   and John Engen, Missoula’s mayor, wanted to change that. So, months before, he had supported Carlyle’s purchase of the regional water company (Park Water) that owned Missoula’s local system (Mountain Water) believing that Carlyle would then sell Mountain Water back to his town. But the mayor’s plans derailed. In October 2013, Missoula made an informal offer to buy its local system. Carlyle declined. Missoula made a formal offer. Carlyle declined again. Missoula then sued, and it won. But the court decided the system was worth $88. 6 million, substantially more than what the city had offered. On top of that, the city must spend millions of dollars on legal and other fees and must also pay some of its opponents’ costs, according to court records. Those costs included lawyers’ fees, limo services and dinners at some of Missoula’s finest restaurants. They also included at least one order of boneless chicken wings at Hooters, and one bottle of Metamucil. In a statement, a Carlyle spokesman said that the firm had considered the city’s offers in good faith. “The city offered many millions less than the company was worth, and an independent panel agreed,” the spokesman said. He also said that under Carlyle’s watch, “capital expenditures more than doubled, leakage was reduced by 19 percent, water quality was excellent and employment was stable. ” And under Missoula’s watch, water rates may rise anyway. Further costly repairs are still needed, for one thing. For Carlyle, the deal was a financial success. The firm sold Park Water in January to another private company for $327 million, more than double what Carlyle had paid. Missoula is not the only city seeking control over its infrastructure. Last year, Santa Paula bought its wastewater recycling plant for about $70 million from Alinda Capital Partners. Alinda, which specializes in infrastructure investing, had teamed up with a private water recycling company to finance, design, build and operate the plant after the city awarded them the contract in 2008. The new facility, Alinda noted, replaced an old plant owned by Santa Paula that had been violating state environmental regulations, saving the city from paying fines. But after years of raising sewer rates, partly to pay “service fees” to Alinda, Santa Paula’s thinking changed: It would be better for Santa Paula to issue its own debt to purchase the plant than to saddle citizens with annual rate increases. Now the town  —   at the urging of its city manager, Jaime Fontes, and several council members, including Ginger Gherardi  —   has started issuing rebates to citizens. Still, there will be bumps along the road. After all, cities like Missoula and Santa Paula are now responsible for running an important, and occasionally messy, public service. Soon after Santa Paula regained control of its sewer plant, an equipment failure let partly treated wastewater pour from the plant. The discharge turned a pond green and flowed onto a nearby organic farm. And wastewater, Mr. Fontes said, is “not the kind of organic you want. ”",0
7027,Comment on Links 10/29/16 by jgordon,"Computer seized in Weiner probe prompts FBI to take new steps in Clinton email inquiry Washington Post 
Read the letter Comey sent to FBI employees explaining his controversial decision on the Clinton email investigation Washington Post. Consistent with my pet theory that Comey was force to get out in front of this development due to the odds of staff insurrection in the form of leaks. From Lambert via e-mail: 
By Comey’s own words under oath in July, there must have been “new and substantial information.” So unless Comey is committing perjury, which the Clinton campaign has not, so far, claimed, this is not a nothingburger, by definition. 
So that must have been quite some “briefing.” 
Also: “Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case. Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.” 
So there’s a process, it doubtless takes more than a week, and therefore the Clinton campaign’s talking point of “We don’t know what’s there, so release it all for the sake of the American people” is bullshit, even if you leave out that the emails can’t be released without vetting them for classified information. 
Also, if it’s really nasty, do the people the Democrats encouraged to vote early get a Mulligan? 
Clinton urges FBI to explain renewed email inquiry ‘without delay’ Washington Post. As if the FBI has to explain itself to her? 
Democrats turn on Comey after he reopens Clinton email wound Politico. How fickle of them. He was their statesman just a few weeks ago…My guess is that Comey told Congress because so many agents in the FBI were unhappy about how the earlier probe had been handled and the the news of the latest batch of e-mails was already all over the FIB (a Freudian typo). Thus Comey felt he had to go public, since it would otherwise be leaked and he judged that to be worse (imagine the wrath of the Republican Congresscritters)

The   PolitiFact  —   which became part of Facebook’s “fact checking” team tasked to label “fake news” stories as they appear on the social media platform  —   uncovered McDaniel’s website while flagging fake news.

7029,Facebook Closes Hundreds of Oculus VR Demo Stations - Breitbart,"Oculus Rift “ ” demonstrating the VR headset are shutting down in the hundreds after a lack of public interest has left some of them empty for days at a time. [Nearly half of   demonstrations at Best Buy of the   Oculus Rift are being axed because of “store performance,” according to an internal memo from a   contractor. Oculus spokeswoman Andrea Schubert, however, chalked the dramatic cuts up to “seasonal changes. ”  But even during the height of the holiday season, Best Buy’s designated “Oculus Ambassadors” counted themselves lucky to sell a few units during a week of the otherwise bustling shopping season. Several Best Buy   employees told Business Insider that “it was common for them to go days without giving a single demonstration. ” Nevertheless, Schubert said that Oculus “still [believes] the best way to learn about VR is through a live demo” and asserted that the company is looking for “opportunities to do regular events and  ” in both retail locations and within communities. According to Best Buy, the lack of demo stations won’t stop them from selling the Rift or its peripherals. It was a much more reserved statement than CEO Hubert Joly’s original pitch last year of a “cool and fun” experience with the potential to contribute to Best Buy’s growth as a whole. It sounds like Zuckerberg’s prediction that Oculus “won’t be profitable for a while” is ringing all too true.

7030,’Manchester’: The Missing Word in the Fourth Circuit’s Ruling - Breitbart,"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refused Thursday to overturn fully a lower court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s new executive order suspending travel from several   countries. [The opinion and dissents cover 205 pages. (The list of supporting briefs from   organizations takes up two pages by itself.) But amidst the arguments, there is a key word missing from the entire document: “Manchester. ”  The opinion of the court was clearly written before Monday evening’s horrific terror attack. And while court rulings do not generally follow current events, the way those rulings are received by the public is affected by the context. The Manchester attack makes the case for Trump’s executive order. True, the terrorist was a British citizen, and so he would not have been stopped by a similar executive order, had one hypothetically existed the United Kingdom. However, the bomber had traveled to Syria and Libya, two of the countries identified by the order as places where terror is rampant and whose governments lack the ability to vouch for their citizens at foreign ports of entry. The fact that those countries were relevant to the Manchester attacks boosts the administration’s argument that it needs to review its procedures for screening foreigners from   countries to prevent enemies from infiltrating. What the Fourth Circuit’s decision essentially says is that President Donald Trump is uniquely unable to make any decisions on immigration policy because of things he said about Muslim and Islam during the 2016 campaign. In other words, the judiciary wants to disarm America in the face of a spreading global threat. The timing could not have been worse, and this decision is likely to provoke more of a public backlash than any that have preceded it. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

7031,Trudeau Sends Cabinet Officials to ’Make Friends’ in DC Ahead of Trump Meeting Monday,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tasked a number of his cabinet officials with traveling to Washington to meet their counterparts in the Trump administration in anticipation of a    meeting between the two leaders. [Trudeau’s overtures to the White House follow a month in which his personal approval ratings have plummeted following a series of ethics scandals and embarrassing public appearances before hostile audiences during a nationwide town hall tour.  Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan all visited Washington this week. Freeland met her U. S. counterpart Rex Tillerson and reportedly used the occasion to object to a hypothetical tariff on Canadian goods. Freeland’s office also recently opened a special unit for bilateral relations with Washington, CBC reports, at Trudeau’s behest. On the same day Freeland met Tillerson, Sajjan met with Defense Secretary James Mattis to discuss “ethics in soldiering. ” Sajjan did not expand upon the topics of conversation, lending only his support to the U. S. government and dismissing a question about President Donald Trump’s ability to handle a crisis by noting that he is the legitimate president of the United States. Morneau, meanwhile, arrived in Washington on Wednesday and is currently speaking at Georgetown University. The meetings are all intended to lay the groundwork for Trudeau and Trump to meet and discuss policy in person  —   and, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr told reporters Wednesday, “to make friends” with the Americans. The     meeting is scheduled to take place on Monday, according to both the White House and the Prime Minister’s Office. Trudeau has a hefty travel schedule before him for next week  —   the Prime Minister is also expected to travel to France and Germany and deliver an address to the European Parliament. Trudeau will also meet with German chancellor Angela Merkel. Trudeau has yet to establish a concrete relationship with Trump and instead has used the President’s policies to promote his own leftist agenda. Following President Trump’s signing of an executive order limiting refugee flows from   nations, Trudeau posted on Twitter that Canada would take in those rejected by the United States. Trudeau’s confrontational Tweet did not match Canada’s record of rejecting hundreds of foreign nationals in 2016 for a variety of national security reasons. Trudeau’s approach also does not seem to match what Canadians are seeking from him as prime minister. A poll by the firm Mainstreet Research released this week found that over half of Canadians approve of President Trump’s national security policy, compared to only 39 percent who approve of Trudeau’s. Similarly, the poll found 53 percent of Canadian respondents supported Trump’s approach to the economy, compared to 41 percent for Trudeau. Trudeau’s meeting with Trump will follow a tumultuous January that saw the Prime Minister’s national approval ratings drop under 50 percent for the first time since he assumed the top government office. Following several public blunders, including praising Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and attempting to hide a lavish New Year’s vacation in the Bahamas, Trudeau went on a nationwide tour to speak to Canadian audiences. Upon arriving in Calgary, the crowd loudly booed the prime minister and accused him of lying to the Canadian people on energy policy. Trudeau is currently undergoing an unprecedented ethics investigation for the Bahamas vacation, in which he accepted a ride on a private helicopter owned by the head of the Ismaili sect of Islam, the Aga Khan. Accepting such free private transportation is a violation of both Liberal Party ethics guidelines and the Canadian government’s ethics rules.",0

7033,"Echoing a Film Plot, Chinese Gangs Kill Drifters in an Elaborate Mining Ruse - The New York Times","SHISUN VILLAGE, China  —   The three miners befriended a lonely, luckless man and offered him work down an iron mine in eastern China. After working together for 10 days, the three pushed a   boulder down a steep tunnel, crushing the man to death. They reported it as an accident. Days later, three men and a woman turned up at the mine, saying they were the dead man’s relatives and demanding compensation. The mine owner offered them $110, 000 if they agreed not to report the death to officials. Prosecutors and the police now say that this death, in Shandong Province in 2014, was one of many in which a sophisticated network of grifters dispatched isolated,   men, some mentally impaired, and dressed up their deaths as accidents to swindle compensation from mine owners. The investigation led the police to Shisun Village in southwestern China, where mine murders for cash appear to have become a cottage industry. Of the 74 suspects indicted in late May in 17 killings, up to 40 were from Shisun Village, prosecutors said. The police said they were still investigating reports of 35 more possible victims. But Shisun is not the only place where such cases have cropped up. A search of court judgments online and news reports of court verdicts turns up dozens of instances across China of gangs killing vagrants and workers in dark, isolated chambers far underground, and using the deaths to defraud mine owners. There have been at least 34 such cases over the past two decades, Caijing Magazine, a prominent business weekly, estimated in June. The allegations have prompted anguished debate across China about the social and legal failings that led people to make a living by murdering vulnerable strangers, and fanned speculation about whether the crimes were inspired by a bleak cult movie with a similar plot. Shisun is a hardscrabble,   farming village of 5, 000 people nestled in the     hills of Yunnan Province. Many villagers work in factories and on building sites in distant provinces, leaving farming and child care to aging parents and grandparents. Those who stay behind often live in crumbling homes of mud and wood. But on the main street, rows of   concrete houses suggest budding prosperity. Wang Fuxiang owns one of those houses, as well as a restaurant in a nearby city. With his dapper suits and loud, casual wear, the kind seen more often on suburban golfers than on dirt farmers, Mr. Wang, 39, appeared to be among the lucky few who had escaped the hard life. But it did not go unnoticed that Mr. Wang and several other villagers would abruptly disappear for days, weeks or months, and return flush with cash, which they often squandered on gambling binges, neighbors recalled. Some thought the men might be selling drugs. “He never told me what he did,” said Mr. Wang’s daughter, Hu Yun, 17. Nor, apparently, did she try to pin him down on the question. About two years ago, she started to sense that something was amiss. “I began to get the feeling that there was something not right about the way he’d been making money,” she said recently in an interview at her home. A   farmer who lived nearby was blunter. Asking that his name not be used for fear of recriminations, he wrote a letter in case he was ever asked about the cases, which said, “There are eight homes in this little village that have been built from human blood. ” The mystery began to unravel two years ago, when the Yunnan police received an anonymous message saying that the man killed in the Shandong iron mine had been working under another man’s identity. (The victim’s real identity, if it has been determined, has not been announced.) Another mine killing late that year in Inner Mongolia, a region of northern China, also left clues pointing to Shisun Village and nearby areas. Detectives descended on Shisun and began questioning villagers. What they found were organized gangs devoted to serial killing for cash. Some participants recruited and killed the victims, having won their cooperation by promising good wages, friendship, even marriage. Others posed as the grieving family members who turned up at the mine to demand compensation, the police have said. The gangs disguised the identities of their victims, using stolen or bought identity papers that they persuaded or tricked victims into using, ensuring that their real families would not learn of their fate. Most victims were quickly cremated by their fake families, making identification even harder and erasing clues about their deaths. Discovery is further complicated because the families of marginalized drifters are unlikely to file a   report. Even if they did, they would be unlikely to know when or where the men had last been seen alive  —   or when simply being out of touch had turned into their being missing or dead. The other side of the equation that kept the business humming is the mine owners, who paid handsome sums to the impostor families in order to keep the deaths quiet. If a fatal accident were reported, the owners feared, safety regulators would shut down the mine for months while they investigated, several mine owners told the police after the killings came to light. If these killings sound like the plot of a thriller, that may be no coincidence. A similar case inspired the 2003 film “Blind Shaft,” a Chinese drama about two men who kill fellow miners for their compensation. In what seems to be an endless loop of life imitating art imitating life, some officials have said that the movie became an instruction manual for the recent killings. “Some viewers saw the film ‘Blind Shaft’ and found a way to get rich,” the township government that oversees Shisun Village said in a notice posted outside the village committee office. “The culprits showed no compassion at all for life, and in particular kin and friends who were mentally impaired became assets used to make money. ” The movie’s director, Li Yang, dismissed as “ridiculous” the idea that suspects in isolated corners of the countryside had seen his film. Because of its grim plot, the Chinese authorities banned the film before it was released, and it has rarely been seen except by urban film enthusiasts. Even Mr. Li had difficulty tracking down bootleg DVDs of it, he said. Still, many people have heard of the movie, and when the cases started coming to light, they were immediately described as “Blind Shaft killings. ” Similar cases first entered China’s national consciousness in the late 1990s, when a gang with dozens of members was convicted of killing 28 migrant workers in Shanxi Province. Those killings inspired the movie, Mr. Li said. Since then, the Blind Shaft scheme has been firmly implanted in the national psyche of a country peppered with thousands of notoriously dangerous mines. Most likely, the Shisun gang heard of it by word of mouth. According to available court records, the pace of such killings appears to have picked up in recent years, possibly because compensation payments have grown. As China’s regulators have clamped down on mine safety, driving down the number of accidents, the stricter regulation has perversely encouraged some mine operators to hide fatalities and pay off victims’ families, increasing the incentive to carry out the crimes. In 2011, nine men from Leibo County in Sichuan Province were convicted of similar crimes, and the police said gangs from there had committed at least 20 murders in mines. In 2014, 21 defendants were convicted in Handan, northern China, of killing four migrant workers in faked mine accidents. Last year, 10 men were convicted in the Ningxia region of killing five people in the same way. The recent killings have veered from the movie version in at least one conspicuous way. In the movie, the killers extorted 30, 000 renminbi, or about $4, 475 at today’s rates, in hush money for one death. The Shisun Village gangs extracted payments of $75, 000 to $120, 000 from mine bosses, according to news reports. If he were to remake the film today, Mr. Li said in a telephone interview, “it wouldn’t have anything different, except the amounts of money scammed would be larger and the perpetrators would be gangs. ” The charges against the Shisun suspects include homicide, faking accidents, swindling compensation, fraud and hiding crimes, though the police have not said publicly who is being charged with what. Long prison terms, and death sentences for the ringleaders, are likely, if similar cases are a guide. Chinese courts almost invariably convict, and the suspects have not been allowed to publicly answer the charges. Mr. Wang was arrested early last year. His daughter, Ms. Hu, now acknowledges that he may have innocent blood on his hands. “I think he did do something, but I don’t blame him,” she said. “He was doing it so that we could live a better life. ”",0

7038,New Rules May Curb Classroom Cupcakes - The New York Times,"The season of    classroom holiday parties is upon us. And while some parents see all the cake, candy and salty snacks as a harmless indulgence during a festive season, others object to any unhealthy food in the classroom. Now the federal government is stepping in to help address the issue of classroom food. Federal school nutrition rules from the Department of Agriculture approved this past summer now require school districts participating in federal lunch or breakfast programs to come up with a nutritional standard for all foods and drinks offered to children at school, including those served by parents at classroom parties and treats awarded by teachers as prizes for a correct answer. The new standards won’t go into effect until the   school year, but right now, school district wellness committees around the country are debating which foods and drinks, if any, should be barred at the classroom door. While it’s too soon to say how most districts will respond to the federal mandate, there’s room for improvement in many classrooms. According to a national survey of school district wellness policies conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, most districts don’t have standards for the foods and drinks served at classroom parties. Although nearly one in four districts discourage teachers from giving food as a reward, only 13 percent prohibit the practice. One option for districts is to simply adopt the   “Smart Snacks” rules that govern snacks and drinks sold to children through vending machines and school  . The rules went into effect in 2014, and are familiar territory to most school districts. Adopting the Smart Snacks rules for classroom food would also steer parents toward   items instead of homemade, reducing the risk of harm to   children. “Many will use Smart Snacks because that’s what they’re used to,” said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. But depending on a given community’s nutritional ethos, the Smart Snacks rules could be seen as too lenient or too stringent. Unless otherwise exempted, homemade birthday cupcakes would be out, but many highly processed snacks, including some with considerable amounts of added sugar, would still be permissible. For instance, a Trix cereal bar, with 150 calories and more than 50 percent whole grain oats, would pass muster, even though the second and third ingredients are corn syrup and sugar. At the other end of the spectrum, districts could set a lax standard that intentionally does little or nothing to change the status quo. After the Smart Snacks rules were adopted, for instance, some states took advantage of a loophole to allow frequent sales of junk food for school   to continue. But that may not happen this time, since the federal rules require a wide range of stakeholders, including parents, to participate in the drafting process. “Wellness policies won’t be decided by the state, but instead by local committees that will include teachers, school officials and members of the community,” Ms. Wootan said. The new federal rules do require each school to appoint a staff member to help oversee the new healthy eating rules. And while states will audit a district’s wellness policy every three years, they will review only a district’s goals and its plan to implement them. In other words, says Ms. Wootan, “They won’t be going into every classroom on Halloween to see what’s happening. ” Parents can also have a voice in decisions made at their child’s school. Individual schools have the option to institute classroom policies that are stricter than their district’s standard. “If parents at a given school really want to take this issue on, they could,” Ms. Wootan said. The National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity has created a useful clearinghouse of wellness policy guidance and resources from leading public health organizations. Jodi Helman, who used to live in Stamford, Conn. said she believes more rules are needed. She said her daughter’s previous elementary school took a decidedly lax approach to classroom food. “The amount of junk food was outrageous,” she recalls. “Candy was given out daily as rewards. The classrooms would have at least one party a week, sometimes two if it fell during a holiday. ” But her family recently moved to Barrington, R. I. where their new school has “a   policy” toward unhealthy food in the classroom. “No candy rewards, no cupcakes for birthdays, no holiday parties with food,” she says. “The kids in Barrington live a healthy lifestyle, without even knowing it. ”",0
7039,The ‘victorious’ legacy of the Vietnam War,"The ‘victorious’ legacy of the Vietnam War By Emanuel E. Garcia, MD 
“What’s he talking about?” you might be thinking, “didn’t America lose the war?” 
I guess it all depends on how you look at it. 
Sure, over 58,000 American soldiers perished , with many more wounded, and over a million Vietnamese fighters and civilians , according to the best estimates, died. And although there is some uncertainty about the actual number of Vietnamese casualties, one thing is certain: their names are not engraved on the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, DC—an omission which brings “irony” to unimaginable heights. Surely the Vietnamese, whose country committed no infringement against the United States, and whose people were slaughtered whether they took up arms to defend their territory or merely attempted to ply their rice paddies—deserved some acknowledgment. 
Nevertheless, narrative has it that the war—or, since there was never any formal declaration of war, I should more properly say ‘conflict’—was lost and that American pride and the American military and, according to some, the American psyche, suffered a terrible blow. 
But in one respect the Vietnamese entanglement proved to have an enduring and efficiently victorious legacy, a legacy moreover that informs the recent escapades in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and the so-called ‘war on terror’. 
To explain what I mean, I have to meander a bit into the terrain of human psychology and war, guided by a remarkable book: Lt. Col. Dave Grossman’s On Killing . Grossman makes two cogent observations: (1) there exists even on the fields of war a very powerful and innate human resistance against killing, which armies throughout the centuries have fought to diminish, and (2) it was in Vietnam that the American soldier was “psychologically enabled to kill to a far greater degree than any other soldier in history.” 
People, generally speaking, do not kill easily. Soldiers throughout history have had a hard time killing face to face and very often turned their weapons away. Only an extremely and brutally efficient methodology of deconditioning, which made its appearance in Vietnam, could result in vastly higher ‘kill rates’. In other words, the more distant and dehumanised the enemy is made to seem, the less resistance there is to murder. 
Vietnam, therefore, heralded a great victory of mechanised death and destruction over the inner humanity of individuals; and those techniques, we can be sure, have only been fortified since then by the increasing reliance on long-range bombing, video-game-like machinations from far away, by the rendering of individual human beings who bleed and laugh and cry and suffer into anonymous digits or blips. 
So on the one hand, it is a wonderful thing to realise that even in the bloodiest times of war, humankind has struggled to kill at close quarters—that, in fact, no matter how much we are inundated by the press and by the purveyors of violent war games, killing is no easy thing. More often than not, even in the great battles between recalcitrant adversaries, compassion showed its presence. 
But compassion seems to have no place in, for example, drone-assassination campaigns that have been ‘legitimised’ by an onslaught of propaganda, with victims that are merely insignificant dots. Killing has been perfected, as it were. 
Indeed, now that I think of it, the irony of the Vietnam War Memorial is no match for the irony inherent in the fact that the man who has won a Nobel Prize for Peace is the very same individual who has presided over an assassination programme whose distinction is as a kind of apex of dehumanised murder. 
I hope for a greater victory, however: one that awaits those who fight not against other men and women, but against the organised forces and practices that seek to abolish our humanity by digitising, anonymizing and atomising us when our great and truer essences cry out for love, connection and community.

7040,"Brooks: ’It Was Incumbent Upon the US’ to Act In Syria, ’There Is Some Upside’ to an Unpredictable POTUS - Breitbart","On Friday’s broadcast of “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks praised the Syria strike by saying “it was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used. ” And “there is some upside to having somebody who’s a little unpredictable. ”  Brooks said, “The question what’s next strikes me as a secondary question. The primary question is, what are we going to do about chemical warfare? A hundred years ago, right now, World War I was going on, and there were people were being gassed in the trenches. And the fact that the world community has basically tried to eliminate chemical weapons since that time strikes me as a great achievement. And to go back on that would be a great step backward for civilization. And Barack Obama, unfortunately, didn’t do anything when chemical weapons were used. So, I think it was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used. ” He continued, “Does this signal some grand change of strategy in the Middle East? I sort of doubt it. But at least we set this precedent on this particular issue. Now, the question  —   I think it was probably totally impulsive of President Trump to do this. He’s an impulsive person, and we’re stuck the downsides of his impulsivity. But there are upsides to having an impulsive president because nobody in the world, and especially in places like North Korea, quite knows what’s going to happen. And so, frankly, there are some advantages to that. ” Brooks later added, “I would rather have a strategy, obviously. But I’m just pointing out there is some upside to having somebody who’s a little unpredictable.   …     I suspect it was a   case  …    but I think it was the right   thing to do. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
7041,Aristocracy’s Immunity From Prosecution Disturbs TARP’s I.G.,"Posted on October 26, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse For the very first time, on October 25th, a high federal official, the “SIGTARP” or Special Inspector General for the TARP program that bailed out the largest financial institutions and their top investors after the 2008 economic crash, is now making a specific proposal to hold the top-level crooks accountable for the incentive-systems they had put into place motivating their employees to pump-and-dump ‘investments’ during the growth-phase of the ‘free market’ Ponzi game that existed since 2000 when the end of the FDR-era Glass-Steagall Act and the start of totally unregulated financial marketeering went wild after 2005 and came crashing down in 2008. Despite the deregulation that Bill Clinton and George W. Bush (and both political parties in Congress) instituted, there still remained on the books some laws that high financial executives were breaking, but the SIGTARP has now come to an impasse in trying to obtain the evidence that will enable investigations to proceed against the top executives, and so she is coming out to urge cooperation of the rest of the government in order to enable it to happen. The SIGTARP, Christy Goldsmith Romero, urges : A PROPOSAL TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE “INSULATED CEO” I propose that Congress remove the insulation around Wall Street CEOs and other high-level officials by requiring the CEO, CFO and certain other senior executives to sign an annual certification that they have conducted due diligence within their organization and can certify that that there is no criminal conduct or civil fraud in their organization. According to a Reuters report from Patrick Rucker, titled “Wall St. Rescue Fund Watchdog Says U.S. Bank Heads Too Insulated” , “Wall Street executives are too shielded from prosecution and should answer for misdeeds committed by underlings, the watchdog for a multibillion-dollar [federal-government] bailout [of the mega-banks] said on Wednesday.” This article, dated Wednesday October 25th, continued: “Senior banking officials should attest each year that their companies are free of criminal fraud and civil abuse, said Christy Goldsmith Romero, special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ‘Every executive should be able to conduct due diligence,’ she told Reuters in an interview. ‘If they are too big to do that, then they are too big, period.’” That policy, if honestly placed into practice, would likely result in lengthy prison terms for many of the people who are the big-dollar political donors; and so it can’t possibly happen. But the very fact that someone in a federal-government capacity has finally said publicly that it needs to happen is shocking enough. The article continues: “U.S. taxpayers have invested more than $400 billion since the crisis, mostly in large Wall Street banks. Goldsmith Romero leads a staff of roughly 140 investigators examining possible abuse of the TARP program.” Romero on Wednesday sent to Congress her agency’s 550-page investigative report (not linked-to by Reuters but here ) on that subject, and Rucker continued: “Goldsmith Romero said the report also described cases where executives are complicit in fraud but the highest-ranking officials are walled off. ‘The knowledge stops,’ she said. ‘It resides at lower levels and stops there. And in many cases, I think that’s by intentional design.’” The reporter, Mr. Rucker, makes clear how grave this situation really is: “Goldsmith Romero has never before suggested a reform of the financial system. She said that she felt compelled to speak up this time after facing so many cases where senior executives seemed out of reach from prosecutions.” So: although the aristocrats’ immunity will not be removed, a federal official has now had the courage to state that it must be removed. Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator who held off from making any endorsement during the Presidential primaries, is now campaigning for Hillary Clinton to become President — the same candidate that Wall Street executives are overwhelmingly funding to win the Presidency — but Warren is already verbally supportive of what Romero is urging. On September 15th, David Dayen at The Intercept bannered, “Elizabeth Warren Asks Newly Chatty FBI Director to Explain Why DOJ Didn’t Prosecute Banksters” , and he reported that on that day: “Warren released two highly provocative letters demanding some explanations. One is to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, requesting a review of how federal law enforcement managed to whiff on all 11 substantive criminal referrals submitted by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), a panel set up to examine the causes of the 2008 meltdown. The other is to FBI Director James Comey, asking him to release all FBI investigations and deliberations related to those referrals.” Warren’s campaigning for Clinton, who has always been against accountability at the top in the U.S., is drastically inconsistent with this public display of supporting such accountability, and is therefore untrustworthy. I (who until now had always voted only for Democrats) earlier reported the fundamental dishonesty of the Democratic Party’s elite about precisely this matter: — Privately, Obama had told Wall Street executives that he would protect them. On 27 March 2009, Obama assembled the top executives of the bailed-out financial firms in a secret meeting at the White House and he assured them that he would cover their backs; he promised “My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks” . It’s not on the White House website; it was leaked out, which is one of the reasons Obama hates leakers (including such heroes as Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange). What the DOJ’s IG indicated was, in effect, that Obama had kept his secret promise to them. Here is the context in which Obama said that (from page 234 of Ron Suskind’s 2011 book, Confidence Men ): The CEOs went into their traditional stance. “It’s almost impossible to set caps [to their bonuses]; it’s never worked, and you lose your best people,” said one. “We’re competing for talent on an international market,” said another. Obama cut them off. “Be careful how you make those statements, gentlemen. The public isn’t buying that,” he said. “My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.” It was an attention grabber, no doubt, especially that carefully chosen last word. But then Obama’s flat tone turned to one of support, even sympathy. “You guys have an acute public relations problem that’s turning into a political problem,” he said. “And I want to help. But you need to show that you get that this is a crisis and that everyone has to make some sacrifices.” According to one of the participants, he then said, “I’m not out there to go after you. I’m protecting you. But if I’m going to shield you from public and congressional anger, you have to give me something to work with on these issues of compensation.” No suggestions were forthcoming from the bankers on what they might offer, and the president didn’t seem to be championing any specific proposals. He had none: neither Geithner nor Summers believed compensation controls had any merit. After a moment, the tension in the room seemed to lift: the bankers realized he was talking about voluntary limits on compensation until the storm of public anger passed. It would be for show. He had been lying to the public, all along. Not only would he not prosecute the banksters, but he would treat them as if all they had was “an acute public relations problem that’s turning into a political problem.” And he thought that the people who wanted them prosecuted were like the KKK who had chased Blacks with pitchforks before lynching. According to the DOJ , their Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) was “established by President Barack Obama in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes.” But, according to the Department’s IG , it was all a fraud: a fraud that according to the DOJ itself had been going on since at least November 2009. — If this matter that Romero is raising will be coming up during a Hillary Clinton Administration, the lying about it will simply continue, that’s all. Barack Obama is no less vicious a liar than Hillary Clinton is, but she’s not nearly as skillful a deceiver as he is, but that’s the only real difference between them. She’ll get the job done for the political megadonors, just the same, like she always has. However, if Donald Trump is to be President, then no one can intelligently say what his policy on accountability would be — other than that he’ll work with Congress to get an independent prosecutor to investigate the criminal allegations against Hillary Clinton, including the ones that the untrustworthy FBI alleges that it has already investigated in an impartial manner. Regarding the specific issue that Romero is implicitly also urging, the reinstatement of the FDR-era Glass-Steagall Act, which Bill Clinton and the Republicans terminated in 2000 and which had limited bank-size, Trump is on record as demanding that it be done . (That’s one of the reasons why he has been receiving far less from Wall Street than Hillary Clinton has been. Wall Street loathes Trump. Almost everything in this ‘election’ is nearly the opposite of what is commonly presumed.) For the first time in recent memory, there really is an important difference between the two major-Party Presidential candidates. The last time it happened was 2000, when the far-right candidate, George W. Bush ‘won’. This time around, it seems likely to be repeated (and maybe this time by a landslide): the far-right candidate Hillary Clinton will probably win — same result, just different nominal parties this time around. In an important sense, this year’s George W. Bush is Hillary Clinton. (He demanded regime-change in Iraq; she demands regime-change in Russia.) This year’s Al Gore is Donald Trump. Except that this time the big issue isn’t global warming, but instead nuclear war against Russia. Of course, GW Bush was bad on both issues (denying climate-change, and demanding “regime-change in Iraq” where the Moscow-friendly dictator Saddam Hussein ruled). But so too is Hillary (who followed up her ardent advocacy for regime-change in Iraq, by regime-change in Moscow-friendly Libya, and regime-change in Moscow-friendly Ukraine, and regime-change in Moscow-allied Syria; and who is now pushing for regime-change in Russia itself, and thus unchallenged U.S.-aristocracy control over every other nation’s aristocracy). All of this election-year, the supposedly big issue was bigotry, but the thing that’s actually destroying this country and the entire world is class — rich versus poor; the super-rich crushing everyone else — and the ‘news’ media are controlled not by the many poor but by the very few super-rich. And this is why Romero’s call for justice is, sadly, just a cry into the wind. Regarding politics, one has no reason to trust what one hears from the politicians, reads in the newspapers and magazines, or hears or sees on radio and TV. The elite scams are overwhelming from all of the Establishment sides. But finally, an obscure federal official, Ms. Romero, the SIGTARP, has spoken her conscience, despite knowing that she’ll only be punished for it once she’s out of office. Unlike the Democratic Party politicians, she’s not grandstanding. She’s instead truly heroic, speaking truth to power, and really meaning it — and ready to face the consequences for having done it. It’s remarkable. It’s Quixotic, in a really heroic way: pathbreaking, even if that path leads only to a brick wall. At least it will expose to the public the extent to which the system itself is their enemy. Not Mexicans. Not Blacks. Not Whites. Not Muslims. Not Christians. Not Jews. Not Russians. Not men. Not women. Not even (though bigots are dangerous fools) bigots against any such group. The system, right here in the U.S., needs to be changed. Nothing can authentically be blamed on any “not us” target — either for invasion, or otherwise. Romero wants to cancel the immunity of aristocrats — the people who control this country .",0
7042,Britain joins biggest European military buildup since Cold War,"RT October 27, 2016 
Britain is deploying troops, aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War. 
The deployment, which was first floated in the press by UK defense chiefs on Wednesday, appears to have been prepared well in advance. 
It will see up to 800 armored infantry troops deployed to Estonia and Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter jets deployed to Romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. 
France and Denmark will also commit more troops. 
On Wednesday, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon struck a belligerent tone in the Wall Street Journal when he warned that Europe “ is our continent ” and, as such, would be defended. 
While he claimed the force would be “ defensive in nature ” he pledged it would be “ fully combat-capable. ” A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
He denied the placement of small formations around the Baltic area are merely a “ trip-wire ” in case of the much-heralded, but hypothetical, clash with Russia. 
“ This is a serious military presence, ” he said. 
Tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of Russian naval vessels bound for the Mediterranean Sea passed through the North Sea and English Channel. 
The passage caused a press frenzy in the UK, framed as though Russia was launching an invasion of the British Isles. The Royal Navy deployed destroyers to, in Fallon’s words, “ man-mark ” the vessels while the RAF overflew the ships with fighter jets. 
According to the Russian military, the naval group’s task was to “ ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the world’s oceans, ” as well as “ the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities ” of Russia. 
Britain’s deployment of troops, drones and aircraft is expected to begin in May 2018. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:45 am Share this article",0
7043,"Mónica Puig, Puerto Rico’s Favorite Daughter (and Only Gold Medalist) - The New York Times","SAN JUAN, P. R.  —   Before she played in her last tennis tournament, Mónica Puig was pretty much like anyone else at San Juan International Airport. Her grandparents would drop her off curbside and she would wait at the gate area flipping though her phone just like anyone else, save for the occasional moments when someone recognized her and asked for a photo. But after her last tournament, at the Rio Olympics, no trip to Puerto Rico will be the same. When she landed at the airport this week, carrying the first Olympic gold medal in Puerto Rico’s history, she was met by thousands of cheering fans, a retinue of three beefy security guards and an escort of several police cars and motorcycles with lights flashing. As her motorcade drove through San Juan, people poured into the streets to greet her, even as it passed the hardscrabble Luis Llorens Torres housing project, where baseball and basketball players and boxers are usually the most idolized stars. But in the span of a week, Puig went from a   curiosity here  —   the girl born in San Juan who went to Miami and became a professional tennis player  —   to a hero, with the island’s first gold medal around her neck at age 22. “I was stunned,” Puig said in an interview at her San Juan hotel, about a mile from her grandmother’s apartment, where she spent summers as a girl. “The support I am getting here is just indescribable. I didn’t fully understand the weight of my actions until I got here. ” Puig’s impromptu parade from the airport was followed by an organized version through the streets of San Juan on Tuesday that drew thousands of supporters. It was intended to commemorate the efforts of the entire Puerto Rican Olympic squad, but without Puig, there would have been no parade. With the United States Open set to begin Monday, Puig had only a few days to soak in the appreciation of Puerto Rico and the fans who had fallen in love with her. She stood at the front of a roofless   bus, her gold medal dangling over the side, singing along with Puerto Rican pop tunes and waving to a grateful island. Waving back were grandmothers and   little girls holding red, white and blue flags gritty bikers business people pouring out of office buildings and truckers, parked in their rigs and honking their horns. There were teenagers in tank tops doctors, nurses, schoolchildren in uniform and nuns in habits. One elderly man wore a crisp, new   with an image of Puig celebrating her gold medal victory and her motto Pica Power. He held a small cardboard sign that read, “Gracias, Monica. ” “It was the most incredible experience of my life,” Puig said. “Obviously, I was overcome with emotion because you saw me crying up there. I could see it on their faces, what it meant to everyone. I felt so proud. ” Puig’s historic success came at an opportune moment for Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States that is enduring hard times. The economy is faltering under the crushing weight of more than $70 billion in government debt, morale is low and fears over the Zika virus caused Major League Baseball to cancel a   series. People are leaving the island to seek their fortunes elsewhere, and it seems that the populace is divided about whether to push for statehood or become an independent nation. But Puerto Ricans here and abroad were united each time Puig took the court in Rio, the momentum building with every win. Unseeded and ranked No. 35, Puig drew scant interest for the first match she played. By the second match, people began to take notice. After she crushed No. 3 Garbiñe Muguruza, the French Open champion, in the third round, Puig had Puerto Rico’s full attention. By the time she beat the   Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in the semifinals, she had captivated an island. Gigi Fernández, also from San Juan, won gold in doubles in the 1992 and the 1996 Olympics, but she did it representing the United States. Before the Rio Games, Puerto Rico had captured only eight medals since it first entered the Olympics in 1948  —   two silver and six bronze. When Puig stepped onto the court to play   Angelique Kerber in the gold medal match on Aug. 13, the streets across Puerto Rico were silent and empty, according to numerous reports and accounts of dozens of people here. But when she won, people came out on the balconies of apartment buildings waving flags and shouting, cars honked their horns and people in bars and restaurants danced and hugged. “The whole island came together,” she said. “I feel like I united the island. ” She added: “I know that in Puerto Rico, not many people watch tennis or know what it is all about. But it is amazing how much a moment like that can mean for so many people. ” After Puig’s victory, Puerto Rican celebrities sent out congratulatory tweets, including the entertainers   Miranda, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and Puig’s friend Carlos Correa, the star shortstop of the Houston Astros. But this, at its core, was a victory for the average Puerto Ricans to revel in. Javier   a    puppeteer from Bayamón, was on a church mission in Nicaragua for the final, but found an internet signal and watched on his phone. “It is the greatest thing to happen to Puerto Rico,” he said Wednesday near the beautiful public tennis courts in Parque Barbosa in San Juan. “That a young woman from Puerto Rico set her mind to a goal and reached it, it gives us hope. The people here are frustrated. But it feels like everyone in Puerto Rico has a gold medal because of her. ” Puig’s sudden popularity is more remarkable considering tennis is not a big sport here. Baseball is considered the passion of the island, and basketball and boxing are immensely popular. Soccer, volleyball and maybe even judo and   may rank higher than tennis. But Puig’s mother, Astrid, played it as a girl in San Juan and earned a top ranking as a junior on the island, although she never played professionally. The Puig family moved to Miami when Monica was 1, but she and her brother returned regularly to spend summers with their grandparents. As her daughter’s tennis improved in her teenage years, Astrid said, the family decided she would play for Puerto Rico, which offered more financial support than the United States Tennis Association did. But the money was contingent upon Puig’s winning medals in events like the Pan American Games and the Central American Games. That may have etched the importance of medals in her mind. At 16, she won gold in the Central American Games, played in Puerto Rico, and last year she won bronze at the Pan American Games in Toronto. “Playing for Puerto Rico was the best decision I ever made,” Puig said. “I am so proud of my Puerto Rican roots. To pay off like this just reaffirms it. ” Puig struggled in 2015, and her ranking, once in the top 40, fell to No. 92 at the end of the year. This season, though, her road to Rio was paved with success. She reached the final at the Sydney event in January and the semifinals at Eastbourne in June to bring her into the top 40. Players are no longer awarded ranking points at the Olympics, but she seized something just as valuable there: confidence. It was buoyed after her     victory over Muguruza and then soared when she stunned Kvitova in three sets in the semifinals. In the final, against Kerber, Puig said her nerves cost her the second set. But when she led,   in the third, she promised herself she would remain calm. “That was a big, fat lie,” she said. “It was definitely the moment of my life. The most   scary, exciting mix of emotions I have ever felt. My hands were shaking. ” Her next stop is the United States Open, next week in New York. Puig knows she enjoys great support from people of Puerto Rican descent and from Caribbean nations. But she noted that now, after Rio, her appeal may broaden. “I know this will probably be one to remember,” she said. “I hope I can go far enough to make it a good memory. ” In less than a month, she obtained a lifetime of memories. On Tuesday in San Juan, the   parade in her honor ended at the Coliseum of Puerto Rico, where she and the other Olympians danced and sang on stage in a jubilant celebration in front of thousands. Puig cried during her speech. Carlos Nido, a    public defense lawyer from San Juan, took his two little girls to watch. “They are very young,” he said. “But maybe someday they will play tennis, too. ”",0
7044,"NSA Whistleblower Says DNC Email Hack Was Not by Russia, but by US Intelligence","
An NSA Whistleblower says that Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails are easily accessible by the NSA and FBI should they desire to look at them, and he suggests that the hacks on the Democratic National Committee’s server was not done by Russia, as many pundits are claiming, but possibly by a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker.
William Binney, the architect of the NSA’s surveillance program, resigned on October 31, 2001, after working for the agency for more than 30 years. He thinks that an intelligence worker may have hacked into the DNC emails due to concern about Hillary Clinton’s disregard of national security in her use of a personal email server and her continued lies about her activity. Once accessed, there’s no telling where the information could have gone.
The “Putin did it” story is a fable used to sway voters towards Clinton’s war-driven agenda.

On a talk radio show, he mentioned that there are numerous questions that are not being answered about the hacked DNC emails and the network log available to the NSA.
Binney explains that there was no evidence tying the alleged Russian hacks to Wikileaks, and he says that they would have access to this information through the network logs. “So, if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and get them right now,” he said.
He finds their reluctance to speak to this matter highly suspicious. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

7045,"Nicholas Clinch, Who Took On Unclimbed Mountains, Dies at 85 - The New York Times","Nicholas Clinch, an audacious and intrepid mountaineer who led   expeditions of skyscraping peaks in the Himalayas and in Antarctica, died on June 15 in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 85. The cause was cancer, a nephew, Richard Kylberg, said. An unusual figure in the world of elite mountaineering, Mr. Clinch was a tall, somewhat gangly man whose slight build was not in the hardy athletic mold of a   climber. He was, in addition, asthmatic. But he found his niche in the field by applying his intelligence, technical skill, practical knowledge and perseverance. In October 1955, Mr. Clinch, then in his   was relaxing after a spaghetti dinner with some fellow climbers in a Northern California living room when he issued an almost casual challenge. “Who wants to climb Hidden Peak in 1958?” he asked. The reference was to the   mountain on earth, located in the Karakoram range in northeast Pakistan. Known also as Gasherbrum I, at about 26, 500 feet it is one of the 14 mountains higher than 8, 000 meters and was, at the time, the   unclimbed peak in the world. (Dhaulagiri, in Nepal, at nearly 26, 800 feet, was not climbed until 1960.) His companions laughed  —   justifiably, Mr. Clinch would later write  —   but he assembled a small team of climbers (including two men who were there for the first inquiry) secured permission for the trek from the Pakistani government, shipped 7, 000 pounds of food and equipment halfway around the world, and met his original deadline. In the spring of 1958, Mr. Clinch led a support army of more than 100 people from the town of Skardu to Hidden Peak, 150 miles away, and in early July two members of the climbing party, Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman, achieved the summit. An assault on the peak from a final temporary camp by a second group of climbers, including Mr. Clinch, was canceled because of threatening weather. That others got the glory for the first ascent was no bother to Mr. Clinch, a lawyer by profession who scaled mountains on several continents and was known among mountaineers as a consummate team player and a leader and organizer of infinite patience, diligence and humor. “He would say to me, ‘The mountains don’t care who you are,’ ” Mr. Kylberg, his nephew, said, meaning that great athletes could founder in the wild at high altitudes as easily as anyone else. “He saw the mountains as a great human equalizer. ” Mr. Clinch’s physical achievements in enduring what he described, in The Saturday Evening Post in 1961, as “the special agonies of   climbing, when the combination of blazing sun and snow makes it feel as if your head were in an oven and your feet in a freezer while you carry heavy loads,” were nonetheless impressive. In 1960, he had organized another first ascent in the Karakoram, leading a team of American and Pakistani mountaineers to the top of Masherbrum  —   sometimes known as Doomsday Mountain  —   at upward of 25, 600 feet. “Nick had the capacity to fantasize and to translate fantasy into reality,” Tom Hornbein, who was part of the Masherbrum team, said in a telephone interview. Asked how a less than robust physical specimen could conquer such mammoth peaks, Mr. Hornbein (who in 1963, with another climber, forged a new route up Mount Everest) said that Mr. Clinch was a highly proficient climber technically, and that his ability to apply his climbing experience to the problems in front of him was peerless. “Nick,” he added, “was not lacking in drive. ” Nicholas Bayard Clinch III was born in Evanston, Ill. on Nov. 9, 1930, and grew up in Dallas and in Roswell, N. M. where he attended the New Mexico Military Institute. His father was a military flyer who became a colonel in the Air Force. Nicholas III graduated from Stanford and went on to earn a law degree there. Like his father, he served in the Air Force. In the 1970s, he was a lawyer for the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the financial institution in Irvine, Calif. that went bankrupt in 1989 during a scandal that sent Charles H. Keating Jr. the chief executive of its parent corporation, to prison for fraud. Mr. Clinch was a longtime member of the American Alpine Club and its president from 1968 to 1970. He was the executive director of the Sierra Club Foundation from 1975 to 1981, and he worked as an environmental consultant for the Fluor Corporation, a   engineering and construction firm. His attraction to the mountains began when he was a teenager. He spent summers at an adventure camp in Estes Park, Colo. and met many friends, including Mr. Hornbein, who would become climbing colleagues. Mr. Clinch married Elizabeth Wallace Campbell, known as Betsy, in 1964. Together they wrote “Through a Land of Extremes: The Littledales of Central Asia” (2011) about the British explorers and adventurers St. George Littledale and his wife, Teresa. Mr. Clinch was also the author of “A Walk in the Sky” (1982) an account of the Hidden Peak expedition. Mr. Clinch is survived by his wife a sister, Lee Everding and two daughters, Alison Clinch and Lee Bridges. One more of Mr. Clinch’s remarkable climbing ventures, perhaps the most remarkable: In December 1966, with the sponsorship of the American Alpine Club and the National Geographic Society, he led a team of American climbers in the first ascent of Mount Vinson, at just over 16, 000 feet the highest peak in Antarctica. In temperatures well below zero (and in   sunlight) all 10 climbers in the group reached the summit. In 2006, according to the United States Geological Survey, a nearly   mountaintop, 1. 4 miles southeast of Mount Vinson, was named in his honor: Clinch Peak.",0

Here are the basics: You need to track your income, but you are likely to get plenty of help on that. Be prepared for a blizzard of tax forms. Employers issue Forms   to employees. Banks, brokerage houses and other payers, including businesses that use independent contractors, issue Forms 1099 and sometimes Schedules   reporting the money they paid. They must report these payments to the I. R. S. as well, and discrepancies are likely to result in an I. R. S. notice. But it is up to the taxpayer to claim itemized deductions and available tax credits. If you neglect to do so, you may end up overpaying. Taking deductions requires good  . Consider the rules for charitable deductions on donated money, household items or clothing, valuable art or properties. Sidney Kess, a New York accountant and lawyer, who is a senior consultant to the accounting firm Citrin Cooperman, said your own check is sufficient for gifts of less than $250, but for higher amounts a receipt from the charity is needed. “To claim a deduction for items or property worth over $500 but less than $5, 000, in addition to a written acknowledgment, records have to show when and how you got the property, the cost or other basis, and you must report this information on Form 8283,” Mr. Kess said. “For a deduction over $5, 000, you need an appraisal from a qualified appraiser. ” But   is only part of what confronts taxpayers trying to reduce liabilities. The tax code  —   four million words by some estimates  —   is   of complexities, but therein lie opportunities. Mr. Kess discussed one such opportunity: deciding how family members should file their returns. Like so much involving taxes, it’s complicated. Say a couple has a daughter in college who earned money from a summer job. The couple provides more than half her support and could claim her as a dependent, but the I. R. S. imposes certain limits. Personal exemptions, which exclude $4, 050 per person from income, begin to phase out for married couples filing jointly with adjusted gross income of $311, 300 and are eliminated when income reaches $433, 800. If the parents had an income below those levels, they would probably have claimed their daughter as a dependent. Because their income is above the upper limit, they do not do so. Instead, she claims her own exemption on her return reporting her summer income, and she can take an education credit as well. Her parents could not get that credit because of their high income. Individual Retirement Accounts and Health Savings Accounts can be used to shelter tax refunds, noted Barbara Weltman, a lawyer in Vero Beach, Fla. and author of two J. K. Lasser books, “1001 Deductions  Tax Breaks 2017,” and “Small Business Taxes 2017,” both published by Wiley. “You can use your tax refund to lower your 2016 tax,” Ms. Weltman said, “but you have to file as early as you can” because the deadline for depositing the money into an I. R. A. or H. S. A. is the same as the due date for filing tax returns, April 18 this year. If you are eligible for an I. R. A. or H. S. A. claim deductions for them on the return, based on the amounts calculated by the accounts’ custodians, and include Form 8888, directing the I. R. S. to deposit those amounts directly into the accounts. Tell your account custodian (it may be a bank or a mutual fund company or a brokerage) that the deposit should be applied to 2016, she said. Any excess from the refund can go to your regular bank account. Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N. Y. said that big refunds can sometimes cause problems. He cited the case of a new client who, he discovered, had been receiving a plump refund every year. Mr. Block advised him to file a revised Form   with his employer, aimed at reducing the amount of money being held out of his regular paycheck and paring down his refund. The reason, Mr. Block said, is that online identity thieves are increasingly active, and if they file a fraudulent return using your Social Security number and claiming a refund, your own refund will be delayed while the I. R. S. sorts it out. Of course, you won’t be held liable for the actions of a thief. If, instead, you owe a small balance to the I. R. S. you won’t have that headache, though you will need to check whether your identity has been compromised in other areas of your financial life. Mr. Block also noted that there is an alternative to an I. R. A. for some older   people, including people who turn a hobby into a small business or do work like child care. If they are over age 70½, such people can no longer contribute to an I. R. A. but they can set up and contribute to a Simplified Employee Pension Plan. That enables them to deduct contributions now and withdraw money in later years. It will be taxable then, but their income may be lower, too. For tax purposes, alimony counts as earned income, he added, so recipients who otherwise qualify for an I. R. A. may contribute the alimony to it and claim a deduction. Many   people do not realize that they are allowed to deduct the cost of health insurance, regardless of whether their unreimbursed medical expenses are high enough to take a deduction on Schedule A, Mr. Block said. They can deduct the health insurance cost on the front of the Form 1040, on Line 29. That’s just one of several deductions on the front of the 1040 that are worth keeping in mind. Others include teachers’    outlays of up to $250 for students or for their own professional development, the deductible part of   tax, student loan interest, alimony paid and an H. S. A. deduction for those who are eligible. All are especially valuable because they reduce adjusted gross income on Line 37. That number ripples all through a tax return, often limiting other tax breaks. In addition to filing a 2016 return by April 18, many taxpayers must file Form   to pay quarterly estimated taxes on income on which no taxes are withheld, like   income interest, dividends and capital gains on investments, or rental and royalty income. Preparers often base the calculations on the previous year’s taxes, Mr. Kess said, but if tax cuts are indeed enacted by Congress, estimates based on 2016 taxes may turn out to be too high. If that happens, you will need to recalculate the estimate later  —   in June, September or even the end of the year, depending on when a law is enacted  —   and can reduce the payments accordingly. For anyone thinking, “I wish I’d known that last year,” Greg Rosica, a tax partner with EY, formerly Ernst  Young, in Tampa, Fla. says it’s probably not too late. Whatever the reason, you realize belatedly that you failed to take a deduction for which you were qualified. All is not lost. “It’s fairly simple to amend returns,” Mr. Rosica said. Taxpayers may file a Form 1040X up to three years beyond its original due date. Say you filed a Form 1040 for 2013 income in March 2014. The due date was April 15, 2014, so you have until April 18 this year. But if you filed under an automatic   extension in 2014, you have until Oct. 16 of this year to file the amended return. Mr. Rosica is a member of the editorial board for the “EY Tax Guide 2017,” which is published by Wiley, and includes this tip: Many taxpayers know they can deduct state income taxes on their federal return, but many do not realize they have the option of deducting sales taxes instead. That is advantageous if you live in a state like Texas, New Hampshire or South Dakota that has no state income tax. It may also be a boon to anyone who bought a   item like a car with a big sales tax, and is often the best choice for people over age 65 because many states  —   even   New York  —   exempt Social Security income and some   income from state income taxes. Both Mr. Rosica and Mr. Kess advised taxpayers to check the tax consequences of any big life changes that may have taken place, like getting married or divorced or having a baby, all of which could affect filing status and the number of personal exemptions, as well as bring medical expenses that may have tax consequences. Changing jobs or moving may also mean income changes that would affect withholding. If you have a financial account outside the United States, be careful to report it, Ms. Weltman said. “Foreign financial accounts are high on the I. R. S. scrutiny list, and people who fail to disclose foreign accounts can be penalized severely,” she said, including people who inherited accounts overseas and those who worked abroad and still have ties where they once lived. FinCEN Form 114, the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, is used for accounts of $10, 000 or more and is filed electronically with the Treasury, while Form 8938, which is attached to Form 1040, is used in more complex situations, with the lowest threshold being for accounts of $50, 000.",0

7048,California Today: Henry Rollins Strikes Chord as a Columnist - The New York Times," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) At 56, Henry Rollins is still angry. When he was a younger man, the rage flowed out of him as the scowling frontman for Black Flag, the pioneering Southern California punk band. Today, Mr. Rollins may no longer scream to get his point across. But as a spoken word performer, radio host and, notably, a widely read columnist at LA Weekly, he has reinvented himself as a political voice that is similarly hard to ignore. “It’s definitely one of the most popular regular features that we run,” his editor at LA Weekly, Andy Hermann, said of his writing. “He’s just a great commentator and satirist. ” (Here are a couple of pieces that Mr. Hermann said struck a big chord with readers.) We caught up with Mr. Rollins by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation: Q. What’s your approach to the column? A. As far as political writing, to use the baseball idea, if you can’t hit them where they ain’t and score, then  —   basically don’t be obvious. And if you’re going to make a point, if you can’t bring some humor into it  —   I mean obviously someone getting shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo. there’s no fun there. But anything with Donald Trump, where there’s so much to say, if you don’t bring some humor in, it’s going to be unreadable. Q. Have you mellowed with age? A. Not really. I’ve just been able to prioritize and direct my energies with a little bit more care and aim, where I don’t need to scorch the entire forest because I’m angry. I can just pick out the three trees and that turns into a column or that turns into something on stage. Q. You’ve said you cultivate your anger. Why? A. Because it turns into good things. I saw the HBO documentary on the West Memphis Three and I said, ‘Oh, O. K. you’ve officially pissed me off. Arkansas we’re coming for you.’ And it was out of anger. I was concerned for guys in jail, yeah, but it was anger that got my civic muscle going. And I started calling rich, famous people I knew  —   ‘Hey can I have a thousand dollars [to donate to a legal fund]?’ I couldn’t believe it. I was like a member of Congress dialing for dollars. Q. Do you ever think about making music again? A. No. For me it was a real time and place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was never fun. It was necessary. I really had to say those words. But I never enjoyed it and I’ll be the first to admit I was never all that good at it. But it was real.

7049,Trump no quiere que EEUU toma parte de Acuerdo de París | US VIEWER,"Trump no quiere que EEUU toma parte de Acuerdo de París 2016/11/13 13:22 Twitter El mandatario electo de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ya está buscando formas rápidas para que Washington salga del acuerdo mundial de París contra el cambio climático. 
USviewer, EEUU_ Así informó Reuters, citando a una fuente de su equipo de transición, quien reprochó al saliente presidente Barack Obama que firmara la adhesión del país mediante una orden ejecutiva, sin contar con el apoyo del Senado. 
""Fue insensato que el Acuerdo de París entrara en vigencia antes de la elección"" del martes, dijo la fuente, que habló bajo condición de anonimato. El Acuerdo de París obtuvo el 4 de noviembre el apoyo necesario para ser puesto en marcha. 
Pues, según la fuente, la alternativa es enviar una carta de retiro de la Convención de 1992 que está asociada al Acuerdo de París, lo que restaría la participación de Estados Unidos en ambos en un año, o emitir una orden presidencial que borre la firma de Washington del acuerdo sellado en la capital francesa. 
Muchos países se han mostrado optimistas para que EE.UU. se mantenga adherido al pacto, aunque Marruecos, sede de las actuales conversaciones, dijo que el acuerdo que busca reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en la segunda mitad del siglo es lo suficientemente fuerte como para sobrevivir al éxodo estadounidense. 
El triunfo del candidato republicano a la Casa Blanca, Donald Trump, en los comicios del pasado martes, ha generado diversas reacciones tanto dentro del territorio estadounidense como en otras partes del mundo, una victoria que ha sido acogida con la satisfacción de algunos, el temor o la prudencia de otros. 
En diciembre de 2015, tras 13 días de intensa negociación en un suburbio de París (capital de Francia), representantes de 195 países consiguieron el acuerdo histórico para reducir drásticamente las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en un intento por detener el calentamiento global. 
Hasta este sábado había sido ratificado por 109 países que suponen el 76 por ciento de los emisores de gases con efecto invernadero. Estados Unidos supone el 18 por ciento de las emisiones. No hay comentarios para esta noticia Nombre : ",0
7050,Mel Gibson-Vince Vaughn Cop Thriller ’Dragged Across Concrete’ Acquired by Lionsgate,"Lionsgate has acquired the U. S. distribution rights to Dragged Across Concrete, a police detective thriller starring Vince Vaughn and Mel Gibson. [According to the Hollywood Reporter, Lionsgate will release the film under its Summit Entertainment banner after negotiating a deal at the Cannes Film Festival in France this week.  The film reportedly stars Gibson and Vaughn as police detectives (Gibson an “ ” and Vaughn as his “volatile” partner) who are suspended from the force when video of their rough tactics is leaked to the media. “Low on cash and with no other options, these two embittered soldiers descend into the criminal underworld to gain their just due, but instead find far more than they wanted awaiting them in the shadows,” the film’s IMDb synopsis reads. The film was written and will be directed by S. Craig Zahler and is expected to begin production in Canada on July 17. Gibson and Vaughn are coming off a successful pairing on last year’s war drama Hacksaw Ridge, which won editing and sound Oscars, a Best Director nod for Gibson and a nomination for Best Picture. Lionsgate also distributed Hacksaw under its Summit Entertainment label last year. “We are delighted to be working again with Mel Gibson who helmed our double Oscar winner Hacksaw Ridge along with Vince Vaughn and the great production team behind this film,” Lionsgate president of acquisitions and   Jason Constantine said in a statement. “It’s a double treat to have screenwriter S. Craig Zahler also direct what will be an intense film for audiences. ” The project is reportedly looking for international buyers in Cannes this week. Gibson’s acting slate is filling up quickly. The      will star next in The Professor and the Madman alongside Sean Penn, and is currently filming a role for the comedy sequel Daddy’s Home 2. Vaughn previously worked with Zahler on the upcoming Brawl in Cell Block 99 and will also star in the upcoming wrestling comedy Fighting with My Family from director Stephen Merchant.

7051,Michigan Football Team Arrives in Italy - Breitbart,"ROME (AP)  —   Jim Harbaugh didn’t have a great answer, believe it or not. [Speaking with a    Nigerian refugee who now lives in Rome, Michigan’s coach was presented Sunday with the basic, fundamental question of why American football is called “football,” given that players barely use their feet.  At a loss for words, Harbaugh summoned his father, Jack, to help give a quick lesson. All in a day’s work. All part of the Roman experience. All part of Michigan football’s   blitz of Rome. “The smiles on everybody’s faces here,” Jack Harbaugh said, “it’s just so fantastic. ” The Wolverines landed in Italy around 9 a. m. Sunday. The entire group has yet to arrive  —   more will be on the way Monday. But the first group of travelers exited their   flight and headed straight toward Rome’s Villa Borghese, a spacious park in the center of the city. There, they spent some time with refugees from the Joel Nafuma Refugee Center, which is located at St. Paul’s Within The Walls Episcopal Church. St. Paul’s, built in 1873, was the first Roman   church to be built inside Rome’s city walls. Michigan handed out more than 50 Jordan Brand backpacks, filled with Michigan gear, to the refugees in the park. The Harbaughs  —   father and son  —   gave a quick lesson to the refugees about how football is played. “These are precious gifts,” said    Ade Dagi, a Nigerian refugee who came to Italy in 2015. “It’s beautiful. ” The Wolverines will spend the first four days of the trip touring Rome  —   an excursion that will see them visit the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the Spanish Steps, the Vatican and more. Harbaugh, his wife and two players (Grant Newsome and Salim Makki) will have a chance to sit near Pope Francis on Wednesday during his weekly Mass. The rest of the team will also be in attendance before touring St. Peter’s Square. Michigan is the first Football Bowl Subdivision team to take a spring trip abroad, and it’s already seeing the benefits. “(A refugee) I met said he came here with one shirt on his back, a pair of shorts and some shoes that didn’t fit,” Michigan quarterback Wilton Speight said. “A lot of us take that for granted. We’re here in Jordan jumpsuits with an American and Italy flag on them. It kind of puts all this in perspective a little bit. ”",0
7052,"Gay and Transgender Egyptians, Harassed and Entrapped, Are Driven Underground - The New York Times","CAIRO  —   The last days of the government of Hosni Mubarak and the turbulent revolution that followed were tense, occasionally   times for many in Egypt. But for gay and transgender Egyptians, it was also a period of unaccustomed freedom. They socialized in bars and sidewalk cafes and met partners over cellphone dating apps with a greater degree of openness and comfort than they had known. But that era came to an abrupt end with the return of military rule. Since the 2013 military intervention that established former Gen. Abdel Fattah   as the country’s ruler, at least 250 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have been arrested in a quiet crackdown that has shattered what had been an increasingly vibrant and visible community. Through a campaign of online surveillance and entrapment, arrests and the closing of   businesses, the police have driven gay and transgender people back underground and, in many cases, out of the country. Before the crackdown, “there was no deliberate campaign of arrest and monitoring,” said Dalia Abdel Hameed, a researcher at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. “But now the police are going out of their way to arrest gay men and trans women. ” Between the unraveling of the Mubarak government and the overthrow of Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people faced little threat from the police, who were focused on other matters and largely ignored what happened at house parties or bars in Cairo’s crumbling, bohemian downtown. The crackdown began in earnest when a military curfew imposed after the removal of Mr. Morsi ended in fall 2013, said Scott Long, a human rights activist who lived in Egypt for many years and wrote a landmark report for Human Rights Watch on the last major crackdown. At the time, control of Egypt’s streets was passing from the army, a relatively trusted institution, to the police, a hated symbol of the Mubarak government. “Somebody in the Ministry of Interior realized this was a way to get good publicity for the police,” Mr. Long said. The arrests signaled the return of an aggressive approach by the morality police division, which has participated in a larger crackdown that has jailed tens of thousands of people since 2013. Using tools last deployed in a campaign against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people over 10 years ago, the division has reasserted the authority lost by the police before and during the revolution. Other branches of the security forces have also flexed their muscles since the return of military rule, arresting protesters or clamping down on unlicensed street vendors, activists said. “The police want to show they have a strong grip on society,” Ms. Abdel Hameed said. “So this is the morality police having their own campaign to arrest L. G. B. T. people. ” There is no law in Egypt specifically banning homosexual acts, so gay and transgender people are charged with “habitual debauchery” under a 1961 law that is used to prosecute men for homosexuality and women for prostitution, Ms. Abdel Hameed said. So far, the sentences have ranged from two to 12 years. The crackdown has primarily targeted gay men and transgender women, some of whom have been arrested in raids on private homes or picked up on the street if their appearances raised suspicions. (Transgender women are usually prosecuted as men because the police, courts and news media in Egypt, unlike those in the West, make no meaningful distinction between gay men and transgender women, activists said.) Most, however, have been arrested after officers entrapped them on dating apps like Grindr, which now greets its users when they log in with a warning message about a possible police presence on the site. Ms. Abdel Hameed said the police used the apps to flirt with people, engaging in sexual banter and asking for risqué photos that could be used as evidence in court before asking them out on dates. When the unsuspecting targets of the stings arrive for the dates, they are swiftly arrested. This is not the first time these tactics have been used against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Egypt. A crackdown that began in 2001 is still remembered for a raid on the Queen Boat, a nightclub where the police arrested dozens of men accused of being gay. Their trials dominated Egypt’s headlines for months and sent a wave of terror through gay circles. “There was the Queen Boat and its aftermath, then there was our normal life, and now this is the biggest crackdown after the Queen Boat,” Ms. Abdel Hameed said. Perhaps the crackdown’s greatest physical manifestation is in the proliferation of police checkpoints in downtown Cairo and the closings of cafes and other businesses that were gathering spots for activists, intellectuals and gay people during the heady days of political upheaval. One    gay man, who asked to be identified by only his middle name, Ali, for fear of arrest, said the police campaign had devastated his community. “Everything leads to getting arrested,” Ali said. “The huge threat is being arrested or losing your friends to prison, because after the failed revolution there was a huge crackdown on the downtown community, especially. This is my community, and it is being destroyed. ” Many gay and transgender people who are able to leave the country have done so or still hope to, Ali said, adding that he wanted to move to Europe or North America. “I am running out of friends because they are all being arrested or they are leaving Egypt,” he said. The police also seize detainees’ phones and “search their data to find others,” Ms. Abdel Hameed said. When they find them, they often torture them to produce lists of gay friends and former sex partners. Detainees are also subjected to forced anal examinations, a form of torture that the police believe can prove if a person has engaged in homosexual conduct, a contention that Egyptian jurists have said is false. Mr. Long said that online entrapment had become especially effective in the last two years, because the shutdown of   spaces had left many with no place to go. “There aren’t many queer places left in downtown or in the rest of the city, so people become more reliant on apps and social networks,” he said. “People are lonely and they meet someone who seems like they’re interested, and bang, they’re arrested. ” Ali agreed that despite the dangers, the internet was one of the few public spaces left for gay and transgender people. “There is no other way,” Ali said. “It is Egypt. ”",0

7054,NFL Commissioner Goodell Affirms Gambling Ban Despite Raiders Move to Vegas - Breitbart,"Despite the recent move of the Raiders from California to gambling mecca Las Vegas, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has reaffirmed the league’s stance against gambling. [With the move to Vegas and the growth of sports betting websites such as Draft Kings, many have wondered just how hard the NFL will continue the fight to restrict gambling. But, Goodell’s recent comments seem to answer that question, at least for now, USA Today reports.  “I would probably tell you that I think society has probably had a little bit of a change with respect to gambling in general,” Goodell said at the league’s annual meeting in Arizona on Tuesday. “I think we still strongly oppose it in that room, and otherwise, legalized sports gambling. The integrity of our game is No. 1. We will not compromise on that. ” Even with that negative assessment, Goodell did admit that Vegas isn’t the same, crooked city it once was. “But I also believe that Las Vegas is not the same city it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago. It’s a much more diverse city. It has become an entertainment mecca. It’s the   city in the country,” he added. “So I think when you look at it today versus what it was a decade or two ago, I think it’s a much different city. And they made a very compelling proposal, which the owners obviously approved overwhelmingly. ” Indeed, many polls have shown an increased tolerance for gambling among the pubic. Polls last year revealed that nearly half of respondents were in favor of legalizing sports betting. Governments are also hungrily eyeing sports betting as a likely new source of tax revenue, as well. Consequently, various bills have been introduced in Congress to lift the federal ban on sports betting. But, other signs pointed to new problems in the internet age when sports fan sites like Draft Kings and Fan Duel came under fire for corrupt practices last year. Yet, even with the controversies, it was reported that several pro sports leagues are looking to work closer with the gambling industry. Unlike the NFL’s Goodell, NBA chief Adam Silver recently went in the opposite direction on sports betting by softening his league’s stance against gambling. But, there is still faint hope for gamblers looking for football to favor them. In the end Goodell noted that the NFL reserves the right to change rules whenever it makes sense to do so.

7056,Comment on The Real Reason Police Fear Monger About ‘Drug-laced Candy’ on Halloween by reversalmushroom,"Home / Be The Change / War on Drugs / The Real Reason Police Fear Monger About ‘Drug-laced Candy’ on Halloween The Real Reason Police Fear Monger About ‘Drug-laced Candy’ on Halloween William N. Grigg October 26, 2015 2 Comments 
Halloween looms on the horizon like a rising Harvest Moon, and with its approach comes the perennial onslaught of scare stories about drug fiends trying to poison “The Children.” 
The Jackson, Mississippi Police Department was one of many that used their Facebook page to disseminate a warning about Ecstasy pills that were deviously disguised to look like children’s candy. The message contained a photo of what appeared to be an assortment of what appeared to be Pez-style hard candies in various shapes and colors. 
“If your kids get these for Halloween candy, they ARE NOT CANDY!!!” bellowed the Facebook post , which was composed by someone dangerously addicted to punctuation marks. “They are the new shapes of `Ecstasy’ and can kill kids through overdoses!!! So, check your kid’s candy and `When in doubt, Throw it out!!!’ Be safe and always keep the shiny side up!!!” 
No instrument yet invented can measure the infinitesimally small possibility that a child in Jackson would receive Ecstasy or any other drug as part of the Halloween haul. However, parents who follow the police department’s admonition will infect their youngsters with alarm over the supposedly all-encompassing menace posed by fiendish drug addicts who spent considerable sums on expensive drugs that they simply give away to kids whom they will never see again. 
“Law enforcement agencies across the country have caught people with ecstasy pills shaped like candy,” intoned Memphis CBS affiliate WREG , which also passed along a report from a sister station in Louisville that “a guy got busted last week for having ecstasy pills with Disney characters on them.” Shelby County Sheriff’s deputies contacted by WREG replied to requests for comment about this supposed threat. The Memphis PD insisted that “they have not heard anything about this, but would ask the Organized Crime Unit about it in the morning.” 
The families and the police ignore the fact that many ecstasy pill manufacturers mimic pop culture to brand their specific blend of drugs. The “Disney Characters” on pills are little more than that drug dealer’s logo. It is in no way intended to lure unsuspecting children into eating these pills that cost upwards of $30 each. 
Dr. Jon McCullers, Chief Pediatrician at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital, introduced an element of sobriety into the discussion, endorsing he common-sense notion that “parents have to remain vigilant” while assuring the public that the specter of drug-tainted candy isn’t “on their radar.” 
“We haven’t seen that here at Le Bonheur,” Dr. McCullers declared. “It [the annual scare over adulterated Halloween candy] goes back to when I was a kid. Everybody worried about that sort of thing.” 
One supposedly verified incident of children being given marijuana-infused candy took place not during trick-or-treating, but in a government-controlled, “drug-free” environment: One teenager was arrested and two others may face charges for allegedly giving pot-enhanced Skittles candies to students at the high school in Miller, Missouri. Police were told that five students “ate the tainted candy and their parents were immediately contacted,” according to a report from KY3news.com. 
School superintendent Dustin Strom claims that the “poisoned” candy “has a different color, different look, and a different texture as well.” It’s not clear from available reports, however, that toxicology tests were performed on the candy to confirm that they had been coated with THC (the psychoactive compound in cannabis), and, if this is the case, where the alleged offenders had obtained it. 
Despite Strom’s assurance that this alleged tampering was “an isolated incident,” the Miller Police Department announced that it will provide “safety checks” on Halloween candy at the request of concerned parents. 
Moral panic of this kind bubbles up every year in mid-October, and the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington – which can take the form of edibles that resemble brownies, cookies, or candy – has added a new flavor to that familiar witches’ brew. However, as MTV News reported a year ago , “we’ve been to this dance before. The myth of poisoned or drugged Halloween candy has been going around at this time of year since at least the ‘60s. Before marijuana candies, Americans have been scared of everything from heroin to metal shards in their kids’ sugary loot.” 
Despite this annual outbreak of alarm, “there’s never been a proven case of some random madman intentionally poisoning random trick-or-treaters. In fact, children are more likely to be poisoned by a family member than a stranger around Halloween.” 
“I have always been skeptical of claims that maniacs try to poison kids’ treats,” observes Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Delaware. “Why would they do that?” 
The implicit answer, from the perspective of those promoting the panic, is that drug fiends are motivated by a sadistic desire to defile childhood innocence. Just as “war on terror” propaganda cultivates a directionless fear of swarthy, savagely bearded foreigners who “hate us for our freedom,” agitprop conducted in the “war on drugs” endlessly recapitulates similar themes put into circulation decades ago by the arch-prohibitionist Harry Anslinger . 
In testimony under oath before Congress in 1937, Anslinger insisted: “Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.” As head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, Anslinger maintained a “gore file” replete with lurid stories – many of them entirely fictitious — of marijuana-crazed people committing hideous crimes, including rape, murder, and “miscegenation.” Ansligner was endlessly preoccupied with the idea that black people are particularly susceptible to marijuana, and that one particularly acute danger posed by the demon weed was its role in breaking down the barriers against “race-mixing.” 
The most important reason to outlaw marijuana, Anslinger insisted, “is its effect on the degenerate races.” Marijuana was nothing less than the drug used to seal the bloody covenants sworn by members of the ancient Order of Assassins, Ansligner tremulously informed a credulous public, and even today it plays a central role in the never-ending plot by dark and devious men who seek to steal the innocence of “Our Children.” 
“There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers,” Anslinger reportedly said on one occasion. “Their Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and any others.” 
Following World War II, after it was documented that marijuana did not promote outbursts of violent, aggressive behavior, Anslinger reversed field entirely. By 1948, he insisted that the same drug that turned men into paranoid, predatory criminals and white women into aggressive sluts would somehow turn young people into weak-willed pacifists unwilling and unable to obey the muster call to take up arms against the Communist Menace. 
Parents whose children participate in trick-or-treating should exercise discretion and supervise them carefully, but they shouldn’t fall prey to officially-promoted urban myths. Practicing adults should know better than to be spooked by the ghost of Harry Anslinger. Share R O M C H O M P A

7057,The Fake News About Central Banking,"The Fake News About Central Banking By Daily Bell Staff - November 22, 2016 
Trump Shouldn’t Bully the Fed … U.S. President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen during his campaign. British Prime Minister Theresa May has questioned the Bank of England’s recent actions, for a while putting Governor Mark Carney’s tenure in doubt. The long-cherished principle of central-bank independence seems to be under attack. – Bloomberg 
The mainstream media is up in arms over “fake news” but the reality is that almost everything the mainstream reports is in a sense fake. Global warming is fake. Vaccines do not work as advertised. Central banking is fake too. 
On and on. Truth has been overtaken by propaganda. We call these fake notions “dominant social themes.” They are inevitably intended to reinforce the idea that a very few must have control over the many. 
Central banks fix the volume and value of “money” – and price fixing inevitably creates disasters. But you will never find this simple fact stated in almost any mainstream media article about central banking. 
This Bloomberg article is no exception. Seldom do we see all the fallacious reasons for a central bank gathered together in one short editorial, but Bloomberg has done us this favor. 
In this case, Bloomberg is trying to justify why central banks should be “independent.” 
More: 
The standard case for leaving central banks alone to conduct monetary policy rests on three points. 
First, a government that controls the central bank might be tempted to finance unaffordable budget deficits by printing money. (See Zimbabwe.) Second, to provide economic stability, a steady hand on the monetary controls is required, which demands some insulation from day-to-day politics. (Would anybody want to put Congress in charge of interest rates?) Third, monetary policy done right is a technical thing, like running a utility. It’s basically apolitical. 
All three of these points are fallacious. First, central banks, independent or not, over-print money on a regular basis. Western central banks have a goal of creating price inflation, which institutionalizes this overprinting, usually via too-low interest rates. 
Second, the idea that an independent central bank can provide “a steady hand on monetary controls” is laughable. Central banks the world over are cartelized via the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland. Central bank policy is created via a secret monopoly and anyone looking over the past 20 years of central bank existence can easily see that the current “steady hand” has yielded up a series of global monetary disasters. 
Even Bloomberg has trouble with the third reason being cited, that central banking is “apolitical.” 
The editorial admits that “Changes in interest rates hurt some and help others,” and thus central bank policy-making is innately political. But because it is political, the predictable argument is made by Bloomberg that central banking ought to be “independent.” 
Bloomberg states, “Disagreement is OK. Intimidation is not.” 
The argument here is that statements by Donald Trump regarding the endless and ruinous low-rate regime of the Federal Reserve are “worrying” because Trump is bullying the Fed rather than criticizing it. 
The larger argument, and it’s one that Trump is surely familiar with, is that central banking cannot be justified at any level. As soon as individuals or groups attempt to manipulate the money supply, prosperity is inevitably affected and wealth is endlessly consolidated. 
This is just what’s happened around the world and especially in the West. Wealth has been gathered into fewer hands and the financial industry itself has grown without stopping until it has virtually taken over the larger economy. 
Conclusion: Money needs to be regulated by markets, not by a handful of individuals. There is plenty of free-market economic theory that illustrates logically why this should be so. Bloomberg’s argument is wrong, but at a more fundamental level, Bloomberg is addressing the wrong issue. The problem with central banking is not whether it should be independent, but whether it should exist at all.",0

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo 
On Tuesday, the FBI released documents related to a 2001 closed investigation into a pay-to-play scheme between former President Bill Clinton and Marc Rich, a man he granted a last-mine pardon. Rich’s ex-wife, Denise, donated more than $1 million to various Clinton and Democratic entities, including the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and the Clinton Foundation. Release reminds voters that the Clinton White House and Clinton Foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning pay-to-play allegations. New files include one entry which shows that “the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed” prior to the Rich pardon. Roger Adams, the U.S. Pardon Attorney at the time, testified to Congress in Feb. 2001 that “none of the regular procedures were followed” ahead of the Rich reprieve. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is also mentioned in the file. It cites Holder’s testimony that he was the only person who worked at DOJ — he was deputy attorney general at the time — about the Rich pardon. Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon: “Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s?” FBI: “The FBI’s Records Management Division receives thousands of FOIA requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis.” 
(WASHINGTON, DC) The FBI on Tuesday released documents related to a now-closed federal investigation of an alleged pay-to-play scheme involving Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. 
The documents, which are heavily redacted, regard the investigation of Clinton’s last-minute pardon of Marc Rich, a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the U.S. for tax evasion. 
The Jan. 20, 2001 pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandal-plagued Clinton administration. Rich’s ex-wife, Denise, donated more than $1 million to various Clinton and Democratic entities, including the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and the Clinton Foundation. 
The release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized. But the dump is noteworthy for two reasons. It reminds voters that the Clinton White House and Clinton Foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning pay-to-play allegations. The Clinton Foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple FBI field offices. 
The FBI issued a statement late Tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a FOIA request. 
“The FBI’s Records Management Division receives thousands of FOIA requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis,” the statement reads. 
“By law, FOIA materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the FBI’s public reading room shortly after they are processed. Per the standard procedure for FOIA, these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI’s public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.”",0
7059,Mike Pence: Obamacare ’Death Spiral’ One of Most Pressing Issues for Americans Today - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the nearly 2 million Americans who have dropped Obamacare this year in a Tuesday speech to employees at U. S. Health and Human Services ahead of meetings with lawmakers at the White House and on Capitol Hill. [The Vice President called the “ongoing collapse” of Obamacare  —   the “death spiral”  —   one of the most pressing issues facing Americans today. “This will be the North Star of our Administration,” Pence said of improving the healthcare system.  “We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare,” he said, citing the broken promises of the Affordable Care Act. While discussing the promise that premiums would go down, Pence referenced a report that revealed premiums have instead skyrocketed under Obamacare  —   more than doubling for the average American. “While costs are soaring  …    choices are plummeting. Insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right,” said Pence. A chart displayed above Pence read, “Only 10 million enrolled, 28 million still uninsured. ” He also referenced the 1. 9 million Americans that signed up for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, but have not followed through on paying their premiums. This figure comes from a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report released on Monday, detailing the 10. 3 million who have paid their premiums as of March 15, out of the 12. 2 million who have signed up. Pence described meeting Julie Champine on a recent trip to Wisconsin. He recalled her story of losing health insurance and her doctor while she faced health issues. She was forced to sign up for an Obamacare plan which in 2016 cost more than $9, 000 in premiums for her family and carries a $13, 000 deductible. Champine’s plan premium increased another $2, 600 this year, said Pence. “Julie told me that her Obamacare health insurance plan costs more than her mortgage and she can’t even afford to use it,” said Pence. A few months back she dropped her plan for a few months in order to afford Christmas presents for her kids. Pence remarked how important the men and women who serve in U. S. Health and Human Services are and thanked them for their service. HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price said before introducing Pence, that the work of HHS goes beyond the border of the United States and recalled a recent trip to Liberia. He lauded U. S. efforts to beat back Ebola in Africa. Price remarked of the challenges Americans face when it comes to obtaining quality health care. He voiced the goal of getting us to a healthcare system where Americans can afford health care and health coverage. He spoke of stabilizing markets, opening up enrollment options and   …     with the goal of installing a more   healthcare system. “The Affordable Care Act took a lot of power away from the states,” added Price who said they are continuing to make progress on innovations. In early May, health insurer Aetna pulled out of yet another state’s individual market, Virginia. CNN Money reported that the company cited massive losses under Obamacare as the reason why. Within days, Fox Business reported that Aetna would pull out of Obamacare exchanges completely by 2018. After passing through the U. S. House of Representatives, the American Health Care Act sits waiting for a vote on the floor of the U. S. Senate. The bill is designed to roll back much of President Barack Obama’s signature health insurance mandate. The bill has been presented as the first of several phases to dismantle Obamacare. President Trump has often stated that Obamacare is in a “death spiral” under which healthcare premiums continue to skyrocket. He has promised to repeal Obamacare. Following his speech, the Vice President is traveling to the White House for lunch with President Trump and members of Congress. Afterward, Pence will join lawmakers for the Senate Republican Policy lunch and hold additional meetings.",0
7060,A Cry From the Heart: Michael Eric Dyson Addresses Race Head-On - The New York Times,"TEARS WE CANNOT STOPA Sermon to White AmericaBy Michael Eric Dyson228 pp. St. Martin’s Press. $24. 99. One Sunday in 1984, my father did something unexpected, at least for a white man in Georgia. He drove us past the little rural church we usually attended and kept going 40 miles south, all the way to Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist  —   home parish of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and an epicenter of the American civil rights movement. Reading Michael Eric Dyson’s “Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America,” I was often reminded of that morning, when I was first exposed to the righteous anger, wry humor and unflinching honesty of a black pastor, determined to guide and teach his flock. While Dyson is best known as a writer and sociologist, he is also an ordained Baptist minister, and his new book draws both its impassioned style and its moral urgency from his years in the pulpit. At a time when one video after another has forced us to acknowledge that unarmed   are regularly killed by the police, Dyson desperately wants his readers to confront the sources of that violence in our nation’s longstanding culture of white supremacy. But he also knows how many political arguments and sociological studies have fallen on deaf ears. And so rather than a treatise, “Tears We Cannot Stop” is a fiery sermon, and an unabashedly emotional, personal appeal. “What I need to say” to white America, Dyson writes, can only be said in “a plea, a cry, a sermon, from my heart to yours. ” The result is one of the most frank and searing discussions of race I have ever read. This is a book that will anger some readers, especially those who reject Dyson’s central premise: that if we want true racial equality in America, whites themselves must destroy the enduring myths of white supremacy. Even sympathetic readers might mistake this extraordinary work for merely a catalog of white sins. But such a reading fails to account for the actual experience of Dyson’s sermon, in which a black preacher speaks to his white congregants in the most tender, intimate terms, even as he preaches against a culture of “whiteness” that “grows more shameless, more cruel, more uncaring by the day. ” Dyson is all too familiar with the claims of innocence and the kneejerk defensiveness that will surely greet this book, and yet he sets out to conquer such denial not only with the difficult truth but also, astonishingly, with love. “Beloved,” he writes, in the voice of one ministering to the sick, “your white innocence is a burden to you, a burden to the nation, a burden to our progress. It is time to let it go, to let it die in the place of the black bodies it wills into nonbeing. ” Many white readers may wince, as I did, to hear their own indifference to black suffering named with such precision, and some, desperate not to face their involvement in America’s systems of racial oppression, might abandon this book altogether. But that would be to miss an essential lesson. For again and again Dyson makes it clear that more than white guilt, he seeks action, and more than condemnation, he wants change. He wants readers to wake from their sleep of ignorance about “what it means to be black in America. ” Reading his praise for James Baldwin, I couldn’t help thinking that the same is true of Dyson himself: “His words drip with the searing eloquence of an evangelist of race determined to get to the brutal bottom of America’s original sin. ” If there is a criticism here, it is that Dyson gathers steam slowly, and his opening “Hymns of Praise” to   artists give little indication of the moral power to come. But this is a small quibble with a deeply serious, urgent book, which should take its place in the tradition of Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time” and King’s “Why We Can’t Wait. ” The comparison might at first seem hyperbolic, but like those books, “Tears We Cannot Stop” is a lament, originating from within the grieving heart of black America, aimed directly at white readers who are often too frightened, or indifferent, or ashamed, to look a man like Michael Eric Dyson in the eyes. I can only hope that others will read and be changed by this book. It ends with a desperate plea for white Americans to rise up in defense of, and in solidarity with, our   brothers and sisters. In response, I say simply: Amen.",0
7061,Look Who 97% of Donations from DOJ Employees Went To,"You are here: Home / US / Look Who 97% of Donations from DOJ Employees Went To Look Who 97% of Donations from DOJ Employees Went To October 26, 2016 Pinterest 
It will probably come as no surprise to anyone, but a huge majority of federal workers give political donations to… Democrats, namely Hillary Clinton. 
Of course this isn’t a shocker. Federal workers know their jobs will remain intact if they keep helping the people who have continued to grow government to the outrageous behemoth it has become. 
From The Hill : 
Of the roughly $2 million that federal workers from 14 agencies spent on presidential politics by the end of September, about $1.9 million, or 95 percent, went to the Democratic nominee’s campaign, according to an analysis by The Hill. 
Employees at all the agencies analyzed, without exception, are sending their campaign contributions overwhelmingly to Clinton over her Republican counterpart. Several agencies, such as the State Department, which Clinton once led, saw more than 99 percent of contributions going to Clinton. 
Employees of the Department of Justice, which investigated Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of State, gave Clinton 97 percent of their donations. Trump received $8,756 from DOJ employees compared with $286,797 for Clinton. From IRS employees, Clinton received 94 percent of donations. 
What’s even more ironic is that these people are paid with taxpayer dollars. They keep using their salaries paid for with taxpayer dollars to help elect Democrats, who keep spending taxpayer dollars to keep these people employed with cushy benefits and salaries that are higher than for the same position in the private sector. 
The only people who actually suffer, of course, are those who have to foot the bill for everything. And yes, federal workers pay taxes as well, but they are paying taxes using taxpayer dollars that pay their salaries to further push politicians that will keep increasing the size of government AND taxes and their salaries. 
It’s especially ironic that the Department of Justice spent so much on Hillary considering she has made fools of them. Obama has completely politicized the department. There is no justice at the Department of Justice anymore. They have lost all credibility thanks to Democrats, just like the FBI.",0

7063,"State that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes","State that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes 'This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority' Published: 3 mins ago About | | Archive Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Print Dr. Eric Walsh (Photo: First Liberty) 
The state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
But Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
The state’s demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
He’s getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
Walsh’s ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
Lee Rudd, the agency’s human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. 
At that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin & Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
“Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today! 
Now, in response to Walsh’s lawsuit, the state delivered a “Request for Production of Documents” that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, “copies of his sermon notes and transcripts.” 
“This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church,” said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. 
“No government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons,” said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. “I cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.” 
Officials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
Walsh’s lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
On the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
WND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parker’s actions as possibly “one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen.” 
The mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
In a prepared statement Wednesday on Walsh’s case, Welch said, “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Georgia’s demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from … us.” 
Welch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is “worse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons.” 
“First, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,” he said. “Also, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor’s preaching Bible. It’s almost as if they are ransacking the pastor’s study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America.” 
Leaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nation’s largest public policy women’s group with 500,000 members, also came to Walsh’s defense. 
Penny Nance, CEO, said: “The words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,’ still reverberate today – especially as we witness the ‘Gestapo-like’ tactics of his native state. The state of Georgia’s blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. 
“Can there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share?” 
WND reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed Walsh’s sermons and then fired him. 
“No one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon,” Dys told Fox News when the case was filed. “He was fired for something he said in a sermon. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything.” The original state investigation of Walsh’s sermons apparently was sparked by “one complaint” from an official with a county Democratic Party and “gay activist.” 
State officials also joked about informing Walsh of his firing. 
The telephone call was between Dr. Patrick O’Neal, an agency official, and Kate Pfirman, an agency financial officer. The call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. 
Pfirman said: “And I’m gonna be very – I’m gonna try to come off as very cold, because I don’t want to say very much. If I try to make it warm – I’ve thought that through, it’s gonna just not – there’s no warm way to say it anyway.” 
Then there was laughter from both parties. 
O’Neal then said to inform Walsh, “You’re out,” and there was another round of laughter. 
“It’s very funny,” Pfirman said. 
The voicemail: 
In the Houston dispute, voters ultimately soundly rejected Parker’s ordinance giving “gays” and transgendered people special rights.",0

7065,Davi at CPAC: Trump the ’Force of Nature’ America Needs to End Globalism,"Actor Robert Davi electrified the Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday with a brief speech in which he described how President Donald Trump is the “force of nature” America needs to move on from the past three decades of its adherence to globalist policies and principles. [The veteran actor and Breitbart News contributor began his speech by asking how many CPAC attendees were Trump supporters from the very first day he announced  —   a few raised their hands. When he asked how many were Trump supporters now, the room exploded in cheers.  “I’m thrilled to be here with all of you, and I have to say how moved I am to see how many young people are engaged,” Davi began. “You are the future of this country. And you’ve gotta be engaged, and you have to understand how important this moment of your history is, because this nation belongs to you. ” The   “Bond    host” continued by referring to a Breitbart News article he had written on June 16, 2015, the day that Trump announced his bid for the presidency. Davi said that former President George H. W. Bush’s 1988 campaign marked the beginning of a “shift” toward what became a   era of globalist policies that ultimately weakened the country. Davi argued that Bush’s campaign slogan, “A kinder, gentler nation,” was not the kind of message the United States needed after eight years of President Ronald Reagan’s bold reforms. “George Bush is a good man. But that was the globalist flag [being] put in the ground. That was the beginning of it all,” he said. “After Reagan we’ve had Bush, Clinton, Bush Two, Obama. We needed a force of nature to take the ship back. ” Later in his speech, Davi criticized the news media, which he said he had seen been manipulated for years. “There are good people. I respect everyone’s living, everyone’s point of view, that’s what America is about,” he said. “But I understand when I see the vitriol, and the continued misrepresentation of certain things, or the exaggeration of certain things, carried to a point that they shouldn’t be  —   and that’s what we see happening now. ” “Every media outlet is saying, ‘The first hundred days  …   ’” he added. “Well, he’s only been in office   days. It’s not a hundred days! And look what’s been accomplished! Look what the future is going to be. ” Davi concluded his speech by quoting the late Red Skelton’s commentary on the Pledge of Allegiance, suggesting that young people and unassimilated immigrants today lack the patriotism that was so vital in building the country. “‘Indivisible’  —   incapable of being divided. ‘With liberty,’ which is freedom, the right to live one’s own life without threats, fear or some form of retaliation,” Davi said. “‘Justice’  —   the principle equality of dealing fairly with others. ‘For all,’ which means boys and girls it’s as much your country as it is mine. ” He then led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance.

7066,Trump’s Presidential Cabinet Picks Leak And They Are TERRIFYING,"  
Rumors are circulating of who Donald Trump is considering to serve as his cabinet members if he wins on Tuesday, and the names on his list will chill you to the bone. 
According to several sources close to Trump, high ranking Republicans who have stood by the GOP nominee’s side throughout the campaign have made the short list. Which means, of course, that he has chosen the worst of the worst. 
NBC reports : 
“Among the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary.” 
Reince Priebus, the current RNC chairman, is also being considered as a possibility to serve as Trump’s chief of staff. He earned the favor of the bigoted billionaire by staunchly defending him time and time again when other Republicans were quick to jump ship. 
“They’re thinking, ‘We need to find that balance between someone who knows how Washington works and someone who shakes things up,'” the senior campaign adviser said. 
NBC points out that appointing Priebus as chief of staff would be “an olive branch to the establishment,” but it isn’t clear at the moment if the RNC chair would even consider taking the position. 
One veteran of the George W. Bush White House said that Trump’s transition team had convinced him that they were looking for people to fill these positions that had “experience” in Washington. 
“They’re reaching out to people with experience, they’re listening to them, they’re taking their counsel,” the former official said. “I was very impressed.” 
The NBC report did say that Trump really isn’t putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. The sources they spoke to said the Trump campaign is “focused on winning first and foremost as well and no decisions have been made or positions finalized.” Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks said that “none of this is accurate” and added that Trump “is entirely focused on the campaign and the American people.”

7068,"Police Department Is Being Evicted – Lafayette, CA","
An East Bay police department is now looking for a new office after being kicked out by their landlord.
The Lafayette Police Department is being evicted from Desco Plaza because there are not enough parking spots for all of their police cruisers. According to city manager Steven Falk, the overbearing presence of cruisers is impacting tenants in the building, affecting their ability to park their own vehicles.

Desco Plaza owner Curt Blomstrand has told the department that it must leave as soon as its lease ends at the end of the year.
In a council meeting earlier this week Blomstrand referenced “ a growing force and too many police cars crammed into his property” as reasons for evicting the department.
Each tenant gets ten parking spaces, but the department is using forty. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

7069,Roger Ailes Is Advising Donald Trump Ahead of Presidential Debates - The New York Times,"Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chairman ousted last month over charges of sexual harassment, is advising Donald J. Trump in preparation for the   presidential debates this fall. Mr. Ailes is aiding the Republican nominee as Mr. Trump turns his attention to the first debate with Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, on Sept. 26 at Hofstra University on Long Island, according to four people briefed on the move, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. Two of them said Mr. Ailes’s role could extend beyond the debates, which Mr. Trump’s advisers see as crucial to vaulting him back into strong contention for the presidency after   wounds that have eroded his standing in public opinion polls. For Mr. Ailes, being connected with Mr. Trump’s campaign could be a form of redemption after he was pushed out of the powerful network that he helped build. And for Mr. Trump, having Mr. Ailes taking a hand in his preparations for the debates adds immeasurably to the messaging and media expertise in his corner  —   and could raise alarms within Mrs. Clinton’s camp about just how aggressive Mr. Trump plans to be in those encounters. Mr. Ailes’s intimate knowledge of how Fox News approaches debates could also give Mr. Trump an important edge should one of the network’s journalists be chosen to moderate one of the three events. It was not clear when Mr. Ailes began helping the campaign. He resigned his post at Fox News on July 21 amid an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment by former female employees that occurred after a lawsuit by the former anchor Gretchen Carlson. It was also not immediately known whether Mr. Ailes, who received $40 million in an exit agreement with Fox News, would be paid for work on the campaign, or how much time he would devote to it. Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is not being paid. Susan Estrich, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Ailes, did not respond to emails and phone messages. Mr. Ailes met with Mr. Trump on Sunday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. and spoke about a range of matters related to the presidential race, including campaign advertisements, according to a person briefed on the discussion. In a telephone interview late Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said Mr. Ailes was not formally involved in his debate preparations, and chafed at the suggestion that he even needed to prepare for them. “I’ll speak with Roger, but this is not a formal thing,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t have a debate coach. I’ve never had a debate coach. ” He insisted that Mr. Ailes had “no role. ” Before he founded Fox News in 1996, Mr. Ailes spent years as a respected political strategist with a pit bull style. He was a top adviser to Richard M. Nixon’s presidential campaign in 1968, softening the candidate’s   unapproachable image. He was also a   debate coach, working with President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and readying Vice President George Bush for debates with Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988. According to Gabriel Sherman’s 2014 book on Mr. Ailes, “The Loudest Voice in the Room,” Mr. Ailes played a crucial role before Reagan’s second debate with Vice President Walter F. Mondale in 1984. During a prep session, he asked Reagan, who had performed badly in the first debate, how he would handle being asked about his age. The question came quickly, and Reagan’s answer, which went down in the annals of witty debate lines, effectively quashed the subject: “I will not make age an issue of this campaign,” he said. “I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent’s youth and inexperience. ” In 1988, Mr. Ailes was enlisted for an image makeover of Mr. Bush, urging the patrician Republican to model himself after the actor Gary Cooper. In debate prep, Mr. Ailes launched rapid questions at Mr. Bush to hone his reflexes, and directed the candidate to slow his sentences and deepen his voice, according to Mr. Sherman’s book. Mr. Ailes also worked on   political races, including the unsuccessful New York City mayoral campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1989. Mr. Giuliani has emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s most devoted surrogates in the presidential campaign. Mr. Ailes and Mr. Trump themselves have a long relationship, although it became fraught at points during the Republican primaries. Still, Mr. Ailes’s involvement is certain to stoke controversy, both for the ongoing sexual harassment cases and for the role that Fox News played in covering Mr. Trump’s candidacy  —   and elevating him as a potential presidential candidate beginning in 2011. One of Mr. Trump’s   and   campaign controversies was a dispute with the Fox News host Megyn Kelly, with whom he clashed angrily beginning with the first Republican primary debate a year ago. Afterward, Mr. Trump implied that she had been agitated during the first Republican debate because she was menstruating. Mr. Trump insisted that Ms. Kelly had treated him unfairly and berated the network for suggesting that she moderate at a later debate. The dispute led Mr. Trump to skip the final debate before the Iowa caucuses, which Ms. Kelly helped moderate on Fox News. Notably, when Mr. Ailes left the network in July, Mr. Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, denied suggestions that Mr. Ailes would be advising the campaign  —   but the candidate left the door open. Asked  by Chuck Todd of NBC News on July 24 whether Mr. Ailes was going to advise the campaign, Mr. Trump replied: “I don’t want to comment. But he’s been a friend of mine for a long time. ” He called Mr. Ailes a “very, very good person” and said, “A lot of people are thinking he’s going to run my campaign. ” Mr. Ailes brings enormous experience in preparing for presidential debates, but his addition to Mr. Trump’s team also raises intriguing questions. Mr. Trump’s support among female voters has eroded during the course of his campaign, after a number of incendiary statements. Mr. Trump’s challenge during the crowded Republican primary debates was far less pronounced than it will be in what could be a    against Mrs. Clinton over 90 minutes. He was one of 10 candidates onstage and could often filibuster his way through questions or avoid them entirely as his rivals consumed airtime  —   an approach that would be untenable in a    or even a   matchup including the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson. What is more, some of Mr. Trump’s worst moments in the primary debates involved Ms. Kelly and Carly Fiorina, the only woman in the Republican nomination contest. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly swatted away accusations of sexism during the campaign, will probably require coaching on how to handle the potential first female president in a debate. Whether Mr. Ailes can best address that concern is unclear. He is deeply familiar with Republican lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton, and with the controversies that have surrounded her and her husband going back to their days in the White House. But even before the sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Ailes, there were questions about whether he had adequately defended Ms. Kelly in her fight against Mr. Trump in 2015.",0
7070,Studie beweist: Indianer kennen doch Schmerz,"Donnerstag, 27. Oktober 2016 Studie beweist: Indianer kennen doch Schmerz New Haven/Connecticut (Archiv) - ""Ein Indianer kennt keinen Schmerz"": Diese Worte bekommen kleine Kinder immer dann zu hören, wenn sie tapfer sein sollen. Wissenschaftler der Universität Yale haben den Wahrheitsgehalt des alten Sprichwortes nun an 1000 amerikanischen Ureinwohnern untersucht – und konnten es eindrucksvoll widerlegen. Offenbar sind Indianer genauso schmerzempfindlich wie jeder andere auch. Dr. Dwight Ewing, der Initiator der Studie, erklärte auf einer Pressekonferenz: ""Egal, ob wir unseren zahlreichen Probanden mit einem Hammer auf die Hand schlugen, sie an den Haaren zogen oder ihnen gar Salz in die Augen streuten, sie reagierten nicht anders, als man erwarten würde."" Will unbedingt weiterforschen: Dr. Dwight Ewing Auch die Zugehörigkeit zu einem bestimmten Stamm oder das Alter habe keinen Einfluss darauf, wie gut man einen Tritt in die Leistengegend oder eine zünftige Backpfeife verkraftet: ""Junge Apachen schreien genauso laut wie alte, weise Komanchen-Medizinmänner, wenn sie wegen eines Stocks in den Speichen vom Rad stürzen"", sagte Ewing. Das Fazit der Studie lautete daher, dass das Sprichwort unwahr ist – oder es müsste wortwörtlich genommen werden, woraus folgen würde, dass tatsächlich nur ""EIN Indianer"" keinen Schmerz kennt. Um diesen einen schmerzunempfindlichen Indianer zu finden, hat Ewing seine Feldversuche nun auf unbestimmte Zeit verlängert. ssi; Foto rechts: © S.

7071,"Edward Snowden, Over 100 Activists Call for Trump to Drop Charges Against Julian Assange - Breitbart","Edward Snowden and over 100 other activists called for President Trump to drop charges brought against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. [The Guardian reports that over 100 activists have signed an open letter calling for President Trump to drop any possible charges being brought against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. “A threat to WikiLeaks’ work  —   which is publishing information protected under the First Amendment  —   is a threat to all free journalism,” the open letter reads.  The open letter, created by the Courage Foundation, warns that criminalizing a journalist or their work can lead to the criminalization of all journalism. “If the DoJ is able to convict a publisher for its journalistic work, all free journalism can be criminalized,” the letter claims. The Courage Foundation is a supporter of whistleblowers, raising funds to cover the legal costs of individuals such as Edward Snowden. “We call on you as President of the United States to close the Grand Jury investigation into WikiLeaks and drop any charges planned against any member of WikiLeaks,” the letter reads. “It was a free and robust press that provided you with a platform on which to run for president. ” “Defending a truly free press requires freedom from fear and favour and the support of journalists and citizens everywhere for the kind of threat now facing WikiLeaks  —   and all publishers and journalists  —   is a step into the darkness,” it continues. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was asked at a press conference in April if arresting Julian Assange was a priority for the Trump administration, to which Sessions replied, “We are going to step up our effort, and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks. ” “This is a matter that’s gone beyond anything I’m aware of. We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks, and some of them are quite serious,” he continued to say. “So yes, it is a priority. We’ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail. ” Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, has argued that prosecuting Assange could set a dangerous precedent. “Never in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for presenting truthful information to the public,” Wizner told CNN in April. “Any prosecution of WikiLeaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other news organizations. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

7072,Comment on The Tragically Hip’s Gord Downie: A True Canadian Hero by The Tragically Hip’s Gord Downie: A True Canadian Hero - New Earth Media,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter For those of you who have no clue who Gord Downie is, you are likely either not Canadian, or were born after the 90s. Gord Downie is the front man for the iconic Canadian band, The Tragically Hip . This band lives in the hearts of millions of Canadians and they are something we can basically call our own, as for some unknown reason they never really made it big anywhere else. It was recently announced that Gord Downie had been diagnosed with stage 4 terminal brain cancer. In the true spirit of the band, they decided to do one final farewell tour across Canada so that all of their loyal fans could enjoy the energy, performance, and great music, live on stage, one last time. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) even aired the final show, in the band’s hometown of Kingston, Ontario. The Tragically Hip is such a big part of being Canadian that our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was even there, singing along.   So, by now you may or may not be wondering why I am calling Gord Downie a real Canadian hero. Yes, his music touched the hearts of millions, but it is because of how he has used his voice, time and time again, for the voiceless. Gord Downie stands up for those who are often not heard and advocates to bring awareness to a dark part of Canadian history and issues that are currently plaguing the First Nations people of Canada. At the end of their very last show, Gord Downie didn’t draw attention to his own illness, and didn’t ask for money to be raised for cancer charities. Instead, Gord Downie addressed Canada’s new Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, and vocalized his fears that the Indigenous people of Canada are perhaps in more dire straits today than they have ever been. He said he believed that Trudeau could help bring about meaningful change and called upon all Canadians to “be more mindful of northern affairs.” This meant the world to thousands of Indigenous people across the country, as this performance and announcement was broadcast on live television with millions of people tuning in. Leaders in the Indigenous population say Downie’s words are accurate and thanked him for taking the time out of his final performance to speak up for their community across the country despite his own struggle. The Secret Path From the Secret Path website: “Gord Downie began Secret Path as ten poems incited by the story of Chanie Wenjack, a twelve year-old boy who died fifty years ago on October 22, 1966, in flight from the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario, walking home to the family he was taken from over 400 miles away. Gord was introduced to Chanie Wenjack (miscalled “Charlie” by his teachers) by Mike Downie, his brother, who shared with him Ian Adams’ Maclean ’s story from February 6, 1967, “The Lonely Death of Charlie Wenjack.””   The stories Gord’s poems tell were fleshed into the ten songs of Secret Path with producers Kevin Drew and Dave Hamelin. Recording took place over two sessions at the Bathouse in Bath, Ontario, in November and December, 2013. The music features Downie on vocals and guitars, with Drew and Hamelin playing all other instruments, except guest contributions by Charles Spearin (bass), Ohad Benchetrit (lap steel/guitar), Kevin Hearn (piano), and Dave “Billy Ray” Koster (drums). In winter 2014, Gord and Mike brought the recently finished music to comic artist Jeff Lemire for his help illustrating Chanie’s story, bringing him and the many children like him to life. Secret Path acknowledges a dark part of Canada’s history – the long-supressed mistreatment of Indigenous children and families by the Residential school system – with the hope of starting our country on a road to reconciliation.” This ten song album was released by Arts & Crafts accompanied by Leire’seighty-eight page graphic novel published by Simon & Schuster Canada. Secret Path was released on October 18th of this year in a deluxe vinyl and book edition and as a book with album download. Downie’s music and Lemire’s illustrations inspired The Secret Path , an animated film was broadcast by CBC in an hour-long commercial-free television special on Sunday, October 23. The Secret Path and Road to Reconciliation panel discussion can be watched at cbc.ca/secretpath . What Can You Do? Proceeds from the sale of Secret Path will be donated to the Gord Downie Secret Path Fund for Truth and Reconciliation via The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR) at the University of Manitoba. Money is also being raised for the Gord Downie and Charlie Wenjack Fund that focuses on cross-cultural education to support the healing and recovery of the Indigenous population, as well as directly supporting the NCTR. You can purchase a copy of the book, album, or film to support this initiative directly, or simply donate by following this link .

7073,Australia Is Worried Foreign Migrants Are Coming,"Sputnik reports: 
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the government is set to present a parliamentary bill to amend the Migration Act , and prevent adults who are sent to Australia’s offshore immigration centers from receiving an Australian visa in the future. 
“This will send the strongest possible signal to the people smugglers, it will send the strongest possible signal to those who are seeking to persuade persons currently on Nauru and Manus (the islands where Australia’s immigration centers are located) that the Australian government will change its mind and allow them to settle here,” Turnbull said. 
Australian barrister Greg Barns, spokesman for the Australian Lawyers Alliance, told Radio Sputnik that the proposal breaches the UN Refugee Convention. This declares that refugees are entitled to claim asylum regardless of their method of reaching a country, if they say they have been persecuted in their country of origin. The government’s plan would prevent migrants from visiting Australia many years later, while on business or as tourists, even if they have successfully settled in a third country and gained citizenship there. 
“It’s the most draconian legislation the world has ever seen, it’s unprecedented in global terms, and it means that Australia puts itself, yet again, in the basket of pariah states when it comes to those sorts of issues ,” Barns said. 
Turnbull’s Liberal Party will require the support of opposition parties to pass the legislation. While Bill Shorten, leader of Australia’s opposition Labor Party, said the proposal “seems ridiculous,” his party stopped short of rejecting it and instead promised to examine the plan closely. 
“Unfortunately the opposition Labor Party in Australia has been very weak on these issues in recent years, and both the major political parties, the conservatives (Australia’s Liberal Party) and the Labor Party, have been able to force these sorts of changes on Australian policy,” Barns told Sputnik. 
“There have been suggestions today that the Labor Party might finally get some backbone and oppose this legislation, because if the Labor Party, which is the major opposition party, supports this legislation, then it will become a reality.” 
The government’s claim that their proposal is compliant with international law is “laughable,” and “shows yet again that Australia snubs its nose at international law when it suits it,” Barns said. 
Barns said that Australia’s immigration policy has become harsher as a result of public fears of migration, and the actions of successive government which have played on these fears. 
“Some Australians have a xenophobic, racist view about the rest of the world, they have this ridiculous fear about hordes coming to this island continent and invading it, that’s been historic.” 
“If you don’t have strong political leadership which says that we can do better, this will become politically popular,” said Barns, who contrasted the current policy with that of Malcom Fraser’s 1970’s Liberal government, which accepted large numbers of refugees who came on boats from Vietnam. 
Since the government of John Howard from 1996 to 2007, “successive governments in Australia have pandered to the xenophobic, racist side of the country, and that’s precisely what Malcolm Turnbull is doing with this legislation.” 
“Australia is a nation built on migration, and in fact some of the leading figures in Australian society came here by boat. Those very same people now would be banned under this law.” 
Turnbull’s proposal has won the praise of Australia’s right-wing populist One Nation party, led by Pauline Hanson, who won re-election to Australia’s House of Representatives this year. Good to see that it looks like the Government is now taking its cues from One Nation. Just like last time. #auspol #PHON #Nauru #Manus https://t.co/c0GQew7vR8 
— Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) 30 October 2016 
Barns said that Turnbull’s proposal is an effort to attract votes from Hanson’s One Nation to the conservative Liberal Party. 
“Malcolm Turnbull’s party wants to try and take over some of its vote, and it seems to be that this is the way to do it. To pass outrageous, draconian laws that trash Australia’s reputation even further in world eyes when it comes to refugees, simply for short-term political gain.”",0
7074,NBA Team Cancels Anthem Singer After She Tries Wearing Controversial Race Shirt Onto Court,"“I was never given any kind of dress code. I was never asked beforehand to show my wardrobe.” Streeter (left) and the 76ers home court at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia 
“I also felt it was important to express the ongoing challenges and ongoing injustice we face as a black community within the United States of America — that’s very important to me,” Streeter said. “Yes, we live in the greatest country in the world but there are issues that we cannot ignore. This can’t be ignored.” Advertisement - story continues below 
“I was angry, extremely, extremely angry and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it. It broke my heart,” she said. “Honestly, I was very excited about being able to perform the national anthem. I was really looking forward to that.” 
Firstly, pro tip: The more times you say “honestly” about something, the more it becomes exponentially less likely to the listener that they will believe you’re being honest. In this case, I believe Streeter honestly wanted to make a point, not sing the national anthem, which is the matter of contention here. 
The national anthem is sung to honor the heroes who have served (and died) for our country before major events. It isn’t time to make a point or “have a discussion” (a discussion, may I add, that usually takes the form of a monologue from whatever social justice warrior is giving it — who usually acts surprised and disappointed when people have a real discussion and push back against their disrespect of the flag). 
If you’re singing the national anthem, it isn’t about your opinions. It isn’t about your talent. It isn’t about what you’ve done. Advertisement - story continues below",0
7075,A Defiant Israel Vows to Expand Its Settlements - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   Undeterred by a resounding defeat at the United Nations, Israel’s government said Monday that it would move ahead with thousands of new homes in East Jerusalem and warned nations against further action, declaring that Israel does not “turn the other cheek. ” Just a few days after the United Nations Security Council voted to condemn Israeli settlements, Jerusalem’s municipal government signaled that it would not back down: The city intends to approve 600 housing units in the predominantly Palestinian eastern section of town on Wednesday in what a top official called a first installment on 5, 600 new homes. The defiant posture reflected a bristling anger among Israel’s   political leaders, who not only blamed the United States for failing to block the Council resolution, but also claimed to have secret intelligence showing that President Obama’s team had orchestrated it. American officials strongly denied the claim, but the sides seem poised for more weeks of conflict until Mr. Obama hands over the presidency to Donald J. Trump. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at Security Council countries by curbing diplomatic contacts, recalling envoys, cutting off aid and summoning the American ambassador for a scolding. He canceled a planned visit this week by Ukraine’s prime minister even as he expressed concern on Monday that Mr. Obama was planning more action at the United Nations before his term ends next month. The prime minister defended his retaliation. “Israel is a country with national pride, and we do not turn the other cheek,” he said. “This is a responsible, measured and vigorous response, the natural response of a healthy people that is making it clear to the nations of the world that what was done at the U. N. is unacceptable to us. ” The Security Council resolution that passed Friday condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as a “flagrant violation under international law” and an obstacle to peace. The Council approved it 14 to 0, with the United States abstaining instead of using its unilateral veto, as it has in the past. Mr. Trump publicly pressed for a veto of the resolution and has chosen a settlement advocate as his administration’s ambassador to Israel. He turned to Twitter on Monday night to air complaints that the United Nations “is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. ” Palestinian leaders made clear that they would use the resolution in international bodies to press their case against Israel. With the imprimatur of a United Nations finding of illegality, they said, they will campaign to require that other countries not just label products made in the settlements, but ban them. “Now we can talk about the boycott of all settlements, the companies that work with them, et cetera, and actually take legal action against them if they continue to work with them,” Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, was quoted as saying by the Palestinian news media. He outlined other steps the Palestinians could now take, using the resolution to press the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders, file lawsuits on behalf of specific Palestinians displaced by settlements and urge the international authorities to determine whether Israel is violating the Geneva Conventions. “We are looking to devise a comprehensive vision, and hopefully 2017 will be the year when the Israeli occupation ends,” Mr. Malki said. Israeli officials said such pronouncements showed that the resolution actually undermined chances for a negotiated settlement because the Palestinians now have less incentive to come to the table. By declaring Israeli settlements illegal, they said, the United Nations essentially took away the one chip that Israel had to trade, meaning land. “The Palestinians are waging a diplomatic and legal war against Israel. That’s the strategy,” Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, said in a phone interview. “Their strategy is not to negotiate an agreement with Israel because a deal is give and take. They want take and take. ” Israel’s settlement project, once a scattering of houses across the   Green Line marking the borders before the 1967   war, has grown substantially over the years. In 2009, the year Mr. Obama took office, 297, 000 people lived in West Bank settlements and 193, 737 in East Jerusalem. That increased to 386, 000 in the West Bank by the end of last year and 208, 000 in East Jerusalem by the end of 2014, according to Peace Now, a group that opposes settlements. Israeli officials note that when Mr. Netanyahu acquiesced to a   settlement freeze sought by Mr. Obama in 2009, the Palestinians still did not agree to negotiate until just before time ran out. But the addition of more than 100, 000 settlers during Mr. Obama’s tenure convinced him that it was time to change his approach at the United Nations, aides said. The 618 housing units to be granted building permits in East Jerusalem on Wednesday have been in the works for a while, and the planning committee meeting agenda was set before the United Nations acted. But the committee chairman said he was determined to go forward with units totaling 5, 600. “I won’t get worked up over the U. N. or any other organization that might try to dictate to us what to do in Jerusalem,” Deputy Mayor Meir Turgeman, the planning committee chairman, told the newspaper Israel Hayom. “I hope that the government and the new administration in the United States will give us momentum to continue. ” Although he did not specify which projects he had in mind, Ir Amim, a private group tracking settlements in East Jerusalem, said he was probably referring to projects in Gilo and Givat Hamatos. Betty Herschman, the group’s director of international relations and advocacy, said it was “defiance demonstrated after Trump’s election, now reinforced by the U. N. resolution. ” Anat Ben Nun, the director of development and external relations for Peace Now, said such construction was problematic. “Netanyahu’s attempt to avenge the U. N. S. C. resolution through approval of plans beyond the Green Line will only harm Israelis and Palestinians by making it more difficult to arrive at a   solution,” she said. Israeli leaders said they had no reason to stop building. The Security Council resolution “was absurd and totally removed from reality,” said Oded Revivi, chief foreign envoy for the Yesha Council, which represents West Bank settlers. “Israeli building policies are set in Jerusalem, not New York. ” For the fourth day, Israeli officials accused Mr. Obama’s team of ambushing them at the United Nations. While the White House denied it, Israeli officials pointed to a meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his New Zealand counterpart a month before the Council vote discussing a resolution on the   conflict. New Zealand was a sponsor of Friday’s measure. Mr. Dermer, the ambassador, said Israel had other, nonpublic information proving the Obama administration’s involvement but provided no evidence and would not elaborate beyond saying it would be provided to Mr. Trump’s team when he takes office. “They not only did not get up and stop it, they were behind it from the beginning,” Mr. Dermer said. “This is why the prime minister is so angry. We’re going to stand up against it. ” Israeli officials worried that Mr. Kerry would use a coming speech or a conference in France to outline an American peace plan that would be hostile to Israel’s interests. Mr. Kerry’s office had no comment. The fury of Mr. Netanyahu’s response has generated debate at home. Mitchell Barak, a political consultant, said the political left considered the resolution “an epic foreign policy and diplomatic debacle” by Mr. Netanyahu. But to his base, the Security Council action confirmed what they believed all along, that Mr. Obama is inherently   and so the prime minister comes across as a champion beset by enemies. “For them,” Mr. Barak said, “Netanyahu emerges from this unscathed, as the lone wolf in a lion’s den of hatred. ”",0
7076,GABRIEL: Terror: The Consequence of Apathy - Breitbart,"Equally infuriating to a radical Islamist killing innocent children at a pop concert in Manchester, is the very likely possibility that it will not be the last time. [We’ve seen this tragic routine before: a radical Islamist wages violent Jihad against the Western world and, after a few days of cliché sloganeering and useless hashtags, all is forgotten.  Well, for the parents and loved ones of those who were killed, all is not forgotten. They will live forever with a hole in their hearts that can never be filled. These are the consequences of open borders, and the willingness of a society to bury its head in the sand while attempting to shame and silence anyone who dares speak the truth. The truth is this: when you flood your country with millions of   migrants from the Islamic world, you shouldn’t be “shocked” when your society acquires the same problems as the Islamic world. One plus one equals two. We can have borders, or we can have terror. No, there is no third option. This is the real world, not a sociology lecture, or CNN. You cannot force Islamists to assimilate because Islamists do not value the same things we do in the West. While most in the West view an Ariana Grande concert as an opportunity for young girls to have a fun night of singing and dancing with their friends, many in the Islamic world views it as a shameful display of dirty infidels, who deserve death for their indulgence. Manchester bomber Salman Abedi’s parents were Libyan “refugees. ” He was given refuge and even tax dollars of the very parents whose daughters he killed. Jihadists are not impressed by Katy Perry’s almost instantaneous call for “no borders” and “ ” in response to the Manchester massacre. They are emboldened by it. She, and every other pompously ignorant celebrity like her, are worse than useless. They are useful for our enemies. This pacifistic, “let’s all hold hands” reaction to the death of innocent children perfectly encapsulates why the West remains a giant sitting duck for radical Islamists. Imagine the disbelief our enemies must be feeling about how easy it is to wage war on a society that seeks to fight them with tolerance. Even after one of their caliphate soldiers bombs a teenage pop concert, one of the most popular singers on the planet welcomes more Islamists to our shores with open arms. But we shouldn’t make Katy Perry feel like the lone wolf in her suicidal delusions. After all, we’re only 6 months removed from a kumbaya President that fought ISIS with a live serenade of “You’ve Got a Friend” by James Taylor. While I, like most Americans, fear another deadly Islamic terror attack, the mainstream media’s biggest concern is  —   that’s right, you guessed it  —   “Islamophobia. ” Martha Raddatz, who gained notoriety for her appallingly biased Presidential debate moderation, lamented to George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s Good Morning America, “This is likely to fuel   backlash across Britain, across Europe. ” Don’t worry Martha, chances are there will still be plenty of niqabs worn in Manchester long after the carnage of young children is removed from the concert venue, and we have open border propagandists to thank for that. Unfortunately, for those who actually want to protect ourselves and our children from Jihadists, nitwitted celebrities and media pundits aren’t the only problem.   groups like the SPLC and ACLU have volunteered themselves to be useful idiots for radical Islamic outfits like CAIR, a notorious Muslim Brotherhood front group that has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted   in a   operation. Their strategy? To smear, intimidate, bully, and ultimately silence anyone who gets in the way of their   agenda. They are counting on patriotic Americans to stay silent and seated, while their   agenda marches on. Are we really going to let these open borders fanatics do to America what they’ve done to Europe? Are we really going to allow terrorist attacks to become the norm in America, as they are the in the Islamic world and, increasingly, Europe? Let the goons at the SPLC and the mainstream media call me what they want, I know what I am. I am an American who loves her country, and doesn’t want to see it diminished to the same rubble I laid under when Islamists blew up my home as a little girl. For those who want to do more than just tweet their outrage, who want to make their country, community, and family a safer place to call home, I invite you to join me, and every other   patriot at ACT for America’s National Conference this coming October in Arlington, Virginia.

7078,What We Know About the Details of the Police Shooting in Charlotte - The New York Times,"CHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   The fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott here on Tuesday afternoon has sparked outrage and concern, and set off, once again, a national conversation about the treatment of minorities by the police. The details of the case have also been a source of intense debate. Here are some questions that readers have asked reporters at The New York Times since Mr. Scott’s death. Why did police officers confront Mr. Scott? Two officers with the   Police Department determined that Mr. Scott, 43, was a potential threat to public safety because they saw him with two items: what they believed was a marijuana cigarette and a gun, according to a statement released on Saturday by the department. The plainclothes officers, who had been near Mr. Scott’s home to serve a warrant on another person, first noticed Mr. Scott when he parked his S. U. V. next to their unmarked police vehicle, which was in his apartment complex in Charlotte’s University City neighborhood. The department said in a statement that its officers initially saw Mr. Scott “rolling what they believed to be a marijuana ‘blunt,’” but ignored the behavior and went about their business. Later, one of the officers, Brentley Vinson, 26, said he saw Mr. Scott “hold a gun up,” the statement said. (A separate statement issued by the city on Tuesday said that Mr. Scott “exited the vehicle armed with a firearm,” and that officers approached him after he got back inside his white S. U. V.) After seeing the gun, the authorities said on Saturday, the officers decided to approach Mr. Scott, but they first left the area to don safety vests that identified them as the police. They returned to the vicinity of his S. U. V. and “again” saw Mr. Scott with a gun. What do the police say about why Officer Vinson fired upon Mr. Scott? Body and dashboard camera footage released on Saturday provided no clear evidence that Mr. Scott had a gun. In the video, Mr. Scott’s arms were at his sides and he was backing away from his vehicle when he was shot. In its statement on Saturday, the department said the officers gave “clear, loud and repeated verbal commands” to Mr. Scott that he should drop his handgun. When Mr. Scott did not, the department said, Officer Vinson “perceived Mr. Scott’s actions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and the other officers” and opened fire. The State Bureau of Investigation is leading an inquiry into the shooting. Although the Charlotte police chief, Kerr Putney, said on Saturday that Officer Vinson was “absolutely not being charged by me at this point,” the decision about whether the officer will face prosecution will ultimately fall to others. “If there was a weapon in his hand, then the case for using lethal force becomes stronger,” said Kami Chavis, a law professor who is the director of the criminal justice program at Wake Forest University in   N. C. But she also noted that there have been cases in which a person was unarmed “but it was determined that a reasonable officer could have viewed whatever it was in their hands as a weapon. ” In many of those cases, officers were cleared of criminal conduct. “Even if the officer was mistaken about what he had in his hand, and yet it was reasonable, it could be deemed a justified shooting,” Professor Chavis said. Some critics argue that the police overreacted. “It seems there were multiple opportunities to do this in a   way, and it seems like everything they did in response was escalating,” said Mark Dorosin, the managing lawyer at the University of North Carolina Center for Civil Rights. “I think there’s an argument to be made that they exceeded their authority. ” What evidence do the police say shows that Mr. Scott had a gun? Chief Putney has flatly and repeatedly said that Mr. Scott had a gun, but he also acknowledged that no recording exists to definitively prove the department’s account. The police statement on Saturday said that crime scene investigators recovered a loaded gun at the scene and that a forensic analysis revealed Mr. Scott’s DNA and fingerprints on the weapon. The police also released a photograph of the gun, as well as one of an ankle holster they said Mr. Scott was wearing. The police have not said where they recovered the weapon, but the photograph of the gun shows it resting on asphalt, next to an evidence marker. In the short video that Scott family lawyers made public on Friday, Mr. Scott’s wife, Rakeyia, can be heard telling the officers: “Don’t shoot him. He has no weapon. ” In an interview on Friday, the family’s lawyers said Ms. Scott was unaware that Mr. Scott owned a firearm. And one of his children said numerous times in a cellphone video she recorded in the aftermath of the shooting that he did not have a gun. Critics have accused officers of planting the gun. If Mr. Scott had a gun, was that allowed under federal and North Carolina laws? No. Although the North Carolina Supreme Court has recognized a general right to carry a firearm openly for nearly 100 years, there are exceptions, including ones related to criminal history, drug use or immigration status, under federal and state laws. Mr. Scott effectively forfeited his right to carry a gun in 2005, when he was convicted in the shooting of a man in San Antonio and sentenced to prison. Police officers on the scene last week in Charlotte almost certainly did not know about Mr. Scott’s legal history before they confronted him. A number of critics have wondered why officers would confront a man with a gun in an   state. But experts said it was not unreasonable for officers to investigate Mr. Scott’s possession of a firearm, even in a state that allows open carry, if they also believed he had marijuana. “If you see a person with drugs in one hand and a firearm in the other, I think that gives you a basis for thinking that a violation of federal law has occurred, and there might also be state crimes,” said Jeffrey B. Welty, an associate professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “If it is the case, as the police have represented, that they confronted a person who had drugs and a weapon at the same time, then no, I don’t think there’s any question that that set of facts would support an investigative stop or an effort to speak further with that person,” he said. Does North Carolina permit marijuana? North Carolina law forbids possession of marijuana, but the police said on Saturday that the officers did not “consider Mr. Scott’s drug activity to be a priority” and approached him only after seeing the firearm. If Mr. Scott had been arrested for drug possession, the severity of the charge would have depended on the quantity of marijuana seized by the police. If he had enough for only one cigarette, the charge would have been a misdemeanor. The police have not explained why or how they assumed, from inside their unmarked vehicle, that Mr. Scott was rolling marijuana while sitting in the driver’s seat of his own vehicle. Did Mr. Scott have a book? Although the police say Mr. Scott was holding a gun before he was shot, friends and family members have said that he actually had a book with him. At least one sign at the protests that swept through Charlotte last week declared, “IT WAS A BOOK. ” Chief Putney said no book was recovered from the scene. What do we know about Officer Vinson? Three facts seem particularly noteworthy about Officer Vinson: He is relatively new to the police force, he has a clean disciplinary history and he is, like Mr. Scott,  . Officer Vinson, a member of a   unit in the department’s metro division, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, a standard procedure here and across the country. The police said he joined the department in 2014, and has never been disciplined. Officer Vinson grew up in Charlotte, where, according to a profile published in 2012 in The Charlotte News and Advance, his father was the first black homicide detective on the police force here. As a high school student, Officer Vinson talked of a career in law enforcement and said he wanted to become a federal marshal. Over six feet tall, Officer Vinson’s formidable size served him as a college football player. After playing at Fork Union Military Academy, he enrolled at Liberty University, the Christian college founded by the evangelist Jerry Falwell. Officer Vinson graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and a master’s degree in executive leadership. What did Mr. Scott’s wife mean when she yelled, just before the shooting, “Keith, don’t do it”? This phrase, a variation of which Ms. Scott yells out numerous times in the cellphone video she made of the episode, has been the subject of intense speculation. Because Ms. Scott’s video is jerky and flits around the scene of the confrontation, it is hard to say what action Ms. Scott is asking her husband not to engage in. In the video, Ms. Scott can be heard telling her husband to get out of the S. U. V. so that the police will not break its windows. “Keith, don’t do it,” she says, while her husband is still inside the S. U. V. “Keith, get out the car! Keith, Keith, don’t you do it! Don’t you do it!” At that point, Mr. Scott can be seen getting out of the car. “Keith, Keith, Keith! Don’t you do it!” she says. Just as she finishes the sentence, the four shots ring out. Justin Bamberg, one of the lawyers for the family, said the statement was an effort to get Mr. Scott to stand still after he got out of the car. The dashboard camera video shows Mr. Scott walking backward before he is shot. What was Mr. Scott’s mental and physical state when the police confronted him? This is difficult to say conclusively, but some facts suggest that Mr. Scott may have been impaired in numerous ways. He suffered a traumatic brain injury last fall when he was involved in a motorcycle accident, neighbors and lawyers for his family said. His wife told officers during the confrontation that he had a “T. B. I. ,” or traumatic brain injury, and that he “just took his medicine. ” The family’s lawyers said they did not know what kind of medication he had taken. A photo of the marijuana cigarette released by the police on Saturday suggested that it had been smoked. Did the police offer medical assistance after the shooting? The Police Department said that officers performed CPR, but the footage that the authorities released on Saturday did not confirm or refute that assertion. The body camera recording showed that immediately after Mr. Scott was handcuffed, an officer asked for a bag and “some equipment. ” He soon added, as he gestured with a bloodied hand, “Get some gloves. We need to hold the wound. ” Mr. Scott was pronounced dead at a hospital later on Tuesday.",0
7079,"A Must-Win Debate for Donald Trump, but Not a Must-Rehearse One - The New York Times","To prepare for Sunday night’s town   debate, Hillary Clinton is not dwelling on   plans or attack lines. Instead, she is holed up with aides to practice her body language, facial expressions, vocal cadences and more conversational answers about college debt, the heroin epidemic and other topics that have come up at her campaign events and that have allowed her to show empathy and emotion along with policy knowledge. Donald J. Trump scoffs at all that. “I don’t need to rehearse being human,” he said in an interview last week. He and his advisers say that Sunday night’s town   format, with its open stage and questions from real voters, will showcase his comfort on television and his direct style, which they see as appealing to voters who are turned off by what they call Mrs. Clinton’s canned warmth. “After decades in public life, Hillary Clinton is still ‘finding her voice,’” said Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager for Mr. Trump. “For her to have to come from behind the comfort of the podium is fraught with peril. ” Both campaigns say the town   exchanges with voters will reveal  —   for better or for worse  —   “the real Clinton” and “the real Trump. ” But it is Mr. Trump who faces graver political consequences if he does not show the best of himself, according to several of his allies and advisers. His performance in the first debate was widely criticized after he seemed to struggle to stay focused and to keep to the debating points and tactics that his advisers had given him. They are now preparing him again, somewhat differently than before, but with the same uncertainty about whether he can follow through. Some of his advisers fear that Mr. Trump’s fiery style could create uncomfortable moments with undecided voters in the debate hall at Washington University in St. Louis. The two candidates will take a mix of questions from voters and from the moderators, Martha Raddatz of ABC and Anderson Cooper of CNN. Mrs. Clinton’s polished and disciplined performance in the first debate helped give her a boost in some national and battleground state polls. The trend has Trump advisers acknowledging privately that Sunday’s debate is a   for their candidate. Only a strong performance will offer Mr. Trump hope of reversing his slide and starting a   effort to persuade undecided voters that he is qualified to be president. “He understands this debate is very important for him,” said Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is a senior adviser to Mr. Trump and is helping prepare him for Sunday. For Mrs. Clinton, the town   event provides her biggest venue yet to try to project a softer side and to improve her likability. A majority of voters tell pollsters that they distrust and dislike Mrs. Clinton, a reality that could hurt turnout and, if she prevails in November, hamper her presidency. For all the praise for Mrs. Clinton’s performance in the first debate, her surgical takedown of Mr. Trump did little to change voters’ perceptions of her. But, in contrast to Mr. Trump, who prefers big rallies, Mrs. Clinton has interacted regularly with voters during her campaign, and some of her most powerful moments have come in those settings. At a town   event in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton became teary and embraced a    girl who said she had been bullied at school. And just before the New Hampshire primary, in response to a question from a rabbi, Mrs. Clinton delivered an extended    riff about her own spiritual journey. “She likes answering questions from individual citizens and she listens and relates to people,” said John D. Podesta, the campaign chairman for Mrs. Clinton. “That’s a format that Donald Trump isn’t as used to. ” But the audience of undecided voters who will ask half of the questions on Sunday will not be as friendly as the supporters who asked Mrs. Clinton questions at campaign stops. Her efforts to seem sincere and personable may also collide with Mr. Trump’s efforts to score points against her for her use of a private email server as secretary of state her oversight during the attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya and her ties to wealthy donors to her family foundation. “It helps if you’ve been subjected to questions from normal people during the campaign, which of course Donald Trump has not, but it’s not the same,” said Mickey Kantor, a longtime adviser to former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Kantor said that having a moderator, an opponent and a television audience of potentially 80 million viewers made it almost impossible to prepare. “You can’t just take a question and run off to your talking points,” Mr. Kantor said. Advisers say Mr. Trump must alternate between personable and piercing during the   debate. They want him to show interest, empathy, and even some humility, in his exchanges with the audience, while hammering Mrs. Clinton in a way that is not too  . “It’s just harder to attack when nice, undecided voters are all around you,” Mr. Giuliani said. “It’s easier to do when people are sitting in a dark hall and you can barely see them. ’’ Mr. Trump logged some practice on Thursday in New Hampshire by participating in a town   forum that even included a   clock  —   the same time limit he will face on Sunday. Mr. Trump denied that the event was a dry run for the debate, saying such a suggestion made him look “like a child. ’’ His performance was uneven, even facing an audience asking friendly questions. Some of his answers were pointed, like his criticism of the Iran nuclear deal. Others were perhaps reassuring, like his insistence that he would stop the flow of heroin into the state. At other times, Mr. Trump meandered, such as a long response about Hispanics that included an observation about those in Las Vegas. “Latinos, they like to be called in that area,” he said. Robby Mook, the Clinton campaign manager, said Mrs. Clinton’s aides anticipated a more disciplined and prepared Mr. Trump who wouldn’t “unravel or unwind the way he did an hour into the last debate. ” Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, for their part, are setting a low bar for his performance. They say Mr. Trump needs to be articulate, play offense against Mrs. Clinton and not lose his cool as he did in their first matchup. Yet his ability to accomplish this remains in doubt, given his tendency to hit back hard when challenged  —   sometimes to the point of sputtering, as he did when he came under attack at the first debate over his past insults of women. A smaller group of advisers is helping Mr. Trump prepare than were involved before the first debate. The group includes Ms. Conway and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, as well as Stephen K. Bannon, the campaign’s chief executive, and Mr. Trump’s    Jared Kushner. Mrs. Clinton is also practicing. At a “Family Town Hall” in Haverford, Pa. on Tuesday, she nearly leapt out of her chair to respond to a    high school student who said she worried that Mr. Trump’s comments about women hurt the body image of girls her age. Her formal preparations include drills and mock debates with Mr. Podesta and Karen Dunn, a Washington lawyer Jake Sullivan, her chief policy adviser Ron Klain, a veteran presidential debate coach, and Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s communications director. The team joined Mrs. Clinton at her home in Washington on Wednesday, snacking on fresh strawberries as they helped shape her answers. In some respects, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, many of whom also worked for Bill Clinton, invented the town   format. Mr. Klain was among the advisers who first suggested to President George Bush and Ross Perot that the candidates abandon the traditional format, and take part in a televised town   forum with a live audience of undecided voters. Mr. Clinton was not yet known as the master of the format, and his opponents agreed. The official debates have included a town   event ever since. That 1992 debate led to a moment that cemented Mr. Clinton’s popular appeal. When a woman asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected them, Mr. Bush delivered a dry response about interest rates. Mr. Clinton, using a tactic he had rehearsed, stood up off his stool and took several steps closer to the voter. “Tell me how it’s affected you again,” Mr. Clinton said, looking directly into the voter’s eyes. “You know people who have lost their jobs and lost their homes?” Mr. Bush, before his response, had checked his watch as the voter was talking, a   movement that led Mr. Clinton’s advisers to burst out in cheers backstage, recognizing the   moment. Trump advisers are well aware that even small gestures can lead to setbacks. They have reviewed video footage of Mr. Trump’s expressions while Mrs. Clinton was speaking and say the town   format will play to their advantage in at least one respect: The dreaded split screen, which captured Mr. Trump scowling and barking into his microphone during the first debate, may be used less if the candidates move around the stage to engage with voters. “A rigid atmosphere can get him in trouble,” Mr. Giuliani said about Mr. Trump. “He’s a quick learner, but that doesn’t mean he knows all the tricks that you learn over decades in political life. ”",0
7080,Why Hillary Won't Unleash WWIII    : Information," Why Hillary Won't Unleash WWIII By Pepe Escobar October 31, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" RT "" - She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/humanitarian imperialist axis.
On the opposite side, for all his personal pathology problems and incoherent twitter-mouth ramblings, Donald Trump seemed to be on the money when he said that if elected, Hillary would use Syria to unleash WWIII.
To check out if that holds, lets start with an essential backup.
The Queen of War, at the final US presidential debate in Las Vegas: "" A no-fly zone [in Syria] can save lives and hasten the end of the conflict. ""
The Queen of War, in one of her 2013 speeches to Goldman Sachs, published by WikiLeaks: a no-fly zone would "" kill a lot of Syrians .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: a no-fly zone in Syria  would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia. ""
No-fly zone would require war with #Syria and #Russia   top US general https://t.co/veSy8uETak pic.twitter.com/zXyCmWjdXj
 RT America (@RT_America) September 22, 2016 Predictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillarys no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war.
Pass the missile launchers, please Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted  as she already was in the past  when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler.
I have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon  reflecting Dunfords comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens  consequences .
The Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two existential threats to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear first-strike  which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.
The relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual  terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust  exactly because Washington refuses to back down from first-strike  only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them.
What Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved moderate Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control  with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences.
Thats exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions,  things could get out of hand .
Also expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed mothership of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition.
And if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Dutertes own pivot to China.
Say hello to my new Sarmat A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton  as in Obama III  presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence.
A Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russias financial  weakness. 
The national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP.
Besides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks.
Moreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals  such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2. The Sarmat delivers monster warheads of 40 megatons; boasts a top speed of seven kilometers per second; and is able to outfox any anti-missile shield system anywhere.

Facebook Inc.'s software knows your face almost as well as your mother does. And like mom, it isn't asking your permission to do what it wants with old photos. 
While millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos, others worried there's something devious afoot are trying to block Facebook as well as Google from amassing such data. 
As advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data, privacy advocates see a pattern in how the world's largest social network and search engine have sold users' viewing histories for advertising. The companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isn't against the law, even without your permission. 
If judges agree with Facebook and Google, they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique Illinois law that carries fines of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person's image is used without permission -- big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions.

How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election
Paul Craig Roberts
I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.
Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYozWHBIf8g&app=desktop is not endeared to the oligarchs.
Who are the oligarchs? 
—Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks’ balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.
—The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.
—The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.
—The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.

What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes’ reporting and the facts on the ground. 
According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.
I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary’s public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: 
“Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and sickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.”
I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity. 
I also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country. 
This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote. 
By controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.
And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.
That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NRP presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Repulbican Texas is up for grabs in the election. 
If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No “glitches” caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.
The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. All of my life I have been trying to get Americans of all stripes—academics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners—out of the false reality in which they exist. 
In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.

7083,How News on a Times-Affiliated Site Drew Praise From Glenn Beck - The New York Times,"The conservative radio host Glenn Beck called the Women’s March in Washington an “AstroTurf” rally funded by the liberal billionaire George Soros. He complained that the news media refused to acknowledge this fact. But there’s one news organization he praised as an exception: The New York Times. As evidence, he pointed to a piece by Asra Q. Nomani, a   liberal feminist and Trump voter, who claimed to document the extensive financial ties Soros had to march partners. The conservative website Breitbart News tied the piece to The Times in a prominent headline. And the   site The Daily Stormer wrote about the piece under a headline that referred to Soros as an “International Jew. ” Suddenly, The Times was a   crowd pleaser. Only it wasn’t The Times that ran this article. It was published on a site affiliated with The Times  —   but completely distinct from the paper  —   called Women in the World. The site is part of an events organization founded by Tina Brown (of The Daily Beast and The New Yorker fame). The Times is a business investor in Women in the World and provides the website’s digital platform, but the two have separate editorial operations. None of that was apparent to many readers who wrote in, confused about whether the story was the work of The Times. Here’s one from Susan Kruglinski of New York: It’s easy to be confused. I was. At the top left corner of the website, for example, there is the familiar “T” logo of The New York Times, and the URL has “nytimes” in it. Click the stylized “T” and you’ll be taken to The Times’s website. If you scroll to the very bottom of the Women in the World home page, squint to find the “About Us” link, and click, you’ll be taken to a page that, in the fourth paragraph, explains the relationship between The Times and Women in the World. For the most part, the site publishes news and features about women that don’t seem particularly controversial. This one, which was labeled Opinion, was more ideologically charged and made The Times the perfect foil for conservative news sites. Adam Bryant, who oversees the newsroom’s role in conferences, was sympathetic to the idea that something more might need to be done to make evident the degree to which the two organizations are separate. “As part of the The New York Times’s business relationship with Women in the World, we currently provide the digital platform for them, but we have separate editorial operations,” he said. “We strive to avoid any confusion on the part of our readers, so we are going to look again to see if there is more we can do to explain our relationship to Women in the World in their articles. ” Glad to hear it. Updated 12:12 p. m. January 27, to clarify Soros’s connection to the march.",0
7084,10-Month Ban for Ryan Lochte After Rio Scandal Is Largely Symbolic - The New York Times,"Ryan Lochte’s drunken night out with three other members of the United States Olympic swim team at the Rio Olympics  —   and his   story about an armed robbery that the authorities in Brazil say never happened  —   resulted in no physical injuries. That is, unless you count the black eyes incurred by U. S. A. Swimming and the United States Olympic Committee, the governing bodies for which Lochte proved an indecorous ambassador. As befits a victimless crime, the punishments announced Thursday, nearly a month after the fact, for Lochte and his accomplices  —   Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen  —   were largely symbolic. The ringleader, Lochte, 32, a heavily decorated veteran of four Olympics, was given a   suspension from domestic and international competitions. The disciplinary measure will prevent him from taking part in the 2017 world championships in Budapest, because the selection meet for the American team falls during his suspension. He was hardly a lock to qualify for the meet anyway, given his slowing performances in the past year. In his one individual event in Rio, the 200 individual medley, he did not win a medal. Bentz, 20 Conger, 21 and Feigen, 26, who kept the truth to themselves for more than 72 hours after Lochte told a tall tale on television about their night out, were handed   suspensions, which will not cause them to miss any major domestic or international competitions. Because Bentz violated the team code of conduct by slipping out of the athletes’ village after the swimmers had been told that only those 21 or older were cleared to leave, he was given an additional 10 hours of community service. All three are barred from United States Olympic Committee facilities  —   at a time when they would be unlikely to use them (especially Conger and Bentz, who are in college). The swimmers’ troubles began after a night of drunken revelry following the final session of the   swimming competition. They asked the taxi driver who was returning them to the athletes’ village from a party to pull over at a gas station. What happened next remains murky but involved public urination, vandalism and money changing hands between the swimmers and security guards brandishing weapons. In Lochte’s original account, which he gave in a television interview with NBC the next morning, he said the taxi had been stopped by armed men he believed were police officers, one of whom held a gun against his head before taking cash from his wallet. His story encapsulated the fears of Olympic visitors and the insecurities of a host city struggling with high crime and gun battles between drug gangs and the police. After the Brazilian authorities opened their own investigation, Lochte altered his story and acknowledged that he had “overexaggerated,” but not before the events had overshadowed the accomplishments of American athletes during the second week of the Games. Brazilian prosecutors are weighing formal charges against Lochte for providing false testimony to the police about the incident the authorities have said that no robbery occurred. They also said that while the security guards were armed, they stopped the swimmers from leaving only so they would pay the gas station manager for the damage done to the property. The timing of the announcement by the Olympic committee, which acted in concert with U. S. A. Swimming, was curious given that this story once again threatened to overshadow   athletes, in this case the Paralympians. Confirmation of the suspensions came on the day after Wednesday’s opening ceremony for the Paralympics, which are taking place in Rio in many of the same venues as the Olympics. Scott Blackmun, chief executive of the Olympic committee, had made it clear in Rio de Janeiro that one of the more regrettable aspects of Lochte’s behavior was how it hijacked the spotlight from deserving track and field and wrestling stars in the second week of the Games. Lochte’s bouts of public partying often turn up in the gossip pages. His longtime rival, Michael Phelps, who had twice been arrested on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, appears to have turned his life around after his   stay at a treatment center in 2014. Lochte could have learned a lot from Phelps’s example, but then, he has spent over a decade merrily building his reputation as the antithesis of the disciplined, hyperfocused Phelps. Clearly, though, Lochte is not the swimmer he once was. His swims this summer were markedly slower than his efforts a year ago. His   finish in the   freestyle at the United States Olympic trials was more than a second slower than his fastest time from 2015. In the   individual medley, the only individual event that Lochte qualified to swim at the Olympics, he did not break 1 minute 56 seconds at the trials or at the Olympics after posting a 1:55. 81 in 2015. In the 200 I. M. at the trials, the average age of the five swimmers who finished directly behind Lochte was 20. 0 years. If Lochte were serious about holding off the youngsters gaining on him, he would have committed to spending the fall working on his freestyle stroke rather than his freestyle dance as a contestant on “Dancing With the Stars. ” As part of the penalties, Lochte loses his $   U. S. A. Swimming stipend, but his turn on “Dancing With the Stars,” and the   fee he will get for his toil and trouble, will more than make up for that loss. Lochte also is required to perform 20 hours of community service. After four Olympics and 12 medals, he appears adrift. The punishment for a night of stupidity amounts to a      card for Lochte, who sadly comes across as a prisoner of a sport he can still do immeasurably better in than he can imagine doing anything else.",0

7086,"Islamic State German Magazine Tells Fighters To Kill ""Apostate"" Imams","The   Islamic state magazine Rumiyah has called on supporters and Islamic State fighters in Germany and Austria to murder moderate Imams who they consider  “apostates. ”[The magazine was released in several languages earlier this week through the various internet channels Islamic State uses to broadcast propaganda to its sympathisers, MEMRI reports. One of the methods used was a “telegram” app, an encrypted messaging service that ISIS often uses and is generally the first place the group takes credit for terror attacks.  The terror group named several prominent members of the Muslim community in both Germany and Austria as potential targets for assassination in an article entitled “Kill the infidel imams in Germany and Austria. ” Among the targets listed is Aiman Mazyek,   of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. Mazyek has made controversial statements in the past, such as calling for German leaders to limit the number of migrants flowing into the country in late 2015. The Muslim leader has also slammed the   migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) likening them to Nazis after they revealed a platform of   last year. Omar   a Vienna city councilman for the Socialist Party (SPÖ) and a member of the Council Committee on European and International Affairs was also listed as a target.   is also no stranger to controversy  —   in 2010 he led an official condemnation of Israel in the Vienna city hall over the Israeli raids on a flotilla heading for Gaza, which Israeli authorities claimed was not the  humanitarian mission activists stated it to be.   also led a protest against Israel in Vienna. Among the demonstrators were members of the Turkish   nationalist group the Grey Wolves who have clashed with Kurds in Germany and have been accused of trying to infiltrate German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party through its diversity program. Killing Imams they don’t agree with is nothing new for the Islamic State. In 2014 ISIS executed 13 clerics in the city of Mosul whom they deemed to be too moderate. Imam Muhammad al Mansuri was one of the victims of the terror group and was the imam in charge of the mosque in which ISIS leader     gave a rare public appearance to lead prayers. Islamic State killed a further six imams in early 2015 after they condemned the group’s actions when they burned Jordanian pilot Mu’ath Kasasbeh alive.

7088,Japan Limited Immigration Now It’s Short of Workers - The New York Times,"GIFU, Japan  —   Liu Hongmei was fed up with her job at a Shanghai clothing factory, where she worked long hours for little pay. So three years ago, she quit to take a job in Japan. A garment factory there promised Ms. Liu three times her $   Chinese wage, and she hoped to save thousands of dollars for her family, which was growing with the recent birth of a son. “It seemed like a big opportunity,” she recalled. Call it an opportunity, maybe, but don’t call it work. Legally, the time Ms. Liu spent ironing and packing women’s wear in Japan is considered “training. ” She had entered the murky and at times abusive world of Japan’s technical trainees  —   essentially   laborers brought in from abroad to fill jobs that Japanese citizens aren’t taking. Just like the United States and other developed countries, Japan has a hard time finding people to pick vegetables, collect   bedpans and wash restaurant dishes. In America, many of these     jobs are filled by illegal immigrants, an arrangement attacked by President Trump during his campaign. Japan, on the other hand, long ago achieved what Mr. Trump has promised: It has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking   work. Now, though, its tough stance on immigration  —   legal and illegal  —   is causing problems. Many Japanese industries are suffering from severe labor shortages, which has helped put a brake on economic growth. That is prompting Japan to question some fundamental assumptions about its labor needs. The debate is politically delicate, but changing realities on the ground  —   in Japan’s factories and fields  —   are forcing politicians to catch up. Japan’s total   labor force topped one million for the first time last year, according to the government, lifted in part by people entering the country on visas reserved for technical trainees. That growth has also led to an increase in cases of worker abuse and fraud, labor activists say. Ms. Liu is part of that debate. She arrived in Japan in debt after paying brokers $7, 000 to arrange her visa. Once there, she said, she found onerous working conditions and    pay. Her bosses, she said, “treat us like slaves. ” Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers at her factory came to Japan through a   internship program. Its purpose is to square the circle between Japan’s labor shortage and its ban on   immigration. Farms,   businesses and many manufacturers would struggle to stay afloat without foreign trainees, specialists say. “Practically every vegetable in the supermarkets of Tokyo was picked by a trainee,” said Kiyoto Tanno, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University. To appease business groups, the government has created immigration loopholes, and hundreds of thousands of   workers like Ms. Liu have poured through them. They come from China and Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia, and they are filling empty jobs in Japan as the Japanese population shrinks, becoming a crucial if underacknowledged motor of the economy. Their numbers are soaring. The trainee program has doubled in size in the last five years, to over 200, 000, according to official data, and the government is planning to expand it. The biggest source of workers has been China, but much of the recent growth has come from Vietnam. Few doubt that “training” is a fig leaf. Beyond a short period of language study, most trainees receive little or no instruction that would distinguish them from regular manual laborers, specialists and participants say. “The system is like calling a crow white,” said Yoshio Kimura, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who heads the party’s labor committee. “What we’re really doing is importing labor. ” Training is not the only way around Japanese immigration restrictions. There are also students in   jobs, asylum seekers waiting for refugee applications to be processed  —   almost all are ultimately rejected  —   and South Americans of Japanese descent who can obtain special visas based on their ancestry. Demand still outstrips supply. The number of   Japanese has been falling since the   a consequence of decades of low birthrates. Nationwide unemployment is just 3 percent, and in some places, jobs are simply going begging. There are three to four positions open in nursing care and construction for every person who applies, according to government surveys. Eventually, Japan plans to lengthen the maximum time that trainees can stay in the country to five years, from three, and allow more kinds of businesses to hire them, including nursing homes and cleaning companies for offices and hotels. Parliament approved the creation of a new agency to oversee the trainee program last year, in response to criticism over worker exploitation. Once it is in place, the plan is to bring in more workers. Mr. Kimura and some other lawmakers want to go further, by establishing a formal guest worker system. Though it would not open a path to immigration  —   workers would still be expected to go home eventually  —   it would be more forthright than the current approach. Business groups favor the proposal, and the Liberal Democrats approved it as party policy in May. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has not indicated whether it will follow through. “If we want economic growth in the future, we need foreigners,” Mr. Kimura said. Nobuya Takai, a lawyer who has represented foreign trainees in labor disputes, said the pretense that trainees are not workers contributes to problems. Companies do not hire them directly, but through a byzantine system of government and   middlemen. Most trainees end up thousands of dollars in debt to pay broker fees before they even arrive, say Mr. Takai and others who have studied the program. And because trainees cannot easily switch jobs  —   their visas tie them to a single company  —   they lack what should be major leverage: the ability to walk out on a bad employer. “They can’t change jobs, and they lose money if they go home,” Mr. Takai said. In 2011, an American State Department report on human trafficking flagged the trainee program for what it said were inadequate protections against “debt bondage” and other abuses. When trainees don’t save enough to repay broker fees, they sometimes stay on illegally. Almost 6, 000 did so in 2015, according to Japan’s Justice Ministry. (There are about 60, 000 foreigners total in Japan without valid visas, according to the government, compared with an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States.) The New York Times spoke with more than a dozen trainees. All of them said they had paid labor brokers in their home countries, usually $7, 000 to $11, 000, to come to Japan to work. Most borrowed the money from family or banks. The trainees came from several countries in Asia and worked in different industries, in different parts of Japan: a Cambodian construction worker, a Chinese lettuce picker, seamstresses from China and Vietnam. Complaints about unpaid labor were common. Cao Bao, a    from Jilin Province in northeast China, worked for Kishimoto Manufacturing, a small auto parts supplier in central Japan. He said Chinese trainees there were made to clean and paint the factory on their days off, without pay, when managers found errors in their work. He was fired when he complained, he said, and a Japanese labor union has taken up his case. “Some Japanese are helpful and nice, but the people at the company are different,” Mr. Cao said. Masahisa Kishimoto, the company’s president, said Mr. Cao had left of his own accord, and he blamed cultural differences for problems at the factory. In China, he said, “they don’t clean. ” “There are no rules,” he continued. “There’s a sense that you if you don’t get caught, you can do anything. ” Mr. Kishimoto referred other questions to Joho Highway   an employers’ association that recruits trainees on behalf of Kishimoto Manufacturing and other local businesses. The   said that Kishimoto had been imposing “penalty” overtime on both Japanese and Chinese workers, in violation of labor rules, and that Kishimoto had compensated the employees after the   intervened. Mr. Kishimoto said the company had fully complied with labor laws. Government data on workplace accidents shows that trainees are more likely to be hurt on the job than Japanese workers  —   a result of poor training, language barriers or more dangerous assignments. Since 2010, two trainee deaths have been recognized by the government as cases of karoshi, the Japanese term for death by overwork. Given widespread underreporting of overtime, the true number could be higher. In the financially struggling garment industry, abuses are pervasive enough that the minister of economy, trade and industry promised an inquiry last year, during a debate in Parliament over expanding the trainee program. Tham Thi Nhung, 32, a mother of two from Vietnam, said she worked from 8 a. m. to 9 or 10 p. m. Her job was to sew jackets, coats and dresses at a small clothing factory in Aichi prefecture, an industrial region in central Japan. All but one of the business’s six seamstresses were Vietnamese, Ms. Nhung said. They hadn’t had a day off in four months, she said, but the owner was recording only part of their overtime. In November, after the women complained that they were being underpaid by $712 a month, the owner sent a letter saying the factory was closing, and they were being laid off. A telephone number registered for Ms. Nhung’s employer, Fashion Ai, was not working, and a lawyer representing the company declined to comment. “We told the boss, but she said she wouldn’t pay more,” Ms. Nhung said. “She told us to keep working or go back to Vietnam. ” Ms. Liu said she emptied her savings and borrowed from relatives to cover the visa fee. Ms. Liu and her colleagues said their employer had been paying them less than the legal minimum wage for overtime, and had been overcharging them for company housing. The employer was    Takeshi Nakahara, who along with his wife owns several small garment factories in Gifu, near Aichi. He started using Chinese trainees 15 years ago, he said in an interview, because “no Japanese want to work in the apparel industry. ” Low wages are the only way to compete with cheap foreign factories, he added. “Most manufacturers have moved overseas,” he said. “It’s the only way to stay profitable. ” Mr. Nakahara said he had been paying Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers less than minimum wage for overtime, though he said the idea had been theirs. “They demanded more overtime work,” he said. “I told them it wouldn’t be profitable for the company, and they said they were willing to work for less. ” Although the arrangement was illegal, he said he felt betrayed when the women, nearing the end of their   contracts, made demands for back pay. The workers sought help from Zhen Kai, a Chinese labor activist who has lived in Japan for decades. He operates a small union office in Gifu that includes temporary rooms in which workers can stay. Mr. Zhen says that he sympathizes with the businesses and that many would have folded without the trainee program. The government, he says, has effectively kept such businesses alive by letting them exploit workers. “Owners often say to me, ‘Are you trying to destroy my company? ’” he said. Mr. Zhen negotiated with the Nakaharas, who offered a settlement, initially about $5, 800. Fed up and homesick, Ms. Liu accepted the offer and was getting ready to go back to China, even though she still owed money to the relatives who helped her pay for her visa. The other four women decided to stay in Japan to fight for more compensation, and a few weeks later accepted offers of $10, 000 to $16, 000. Asked if they had learned anything during their ostensible training, they laughed bitterly. “Only hardship,” Ms. Liu said. “My image of Japan,” she said, “was that it was a good country. ”",0

7090,Americans Need to Exercise Their Freedoms and Vote,"November 8, 2016, is election day. On Tuesday, Americans will vote for who will represent them to the world. That would be the position of the most powerful person in the world; President of the United States (POTUS). It is up to every citizen, young and old, to remind people to get out and vote. Support the freedom afforded Americans.
Also, there are state elections for senators and representative seats. In fact, there are 270 congressional positions available. Most states have significant measures on the ballots for voters to decide. Some measures include; Marijuana legalization, whether or not to raise taxes, fund bonds to fix the school system, build a stadium.
Vote for POTUS As far as voting for the POTUS goes, the country has found itself more divided than ever before. There are four candidates,
Hillary Clinton , the first female candidate from a major party, Democrat, former first lady, and former secretary of state; Gary Johnson , governor of New Mexico, Libertarian Party; Jill Stein, Green Party, a presidential candidate in 2012; Donald Trump , real estate mogul, reality star, and entrepreneur, Republican. Stein and Johnson are unlikely for two reasons;
Neither are members of the two primary parties. Neither have numbers in the polls that are in the double digits. Clinton has many good qualities that indicate she would be a strong leader. As the first lady, she understands the pressures of the presidency from watching her husband deal with the job. As the secretary of state, Clinton learned first hand the ins and outs of dealing with foreign affairs and American citizens. In this post, she worked closely with the president. When she was a senator, the Democratic candidate learned how difficult it could be to compromise across the aisle.
Trump has qualities that may help him should he win. His business acumen and his personality indicate he will be a force to with which to be reckoned. He knows the art of the deal making. The Republican candidate has no political experience short of lobbying for his causes, which could serve him well by understanding how the lobbyists think.
Lesser of Two Evils? Both Clinton and Trump have red marks on their reputations, and they have attacked one another relentlessly since each won their primaries. Whereas, the former’s are over a decade old the latter’s are current.
How does one decide which to choose? What happens if neither wins the majority of the vote? Would it be as simple as whoever garners the highest number?
Stein and Johnson each proclaim they are the better choice for voters over choosing the better of two evils. Their positions are unique and intriguing. The Libertarian ticket may be strong as both the presidential and vice presidential candidates are former governors.
Early Voting Numbers As of November 4, there have been at least 37 million ballots cast, according to Business Insider. There are approximately 219 million eligible voters in the U.S. in 2016. Polls indicate a drop in the number who are stated they are definitely casting their ballots; in 2012 the number was 76 percent, and in 2016 it was 69. That leaves 41 percent of registered voters who need to have people, adults, teenagers, and children alike, to push them to get to the polling sites and cast their ballots.
Questions about what is on the ballot for individual states can be found on Ballotpedia. A person can choose the see what is on the federal, state, local ballots. Another option would be to go the website for the state’s registrar’s office. It is important to exercise the freedom to vote.

He added that the previous owner wasn’t too concerned about the shelter, as he had just covered it up. 
“He clearly wasn’t very worried about it and it just sat there until the hatch fell through. I think it’s great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it’s structurally sound.” 
“It’s incredible to think it has all been made by hand. It’s part of our history, so it should be kept.” 
When he first started digging, the shelter was almost completely full of mud. After the area was cleaned out, Marks discovered glass bottles and old newspapers inside. 
Since some of those newspapers were much more recent than World War II, you have to wonder what else has gone on down there.

7092,Facebook user wastes two hours sharing things to impress his insurance company,"Wednesday 2 November 2016 Facebook user wastes two hours sharing things to impress his insurance company 
Facebook user Simon Williams has admitted he only shares things on social media to impress other people, so trying to impress his insurance company seemed like a sensible thing to do. 
Williams said Admiral Insurance’s decision to offer better insurance deals to people with Facebook profiles that looked ‘safer’ to their quotation algorithm had led to an afternoon of frantic social activity. 
He explained, “Obviously, as a millennial social media user, I only ever share things that will impress my friends, future employers and potentially those women who happen across my Facebook profile from any of the number of dating apps I use. 
“So sharing and posting things purely to make myself look better is nothing new to me. Tweaking that for an insurance company was pretty easy. 
“I simply liked a number of Facebook pages about driver safety, signed a petition calling for lower speed limits on UK roads, added a couple of driving safety courses as Life Events, and even put a couple of posts on my historic timeline about how people are ‘driving way too fast past the school these days’. 
“Also, Driving Miss Daisy is now my favourite film, by the way. 
“It would definitely have got me cheaper car insurance. It was a flawless plan. 
“Of course, Facebook has now put an end to that – the bastards. Two hours of my life I won’t get back. 
A spokesperson for Facebook told us, “We simply can’t have a third party business exploiting the information our users share on the Facebook platform for commercial gain.

7094,Journalist facing 45 years in jail for filming the tar sands pipeline protest in North Dakota,"Meet the journalist facing 45 years in jail for filming the tar sands pipeline protest in North Dakota 
Thursday, October 27, 2016 
Are North Dakota authorities waging a war against the public’s right to know about the ongoing Standing Rock pipeline protests? We are joined by documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, who was charged earlier this month with three felonies for filming an act of civil disobedience in which climate activists manually turned off the safety valves to stop the flow of tar sands oil through pipelines spanning the U.S. and Canada. 
The actions took place in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Washington state. Schlosberg is an award-winning filmmaker and was the producer of Josh Fox’s recent documentary, “How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change.” She was filming the action at a valve station owned by TransCanada in Walhalla, North Dakota. She was arrested along with the activists, and her footage was confiscated. Then she was charged with a Class A felony and two Class C felonies—which combined carry a 45-year maximum sentence. 
For original video interview please click here . TRANSCRIPT 
AMY GOODMAN: But we’re joined right now in Los Angeles by Democracy Now! video stream by Deia Schlosberg, the award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, who was arrested on October 11th in a different area of North Dakota, while reporting on a climate change protest in Walhalla, North Dakota, charged with three felonies, facing 45 years in prison, if convicted. Also with us, Josh Fox. His article in The Nation, “The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline is a Threat to Democracy—and the Planet.” His previous documentaries include Gasland, which first exposed the harms of the fracking industry, nominated for an Academy Award, also made Gasland 2, which aired on HBO. 
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Deia, describe what happened to you. 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Well, on October 11th, I was working as a climate reporter, as I’ve done for years and years and years, as Josh and I were doing, and the rest of the How to Let Go of the World team, when we made the film. And I was documenting people taking a stand, people on the frontlines of the fight to lessen the impacts of climate change. So, there were—there were five activists across four states that had planned to turn the emergency shutoff valves on the five pipelines that bring all Canadian oil sands into the U.S. And I was documenting this occurrence at the North Dakota site, outside of Walhalla, as you said. I was—I was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed, at no point, you know, broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think it’s essential for journalists to—journalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And there’s a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So, I take that responsibility very seriously. 
AMY GOODMAN: So when did the police come? 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: The police came after—well, the activist that was doing the action, Michael, had called the company ahead of time to say that he was—he was going to shut off the valve, so they could—to give them ample time to take any emergency precautions. And then he turned the valve. And meanwhile, the company notified the local police. So, after the valve was closed, they came in probably about 15 minutes. I had my camera set up on a tripod on the public road. And they told me I was arrested for being an accessory to a crime, at which point I was brought to the local jail . I figured it would—things would just have to clear up once they realized what was— 
AMY GOODMAN: So, they charged you with three felonies? 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: —that I was just, you know, exercising my First Amendment— 
AMY GOODMAN: What were the felonies? 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Conspiracy—they were all conspiracy charges: conspiracy to theft of public—theft of property, conspiracy to theft of service and conspiracy of interfering with a public—a critical public infrastructure. 
AMY GOODMAN: And you face 45 years in jail? What is your comment on this? 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: What is my what? Sorry, the connection is— 
AMY GOODMAN: What do say about this? 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: It’s absolutely outrageous. Yeah, I mean, this is what I—this is what I do for my living. This is what I’ve done for years and years. There’s absolutely no grounds for these charges.

7095,Exclusive—Rep. Massie on Trump’s First 100 Days: ‘Neil Gorsuch Was Worth the Entire Election’,"Congressman Thomas Massie wants spending cuts, not tax increases elsewhere, to offset income tax reductions. [Congressman Massie ( ) spoke to Breitbart News on President Donald Trump’s first 100 days, saying the president is off to a great start, and calling the nomination of Neil Gorsuch a defining moment for the Trump presidency.  He told Breitbart News: I’m excited for the wins that we got already, which includes Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch being confirmed and that’s going to last for decades. Neil Gorsuch was worth the entire election, everything else is a bonus. As for other stuff he scores big points for rolling back the regulatory state. In my district two big deals are the EPA’s Waters of the US rule, and the Social Security gun grab. I’m excited about those things. Massie explained that he loves using the Congressional Review Act to repeal regulations. He explained, “I lost track of how many we’ve done, and it was only used once successfully before Trump. and that was an OSHA rule with President George W. Bush that Bush was able to rescind a rule created during the Clinton era. I’m excited about all of those and more. but I’m particularly excited about the Social Security gun ban. ” The Kentucky congressman would love to see a comprehensive infrastructure plan. Massie said: I would love for us to make progress on infrastructure. I am one of the most conservative members of Congress, and I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because I believe it’s vital to our country. it’s one of the few things our country should spend money on. I believe that there’s a constitutional and a federal nexus for it so I’d like to figure out how to address the nation’s infrastructure needs. Trump spoke to that on the campaign, and I think that a lot of Republicans and Democrats agree that we need this. So I believe that Trump can get the six votes he needs in the Senate to pass an infrastructure plan. We know he can get 218 in the House. I’m really excited he chose Elaine Chao to be Transportation Secretary. Massie cheered Trump nominating Scott Garrett to run the   Bank. He said: He couldn’t pick a better person than Scott Garrett to run the   Bank. Obviously I want to eliminate the   Bank, but if there’s going to be someone to run, then Scott should run it. He’s the best person he can choose. It’s not in the win column, but it’s something for Congress to do, not the president. We should elect more people in Congress to get rid of the   Bank. Looking forward, Congressman Massie believes that tax reform can do some great work if it cuts Americans’ tax burden and does not add to the deficit. He said: In spite of the caution, there’s a lot of opportunity in tax reform. I think what we should do instead of swallowing the entire apple whole, we should take several bites at it. I agree in large part with Stephen Moore and Larry Kudlow in their Wall Street Journal   that we should take it slow and rack up some wins and realize that tax reform does not have to be revenue neutral. Revenue neutral means that someone’s taxes are going down and somebody’s taxes are going up. “I would like us to see a real tax cut along with tax reform and we can accomplish that without increasing the deficit. We can make up the difference by cutting spending, especially in a lot of ways that works with Trump’s narrative. We spent a $100 billion in Afghanistan rebuilding their infrastructure  …    . I would like to see Trump bring that money back. That’s a great opportunity right there,” Massie concluded.",0
7096,NYPD Source: Weiner Laptop Has Enough Evidence “to Put Hillary ... Away for Life”,"Email 
Sex crimes with children, child exploitation, money laundering, perjury, and pay to play, reads the partial list of crimes that, say New York City Police Department sources, could “put Hillary and her crew away for life.” 
Shocking evidence of such criminality has been found on ex-congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop computer, say the sources, which was seized from him by NYC officials investigating his allegedly having sent sexually explicit texts to a 15-year-old girl. Moreover, Hillary Clinton’s “crew” supposedly includes not just close aide and confidante Huma Abedin and her husband, Weiner, but other aides and insiders — and even members of Congress. Reports True Pundit : NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: • Money laundering • Sex crimes with minors (children) • Perjury • Pay to play through Clinton Foundation • Obstruction of justice • Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a [sic] NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.” 
These revelations would explain why Director Comey reopened the investigation into Clinton’s mishandling of classified information, a move that shook the political world and caused Comey to come under fire. As the NYPD chief put it, the new e-mails contents truly are “alarming.” 
True Pundit also reports FBI sources as stating that Abedin and Weiner are both trying to cut immunity deals with federal officials and that, if they didn’t cooperate, they’d face long prison sentences. Abedin’s turning state’s evidence would no doubt be devastating for Clinton, as the two women have for years been joined at the hip. Abedin has at times been like Clinton’s shadow, has been called her “body woman,” and has even been rumored to be Clinton’s lesbian lover. So Abedin likely knows where, as is said, the bodies are buried. 
Of particular note, the new e-mails allegedly contain information revealing that Hillary, Bill Clinton, Weiner, and numerous congressmen took trips to convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s private island, where he is said to pimp out underage minors of both sexes to prominent people. The trips were taken aboard Epstein’s Boeing 747, dubbed the “Lolita Express”; the pedophile’s island, in the US Virgin Islands, has been called “ Sex Slave Island .” 
These revelations would also explain why Clinton used powerful software called BleachBit to scrub damning information from her private server. According to BleachBit’s website, its program gives criminals and others the ability to “shred files to hide their contents and prevent data recovery.” 
Yet it can’t scrub bumbling perverts from your personal life, and Weiner’s laptop also contains incriminating e-mails revealing the mishandling of classified information by Abedin and Clinton, say the sources. Both women “sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts,” and this information could have been “accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers ... of unknown individuals,” writes True Pundit . 
Consequently, FBI sources say the new Clinton investigation has been broadened and now includes matters such as how, informs True Pundit : • Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner’s email • Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails. • Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records • Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents • [a] private consultant managed Weiner’s site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domain’s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts. 
This story just adds more intrigue to a presidential campaign that is truly unprecedented, with a torrent of WikiLeaks and Project Veritas revelations and now Clinton’s Weiner woes. From vote fraud to inciting violence to child sex abuse to pay-for-play to perjury, it’s becoming clear to many that the Democratic Party — and the Clintons in particular — are essentially a criminal syndicate. As former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said in a Sunday interview, “The Clintons, that’s a crime family, basically. It’s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.... God forbid we put someone like that [Clinton] in the White House.” And now we know better why, as I wrote Sunday, this “appears standard FBI sentiment. I personally know of an ex-agent — someone with knowledge of Clinton ‘crime family’ dealings — who I’m told is having trouble sleeping at night due to the prospect of a Clinton presidency.” 
All these revelations raise important questions: How could Hillary Clinton and her cohorts have bumbled so badly that they appear a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Boss Tweed ? 
And if Clinton is so careless with her own personal survival, how can she be trusted with national survival? 
Part of the explanation is general incompetence, yet there’s another factor: Both Clintons have engaged in continual criminality over the decades — and have been allowed to skate at every turn. This lack of accountability has led to complacency and ever-increasing brazenness, just as with a child never punished for wrongdoing. 
So, finally, perhaps, Clinton corruption has reached critical mass. And with Donald Trump ahead 10 points (according to one respected poll) among the 88 percent of voters who have definitely made up their minds, maybe, come late Tuesday evening, some tossing and turning FBI agents will finally be able to enjoy a good night’s rest.

The Trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show. This is why Trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning. Trump still thinks that he can win Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Mexico. Wisconsin might be the most laughable of three delusions because Trump was routed in the Republican primary there, and GOP support from Wisconsin Republicans like Paul Ryan and Scott Walker has been lukewarm at best. 
These are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat. The Comey letter didn’t move the needle for Trump. It didn’t give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for Hillary Clinton. 
The Clinton emails didn’t save Trump, so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line.",0
7098,White Students Start Whites-Only Group to Wreck White Racism,"White Students Start Whites-Only Group to Wreck White Racism Quincy Clarke, Campus Reform, November 2, 2016 
A number of white Pomona College students formed a new club called “We’ve Got Work To Do: White People for Deconstructing Whiteness.” The club, open to students from all five of the Claremont Colleges, aims to “work on owning our racism, deconstructing our Whiteness, and to engage in movement & action toward dismantling White Supremacy.” 
“White people at the 5C’s: we’re all racist. we’re all microaggressive. [W]e are all not only complicit in, but actively perpetuating white supremacy,” states an advertisement for the group. “Pretending that we are not racist and hoping that no one will discover our racism really doesn’t cut it. [W]e need to ACTIVELY be doing work to deconstruct our whiteness (and holding our peers accountable in doing the same).” 
“Recognizing that White identity is a self-fashioned, hierarchical fantasy, Whites should attempt to dismantle Whiteness as it currently exists,” explains the group’s Facebook page , quoting Ian Haney López, a leading racial justice scholar. “Whites should renounce their privileged racial character, though not simply out of guilt or any sense of self-deprecation. Rather, they should dismantle the edifice of Whiteness because this mythological construct stands at the vortex of racial inequality in America.”

7100,"Strong Job Gains, for Second Month, Reframe Economic Outlook - The New York Times","The American jobs machine has moved back into high gear. After a long stretch of conflicting reports, the Labor Department said on Friday that the economy in July delivered a second consecutive month of robust hiring and rising wages in a signal that the expansion is strengthening, not ebbing, as it enters its eighth year. Stocks surged, experts expressed more confidence that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates before the end of the year, and it was clear that   wages for ordinary workers were advancing at a healthier pace. “This was everything you could have asked for, maybe more,” said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We’re seeing new entrants into the labor market, which implies a longer runway for the business cycle. ” With the political conventions completed, the buoyant jobs numbers also have major implications for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. Not only does the new data undercut Republican arguments that the recovery is faltering, it also suggests that after years of paltry gains, deeply frustrated workers are finally seeing some benefits from the drop in unemployment, which was unchanged last month at a relatively low 4. 9 percent. Wages are up 2. 6 percent over the last 12 months, a faster pace than earlier in the recovery, and many economists expect that the gain in incomes, adjusted for inflation, will accelerate later this year and into 2017. “The idea that Republicans are touting, that the job market is a wreck, is clearly belied by the data,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served in the Obama administration. “What matters most to people isn’t G. D. P. growth, it’s jobs and wages. ” Longtime G. O. P. economic hands like Wayne Berman, a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, conceded Friday’s data was favorable for Democrats, but insisted it represented a snapshot of the economy, not necessarily the underlying trends. A major failing in the recovery, Republicans note, is that millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force during the recession have still not found jobs. July’s jobs number “is a good statistic for Clinton to pivot towards,” said Mr. Berman, who currently serves as a top official at the Blackstone Group and advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary. He noted, however, that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of 2016, a sharp decrease from last year. “We’re in a very mixed economic picture now,” said Mr. Berman, recalling the presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole two decades ago, when attacks on Bill Clinton’s economic record failed to resonate at a time of rising prosperity. “You can’t say this is like 1996, when there was no oxygen for Bob Dole’s arguments. ” The July increase in payrolls stands in sharp contrast to data released just last week showing disappointing economic growth in April, May and June. A reason for the difference is that parts of the economy are still suffering from the continuing fallout from low oil prices as energy companies cut back on investment. Government spending also has been weak and many companies, at least for now, prefer to hire more workers rather than invest in new equipment and increase their efficiency and output. If business and government investment continue to lag, that could undermine the   ability of the American economy to be more productive and raise living standards for most workers. In late spring, the government reported that job creation in May was much weaker than economists had expected a big rebound in June similarly caught the experts off guard. The July data helps clear up some of the confusion. “This is a validator,” said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. “This is a report that indicates that the slowdown in hiring earlier in the year has been reversed. ” June’s gain was revised upward by 5, 000 jobs, and May’s by 13, 000. The combination of better gains in the spring and July’s increase in hiring means that the Federal Reserve is likely to have a more vigorous debate about raising interest rates when it meets in September. But most experts think the Fed will wait until December to be sure the economy remains on a solid track. The Fed said in July, after the most recent meeting of its   committee, that the economy was growing more strongly and there were fewer clouds on the horizon, suggesting it was giving greater consideration to rate increases later this year. But on the   front, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an influential adviser to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, said on Sunday that current economic conditions still called for “caution in raising U. S.   interest rates. ” Job openings are spreading. “It’s been a really good summer for hiring all across the country,” said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a recruiting and staffing firm based in Chicago. “Business has been great. Kids coming out of college are getting hired, and we’re seeing a lot of activity in the $50, 000 to $150, 000 category. ” The upswing in jobs last month also coincided with a sharp drop in unemployment among the   workers, a group that has missed out on nearly all the gains of the current recovery thus far. Other measures of the labor market suggest that underlying joblessness is higher than the official 4. 9 percent rate, although nowhere near the 42 percent level Mr. Trump suggested last fall. The broadest measure of unemployment calculated by the Labor Department, which includes workers who want   positions but cannot find them, stood at 9. 7 percent in July. To arrive at his figure, Mr. Trump apparently compared the total civilian population aged 16 and up  —   about 253. 6 million people  —   with the 102 million Americans who are not in the labor force, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But in addition to the 7. 7 million currently counted as unemployed, that larger figure includes more than 50 million Americans above the age of 55 who say they don’t want to work and are, for the most part, retired. It also takes into account 13. 5 million Americans age 16 to 24, most of them in school, and millions of women who have chosen to stay home to care for their young children. None of those people are considered unemployed by the Labor Department. The payroll figures, which reflect hiring at companies and in the public sector, revealed   job gains, not just in   sectors like retail and leisure and hospitality, but in   fields like professional and business services as well. The household survey, which has offered a mixed picture in the past, was also robust. The jobless rate for high school dropouts, which has been elevated throughout the recovery, fell more than a full percentage point to 6. 3 percent, suggesting that employers who had previously ignored these   workers are now taking a second look. As the unemployment rate has fallen, some employers have raised salaries to retain their best workers and attract new ones. Increases in the minimum wage in many states recently, and increases in the   salaries by big employers like Walmart, Target and Aetna, are also beginning to ripple through the broader work force. But a   job market remains in place, with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills. In San Francisco, even the most junior software engineers hired at Sunverge, a maker of energy storage systems for solar electricity users, command starting salaries of just over $100, 000. A little more than 60 miles to the east, at Sunverge’s assembly plant in Stockton, Calif. where the unemployment rate is 9 percent, new   workers can expect to earn about $14 an hour, or $29, 000 a year. Sunverge is bulking up in both cities. But hiring technical talent is much more   said Stu Statman, Sunverge’s chief of engineering. “It doesn’t seem like it’s that hard to find good factory workers in Stockton,” Mr. Statman said. “In San Francisco, if you’re talking about software engineers or developers, it’s very hard. It takes a long time, and there’s a huge amount of hunger out there for people with these skills. ”",0
7101,The Vibration of the World,"Leave a reply Dylan Harper – The entire physical universe is made up of pure energy and vibration. When you have the insight to see everything as vibration, the nature of the universe is revealed to you. Light is vibration. The entire electromagnetic wave spectrum of visible light produces different colors. Colors are simply waves vibrating at different frequencies . On one end of the spectrum you have red, on the other end you have violet. Red has the longest wavelength and the lowest frequency, violet has the shortest wavelength and the highest frequency. There are two kinds of electrical lighting that you can find when you visit an electronic store. Warm light and cool light. Warm light contains a greater mixture of lower frequency color waves such as yellow and orange. Cool light contains a greater mixture of higher frequency color waves such as green and blue. Light is crucial in its environmental effect upon work, play, rest and other life activities. It controls stimulation, relaxation and energy level . Since warm light is more relaxing than cool light, you might decide to use it for the ambience it creates. Have you ever used only warm lights in a room and thought that you could make the place more relaxing or stimulating simply by increasing or decreasing the light intensity? But it doesn’t work that way. Increasing the light intensity of warm light does not make it a lot more stimulating. Higher energy levels require higher rate of vibration. It is not the magnitude but the frequency of the vibration that determines its energy level. Is it any wonder that blue flame is hotter than yellow flame? Health is vibration. Cold, damp and dark places with lack of airflow are breeding grounds for bacteria, whereas sunny places with abundance of airflow eliminate unhealthy micro organisms. The second type of environment is healthier than the first because it is high vibration while the other is low vibration. Although sunlight is biologically beneficial, too much of it causes heatstroke. The energy turns from being constructive to destructive. The key here is balance. Too much of something beyond the rightful amount causes instability. This is what all sickness and disease does. It seeks to weaken or destabilize vibration. The more vibrant and stable a person is, the more alive and constructive he/she are. The more lackluster and unstable he/she is, the less alive and/or the more (self)destructive. Ever wonder why you have always been told to drink warm water and not to drink cold one when you were sick? When the body is sick, there are things within that are clogging up the system and slowing down some functions. The body needs energy to move the sickness out of the body or to destroy it. That is why your doctor advices you to drink plenty of water. It is the medium that your blood cells use to mobilize their work. More water and oxygen gives your body the much needed resources it needs in getting rid of the sickness. Your impulse of coughing out phlegm and blowing out mucus is your bodies act of expelling the bad stuff from your body, which means you are on the road to recovery. Warm water is high vibration whereas cold water is low vibration. Cold water removes the precious energy needed for recovery, whereas warm water supplies it. One supports your recovery rate while the other sabotages it. Sound is vibration. Bassy music is low vibration and energetic music is high vibration. We enjoy listening to different types of music because we like to experience different ranges of emotion. The variety of feelings in life makes it fun and meaningful. High energy dance music appeal to younger people because they are highly energetic and expressive. Slower and emotional entrancing music is what we desire to hear when we want to be moved in a deep and sensual way. We want time to slow down and come to a standstill the experience to be like an eternal moment. Chemical is vibration. Alcohol and earl grey tea are opposite in terms of vibration. Although stress and anxiety is a form of high vibration, it is undesirable because the vibration is incoherent and disorderly. Alcohol lowers vibration. That’s why people drink to relax and distress. But drinking consumes more than the natural amount of alcohol that the body is supposed to take. Therefore it causes instability as well. Drivers who drink have impaired judgment and reaction rate are more susceptible to accidents. People who are above the need of alcohol to relax have chosen more intelligent means of doing so. Earl grey tea acts as a stimulant that counters the effects of alcohol to a certain extent to “sober” you up. The vibration of our “bodies” at every level, physical and non-physical, has a profound influence on our ability to attract positive experiences. The higher your vibration, the more of a “magnet” you become as a result of the thoughts you hold in your mind. By holding only thoughts of the “things” you wish to manifest into your experience, and keeping your vibrations high in the ways we discussed previously, you will find your wishes will manifest much more quickly. When you learn to see everything as vibration different in terms of rate and stability, you will understand what you need in order to obtain the desired effect in any situation. It is all about balancing vibrations. There are lots more aspects of physical reality than those mentioned here where this principle is applied to. Once you are aware of this principle and always think in terms of vibration, you can understand practically everything that happens in the physical world.

7103,The Chronovisor: A Device Used To Look Into The Future And Past,"1 Reply 
According to numerous reports and stories that have been published through the years, among the many alleged secrets the Vatican has, there is a device called the Chronovisor. The device enables its user to observe future as well as past events. Many believe this device is one of the greatest guarded secrets humanity has ever had. 
Some even believe it is a crucial ‘tool’ which has allowed the Vatican to preserve its influence and power through the years. 
Ever since H. G. Wells composed his novel ‘The Time Machine’ many people have been left fascinated by the idea of time travel. Even Theoretical Physics dreams of the possibility of making it work one day. Everything related to time travel today is related to science fiction, or so it seems at least. Interestingly, on May 2, 1972, an Italian newspaper shocked the world when they published an article with a provoking headline: A machine that photographs the past has finally been invented . 
The news article indicated that dozens of scientists created an artifact that allowed them to photograph the past, and even witness important historical accounts directly connected with Jesus Christ. 
The alleged device –which according to many is nothing more than science fiction— was built in the 1950’s by a team of scientists led by Father Pellegrino Maria Ernetti, an Italian physicist who eventually became a priest. 
It is believed that the team received important help from Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi and famous rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. 
The Chronovisor is a relatively small object that is equipped with a number of antennas and is composed entirely of precious alloys, cathode tubes, some dials, and levers. Reports by Father Ernetti suggest that whoever uses the device is able to capture and record specific locations, important events and follow in history, noteworthy individuals. According to Father Ernetti, he had observed, among other historical events, Christ’s crucifixion and photographed it as well. View image The image to the left is the one obtained using the Chronovisor. On the right is a similar image located in a Church in Perugia. 
It is even said that under the perfect conditions, the device offers its user the ability to foresee what was going to happen in the near future. 
However, Father Ernetti remained secretive and stated he was not at liberty to reveal further details about the Chronovisor. 
Father Ernetti did however reveal that the Chronovisor worked by ‘…processing residual electromagnetic radiation left over by numerous processes…’ 
According to numerous reports, Father Ernetti used the Chronovisor to witness important historical events, with the most notable being the crucifixion of Christ. 
However, Father Ernetti revealed that thanks to this invention had managed to witness the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and other major historical events such as the founding of Rome in 753 B.C. Also, thanks to the Chronovisor, Father Ernetti was able to recompose the missing work “Thyestes” , written by Ennio Quinto and represented in Rome in 169 A.C. in its original version, and the original text of the the two stone tablets written by God (Exodus 24:12) which were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, apart from witnessing the likes of Napoleon, Roman philosopher Cicero and other great and momentous historical and biblical episodes. 
French priest François Charles Antoine Brune was one of the first to hear about the Chronovisor. According to Father François, he met Father Ernetti in the 1960’s when the two were traveling across the Grand Canal of Venice. As the two were experts in ancient languages, they began to talk about the Bible and its interpretation through the years. Supposedly, these are the blueprints of the Chronoviso r [image] 
Father Brune that was very intrigued when the Father Ernetti revealed that there was a machine that could answer all questions related to the Bible. 
When Father François asked about the Machine, Father Ernetti described the Chronovisor, saying that it was device that functioned just like a T.V., but instead of receiving transmissions from local stations, the chronovisor was able to tune into the past and allow the viewer to “see and hear” events that had occurred centuries before. 
Ernetti told Brune that the machine worked by detecting images and sounds that humanity had ‘created’ which were “floating” in space. 
It is said that this intriguing device and the project behind it were canceled by the Vatican but not destroyed. Some believe the Chronovisor is located somewhere in the Vatican, hidden in one of the many chambers, hidden away from society. 
However, there are other versions that suggest that father Ernetti and his team decided to voluntarily dismantle the device because, since it could tune anywhere and anytime in the past, if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could create the “scariest dictatorship the world has ever seen.” 
Interestingly, before Father Ernetti died in April 1994, he wrote a letter in which he INSISTED that the device was real and was not a hoax as many believed. 
Father Ernetti claimed that the alleged photograph the chronovisor had captured of Jesus Christ on the cross, showing the sorrowful face of a bearded man gazing towards the heavens was real, even though some critics argue that the image was a reproduction of a statue of Jesus located in a church in Perugia. 
Critics also claim that the alleged text the device managed to observe of “Thyestes” included Latin words that did not exist at the time it was made. 
In 1994, Father Ernetti also said that “Pope Pius XII forbade us to do disclose any details about this device because the machine was very dangerous. It can restrain the freedom of man…” 
However, in 1988, the Vatican issued a decree in which it warned that “anyone using, an instrument of such characteristics would be excommunicated.” According to many, this was an unnecessary warning since according to them the Chronovisor never existed. So why issue a warning if it was just another hoax? 
What do you think about the story behind the Chronovisor? Do you think it is another top secret ‘object’ kept away from society by the Vatican? SF Source Rise Earth  ",0
7104,ESPN Makes Sudden Guidelines Change to Limit On-Air Talent’s Political Commentary - Breitbart,"It appears that sports cable network ESPN will finally address accusations that it has become far too political, and has now issued new guidelines to reign in talent by ensuring that   political commentary is tied more directly to sports. [The new rules come after years of fans and customers complaining that ESPN has become a bastion of   views delivered at the expense of sports, and to the utter exclusion of any conservative ideas.  While in some cases it appears the new rules do offer a little wiggle room for   talent, the rules seem to be aimed at tamping down the wild spouting on political topics its hosts have indulged for the last few years. It is also interesting that ESPN released these new guidelines right in the middle of the NCAA Championship game when fans were distracted by the tournament and might not have taken notice of the change. It is almost like the practice of dumping political news on a Friday evening in the hopes that it might make fewer waves because all the reporters have already gone home for the weekend. ESPN’s vice president of global digital content, Patrick Stiegman, noted that the rise of social media and the many controversies that   talent recently stirred via Twitter and Facebook was a major reason for the new guidelines. “We have the convergence of a politically charged environment and all these new technologies coming together at once,” Stiegman told ESPN’s Jim Brady. “Based on that, we wanted the policy to reflect the reality of the world today. There are people talking about politics in ways we have not seen before, and we’re not immune from that. ” Brady, also ESPN’s ombudsman, addressed complaints from fans that the network has become too political in a long article published last November. Brady made to investigate the claims that his network had become infected with liberal politics, and at that time concluded that was not the case. Despite Brady’s obviously skewed “investigation” from November, it now appears that the network has accepted the charge that it has become too political. Some of the changes include a proscription against political advocacy, including the one that states, “Original news reports should not include statements of support, opposition or partisanship related to any social issue, political position, candidate or office holder. ” The rules also both directly and indirectly mention social media, stating, “Writers, reporters, producers and editors directly involved in ‘hard’ news reporting, investigative or enterprise assignments and related coverage should refrain in any   forum from taking positions on political or social issues, candidates or office holders. ” By “  forum,” the network means social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Indeed, later in the new policy, it directly notes that the new rules apply to “ESPN, Twitter, Facebook and other media. ” The new guidelines also inform hosts that any interviews with candidates will have to be cleared by executives so that “balance” can be assessed. It also says that presentations must be balanced, stating “The presentation should be thoughtful and respectful. We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric. ” The new rules could act to temper the extreme liberalism in which hosts have routinely indulged. But, it remains to be seen if the network will stick to the policy if the   commentary goes on unabated. After all, it should be noted that the network had rules similar to these before and it neither calmed the   liberal outbursts nor did the rules form the basis for any punishment of violations of anyone spouting liberal political views.

7105,A Rabbi’s Enduring Sermon on Living Your Last Five Minutes - The New York Times,"Thirty years ago, amid the somber prayers of Judaism’s holiest day, Rabbi Kenneth Berger rose to deliver the Yom Kippur sermon. He spoke to his congregants about a tragedy many of them, including his daughter, had witnessed eight months earlier in the Florida sky: the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Rabbi Berger focused on one particular detail, the revelation that Challenger’s seven astronauts had remained alive for the   fall to the ocean. He called the homily “Five Minutes to Live,” and he likened the crew members to Jews, who are called during the High Holy Days to engage in the process of “heshbon ” Hebrew for taking stock of one’s soul. “Can you imagine knowing that in a few moments death was imminent?” Rabbi Berger said at the Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Tampa, Fla. “What would we think of if, God forbid, you and I were in such circumstances? What would go through our mind?” Not quite three years later, Rabbi Berger was on a flight to Chicago from Denver returning from a family vacation. The plane’s tail engine exploded en route, crippling the controls, and for 40 minutes, the passengers prepared for a crash landing. The rabbi’s wife, Aviva, fainted from the shock. Rabbi Berger reached across the seats and gathered the hands of his daughter Avigail, 16, and son Jonathan, 9, trying to reassure them, Avigail would later recall. The plane burst into flames after it hit the ground in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 people, including the rabbi and his wife, both in their early 40s. As Jews enter the Days of Awe, which begin at sundown on Sunday, Rabbi Berger’s sermon on the Challenger has achieved a piercing and eerie kind of immortality. Between its eloquence and its prophecy, “Five Minutes to Live” continues to be cited, written about and delivered as a tribute, especially during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. Both the sermon’s theme and its presentiment of the rabbi’s death resonate with the theological essence of the High Holy Days. In his sermon, Rabbi Berger plucked several   sentences of the liturgy, rearranging them for heightened effect: “Who shall live and who shall die? Who shall attain the measure of a man’s days and who shall not? On Rosh Hashana, it is inscribed, and on Yom Kippur, it is sealed. ” “People are hungry for guidance in living a life that matters,” said Rabbi Edward Bernstein of Temple Torat Emet in Boynton Beach, Fla. “Rabbi Berger, in his words, inspired people to action. And his death made those words holy. ” Judaism is hardly unique among world religions in urging its believers to undertake a moral inventory. Catholics participate in confession, formally called the sacrament of reconciliation, while Muslims call the process of repentance by the Arabic word “tawbah,” which means “turning back. ” What is unusual in the American Jewish idiom is that heshbon   is addressed by rabbis on the two holidays each year when synagogue attendance grows exponentially. Mindful of another autumn ritual, Rabbi Berger called it “the World Series. ” Kenneth Berger, who grew up in suburban Philadelphia, was ordained by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and took on the pulpit of Rodeph Sholom in 1983. There he made his reputation as a trusted confidant for congregants in crises who could also   into donning a Big Bird costume to entertain the children. He boiled down Judaic erudition to aphorisms like “There’s no roof overhead unless you build it. ” Invariably chewing a straw and clutching a pen, he drafted his sermons on a yellow legal pad, and then read them over the phone to his father in Pennsylvania. When the rabbi’s words really connected to his synagogue audience, he would permit himself a brief moment of ego, telling his children, “I hit a home run. ” On Sept. 16, 1986, the day Rabbi Berger delivered “Five Minutes to Live,” the Challenger tragedy was fresh in the minds of his congregants. From that shared memory, Rabbi Berger extrapolated in both prosaic and profound directions. He touched on the ordinary ways that people forget to express love for their families, blithely assuming there will always be another day. He recounted the story of a Jewish father, facing imminent death during the Holocaust, who bestowed a final kiss on the young son he was sending away to safety. “That scene still haunts me,” Rabbi Berger said as the sermon closed, returning to the Challenger. “The explosion and then five minutes. If only I  …     If only I  …     And then the capsule hits the water, it’s all over. Then you realize it’s all the same  —   five minutes, five days, 50 years. It’s all the same, for it’s over before we realize. “‘If only I knew’  —   yes, my friends, it may be the last time. ‘If only I realized’  —   yes, stop, appreciate the blessings you have. ‘If only I could’  —   you still can, you’ve got today. ” After Rabbi Berger and his wife died on July 19, 1989, his brother Samuel and    Trisanne stepped in to take care of the family. The rabbi’s middle child, Ilana, then 13, had been at camp at the time of the crash. Avigail spent a month in a coma from her injuries, awakening to the absence of her mother or father at her bedside. Jonathan suffered lesser injuries. Samuel Berger found the text for “Five Minutes to Live” while cleaning out his brother’s office. The sermon made its way to Avigail, who laminated it and keeps it in her jewelry box. The sermon also took on its public life. Rabbi Michael Swarttz of Temple B’nai Shalom in Braintree, Mass. quoted large portions of it in his homily on Yom Kippur in 1989. Rabbi Larry Pinsker of Congregation Beit Tikvah in Baltimore assembled a “book of remembrance” about Rabbi Berger, in which many contributors mentioned the sermon. Rabbi Mel Glazer of Colorado Springs, Colo. included part of the sermon in his 2013 book, “A GPS for Grief and Healing. ” Twice in the last two years, Rabbi Bernstein in Florida has referred to “Five Minutes to Live” in online essays  —   one on the 30th anniversary of the Challenger tragedy, the other after the mysterious disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines flight in 2014 over the Indian Ocean. “I find it in hindsight even more moving than when I heard it,” said Marty Solomon, who was president of Rodeph Sholom in 1986. “As much as anything else, it’s a living legacy from Kenny. It’s universal and it will be forever. ”",0
7106,"Syrian Mother: ISIS Baked Christians Adults, ‘Kneaded’ Christian Children in Bakery Machines","by FRANCES MARTEL A Syrian Christian mother shared her story of escaping the Islamic State terrorist group in a suburb of Damascus while losing her son, George, after he refused to identify himself to the terrorists by a Muslim name. 
The woman, Alice Assaf, said that she had heard that her son, who was beaten and shot to death, was spared a much worse fate: being baked in the ovens of the local bakery or “kneaded” to death in the bakery’s industrial-sized mixer. 
Assaf told her story to Roads of Success , a human rights NGO with a focus on the rights of women and Christians in the Middle East. The group has provided testimony of the plight of Christians and Yazidis persecuted by the Islamic State to the House Foreign Relations Committee and regularly publishes video interviews with ISIS attack survivors. 
The Christian Post picked up the story and video interview, in which Assaf narrates the final days of her 18-year-old’s life. 
Assaf says her suburb was targeted two years ago by Islamic State jihadists. She and her children hid in the home of a Muslim neighbor when she first heard that ISIS had come to town to kill its Christian population. 
“Later on, we heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,” she said. 
When the army of dictator Bashar al-Assad arrived to quell the ISIS uprising, the jihadist began throwing children off of balconies and roofs in an attempt to scare the soldiers away. “The oldest was 4,” she recalls. 
The killing, “in the beginning… was against Christians,” but they later started killing anyone who they believed affiliated to the Syrian army. Assaf and her family were betrayed by the Muslim neighbor who hid them. She pleaded with her eldest son, George, to use a Muslim name and deny his faith. “I don’t want to hide myself,” Assaf says her son said, “you are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said: whoever denies me before men, I will also deny them before Heaven.” “They took him to the backyard to shot and kill him… they killed him because his name was ‘George,’” a Christian name, she notes. George was buried in a mass grave, and Assaf does not know his whereabouts. While Assaf managed to escape, many Christian communities in Syria and Iraq remain under siege. One of the largest regional Christian population centers – Mosul, Iraq – remains under Islamic State control, with a coalition of Iraqi soldiers, Kurds, and Shiite militias working to liberate it. There is no guarantee that Christians will return to repopulate those areas. Roads of Success has profiled those Christians who insist on staying in Iraq and Syria and, perhaps even more dangerous, proselytizing their faith. “The great thing is that

7107,Report: Hillary Clinton Spent ’Tens of Millions of Dollars’ on Failed Digital Youth Outreach Campaign - Breitbart,"Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton allegedly spent “tens of millions of dollars” on digital youth outreach during her campaign, reportedly spending an extra $30 million on internet adverts just over a month before election day. [“Mrs. Clinton employed more than 100 people in her digital team and spent tens of millions of dollars targeting millennials with a series of   messages on Facebook,” reported the Telegraph on Monday. “But experts said she might have been better off buying newspaper or local TV adverts in the handful of key states she unexpectedly lost. ”  “Mrs. Clinton’s digital team, sitting in their Brooklyn headquarters under a ‘Swipe Right for Hillary’ banner, were told to think ‘out of the box’ and appeal to young voters on social media, using outlets including Snapchat and Pinterest,” it continued. “A total of 30 young staff members were assigned to film her on the campaign trail and post the slickly edited videos on Facebook. ” Other projects that Clinton’s campaign spent money on in an attempt to secure millennials included a   comic book series based on what they predicted a Donald Trump presidency would look like, while Facebook adverts took the top priority. “Her big problem was not reaching working class voters in about three key states,” said Justin Holmes, assistant professor of political science at the University of Iowa. “With social media you can target specific groups, but they were focused on young women and Latinos. ” “If anything, if the Clinton campaign had bought a few more ads in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin newspapers she might have won,” added Holmes, who also claimed that the   rate of social media adverts were “terrible” and were only a way of “preaching to the choir. ” “It’s a lot of people who have already made up their minds. There is some value in mobilising people who already support you, but those other people are harder to reach,” he concluded. “What’s a candidate supposed to do in the future? I don’t know. ” In their report, The Telegraph also claimed that digital advertising “made up 14. 4 per cent of the total spent in 2016 compared to only 1. 7 per cent in 2012,” adding around 40% of the budget, or $428 million, would have been spent on Facebook adverts. “That’s not to say Facebook doesn’t work,” said political consultant Neil Oxman. “I think it’s better to have them than not have them  …     But one of the reasons she didn’t win was because she spent almost no money on traditional advertising in Wisconsin and Michigan. ” “Hillary Clinton should get all her money back. It didn’t work,” proclaimed Vanderbilt University Political Science Professor John Geer. “Anyone who relies on     as a group, unfortunately, what we would call those candidates are losers. Because they never turn out. ” “We are in a situation where we should really   all the money they are pouring into these adverts because it seems crazy,” he concluded. During Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, a PAC in her favor also paid over $1 million for internet trolls to scour the web and “correct” negative things said about Clinton online. In September, the same PAC also offered a paid bounty to anyone who had dirt on Trump. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

The    comedian and actress, who played Amy Schumer’s sidekick in the movie “Trainwreck” last summer, grew up in Cleveland and discovered the meaning of “comic relief” while battling leukemia as a teenager. “I don’t know if it made me funnier, but it was so amazing, how it made everything be O. K.,” she said. Ms. Bayer lives in a   apartment in a West Village   by herself. “But I just realized there’s a part of my floor that squeaks,” she said, “so it’s kind of like I have a cute pet. ” SOFA BOUND I try to get up by 3. I put a sweatshirt on over my PJs and I go down my stairs. It’s like a loft where I live my bedroom is upstairs. My TV is in an entertainment center. You have to open the doors for the remote to work, so I open those and then I sit down on my couch. I’ll forget my slippers upstairs and I’ll be like, “Ugh! I have to go upstairs to get them. ” It’s like eight stairs. But stairs are stairs. THAT MAKEUP I’ll wash my face because I start to feel like my eyes are stuck together. It’s so much makeup from the show. I usually don’t shower. There’s just no reason. ‘TOASTED!’ I order food from my couch and I don’t leave my couch again until it comes. I’ll order a bagel. I’ll get really mad because they will forget to toast it. It didn’t happen when I lived further east, near NYU. Those people were really on it. I’d say it takes me a good 10 minutes to get over it. I’ll have a savory or sesame bagel. Sometimes I’ll get a raisin bagel with raisin walnut cream cheese and they’ll use a knife they cut an onion bagel with and then there’s a whole section of the bagel I can’t eat. I usually order coffee with the bagel. My coffee maker isn’t the best, so I like ordering it in. Sometimes the coffee will have spilled onto the bagel, and then of course, you know how upsetting that is. UNREALITY TELEVISION I’ll sit and I’ll watch TV while I’m eating my bagel. It’s stuff I have  . “Real Housewives,” stuff on Bravo. I also weirdly watch “General Hospital. ” I used to watch it and then I stopped and now I’ve started watching it again. They have a lot of supernatural stuff. I truly love it, but the level of believability is very low. It’s very refreshing.  PRIORITIES I joined Twitter two years ago. I was late to it. So I am still really into it. I’ll make a tweet. Wait, is that what you say? Post a tweet? I’ll post a tweet and then I’ll call my brother and say, “Hey, did you see my tweet?” I won’t talk on the phone too much. It’s usually fun to talk to my parents. I mean, it’s always fun! I don’t want to burn my parents. But I don’t pick up the phone much on Sundays. I like texting with friends, but I find if I am watching TV, I have to focus on the show. CHECKING THE FRIDGE My fridge is usually pretty empty. If I can get it together to order FreshDirect, I will have some fruit and yogurt in the fridge. But there isn’t a ton of stuff you would cook with. I feel like my parents are going to be very proud of me when they read this. NOISES OFF I usually meditate twice a day, Transcendental Meditation. For some reason, I always forget to meditate on Sunday, because it’s such a weird day, and I’ll remember at 5 and meditate for 20 minutes. And it’s great, because I’ll feel like I’m getting something done. Even though I am sitting on the couch. DELIVERY At 7 or 8 I decide to order dinner. I try and eat kind of healthy on Sunday nights, to balance out the bagel. Some kind of salad, or sushi sometimes. At dinner, I’ll switch to HBO. I can stay up watching TV so late. The problem is I don’t get tired early because of staying up so late. I might order a snack, popcorn, at 11. Sometimes I’ll order in three times on Sundays. People think New York is crazy and busy, but it’s actually a great place for lazy people to live. You can order microwaveable popcorn! I’ll order, like, those bags of it. But there’s a minimum, so then I’ll order laundry detergent. I wonder sometimes what the doormen think of me.",0
7109,No-Fly Zone Declared as Militarized Police Prep for Assault on ‘Front-Line Camp’ at Standing Rock,"No-Fly Zone Declared as Militarized Police Prep for Assault on ‘Front-Line Camp’ at Standing Rock   Jay Syrmopoulos 
Cannon Ball, ND – Pipeline opponents attempting to protect their water supply from the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL), as well as prevent the continued destruction of burial grounds and cultural sites, are anticipating a confrontation with police today. This news come after “water protectors” refused law enforcement requests to vacate reoccupied land in the pipeline’s path, owned by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. 
Last week, native activists took the bold action of declaring eminent domain over their traditional territory and set up a new camp “Front-Line” camp directly in the pipeline’s path. Pipeline opponents say they have simply reclaimed the land under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, clearly noting the Sioux never ceded that territory. The new encampment lies across Highway 1806, where pipeline security guards armed with guard dogs and pepper spray attacked protestors attempting to stop the bulldozing of cultural sites and burial grounds on September 3. 
The impending crisis comes after nearly 200 water protectors set up the new camp on land that Energy Transfer Partners last month purchased from a local rancher in an effort to bolster strategic and tactical control of areas surrounding construction of the controversial pipeline. 
According to the AP , however, the Native Americans claim the land is theirs by way of an “1851 treaty and they won’t leave until the pipeline is stopped.”“We never ceded this land,” said protester Joye Braun. 
This latest flashpoint in the ongoing conflict is north of the larger and more permanent encampments, which have been constructed on federally owned land where over 200 Native American tribes have gathered to oppose the pipeline’s construction. 
On Wednesday, a heavily militarized law enforcement presence began mobilizing heavy equipment, including Humvees, armored personnel carriers, buses and demanded the protestors leave the occupied area. 
In an ominous sign, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has restricted flights , and banned the use of drones within a radius of about 4 ½ miles of Cannon Ball. The FAA declared that only aircraft affiliated with the North Dakota Tactical Operation Center are allowed within the restricted airspace. The flight restriction went into effect Wednesday and will last until November 5. 
Indian Country Today reports : 
What began with prayers and a single tipi alongside Highway 1806 quickly grew to more than a dozen tipis surrounded by tents, buses, cars and hundreds of water protectors. Some are calling it the “1851 Treaty Camp” to acknowledge their Treaty rights. 
Across the road is the encroaching pipeline and a heavily militarized police force with armored vehicles, helicopters, planes, ATVs and busloads of officers. Tensions are growing as unarmed citizens worry that police will use unnecessarily harsh tactics. 
In recent weeks, nearly 300 unarmed water protectors who were arrested have been subjected to pepper spray, strip-searches, delayed bail, exaggerated charges and physical violence, according to interviews with several who were taken into custody. The ACLU and National Lawyers Guild recently sent attorneys to Standing Rock to help the Red Owl Collective, a team of volunteer lawyers headed by attorney Bruce Ellison, who are representing many of those arrested. 
The massive law enforcement contingent, consisting of sheriff’s deputies and officers from numerous other states and counties, as well as National Guard, began staging near the encampment — with scores of Armored Personnel Carriers, buses and Humvees poised at the ready. 
“At some point the rule of law has to be enforced,” Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said Wednesday. “We could go down there at any time. We’re trying not to.” 
Dakota Access LLC, the pipeline developer released a statement encouraging trespassers to “vacate the land immediately” or be “removed from the land.” 
“Alternatively and in coordination with local law enforcement and county/state officials, all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land,” the company said. “Lawless behavior will not be tolerated.” 
Just days ago, sheriff’s officials had said earlier they didn’t have the resources to immediately remove activists from the private land, about 50 miles south of Bismarck. Subsequently, law enforcement officials put out a call for reinforcements, with hundreds of officers from out of state responding. 
On Wednesday, actor and environmental activist Mark Ruffalo and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson went to the new camp to speak and pray with the water protectors. Ruffalo had arrived the night before to speak on an anti-DAPL panel with Native activists at the Prairie Knights Casino and Hotel, according to Indian Country Today. 
After touring the camp Jackson spoke to the crowd, reminding people that nonviolence is key to winning the battle for justice. 
“With promises broken, land stolen, and sacred lands desecrated, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is standing up for their right to clean water. They have lost land for settlers to farm, more land for gold in the Black Hills, and then again even more land for the damn (sic) that was built for flood control and hydro power,” Jackson said. 
When will the taking stop? When will we start treating the first peoples of these lands with the respect and honor they deserve? 
The rerouting of the pipeline away from Bismarck to its current route is “the ripest case of environmental racism I’ve seen in a long time,” Jackson said. “Bismarck residents don’t want their water threatened, so why is it okay for North Dakota to react with guns and tanks when Native Americans ask for the same right?” 
The pipeline was originally scheduled to run north of Bismarck until local residents expressed displeasure with the plan, with the DAPL ultimately being rerouted to its current trajectory near the Oceti Sakowin Standing Rock Reservation. 
With an impending militarized police raid of the camp, Mekasi Camp-Horinek, one of the camp coordinators, told officers the protesters planned to stand their ground, saying “Do what you’ve got to do,” according to the Bismarck Tribune 
“I don’t have a crystal ball to know when it will happen, but we know it will happen,” said Mekasi Camp-Horinek, a member of the Ponca tribe in Oklahoma. “We’re going to hold this ground.” 
Water protectors could be heard chanting, “Stand in peace against the beast.” 
“I’m here to die if I have to. I don’t want to die but I will,” said Didi Banerji, who lives in Toronto but is originally from the Spirit Lake Sioux reservation in North Dakota. 
The protesters are simply trying to keep law enforcement from preventing their efforts to stop the pipeline said David Red Bear Jr., 30, from the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. 
“If we don’t stop them here, they’re going to cut us off closer to the pipeline. We can’t let that happen,” Red Bear said. “We’re not trying to force anybody’s hand. We’re just trying to stand up for what we believe in.” 
The reality is that the citizens of North Dakota are funding a protection force, in the form of police, for a multi-billion dollar corporate entity. North Dakota’s Emergency Commission previously approved $6 million in emergency funding for law enforcement costs related to the protest — with almost all of those funds having been used already. The Department of Emergency Services plans to ask for more, spokeswoman Cecily Fong said. 
Do North Dakotans want their tax money spent on police acting as paid enforcers for Wall Street and big oil interests? 
While law enforcement claims they are just doing their job and enforcing the law, in reality, they are acting as enforcers for an unjust corporate oligarchy that consistently puts money over people. The financial elite are the ones who the police are truly protecting and serving — not the American people. Share This Article...",0
7110,Listening to This New Podcast Could Save Your Life on Election Day - The New York Times,"People on both sides of the aisle are concerned that this election might pose an existential threat to society. But did you know there’s one particularly dangerous time of day to vote? It has nothing to do with voter intimidation  —   but everything to do with how you get to the polls. Hear about the hazards of Election Day  —   and other types of “Strange Danger”  —   on the debut episode of Tell Me Something I Don’t Know with its host, Stephen J. Dubner. In everything he’s done, Mr. Dubner has made it his mission to tell people about things they thought they knew but didn’t, and things they didn’t think they wanted to know but do. This manifesto has informed his “Freakonomics” books (authored with Steven D. Levitt, an economist at the University of Chicago) and his Freakonomics Radio podcast. Now Mr. Dubner has a new way to carry on that mission: hosting a New York Times podcast, Tell Me Something I Don’t Know. On each episode, contestants get up onstage, in front of a live audience, and present an “IDK”  —   “I don’t know”  —   which might be a strange fact, some groundbreaking research or a forgotten piece of history. Three celebrity panelists poke and prod the presenters, and ultimately choose a winner. It’s still factual and still journalism, but disguised as a game show. For our debut show, the theme is “Strange Danger,” with these panelists: Debora Spar, president of Barnard College of Columbia University and author of “Wonder Women: Sex, Power, and the Quest for Perfection. ” She speaks faster backward than you do forward. Anthony Marx, president of the New York Public Library and former president of Amherst College, who, in his youth, crossed a border illegally. Andy Zaltzman, comedian, political satirist and host of The Bugle podcast, who moonlights as a midwife very occasionally. Our “  Human Fact Checker” is Jody Avirgan, who hosts FiveThirtyEight’s Elections podcast. Election Day is just one of the strange dangers featured on this episode. We also have a sleep specialist from Atlanta with a theory on why we need our zzzzs. Also: An emergency room doctor describes the (shall we say) unusual actions of people about to freeze to death. And a Princeton professor tells us why supermarket shelves went empty in the early 1970s. (Hint: This was around the time Johnny Carson made a joke that led to   hoarding.)

7111,"Reeking, Oozing Algae Closes South Florida Beaches - The New York Times","STUART, Fla.  —   A rancid smell penetrated the front of Marisa and Duncan Baskin’s   house, which rests less than 100 feet from an inlet of the St. Lucie River in this tourist hamlet just inside the Atlantic coastline that bills itself as “America’s Happiest Seaside Town. ” But the Baskins  —   whose    daughter, like Ms. Baskin, suffers from asthma  —   and their neighbors are not so happy these days. In the water of the inlet of their subdivision in Northriver Shores, an   layer of bubbling ooze and slime emits a stench so overwhelming that none of the neighbors go outside. In fact, the Baskins were preparing Friday to stay with friends across town for the weekend just to get away from the green and blue algae bloom that has overtaken their small neighborhood marina, from which most neighbors have moved their boats. “Our lives revolve around the water we have a boat, surfboards, and there’s nothing really to do here without the water,” Ms. Baskin, 31, a lifelong resident of Stuart who works as a social worker at a local hospital, said Friday. “And I think our governor and local politicians are to blame. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but it’s definitely the worst. ” At play are many of the forces that define modern Florida: competing environmental, residential and agricultural interests, a failure by state officials to invest in managing the demands of growth, finger pointing between state and federal officials. The result has been an environmental nightmare playing out here, about 35 miles from the source of the problem in Lake Okeechobee. There, an aging dike system forces the Army Corps of Engineers to release controlled discharges through channel locks east and west from the lake to protect nearby towns from flooding. However, those discharges, which carry pollutants from agricultural lands that flow into the lake from the north, pour into rivers and lagoons downstream, which eventually dump into the ocean. When too much polluted discharge from Okeechobee hits areas downstream like the St. Lucie River estuary in Stuart, for example, the blend of fresh and salt water creates giant phosphorescent plumes of algae, making the water unsafe for human and aquatic life alike. This week, Gov. Rick Scott declared states of emergency in Martin, St. Lucie, Palm Beach and Lee Counties, and Senators Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, both visited the scene, expressing concern. The Corps of Engineers is dealing with a dike nearly 80 years old with structural problems. It was originally designed during a time when environmental preservation was not an issue. Engineers also have to balance the concerns of environmentalists with the need to safeguard area residents  —   more than eight million people are affected by the water system, according to a corps spokesman, John Campbell. “We’re constantly having to balance the potential of an environmental impact from releasing water against the very real public safety hazard of containing the water and the hazard that poses by putting pressure on the dike itself,” Mr. Campbell said by telephone Thursday from Jacksonville, Fla. “The system is so constrained that everything that was   fruit has been done so far. We are left with few options or constraints to work with. ” He said the water levels the Army Corps gauges to determine how to react to discharges are between 12. 5 feet and 15. 5 feet. The lake is currently at 14. 9 feet, roughly a foot higher than it was during the last crisis at the same time of year in 2013, Mr. Campbell said. With hurricane season yet to come, the Army Corps still has to carefully determine how to release and plug the dikes. It takes roughly one month to release six inches of water from the lake, Mr. Campbell said, so if significant rains fell, the dike could have “performance issues” and the Army Corps would have to take precautions to prevent a disaster that would bring “widespread damage and problems, especially if the water goes south, which is where the water wants to go anyway. ” But residents along the coast are tired of the excuses. They say there is enough blame to go around at both the state and federal levels, with Big Agriculture playing a significant role. “Everybody’s known about this problem for years  —   that there’s a big algae bloom, and now it’s worse than 2013,” Richard Day, 51, who has lived in Stuart since 1973 and works as an auto mechanic at a downtown garage, said Friday. “I’ve got friends who captain boats and they’re moving south to Jupiter in Palm Beach County. It’s just sad. ” Mark Perry, executive director of the Florida Oceanographic Society, based in Stuart, said the state’s inability to close a deal to purchase thousands of acres of land south of Lake Okeechobee  —   to create a natural runoff from the lake into the Florida Everglades, where the diverse ecosystem could naturally filter toxins from the north  —   has been to blame for the problems being experienced by communities west and east of the lake like Stuart. But the area south of the lake has been controlled by sugar farmers for decades, and environmentalists like Mr. Perry say state legislators in Tallahassee kowtow to agricultural lobbyists who fund their   campaigns. “The flow used to go south to the Everglades, and now this is a   criminal disaster,” Mr. Perry said. “They, as in the state and federal government, say they can’t send the water south, but they can. This is an absolute atrocity that they are allowed to continue this in the name of agriculture. This is the worst I’ve ever seen it. ” The 2016 sugar harvest was the longest on record because of rain delays, making it also one of the most profitable on record, resulting in 2. 15 million tons of sugar. Under Mr. Scott, the board of the South Florida Water Management District failed in 2015 to carry out a plan to buy roughly 47, 000 acres of land from U. S. Sugar south of Lake Okeechobee that would have acted as a reservoir for the lake’s runoff. “The political leadership has not been putting the demand on the agencies to fix the problem,” Mr. Perry said. “This water was never meant to go east and west  —   it was meant to go south. ” Here in Stuart, where the algae lapped up on area shorelines, keeping public beaches closed  —   a first in the area  —   Ms. Baskin and her daughter stood outside in their front yard, wincing at the smell. She said she and her husband were considering whether to sell the home they purchased just two years ago. No one else was seen around the neighborhood. “Normally there are kids outside playing,” she said. “But not right now  —   it’s a ghost town. ”",0

One of the Islamic State’s most senior strategists, Abu Muhammad   was killed in the Syrian province of Aleppo. A founding member of ISIS, he was its chief propagandist and headed its efforts to instigate terror attacks in the West. _____ 2. The European Union’s antitrust enforcer ruled that huge tax breaks Ireland provided to Apple were illegal, ordering the country to collect about $14. 5 billion in back taxes. Apple described the record penalty as a “devastating blow” to the rule of law, and the U. S. despite its own frustrations with corporate schemes to avoid taxes, said it jeopardized “the important spirit of economic partnership between the U. S. and the E. U. ” _____ 3.   races in Florida and Arizona made Tuesday one of the summer’s biggest congressional primary days. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, above, who was forced to step down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee by an email leak, hung on to her South Florida House seat. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was nominated by Republican voters for a second term, and John McCain fought off a Republican challenger for his Senate seat. _____ 4. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are preparing for the first presidential debate, due in less than four weeks, in tellingly different ways. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are consulting Mr. Trump’s ghostwriter on “The Art of the Deal” and psychology experts, reviewing his past performances and looking for trigger points. Mr. Trump has had freewheeling sessions with his debate team, but not mock debates with a Clinton  . _____ 5. Brazil’s Senate could vote overnight on whether to convict President Dilma Rousseff of manipulating the federal budget to mask the extent of the country’s economic problems. “Don’t expect from me the obliging silence of cowards,” Ms. Rousseff said as she made a   rebuttal on Monday. _____ 6. Israel has been quietly legalizing tiny outposts established by settlers in the West Bank over the past two decades.   groups accuse the government of changing the map of the West Bank, now in its 50th year of Israeli occupation, and ruining any possibility of a   solution. “We see it as a very gradual move toward annexation,” said an Israeli opponent. _____ 7. Reader appreciations for Gene Wilder are rolling in by the hundreds in comments on our obituary and on our Facebook post. Our critic mused on the genius of the comic actor, who died Monday at the age of 83: glimmering eyes, diction “as crisp as a potato chip” and a barely suppressed lunacy. “His Willy Wonka spent that chocolate factory tour quietly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. ” _____ 8. Our magazine has the back story of Oliver Stone’s herculean efforts to make “Snowden,” the biopic of Edward Snowden opening Sept. 16. Mr. Stone became preoccupied with warding off government surveillance and schemed to secure Mr. Snowden’s appearance in the movie’s finale. That passage required nine takes. “Ed is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,” Mr. Stone said. “But I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him. ” _____ 9. An organization that tracks extremist groups in the U. S. has declared one of them, White Lives Matter, a hate group. Established in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, the group argues that white Americans are being eradicated by immigration and intermarriage. “I wish Hitler were here alive and well today,” one of its founders wrote on a social networking site. _____ 10.

Steve in Dallas has graciously arranged for us to meet at 
Cantina Laredo 4546 Belt Line Rd Dallas, TX 75244 
As you can see, it is just east of Beltline and Midway, on the south side: 
We’ll start at 5:00 PM. I’m sure I’ll be there until at least 8 PM. Steve says he’s hosted many groups there before, so the manager is fine with us not knowing how many people will join. That means you don’t need to worry about there being enough room for everyone if we have the high class problem of really good turnout. 
In all the meetups, readers have really enjoyed getting to chat with other members of the community, so I’m looking forward to another fun event. I am flying into Dallas that AM, so the only caveat is that if the Dallas or NY airports are reported to be having serious problems in the morning, you might double check the site for updates (although I think you should plan on meeting regardless even if I wind up being delayed).

7117,Local Transmission of Zika Virus Is Reported in Texas - The New York Times,"A probable case of local transmission of the Zika virus has been reported in Texas, state health officials announced on Monday, making it the second state, after Florida, in which the infection is thought to have been carried from person to person by mosquitoes. The patient is a woman who is not pregnant and lives in Brownsville, on the Gulf Coast near the Mexican border. The state’s first case of chikungunya, a virus spread by the type of mosquito that carries Zika, was confirmed this year in Brownsville. Medical investigators must now determine whether the infection is spreading and, if so, how many people may have become infected. Officials have begun asking the woman’s neighbors for urine samples and trapping mosquitoes to test for the virus. State and county health officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the case. The state medical operations center has been activated to help with contact tracing, mosquito surveillance and public education. The C. D. C. sent a training team to Texas this year but has not yet been asked to send an emergency response team, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the agency’s director. No travel alert suggesting that pregnant women avoid the area will be issued now, Dr. Frieden said, because a single case does not constitute evidence of continuing local transmission. “Most local cases are isolated dead ends,” he said. Confirmation of several cases within a roughly    area for more than about two weeks, despite aggressive mosquito control, would prompt an alert from federal authorities. In Florida this year, the C. D. C. first advised pregnant women to avoid Wynwood, the neighborhood where the first cases in Miami were discovered, and later suggested they avoid all of   County. There have now been 4, 444 confirmed cases of Zika infection in the continental United States, including 1, 114 in pregnant women. Most of those infected had traveled to countries where the virus had been spreading, but 182 of the infections were contracted in Florida by people who had not visited such places. The Texas patient, who was not identified, told investigators that she had not traveled recently to anywhere the virus had been spreading. She had no other risk factors, such as having sex with someone who had visited an area with Zika transmission. “We knew it was only a matter of time before we saw a Zika case spread by a mosquito in Texas,” said Dr. John Hellerstedt, the state health commissioner. Residents of Brownsville, a city of 183, 000, are concerned but not fearful, Mayor Tony Martinez said on Monday. “I don’t think it’s something that people need to be alarmed about, but by the same token, they need to be cautious about it and report anything that needs to be reported to our health department,” Mr. Martinez said. “On the coast, we kind of hoped that it wouldn’t happen,” he added, “but the likelihood was pretty high. ” Dr. Carmen Rocco, a Brownsville pediatrician, said she had been checking her patients for Zika, but none so far had been infected. Most of her patients are poor enough to be on Medicaid, and she praised state health officials for reinstating a Medicaid benefit for mosquito repellent. “Families were taking advantage of that,” she said. While cold weather is arriving in other parts of the country, southern Texas has had an unusually hot autumn, making it more hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit Zika. Even in normal years, Aedes aegypti can persist in the Brownsville area well into December, so new cases may be confirmed in January or later. “I predicted last April that we would see cases along the Texas Gulf Coast this summer,” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “This is now the one case we know about, but we don’t know if there are dozens or hundreds. ” “Because of the lack of funds from Congress, there has been no active surveillance along the Gulf Coast,” he added. “Those cases in Florida were found by serendipity. ” Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Department of State Health Services in Texas, said the new case was discovered because the woman fell ill and was tested for Zika infection by a local doctor, who alerted public health authorities. All such cases are investigated to see if a patient has a travel history or other risk factors that might explain the infection. “Pregnant women should continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites there and elsewhere in Texas,” Mr. Van Deusen said. Mosquito control measures will be stepped up, he said, but he did not know if they would involve aerial spraying of pesticides like Naled and larvicides like Bti. In the Wynwood section of Miami, mosquito swarms did not decrease enough to stop disease transmission until both types of aerial spraying were used. Thousands of Mexicans and Americans cross bridges over the Rio Grande each day in the Brownsville area it is possible that the virus has been spreading in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the border. In 2002, when there was a small outbreak of dengue in Brownsville, Dr. Hotez said, there turned out to be a much larger one in Matamoros. Both cities have poor neighborhoods where residents lack   and window screens, he said, but many more Matamoros residents live in poverty. “We won’t know how widespread the virus really was until babies with microcephaly begin being born, probably in the spring,” Dr. Hotez said, referring to the Zika virus and its link to the birth defect. “And I expect it to return next year. ” The C. D. C. regularly collaborates with Mexican health authorities, and Mexico “has quite a strong mosquito control program,” Dr. Frieden said. Exactly how much Zika infection there may be in nearby parts of Mexico is unknown. “We know there is transmission in the border areas,” Dr. Frieden said. “But exactly where, we don’t know. ”",0
7118,MOCKINGBIRD: The Subversion Of The Free Press By The CIA,"Washington, DC 20071 Dear Mr. Harwood, Though the Washington Post does not over-extend itself in the pursuit of hard news, just let drop the faintest rumor of a government ""conspiracy"", and a klaxon horn goes off in the news room. Aroused from apathy in the daily routine of reporting assignations and various other political and social sports events, editors and reporters scramble to the phones. The klaxon screams its warning: the greatest single threat to herd-journalism, corporate profits, and government stability -- the dreaded ""CONSPIRACY THEORY""!! It is not known whether anyone has actually been hassled or accosted by any of these frightful spectres, but their presence is announced to Post readers with a salvo of warnings to avoid the tricky, sticky webs spun by the wacko ""CONSPIRACY THEORISTS"". Recall how the Post saved us from the truth about Iran-Contra. Professional conspiracy exorcist Mark Hosenball was hired to ridicule the idea that Oliver North and his CIA-associated gangsters had conspired to do wrong (*1). And when, in their syndicated column, Jack Anderson and Dale Van Atta discussed some of the conspirators, the Post sprang to protect its readers, and the conspirators, by censoring the Anderson column before printing it (*2). But for some time the lid had been coming off the Iran-Contra conspiracy. In 1986, the Christic Institute, an interfaith center for law and public policy, had filed a lawsuit alleging a U.S. arms-for-drugs trade that helped keep weapons flowing to the CIA-Contra army in Nicaragua, and cocaine flowing to U.S. markets (*3). In 1988 Leslie Cockburn published Out of Control, a seminal work on our bizarre, illegal war against Nicaragua (*4). The Post contributed to this discovery process by disparaging the charges of conspiracy and by publishing false information about the drug-smuggling evidence presented to the House Subcommittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. When accused by Committee Chairman Charles Rangel (D-NY). of misleading reporting, the Post printed only a partial correction and declined to print a letter of complaint from Rangel (*5). Sworn testimony before Senator John Kerry's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations confirmed U.S. Government complicity in the drug trade (*6). With its coverup of the arms/drug conspiracy evaporating, the ever-accommodating Post shifted gears and retained Hosenball to exorcise from our minds a newly emerging threat to domestic tranquility, the ""October Surprise"" conspiracy (*7). But close on the heels of Hosenball and the Post came Barbara Honegger and then Gary Sick who authored independently, two years apart, books with the same title, ""October Surprise"" (*8). Honegger was a member of the Reagan/Bush campaign and transition teams in 1980. Gary Sick, professor of Middle East Politics at Columbia University, was on the staff of the National Security Council under Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan. In 1989 and 1991 respectively, Honegger and Sick published their evidence of how the Republicans made a deal to supply arms to Iran if Iran would delay release of the 52 United States hostages until after the November 1980 election. The purpose of this deal was to quash the possibility of a pre-election release(an October surprise). which would have bolstered the reelection prospects for President Carter. Others published details of this alleged Reagan-Bush conspiracy. In October 1988, Playboy Magazine ran an expose ""An Election Held Hostage""; FRONTLINE did another in April 1991 (*9). In June, 1991 a conference of distinguished journalists, joined by 8 of the former hostages, challenged the Congress to ""make a full, impartial investigation"" of the election/hostage allegations. The Post reported the statement of the hostages, but not a word of the conference itself which was held in the Dirksen Senate Office Building Auditorium (*10). On February 5, 1992 a gun-shy, uninspired House of Representatives begrudgingly authorized an ""October Surprise"" investigation by a task force of 13 congressmen headed by Lee Hamilton (D-IN). who had chaired the House of Representatives Iran-Contra Committee. Hamilton has named as chief team counsel Larry Barcella, a lawyer who represented BCCI when the Bank was indicted in 1988 (*11). Like the Washington Post, Hamilton had not shown interest in pursuing the U.S. arms-for-drugs operation (*12). He had accepted Oliver North's lies,and as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee he derailed House Resolution 485 which had asked President Reagan to answer questions about Contra support activities of government officials and others (*13). After CIA operative John Hull (from Hamilton's home state). was charged in Costa Rica with ""international drug trafficking and hostile acts against the nation's security"", Hamilton and 18 fellow members of Congress tried to intimidate Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez into handling Hull's case ""in a manner that will not complicate U.S.-Costa Rican relations"" (*14). The Post did not report the Hamilton letter or the Costa Rican response that declared Hull's case to be ""in as good hands as our 100 year old uninterrupted democracy can provide to all citizens"" (*15). Though the Post does its best to guide our thinking away from conspiracy theories, it is difficult to avoid the fact that so much wrongdoing involves government or corporate conspiracies: In its COINTELPRO operation, the FBI used disinformation, forgery, surveillance, false arrests, and violence to illegally harass U.S.citizens in the 60's (*16). The CIA's Operation MONGOOSE illegally sabotaged Cuba by ""destroying crops, brutalizing citizens, destabilizing the society, and conspiring with the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Castro and other leaders"" (*17).""Standard Oil of New Jersey was found by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to be conspiring with I.G.Farben...of Germany. ...By its cartel agreements with Standard Oil, the United States was effectively prevented from developing or producing [fo rWorld War-II] any substantial amount of synthetic rubber,"" said Senator Robert LaFollette of Wisconsin (*18). U.S. Government agencies knowingly withheld information about dosages of radiation ""almost certain to produce thyroid abnormalities or cancer"" that contaminated people residing near the nuclear weapons factory at Hanford, Washington (*19). Various branches of Government deliberately drag their feet in getting around to cleaning up the Nation's dangerous nuclear weapons sites (*20). State and local governments back the nuclear industry's secret public relations strategy (*21).""The National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society and some twenty comprehensive cancer centers, have misled and confused the public and Congress by repeated claims that we are winning the war against cancer. In fact, the cancer establishment has continually minimized the evidence for increasing cancer rates which it has largely attributed to smoking and dietary fat, while discounting or ignoring the causal role of avoidable eposures to industrial carcinogens in the air, food, water, and the workplace."" (*22). The Bush Administration coverup of its pre-Gulf-War support of Iraq ""is yet another example of the President's people conspiring to keep both Congress and the American people in the dark"" (*23). If you think about it, conspiracy is a fundamental aspect of doing business in this country. Take the systematic and cooperative censorship of the Persian Gulf War by the Pentagon and much of the news media (*24). Or the widespread plans of business and government groups to spend $100 million in taxes to promote a distorted and truncated history of Columbus in America (*25). along the lines of the Smithsonian Institution's ""fusion of the two worlds"", (*26). rather than examining more realistic aspects of the Spanish invasion, like ""anger, cruelty, gold, terror, and death"" (*27). Or circumstances surrounding the U.S. Justice Department theft from the INSLAW company of sophisticated, law-enforcement computer software which ""now point to a widespread conspiracy implicating lesser Government officials in the theft of INSLAW's technology"", says former U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson (*28). Or Watergate. Or the ""largest bank fraud in world financial history"" (*29), where the White House knew of the criminal activities at ""the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International"" (BCCI) (*30), where U.S. intelligence agencies did their secret banking (*31), and where bribery of prominent American public officials ""was a way of doing business"" (*32). Or the 1949 conviction of ""GM [General Motors], Standard Oil of California, Firestone, and E. Roy Fitzgerald, among others, for criminally conspiring to replace electric transportation with gas- and diesel-powered buses and to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to transportation companies throughout the country"" [in, among others, the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Louis, Oakland, Salt Lake City, and Los Angeles] (*33). Or the collusion in 1973 between Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT). and the U.S. Department of Transportation to overlook safety defects in the 1.2 million Corvair automobiles manufactured by General Motors in the early 60's (*34). Or the A. H.

Or the convictions of Industrial Biotest Laboratories (IBT). officers for fabricating safety tests on prescription drugs (*40).

Or ""the way the Vatican and Washington colluded to achieve common purpose in Central America"" (*55). Or the collaboration of Guatemalan strong-man and mass murderer Hector Gramajo with the U.S. Army to design ""programs to build civilian-military cooperation"" at the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA) at Fort Benning, Georgia; five of the nine soldiers accused in the 1989 Jesuit massacre in El Salvador are graduates of SOA which trains Latin/American military personnel (*56). Or the conspiracy of the Comanche Peak Nuclear Plant administration to harass and cause bodily harm to whistleblower Linda Porter who uncovered dangerous working conditions at the facility (*57). Or the conspiracy of President Richard Nxion and the Government of South Vietnam to delay the Paris Peace Talks until after the 1968 U.S. presidential election (*58). Or the pandemic coverups of police violence (*59). Or the always safe-to-cite worldwide communist conspiracy (*60). Or maybe the socially responsible, secret consortium to publish The Satanic Verses in paperback (*61). Conspiracies are obviously a way to get things done, and the Washington Post offers little comment unless conspiracy theorizing threatens to expose a really important conspiracy that, let's say, benefits big business or big government. Such a conspiracy would be like our benevolent CIA's 1953 overthrow of the Iranian government to help out U.S. oil companies; or like our illegal war against Panama to tighten U.S. control over Panama and the Canal; or like monopoly control of broadcasting that facilitates corporate censorship on issues of public importance (*62). When the camouflage of such conspiracies is stripped away, public confidence in the conspiring officials can erode -- depending on how seriously the citizenry perceives the conspiracy to have violated the public trust. Erosion of public trust in the status quo is what the Post seems to see as a real threat to its corporate security. Currently, the Post has mounted vituperative, frenzied attacks on Oliver Stone's movie ""JFK"", which reexamines the U.S. Government's official (Warren Commission. finding that a single gunman, acting alone, killed President John F. Kennedy. The movie also is the story of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's unsuccessful prosecution of Clay Shaw, the only person ever tried in connection with the assassination. And the movie proposes that the Kennedy assassination was the work of conspirators whose interests would not be served by a president who, had he lived, might have disengaged us from our war against Vietnam. The Post ridicules a reexamination of the Kennedy assassination along lines suggested by ""JFK"". Senior Post journalists like Charles Krauthammer, Ken Ringle, George Will, Phil McCombs, and Michael Isikoff, have been called up to man the bulwarks against public sentiment which has never supported the government's non-conspiratorial assassination thesis. In spite of the facts that the Senate Intelligence Committee of 1975 and 1976 found that ""both the FBI and CIA had repeatedly lied to the Warren Commission"" (*63) and that the 1979 Report of the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that President Kennedy was probably killed ""as a result of a conspiracy"" (*64), a truly astounding number of Post stories have been used as vehicles to discredit ""JFK"" as just another conspiracy (*65). Some of the more vicious attacks on the movie are by editor Stephen Rosenfeld, and journalists Richard Cohen, George Will, and George Lardner Jr (*66). They ridicule the idea that Kennedy could have had second thoughts about escalating the Vietnam War and declaim that there is no historical justification for this idea. Seasoned journalist Peter Dale Scott, former Pentagon/CIA liaison chief L. Fletcher Prouty, and investigators David Scheim and John Newman have each authored defense of the ""JFK"" thesis that Kennedy was not enthusiastic about staying in Vietnam (*67). But the Post team just continues ranting against the possibility of a high-level assassination conspiracy while offering little justification for its arguments. An example of particularly shabby scholarship and unacceptable behavior is George Lardner Jr's contribution to the Post's campaign against the movie. Lardner wrote three articles, two before the movie was completed, and the third upon its release. In May, six months before the movie came out, Lardner obtained a copy of the first draft of the script and, contrary to accepted standards, revealed in the Post the contents of this copyrighted movie (*68). Also in this article, (*69). Lardner discredits Jim Garrison with hostile statements from a former Garrison associate Pershing Gervais. Lardner does not tell the reader that subsequent to the Clay Shaw trial, in a U.S. Government criminal action brought against Garrison, Government witness Gervais, who helped set up Garrison for prosecution, admitted under oath that in a May 1972 interview with a New Orleans television reporter, he, Gervais, had said that the U.S. Government's case against Garrison was a fraud (*70). The Post's 1973 account of thebr> Garrison acquittal mentions this controversy, but when I recently asked Lardner about this, he was not clear as to whether he remembered it (*71). Two weeks after his first ""JFK"" article, Lardner blustered his way through a justification for his unauthorized possession of the early draft ofthe movie (*72). He also defended his reference to Pershing Gervais by lashing out at Garrison as a writer ""of gothic fiction"". When the movie was released in December, Lardner ""reviewed"" it (*73). He again ridiculed the film's thesis that following the Kennedy assassination, President Johnson reversed Kennedy's plans to de-escalate the Vietnam War. Lardner cited a memorandum issued by Johnson four days after Kennedy died. Lardner says this memorandum was written before the assassination, and that it ""was a continuation of Kennedy's policy"". In fact, the memorandum was drafted the day before the assassination by McGeorge Bundy (Kennedy's Assistant for National Security Affairs) Kennedy was in Texas, and may never have seen it. Following the assassination, it was rewritten; and the final version provided for escalating the war against Vietnam (*74) -- facts that Lardner avoided. The Post's crusade against exposing conspiracies is blatantly dishonest: The Warren Commission inquiry into the Kennedy Assassination was for the most part conducted in secret. This fact is buried in the Post (*75). Nor do current readers of this newspaper find meaningful discussion of the Warren Commission's secret doubts about both the FBI and the CIA (*76). Or of a dispatch from CIA headquarters instructing co-conspirators at field stations to counteract the ""new wave of books and articles criticizing the [Warren] Commission's findings...[and] conspiracy theories ...[that] have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization"" and to ""discuss the publicity problem with liaison and friendly elite contacts, especially politicians and editors ""and to""employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics. ...Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. ...The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists..."" (*77). In 1979, Washington journalist Deborah Davis published Katharine The Great, the story of Post publisher Katharine Graham and her newspaper's close ties with Washington's powerful elite, a number of whom were with the CIA. Particularly irksome to Post editor Benjamin Bradlee was a Davis claim that Bradlee had ""produced CIA material"" (*78). Understandably sensitive about this kind of publicity, Bradlee told Davis' publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ,""Miss Davis is lying ...I never produced CIA material ...what I can do is to brand Miss Davis as a fool and to put your company in that special little group of publishers who don't give a shit for the truth"". The Post bullied HBJ into recalling the book; HBJ shredded 20,000 copies; Davis sued HBJ for breach of contract and damage to reputation; HBJ settled out of court; and Davis published her book elsewhere with an appendix that demonstrated Bradlee to have been deeply involved with producing cold-war/CIA propaganda (*79). Bradlee still says the allegations about his association with people in the CIA are false, but he has apparently taken no action to contest the xetensive documentation presented by Deborah Davis in the second and third editions of her book (*80). And it's not as if the Post were new to conspiracy work. Former Washington Post publisher Philip Graham ""believing that the function of the press was more often than not to mobilize consent for the policies of the government, was one of the architects of what became a widespread practice: the use and manipulation of journalists by the CIA"" (*81). This scandal was known by its code name Operation MOCKINGBIRD. Former Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein cites a former CIA deputy director as saying, ""It was widely known that Phil Graham was someone you could get help from"" (*82). More recently the Post provided cover for CIA personality Joseph Fernandez by ""refusing to print his name for over a year up until the day his indictment was announced ...for crimes committed in his official capacity as CIA station chief in Costa Rica"" (*83). Of the meetings between Graham and his CIA acquaintances at which the availability and prices of journalists were discussed, a former CIA man recalls, ""You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month"" (*84). One may wish to consider Philip Graham's philosophy along with a more recent statement from his wife Katharine Graham, current Chairman of the Board of the Washington Post. In a lecture on terrorism and the news media, Mrs. Graham said: ""A second challenge facing the media is how to prevent terrorists from using the media as a platform fortheir views. ... The point is that we generally know when we are being manipulated, and we've learned better how and where to draw the line, though the decisions are often difficult"" (*85). Today, the Post and its world of big business are apparently terrified that our elite and our high-level public officials may be exposed as conspirators behind Contra drug-smuggling, October Surprise, or the assassination of President Kennedy. This fear is truly remarkable in that, like most of us and like most institutions, the Post runs its business as a conspiracy of like-minded entrepreneurs -- a conspiracy""to act or work together toward the same result or goal"" (*86). But where the Post really parts company from just plain people is when it pretends that conspiracies associated with big business or government are ""coincidence"". Post reporter Lardner vents the frustration inherent in having to maintain this dichotomy. He lashes out at Oliver Stone and suggests that Stone may actually believe that the Post's opposition to Stone's movie is a ""conspiracy"". Lardner assures us that Stone's complaints are ""groundless and paranoid and smack of McCarthyism"" (*87). So how does the Post justify devoting so much energy to ridiculing those who investigate conspiracies? The Post has answers: people revert to conspiracy theories because they need something ""neat and tidy"" (*88) that ""plugs a gap no other generally accepted theory fills', (*89. and ""coincidence ...is always the safest and most likely explanation for any conjunction of curious circumstances ..."" (*90). And what does this response mean? It means that ""coincidence theory"" is what the Post espouses when it would prefer not to admit to a conspiracy. In other words, some things just ""happen"". And, besides, conspiracy to do certain things would be a crime; ""coincidence"" is a safer bet. Post Ombudsman Richard Harwood, who, it is rumored, serves as Executive Director of the Benevolent Protective Order of Coincidence Theorists, (*91) recently issued a warning about presidential candidates ""who have begun to mutter about a press conspiracy"". Ordinarily, Harwood would simply dismiss these charges as ""symptoms of the media paranoia that quadrennially engulfs members of the American political class"" (*92). But a fatal mistake was made by the mutterers; they used the ""C"" word against the PRESS! And Harwood exploded his off-the-cuff comment into an entire column -- ending it with:""We are the new journalists, immersed too long, perhaps, in the cleansing waters of political conformity. But conspirators we ain't"". Distinguished investigative journalist Morton Mintz, a 29-year veteran of the Washington Post, now chairs the Fund for Investigative Journalism. In the December issue of The Progressive, Mintz wrote ""A Reporter Looks Back in Anger -- Why the Media Cover Up Corporate Crime"". Therein he discussed the difficulties in convincing editors to accept important news stories. He illustrated the article with his own experiences at the Post, where he says he was known as ""the biggest pain in the ass in the office"" (*93). Would Harwood argue that grief endured by journalists at the hands of editors is a matter of random coincidence? And that such policy as Mintz described is made independently by editors without influence from fellow editors or from management? Would Harwood have us believe that at the countless office ""meetings"" in which news people are ever in attendance, there is no discussion of which stories will run and which ones will find inadequate space? That there is no advanced planning for stories or that there are no cooperative efforts among the staff? Or that in the face of our news-media ""grayout"" of presidential candidate Larry Agran, (*94) a Post journalist would be free to give news space to candidate Agran equal to that the Post lavishes on candidate Clinton? Let's face it: these possibilities are about as likely as Barbara Bush entertaining guests at a soup kitchen. Would Harwood have us believe that media critic and former Post Ombudsman Ben Bagdikian is telling less than the truth in his account of wire-service control over news: ""The largely anonymous men who control the syndicate and wire service copy desks and the central wire photo machines determine at a single decision what millions will see and hear. ...there seems to be little doubt that these gatekeepers preside over an operation in which an appalling amount of press agentry sneaks in the back door of American journalism and marches untouched out the front door as 'news'"" (*95). When he sat on the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, Judge Clarence Thomas violated U.S. law when he failed to remove himself from a case in which he then proceeded to reverse a $10 million judgment against the Ralston Purina Company (*96). Ralston Purina, the animal feed empire, is the family fortune of Thomas' mentor, Senator John Danforth. The Post limited its coverage of the Thomas malfeasance to 56 words buried in the middle of a 1200-word article (*97). Would Harwood have us believe that the almost complete blackout on this matter by the major news media and the U.S. Senate was a matter of coincidence? Could a Post reporter have written a story about Ralston Purina if she had wanted to? Can a brick swim? Or take the fine report produced last September by Ralph Nader's Public Citizen. Titled All the Vice President's Men, it documents ""How the Quayle Council on Competitiveness Secretly Undermines Health, Safety, and Environmental Programs"". Three months later, Post journalists David Broder and Bob Woodward published ""The President's Understudy"", a seven-part series on Vice President Quayle. Although this series does address Quayle's role with the Competitiveness Council, its handling of the Council's disastrous impact on America is inadequate. It is 40,000 words of mostly aimless chatter about Quayle memorabilia: youth, family, college record, Christianity, political aspirations, intellectual aspirations, wealthy friends, government associates, golf, travels, wife Marilyn, and net worth -- revealing little about Quayle's abilities, his understanding of society's problems, or his thoughts about justice and freedom, and never mentioning the comprehensive Nader study of Quayle's record in the Bush Administration (*98). Now, did Broder or did Woodward forget about the Nader study? Or did both of them forget? Or did one, or the other, or both decide not to mention it? Did these two celebrated, seasoned Post reporters ever discuss together their jointly authored stories? Did they decide to publish such a barren set of articles because it would enhance their reputations? How did management feel about the use of precious news space for such frivolity? Is it possible that so many pages were dedicated to this twaddle without people ""acting or working together toward the same result or goal""? (*99) Do crocodiles fly? On March 20, front-page headlines in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, USA Today, and the Washington Post read respectively: TSONGAS DROPPED OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE CLEARING CLINTON'S PATH TSONGAS ABANDONS CAMPAIGN LEAVING CLINTON CLEAR PATH TOWARD SHOWDOWN WITH BUSH TSONGAS CLEARS WAY FOR CLINTON TSONGAS EXIT CLEARS WAY FOR CLINTON This display of editorial independence should at least raise questions of whether the news media collective mindset is really different from that of any other cartel -- like oil, diamond, energy, (*100) or manufacturing cartels, a cartel being ""a combination of independent commercial enterprises designed to limit competition"" (*101). The Washington Post editorial page carries the heading: AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER Is it? Of course not. There probably is no such thing. Does the Post""conspire"" to keep its staff and its newspaper from wandering too far from the safety of mediocrity? The Post would respond that the question is absurd. In that I am not privy to the Post's telephone conversations, I can only speculate on how closely the media elite must monitor the staff. But we all know how few micro-seconds it takes a new reporter to learn what subjects are taboo and what are ""safe"", and that experienced reporters don't have to ask. What is more important, however, than speculating about how the Post communicates within its own corporate structure and with other members of the cartel, is to document and publicize what the Post does in public, namely, how it shapes and censors the news.

7119,Theresa May refuses to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia,"Theresa May refuses to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia Theresa May refuses to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia By 0 41 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to withdraw her support for UK weapons sales to Saudi Arabia as well as Riyadh’s membership at the UN Human Rights Council despite the regime’s atrocities in Yemen. 
During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country’s weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
“The issues are being investigated… We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen,” May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. 
Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK government’s contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. 
Corbyn also questioned May’s support for Saudi Arabia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will…",0
7120,"Buddy Ryan, Combative Defensive Genius in the N.F.L., Dies at 85 - The New York Times","Buddy Ryan, pro football’s famously combative defensive innovator, who helped propel the Jets and the Chicago Bears to Super Bowl championships, died on Tuesday in Shelbyville, Ky. He was 85. His death was confirmed by the Buffalo Bills. His son Rex, the former Jets head coach, is now the Bills’ head coach, and Rex’s twin, Rob, is an assistant with the team. James Solano, Buddy Ryan’s agent, said that Ryan owned a ranch in Shelbyville. He had been treated for cancer in recent years. In his seven years as a head coach, with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Arizona Cardinals, Ryan never won a playoff game. But he had already solidified his legacy as an assistant coach with his shifting and blitzing defensive alignments, which confused and clobbered opposing quarterbacks. His bruising “46” defense, in particular, took the Bears to their Super Bowl victory in 1986. For all his football intellect, Ryan embraced pure aggression. “It got mean, cruel,” defensive end Gerry Philbin, who played under Ryan at the University at Buffalo and on the Jets, once told Sports Illustrated. “I’ve never seen anyone better at bringing the animal out of you. If you didn’t hit as hard as he wanted, he’d humiliate you in front of everyone. “Guys like me loved him, though. He was just so brutally honest. ” When Ryan became the Eagles’ head coach in 1986 and subjected his players to punishing drills in training camp, he spoke of his  . “They probably think I’m a    ” he told The New York Times. “But that’s all right. That breeds closeness as a team. That way they can all dislike the same guy. ” His son Rex, having earned a reputation for brashness in his own right while coaching the Jets from 2009 to 2014, wrote in a memoir, “Play Like You Mean It” (2011) that he grew up “wanting to be Buddy Ryan,” though he acknowledged that his father “was a little over the top from time to time. ” While he was the Bears’ defensive coordinator, Buddy Ryan largely ignored Mike Ditka, his presumed boss as the head coach, concluding that Ditka, once a brilliant tight end, knew nothing about defense. In 1985 they almost came to blows in the locker room during halftime of the Bears’ loss to the Miami Dolphins, the team’s only defeat that season. In 1989, the Cowboys accused Ryan of offering bounties of a few hundred dollars to any of his Eagles players who knocked the Dallas kicker, Luis Zendejas, and quarterback Troy Aikman out of the Thanksgiving Day game, which Philadelphia won,  . Both players were roughed up in the game. Zendejas, who had previously been cut by the Eagles, called Ryan “the fat little guy” and denounced him as essentially a coward. Ryan, a bit paunchy and bespectacled, denied offering bounties, and a league investigation could not substantiate the accusations. When Ryan was the Houston Oilers’ defensive coordinator, he punched the team’s offensive coordinator, Kevin Gilbride, in the face during the final game of the 1993 regular season, against the Jets, incensed that Gilbride’s disdain for ball control kept Ryan’s defenders on the field too long. Ryan broke into professional football as the defensive line coach for the 1968 Jets, who shocked the football world and provided credibility for the American Football League by upsetting the N. F. L. ’s Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Working with Walt Michaels, the Jets’ defensive coordinator, Ryan developed the seeds of his “46” defense. That scheme flourished with the 1985 Bears, who went   in the regular season, won two playoff games by shutouts and routed the New England Patriots,   in the Super Bowl. Named for the   and frequently blitzing safety Doug Plank, who wore No. 46 playing for the Bears in Ryan’s first few seasons as defensive coordinator, the plan put as many as eight men on the defensive line to foil the opponents’ blocking plays, and it sprang blitzes by just about anyone. The aim was to pressure the opposing quarterback or knock him out of the game. Ryan hoped to find out “who the   quarterback was,” he said. N. F. L. teams eventually developed spread offenses to counter the “46,” which featured stars like Mike Singletary, Dan Hampton and Richard Dent, but the alignment survives in various forms. Ron Jaworski, a former N. F. L. quarterback and an ESPN commentator, wrote in his book “The Games That Changed the Game” (2010, with David Plaut and Greg Cosell) that Ryan’s “46” was “the single most influential factor in shaping modern N. F. L. blitz pressure packages. ” James David Ryan was born on Feb. 17, 1931, in Frederick, Okla. where his father was a house painter. (His birth year was often listed as 1934 as Rex Ryan said in his memoir, his father had subtracted a few years from his true age to come off as more youthful when first looking for an N. F. L. job.) Buddy Ryan served in combat as a master sergeant during the Korean War, then played guard at Oklahoma AM (now Oklahoma State) and coached high school football in Texas. He was an assistant coach at the University at Buffalo, Vanderbilt and the University of the Pacific before joining the Jets’ staff under Coach Weeb Ewbank. After eight years with the Jets, Ryan was an assistant to Coach Bud Grant for two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, overseeing the Purple People Eaters defense that helped take the Vikings to the 1977 Super Bowl, where they lost to the Oakland Raiders. Ryan became the Bears’ defensive coordinator in 1978. When Ditka became head coach in 1982, Ryan stayed on with the backing of the owner, George Halas. It seemed that the Bears had two teams. When they won the 1986 Super Bowl, the offensive players lifted Ditka onto their shoulders while the defensive players hoisted Ryan. Ryan finally got a   job when he was hired by the Eagles soon after. He was fired after the 1990 season, when the Eagles lost their playoff opener for a third consecutive year. He posted a    record with Philadelphia. Ryan was named the Cardinals’ head coach in 1994, and he chose his sons Rex and Rob as assistants. He was   over two seasons, was fired once more, and then retired. Besides Rex and Rob, Ryan’s survivors include another son, Jim, all from his marriage to his first wife, Doris, which ended in divorce, and six grandchildren. His second wife, Joanie, died in 2013. Ryan devoted himself to breeding thoroughbreds in Kentucky after his football years, but he hardly forgot the football days. One of his horses was named FortySixBlitz. Another one kept alive the anger he felt when the Eagles let him go. Its name was FiredForWinning.",0
7121,"Lagarde Case Is ‘Weak,’ French Prosecutor Says, Raising Chances of Acquittal - The New York Times","PARIS  —   The prosecutor in the trial against Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, raised the chance that she would be acquitted of criminal charges linked to the misuse of public funds, after he called the case “very weak” on Thursday. Ms. Lagarde stands accused of “negligence by a person in a position of public authority,” in a matter related to her time as French finance minister. The case stems from an arbitration hearing ordered by Ms. Lagarde that ultimately awarded a French tycoon more than 400 million euros, or $425 million. She has long dismissed the allegations  —   which have dogged her for nearly a decade  —   as politically motivated and without basis. But they have nevertheless captured the attention of the public, illustrating close ties between France’s powerful politicians and the country’s business elite. Wrapping up a   trial,   Marin, the public prosecutor, said the testimony presented did not appear to be sufficient to merit a conviction. It is a theme prosecutors have echoed previously. The case was halted in September 2015, when France’s top prosecutor said there was insufficient evidence. But a special court, which had been set up in 1993 to hear cases against the country’s politicians, overrode that recommendation. Ms. Lagarde, a former senior lawyer and executive with the international law firm Baker  McKenzie, has taken time to defend herself in person, while remaining at the helm of the I. M. F. The   I. M. F. has said that while the case was a private matter, it retained confidence in her. The case against Ms. Lagarde centers on Bernard Tapie, a former    executive who has previously been jailed on corruption charges. Mr. Tapie had accused Crédit Lyonnais of cheating him out of money when he sold his stake in the sportswear company in 1993. At the time, the bank was still partially owned by the French state. Years of legal battles ensued, with Ms. Lagarde eventually sending the dispute to a private arbitration authority in 2007. The   panel awarded Mr. Tapie damages and interest to be paid by the government, a ruling that angered the French public. Ms. Lagarde’s aides suggested she annul the decision. But she declined to do so because it could result in a slew of new lawsuits from Mr. Tapie and further costs to the state. After the ruling, questions emerged about the impartiality of one of the arbiters. That arbiter, Pierre Estoup, was accused of having ties to Mr. Tapie’s lawyer. The lawyer and Mr. Estoup are now expected to stand trial in France over whether they colluded during the arbitration proceedings. The payout itself has since been annulled, with Mr. Tapie ordered to repay €404 million with interest to the state. He is, however, currently under bankruptcy protection and has not yet repaid the sum.",0

7123,Want to Know the Crucial Areas for Clinton? Follow Michelle Obama - The New York Times,"Four taps of the microphone were all Michelle Obama needed to take down Donald J. Trump. “Hillary Clinton is tough,” Mrs. Obama, the first lady, told a crowd of several thousand in Charlotte, N. C. on Tuesday. “See,” she continued, “I’ve watched her when she gets knocked down  —   she doesn’t complain. She doesn’t cry foul. ” Tap, tap, tap, tap. It took a second for the audience to catch on: Mrs. Obama was mocking Mr. Trump’s complaint that a faulty microphone had hindered his performance in his first presidential debate with Mrs. Clinton. But as Mrs. Obama continued  —   “No, she gets right back up, comes back stronger”  —   the mostly young and heavily   crowd let out a deafening howl. They called her “the closer” during Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, like a   relief pitcher used sparingly but with devastating effect. Mrs. Obama preferred spending time with her daughters over attending political rallies. But when she was unleashed before a pivotal caucus or primary, her story of growing up on the South Side of Chicago and falling in love with a young community organizer had an unmatched, almost magical power to turn out voters, campaign officials discovered. Eight years later, Mrs. Obama is playing a similar role for the woman whom she helped her husband defeat in that race. To divine the places where the Clinton campaign’s turnout operation is under the greatest pressure, and the constituencies about which it is most concerned, look no further than where Clinton aides dispatch the popular first lady. She has appeared in North Carolina, at college campuses in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.  —   all areas where Mrs. Clinton needs to drive up turnout among blacks and younger voters. “She chooses her moments, and she has made clear to her staff and the Democratic Party that she wants to go places where she can make a difference,” said Peter Slevin, the author of “Michelle Obama: A Life. ” “If a candidate is up by 15 or down by 15, you’re not going to see Michelle Obama there. ” Mrs. Obama has made only about a   campaign appearances for Mrs. Clinton in the general election, each carefully approved by the White House. Each has become something of an event  —   and her warm, spunky delivery has given rise to several of the kind of   moments that rarely emerge from Mrs. Clinton’s rallies. President Obama, of course, has proved an immensely valuable surrogate for Mrs. Clinton, appealing frequently to the young, black and Latino voters who turned out in record numbers for him but who have proved lukewarm to Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. He has gone so far as to tell black voters he would consider it a “personal insult” if they did not help elect Mrs. Clinton. But the first lady’s reluctance to campaign means that the events she does attend speak volumes about the places Mrs. Clinton views as most critical in November. She is virtually tied with Mr. Trump in North Carolina, with its younger and diverse population. Enter Mrs. Obama. In Raleigh and Charlotte this week, where thousands of mostly younger voters turned out to hear her, Mrs. Obama came armed with data points about turnout from Mr. Obama’s narrow victory in North Carolina in 2008. (He lost the state in 2012.) “Barack won North Carolina by about 14, 000 votes,” she said in Charlotte on Tuesday. “That sounds like a lot, but when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was a little over two voters per precinct. ” Mrs. Obama paused and gave a stern look to her largely young crowd. “Do you hear that?” she continued. “If just two or three folks per precinct had gone the other way, or stayed home, Barack would have lost this state. ” Straight talk is a specialty. At La Salle University in Philadelphia last month, Mrs. Obama soberly warned college students not to support a   candidate. “If you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don’t vote at all,” she said, “then you are helping to elect Hillary’s opponent. ” Mrs. Obama has also gone further than her husband in laying bare the emotional toll of the   birther movement, including Mr. Trump’s   campaign to sow doubts about whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States. “Back then, people had all kinds of questions about what kind of a president Barack would be,” Mrs. Obama said in Fairfax in September on the same day Mr. Trump tried to distance himself from the birther claim. “Things like: Does he understand us? Will he protect us? And then, of course, there were those who questioned  —   and continue to question, for the past eight years, up through this very day  —   whether my husband was even born in this country. ” Mrs. Obama’s hard feelings from the 2008 campaign for a time extended to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, after an acrimonious South Carolina primary battle in which Mr. Clinton dismissed Mr. Obama’s antiwar image as a “fairy tale. ” But Mrs. Obama has long since come around, and often refers to Mrs. Clinton now as “my friend Hillary. ” She brings undeniable advantages to Mrs. Clinton 64 percent of Americans view Mrs. Obama favorably, according to a Gallup poll in August. But Gallup polling this week found 54 percent of the public holds an unfavorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton. Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton’s communications director, called Mrs. Obama “one of the most popular public figures in America” and “a highly effective messenger both at our convention and throughout the campaign. ” Mrs. Obama appears in an ad for Mrs. Clinton, called “Watch,” being shown in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. “Our children watch everything we do,” the first lady says, as images of Mrs. Clinton working with children flash on screen. “The person we elect as president has the power to shape their lives for years to come. ” Before making the case for Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Obama often describes her mixed emotions about leaving the White House. “We are experiencing a great transition for me and Barack and Malia and Sasha and Bo and Sunny and Grandma,” she said in Charlotte on Tuesday. “I’m going to need a job, but it will be a job out of politics,” she said. “My husband’s got to get a job  —   somebody has got to hire that man. ” There were shouts of “Michelle for president!” and “Michelle for mayor!”  —   but the first lady was having none of it. “Can you believe I’m campaigning again?” she said. “But I’m happy to be out here. Because this is the last time. ”",0
7125,"For Marketers, TV Sets Are an Invaluable Pair of Eyes - The New York Times","While Ellen Milz and her family were watching the Olympics last summer, their TV was watching them. Ms. Milz, 48, who lives with her husband and three children in Chicago, had agreed to be a panelist for a company called TVision Insights, which monitored her viewing habits  —   and whether her eyes flicked down to her phone during the commercials, whether she was smiling or frowning  —   through a device on top of her TV. “The marketing company said, ‘We’re going to ask you to put this device in your home, connect it to your TV and they’re going to watch you for the Olympics to see how you like it, what sports, your expression, who’s around,’” she said. “And I said, ‘Whatever, I have nothing to hide. ’” Ms. Milz acknowledged that she had initially found the idea odd, but that those qualms had quickly faded. “It’s out of sight, out of mind,” she said, comparing it to the Nest security cameras in her home. She said she had initially received $60 for participating and an additional $230 after four to six months. TVision  —   which has worked with the Weather Channel, NBC and the Disney ABC Television Group  —   is one of several companies that have entered living rooms in recent years, emerging with new, granular ways for marketers to understand how people are watching television and, in particular, commercials. The appeal of this information has soared as Americans rapidly change their viewing habits, streaming an increasing number of shows weeks or months after they first air, on devices as varied as smartphones, laptops and Roku boxes, not to mention TVs. Through the installation of a Microsoft Kinect device, normally used for Xbox video games, on top of participants’ TVs, TVision tracks the movement of people’s eyes in relation to the television. The device’s sensors can record minute shifts for all the people in the room. The company then matches those viewing patterns to shows and commercials using technology that listens to what is being broadcast on the TV. “The big thing for TV advertisers and the networks is: Are you actually looking at the screen or not?” said Dan Schiffman, the chief revenue officer of TVision (pronounced  ). “What you looked at is interesting, but the fact that you looked away is arguably the most interesting. ” Mr. Schiffman founded TVision, a     with a classmate from the Sloan School of Management at M. I. T. Companies spend around $69 billion a year on TV ads in the United States and are keen to find out how to best distribute that money in a fractured media landscape. Nielsen and its panel of 42, 500 households have long determined how money is spent on TV advertising in the United States. The higher a show’s ratings, the more networks can charge for advertising. But some industry executives have criticized Nielsen’s methods as outdated. Nielsen selects homes at random to represent the nation’s viewing audience, and measures who is watching what shows, mostly through meters connected to the sets, as well as diaries in select markets and digital tracking of certain   programs on tablets and phones. The company recently delayed the rollout of a new system that will count viewing across platforms and devices. The capability to do just that is a core selling point for upstarts like TVision, which promote their ability to measure how people are   shows on, say, Netflix and Amazon. “Nielsen will remain the currency for the time being because it is agreed upon as the thing everyone uses,” said Alan Wurtzel, an adviser at NBCUniversal and its former head of research. “But as the world becomes more complex, as it is, many more additional supplemental or complementary measures will come into play. ” Information gathered by companies like TVision can help advertisers steer marketing toward shows with the most engaged audiences, not just the largest ones. And for networks, it could make a show with a committed and loyal audience as valuable as one that attracts a larger but more casual set of viewers. TVision has recruited 2, 000 households, or roughly 7, 500 people, in the Boston, Chicago and   Worth areas. The company said the information was transmitted without storing images or video and collected anonymously. Mr. Schiffman said the data would show, for example, “Person No. 124 in Household 6 was paying attention this second and not paying attention the next to a certain program or advertisement. ” Symphony Advanced Media has built a panel of 17, 500 people in the United States who have installed its Media Insiders mobile app, mostly on Android phones. In exchange for about $5 to $12 a month, the app passively tracks how people use their phones, uses the device’s microphone to hear what they are watching and asks them to complete surveys. The app can tell if someone streamed a show using headphones while on a bus or saw a commercial at a sports bar. Symphony and TVision both use technology that can recognize shows and ads through the audio or digital tags the content contains. Consumers are most likely familiar with this type of technology through the   app Shazam. Another ratings company, RealityMine, has assembled a panel of 5, 000 people in the United States whom it said it paid less than $90 a year, who either have its app, a “home meter” plugged into their internet networks or both. In some instances, its meter may capture activity across 25 devices in a household, such as tablet, phone, Xbox, Wii, Apple TV and Google Chromecast. The aim is “understanding what is the media day and the life of the consumer today,” said Charlie Buchwalter, the chief executive of Symphony, which has worked with companies including NBCUniversal. Mr. Schiffman said that while some people were wary of TVision’s technology, they were often placated after learning that it was not storing images or videos. During the Olympics, Ms. Milz wore a Fitbit so that NBC could see how her heart rate changed while she watched certain events. “We’re just trying to understand where people really are and what they’re doing, what they’re watching, how are they interacting, and ideally after that, how is that changing their behavior or affecting their behavior,” said Jonathan Steuer, the chief research officer of Omnicom Media Group, which oversees media buying for advertisers. Still, privacy can be a concern. This month, Vizio, one of the biggest makers of   televisions, said it would pay $2. 2 million to settle charges that it had been collecting and selling viewing data from millions of smart TVs without the knowledge or consent of the sets’ owners. By measuring the level of attention a person is paying to a given show, TVision believes it can help bolster niche programs and smaller networks. For example, Mr. Schiffman said the company had found that the series “Lucifer,” on Fox, commanded better attention metrics from viewers than “The Big Bang Theory,” on CBS, even though “Big Bang” is one of the TV shows rated highest by Nielsen. “People don’t just tune into ‘Lucifer.’ They DVR it and watch it when they come home,” he said, adding that viewers tend to be focused on the show and stay in the room when it is on. The Weather Channel used TVision’s data in the fall to give it an edge over the news and lifestyle shows it is normally compared against by advertisers. It showed its audience for weather news as “lean forward,   viewers,” said Indira Venkat, who oversees research at the channel. “What is oftentimes missing is the quality of the audience,” Ms. Venkat said about Nielsen viewing data. “Yes, you’re getting audience, but what are they doing in today’s era of multitasking?”",0
7126,THE SMOKING GUN: WikiLeaks Emails Show Proof Positive Of Vast Clinton Foundation Corruption,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy THE SMOKING GUN: WikiLeaks Emails Show Proof Positive Of Vast Clinton Foundation Corruption It is astonishingly detailed proof that the Clintons do not draw any lines between their “charitable” work, their political activity, their government jobs or (and most important) their personal enrichment. Every other American is expected to keep these pursuits separate, as required by tax law, anticorruption law and campaign-finance law. For the Clintons, it is all one and the same—the rules be damned. by Geoffrey Grider October 28, 2016 Grifters-in-Chief: The Clintons don’t draw lines between their ‘charity’ and personal enrichment. 
In an election season that has been full of surprises , let’s hope the electorate understands that there is at least one thing of which it can be certain: A Hillary Clinton presidency will be built, from the ground up, on self-dealing, crony favors, and an utter disregard for the law. 
This isn’t a guess. It is spelled out, in black and white, in the latest bombshell revelation from WikiLeaks . It comes in the form of a memo written in 2011 by longtime Clinton errand boy Doug Band, who for years worked simultaneously at the Clinton Foundation and at the head of his lucrative consulting business, Teneo. 
It is astonishingly detailed proof that the Clintons do not draw any lines between their “charitable” work, their political activity, their government jobs or (and most important) their personal enrichment. Every other American is expected to keep these pursuits separate, as required by tax law, anticorruption law and campaign-finance law. For the Clintons, it is all one and the same—the rules be damned. Trump: WikiLeaks Shows Clinton Foundation Corruption 
The memo came near the end of a 2011 review by law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett into Clinton Foundation practices. Chelsea Clinton had grown concerned about the audacious mixing of public and private, and the review was designed to ensure that the foundation didn’t lose its charitable tax status. Mr. Band, Teneo boss and epicenter of what he calls “ Bill Clinton, Inc.,” clearly felt under assault and was eager to brag up the ways in which his business had concurrently benefited the foundation, Clinton political causes and the Clinton bank account. The memoed result is a remarkably candid look at the sleazy inner workings of the Clinton grifters-in-chief. Rep. Sessions: Clinton Foundation’s fundraising tactics are criminal 
The cross-pollination is flagrant , and Mr. Band gives example after example of how it works. He and his partner Declan Kelly (a Hillary Clinton fundraiser whom Mrs. Clinton rewarded by making him the State Department’s special envoy to Northern Ireland) buttered up their clients with special visits to Bill’s home and tête-à-tête golf rounds with the former president. They then “cultivated” these marks ( Coca-Cola , Dow Chemical , UBS) for foundation dollars, and then again for high-dollar Bill Clinton speeches and other business payouts. Morning Joe Destroys Corrupt Clinton Foundation “Total Corruption” 
Teneo’s incestuous behavior also included Mrs. Clinton’s State Department. The Band memo boasts that Mr. Kelly (while he was Mrs. Clinton’s State envoy) introduced the then-head of UBS Wealth Management, Bob McCann, to Bill Clinton at an American Ireland Fund event in 2009. “Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Mr. Mccann [sic] to support the Foundation, which he did . . . Mr. Kelly also encouraged Mr. Mccann [sic] to invite President Clinton to give several paid speeches, which he has done,” reads Mr. Band’s memo. UBS ultimately paid Bill $2 million. 
American Ireland Fund meanwhile became a Teneo client, and made Mr. Kelly (of former State envoy fame) a trustee, where he “ensured that the AIF is a significant donor to the Foundation.” AIF then bestowed upon Mrs. Clinton a major award on her final trip to Northern Ireland in 2012, in an event partly sponsored by . . . Teneo. 
Not that this is all one way. Mr. Band let slip just how useful all these arrangements were for Teneo, too, when he backhandedly apologized in the memo for hosting 15 client meetings in a hotel room rented by the Clinton Global Initiative. 
The memo removes any doubt that the foundation is little more than an unregistered super PAC working on the Clintons’ behalf. Donors to the charity are simultaneously tapped to give Bill speech requests and other business arrangements, including the $3.5 million he was paid annually to serve as “honorary chairman” of Laureate International Universities. Mr. Band’s memo also notes his success at getting donors to “support candidates running for office that President Clinton was supporting.” It’s now 2016 and Bill’s most favorite candidate is running for the presidency. There’s no question foundation donors are being “leveraged” for Mrs. Clinton. 
Mr. Band wants credit in the memo for prodding existing foundation donors to pony up more money, though the donation statistics he provides paint a different picture. By and large, donations to the foundation begin to spike dramatically in 2009 and 2010. Mr. Band didn’t form Teneo until 2011. What was happening in 2009? Mrs. Clinton was sworn in as one of the most powerful politicians on the planet. The Clinton Foundation takes money from countries that deny rights to women: 
The obvious question is where are the prosecutors? (For that matter, where is Lois Lernerwhen you need her?) Any nonprofit lawyer in America knows the ironclad rule of keeping private enrichment away from tax-exempt activity, for the simple reason that mixing the two involves ripping off taxpayers. Every election lawyer in the country lives in fear of stepping over the lines governing fundraising and election vehicles. The Clintons recognize no lines. 
Here’s the lasting takeaway: The Clintons spent their White House years explaining endless sleazy financial deals, and even capping their exit with a scandal over whether Bill was paid to pardon financier Marc Rich. They know the risks. And yet they geared up the foundation and these seedy practices even as Mrs. Clinton was making her first bid for the presidency. They continued them as she sat as secretary of state. They continue them still, as she nears the White House. 
This is how the Clintons operate. They don’t change. Any one who pulls the lever for Crooked Hillary Clinton takes responsibility for setting up the nation for all the blatant corruption that will follow. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

I learned first hand that no matter how good you are at your job, how much you save the taxpayer, and how many times you’ve saved your boss or the “higher ups” from getting in trouble, when you need them to stick their neck out for you, they just hang you out to dry.
Huma Abedin is learning that firsthand now too… and Donna Brazile…The loyalty you feel in your heart to your country, or county is not reciprocated to you in your time of need.

7129,British Girl Who Joined ISIS Is Reported Killed in Airstrike - The New York Times,"One of the three London schoolgirls who made headlines last year when they fled their homes to join the Islamic State extremist group in Syria is believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike, a British television channel reported on Thursday. The ITV News channel also said that the girl, Kadiza Sultana, 17, had become “disillusioned with life in the medieval terror state” and had been planning to return to Britain. Kadiza is believed to have been in a residential building in Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital in northeast Syria, when it was hit in May by a bomb thought to have been dropped by a Russian warplane, ITV said in an article on its website. ITV said its report was based on communications with her relatives in London, with unidentified contacts in Raqqa and with a lawyer for her family, Tasnime Akunjee, who the report said had been working on an escape plan for her. The report said her family had been “informed of Kadiza’s reported death by other people in Raqqa and confirmed details in a statement to ITV News. ” It quoted her sister, Halima, as saying: “We were expecting this, in a way. But at least we know she is in a better place. ” Kadiza’s relatives could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Akunjee, in a telephone interview, confirmed the substance of the ITV account but said he did not know with certainty whether she had been killed. “This did not come from any official sources,” he said. “I can’t tell you where the information came from. I suspect it’s true. But I don’t know for a fact that it’s true. Nobody knows for sure anything, because it’s a war zone. ” Kadiza and her companions, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, who were both 15 when they joined the Islamic State in February 2015, became symbols of the organization’s ability to lure foreign women to its militant jihadist cause. Prohibited from engaging in combat, the women support the group’s goal of building a caliphate by becoming wives, mothers, recruiters and online cheerleaders of its violent acts. According to a May 2015 report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a   research group that studies extremism, the Islamic State had recruited an estimated 4, 000 Western foreign fighters and migrants, including more than 550 women. The disappearance of the girls,   students who had kept secret their desire to join the Islamic State, took their families by surprise and stunned the nation. The three became known as the Bethnal Green schoolgirls, after the east London neighborhood where they grew up. Their relatives made desperate public pleas for help, and some traveled to Istanbul. They hoped to follow their trail for more information after it had become clear that the girls had flown to Turkey and caught a bus to the border with Syria, where they were smuggled into territory held by the Islamic State. ITV said it was believed all three had wed foreign recruits, not Syrian members. It said Kadiza’s husband was thought to have been an American citizen of Somali descent who died late in 2015.",0
7131,Dublin Council Criticised For Turning On Xmas Lights Way Too Late,"0 Add Comment 
AN ANGRY mob of Christmas shoppers descended on Grafton Street yesterday evening to protest what some are calling ‘the insultingly late’ date for the annual turning on of the Christmas lights, WWN can reveal. 
What had at first appeared to be a warm crowd hoping to witness the event soon turned sinister in nature with many chanting for the firing of several council employees. 
The 13th of November, a key date in the Christmas period, was chosen by Dublin City Council as the date on which they would usher in Christmas but the ceremony had to be shut down early as the crowd, enraged at how the council had left it so late in the year, turned violent. 
“I think it’s a disgrace that as an Irish citizen I was walking in town on the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th of November without Christmas lights on. It’s a fucking travesty is what it is,” shared local Alan Healy, who had taken to dressing head to toe in Christmas lights to counteract the lack of Christmas cheer in the city. 
Dublin council defended their decision by pointing out the lights cannot be turned on until the first a person is driven insane by Christmas ads which now dominate TV. 
“This year took a little longer, but I think it was a Laois woman who lost the plot after seeing the same Tesco ad for the 50th time that day,” shared council official Aine Kilbride. 
The council confirmed that in an ideal world they would turn on the Christmas lights in an over the top ceremony once a week from the beginning of August. 
“Some people forget that August, September, October and November are part of Christmas and it is our job to hammer people ove rthe head with it until they want commit acts of violence against us,” added Kilbride.",0

7133,Gabby Douglas Defends Herself Against the Wrath of Social Media - The New York Times,"Gabby Douglas is a decorated Olympic gymnast who will bring home a gold medal from Rio. But her performance has not been enough to appease some observers on the internet. Douglas, 20, who won the women’s   during the London Olympics in 2012, lamented on Sunday that she had been picked apart by people on social media for everything from her appearance  —   right down to her hair texture  —   to her behavior during a medal ceremony while the national anthem was being played. “When they talk about my hair or not putting my hand over my heart or being very salty in the stands, really criticizing me, for me it was really hurtful,” Douglas, who is   said, according to The Associated Press. Even her mother, Natalie Hawkins, expressed frustration with the harsh attacks. “They said she had breast enhancements they said she wasn’t smiling enough, she’s unpatriotic,” Hawkins told Reuters. After some observers noticed that Douglas looked disappointed while watching her teammates succeed, “it went to not supporting your teammates,” her mother said. Hawkins added: “Now you’re ‘Crabby Gabby.’ You name it, and she got trampled. What did she ever do to anyone?” The Olympics have always been fertile ground for cutthroat competition and narratives about fallen heroes, but observers on social media can distort those stories and take them to extremes  —   while still expecting athletes to smile and act gracefully when they lose. In the pool, Lilly King of the United States made a point to emphasize her   win over Yulia Efimova of Russia, who had served a doping suspension and was booed every time she entered the Olympic Aquatics Stadium. And there has been no shortage of scrutiny of the    swimmer Missy Franklin, who won four gold medals in London only to fall short in Rio, prompting a slew of “What happened?” headlines. But the online criticism of Douglas has been relentless since her lackluster performance during the Olympic trials, she and her mother both said. After the United States women’s team took home the gold last Tuesday, Douglas’s failure to put her hand on her heart during the national anthem struck a nerve with viewers. Not everyone thought this was valid criticism. It is not as if Douglas has not been hard on herself, criticizing her   performance in the uneven bars. “In my head, I pictured it a little bit differently,” she said. “You want to picture yourself being on top and doing amazing gymnastics. ” Athletes have never been as accessible as they are right now  —   especially those like Douglas and Franklin who rely on social media to build a fan base and share sponsored posts from brands they endorse, like United Airlines and Gillette razors. That accessibility becomes a   sword when they do not perform as well as they should, or if fans catch a whiff of jealousy, bad behavior or team infighting. But if we have learned anything from social media’s power to tear down idols, it is that the same tools can be used to build someone back up. By Monday, #LOVE4GABBYUSA was being spread across Twitter by fans who wanted to help Douglas feel better despite the onslaught of abuse. It was an outpouring of support for an athlete that came days, if not years, too late.",0
7134,Meet Peter Kadzik – Another Clinton Stooge at the Justice Department,"at 3:08 pm Leave a comment 
The name Peter Kadzik probably doesn’t ring a bell for many of you, although it probably should. This guy is a real piece of work, as an excellent article published earlier today at the Daily Caller demonstrates. 
Here’s some of what we learned: 
The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat’s campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik’s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
“The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
Kadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. 
Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “kept me out of jail.” 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. 
“He did lie to me,” Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. 
Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton’s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. 
To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. 
A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that “Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.” 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich’s pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the WikiLeaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. 
The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just a day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta’s home, another email shows . And in an email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik’s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
I’ll have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction. 
As head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. 
The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. 
Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. 
Seems like a pretty important decision for a Clinton crony to make. 
The Justice Department declined to comment on the record for this article. 
Could the Department of Injustice have any less credibility?

7135,Clinton Isn’t Letting Up As She Hammers Trump For Pimping His Hotel Instead Of Campaigning,"Hillary Clinton is keeping her foot on the gas pedal by hammering Donald Trump for taking the day off to promote his hotel built with undocumented workers instead of campaigning. 
Video: 
Clinton said: 
Hillary Clinton could probably spend 24 hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting Trump’s hypocrisies. 
While Trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new DC hotel, Hillary Clinton was winning more early votes in the state of Florida. There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. 
It is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. 
The important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. 
If most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. 
Hillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8.

7136,Donald Trump Says He’s Willing to Talk Directly With Kim Jong-un - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump proposed another significant shift in American foreign policy on Tuesday, suggesting that as president he would be willing to hold direct negotiations with Kim   the North Korean dictator. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said that the talks would be part of an effort to halt North Korea’s nuclear program, which the United States considers one of the most serious national security threats. “I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,” Mr. Trump said. North Korea is among the most isolated countries in the world and regularly defies the international community by launching test rockets and capturing political prisoners. The notion that Mr. Trump would hold direct talks with Mr. Kim could create backlash among Republicans and Democrats. In 2008, Hillary Clinton criticized   Barack Obama for being naïve about foreign policy for expressing a willingness to speak directly with Iran. Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, offered similar criticism of him in the general election. Mr. Trump’s willingness to negotiate with a pariah state comes as he has been offering olive branches to countries such as Russia, which has had tense relations with the United States, while criticizing leaders of traditional allies such as Mexico and Britain. This is not the first time that Mr. Trump has expressed unconventional ideas when it comes to America’s interests in Northeast Asia. In a March interview with The New York Times he suggested that Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear arsenals so that they would be less reliant on protection from the United States in the region. Direct talks were not the only solution that Mr. Trump proposed on Tuesday when it comes to North Korea. He also told Reuters that he would exert pressure on the Chinese, one of North Korea’s closest allies, to help curb its nuclear ambitions. “I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China,” he said.",0
7137,Assange tells the sordid truth about the US elections,"VIDEOS Assange tells the sordid truth about the US elections There’s so much information that it’s difficult to see the large mosaic created by the tiny parts By Daisy Luther - November 8, 2016 
When you put together everything we’ve learned about the corruption in our government and electoral system, it paints an ugly picture. There’s so much information that it’s difficult to see the large mosaic created by the tiny parts. 
UPDATED: Today, Julian Assange made a statement about the election . In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaign’s allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President. On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have. The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks – an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the public’s right to be informed. This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work. The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks’ election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have poured over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment. We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria , we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails). No-one disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election. At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump’s campaign, or Jill Stein’s campaign, or Gary Johnson’s campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clinton’s cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us. We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it. That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public. This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administration’s inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Manning’s treatment either. Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public’s right to know. This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so. The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone’s ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks’ model of scientific journalism or an individual’s decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential. Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton’s main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications—because none exists. In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them – a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks’ decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them. We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many long-term supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks’ motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work. WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism. Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public. Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned.

7138,"Set to Lift Interest Rate, Fed Embraces Investors’ Optimism - The New York Times","The Federal Reserve is poised to raise its benchmark interest rate in   significantly sooner than investors had expected, as it moves to keep pace with a wave of economic optimism that started with the election of President Trump. In an unusually clear statement about a pending decision, the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said on Friday in Chicago that the central bank was likely to act at its next   meeting  —   barring any unpleasant economic surprises. Ms. Yellen added that the Fed still expected to raise rates twice more later in the year, which she said would bring the benchmark rate close to a level that the Fed regards as neutral, with low rates no longer providing an inducement for borrowing and  . That outlook signals that an end is finally in sight for the Fed’s economic stimulus campaign, devised during the depths of the financial crisis more than eight years ago. Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s vice chairman, delivered the same message at the same time at a conference in New York. “We’ve seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time,” Mr. Fischer said of the postelection shift in economic conditions. “There is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months. ” Asked whether Fed officials were delivering a coordinated message, Mr. Fischer responded wryly, “If there has been a conscious effort, I’m about to join it. ” The impending rate increase could heighten tensions with the White House, which wants to stimulate growth by cutting taxes, reducing regulation and increasing defense and infrastructure spending. Fed officials have concluded the economy is already growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth should be offset by faster rate increases. Financial markets, however, are taking the prospect of higher rates in stride. The Standard  Poor’s   index, which is up more than 11 percent since Election Day, ended trading on Friday mostly flat. The prospective Fed move has modest   implications for consumers. Interest rates on car loans and some kinds of credit card debt will tick upward, but remain at low levels by historical standards. Rates on   mortgages are up by about half a percentage point over the past year. The broader consequences depend on the Fed’s ability to raise interest rates without slowing economic growth. The Fed’s goal is to return rates to a level that neither encourages nor impedes economic activity. Over the past century, however, most of the central bank’s attempts to strike that balance have ended in economic recessions. The American economy is in the midst of one of the longest expansions in the nation’s history, but it is also one of the weakest. The economy expanded by 1. 6 percent in 2016, compared with 2. 6 percent in 2015, according to the government’s most recent estimate. Fed officials have concluded, however, that monetary policy cannot deliver faster growth. The Fed’s job is to minimize unemployment and moderate inflation. The unemployment rate, at 4. 8 percent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and prices rose 1. 9 percent in the 12 months ending in January, the closest the Fed has come since 2012 to hitting its target of 2 percent annual inflation. In December, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since the financial crisis, to a range of 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent, and predicted three increases in 2017. At the beginning of the week, however, Wall Street analysts and investors did not expect the Fed to raise rates again any earlier than June. The Fed issued a measured statement after its policy meeting in early February, and the meeting minutes, published three weeks later, conveyed little sense of urgency. Now, after a week of discussions, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely. Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, described the shift in Fed language as “remarkably swift and decisive. ” Investors put the chances at almost 80 percent in trading on Friday, according to an analysis of asset prices by CME Group. Some Fed officials appear particularly focused on the rise of the stock market. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who described markets as “very buoyant” on Tuesday, has said in the past that if markets did not respond to rate increases, the Fed might need to act more forcefully to tighten financial conditions. It is also getting harder to dismiss the market’s reaction to Mr. Trump’s victory as a bout of temporary euphoria. Mr. Fischer noted on Friday that the stock market boom was creating wealth that people would begin to spend. Ms. Yellen pointed to an improvement in the global context. “The prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat,” she said. The shift in the Fed’s language over the last week also may reflect a recognition that market expectations were not keeping pace with the Fed’s evolving view of the economy. Ms. Yellen, in a February appearance before Congress, hinted that the Fed might be providing a little too much stimulus, describing the Fed’s policy as “accommodative. ” But at the start of this week, investors still put a low probability on a March increase. Markets are wary of the Fed’s flirtations with interest rate increases, as the central bank in recent years has often found reasons for   postponements. This time, the Fed chose to overwhelm any lingering doubts. On Tuesday, Mr. Dudley told CNBC that the case for a rate increase “has become a lot more compelling. ” On Wednesday, Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been one of the most consistent supporters of raising interest rates slowly, suggested that she too was ready to act. “We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time,” Ms. Brainard said at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path. ” Fed officials often bury their latest views on monetary policy at the end of their speeches. Ms. Brainard’s remarks came at the beginning, so that no one missed the point. On Thursday, another Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, issued a similarly blunt notice of intent in an interview with CNBC. “I think the case for a rate increase for March has come together, and I think it’s on the table for discussion,” he said. Then came Friday, the last day on which Fed rules allowed officials to comment on monetary policy before the March meeting, and Ms. Yellen delivered the last word. “At our meeting later this month,” she said, “the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate. ” The committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on March 14 and 15.",0
7139,BREAKING : Most Accurate Poll in Last 3 Election Cycles Predicts Trump Victory #ElectionDay – TruthFeed,"BREAKING : Most Accurate Poll in Last 3 Election Cycles Predicts Trump Victory #ElectionDay BREAKING : Most Accurate Poll in Last 3 Election Cycles Predicts Trump Victory #ElectionDay Breaking News By TruthFeedNews November 7, 2016 
The final national poll from the IBD/TIPP, the pollster with the highest rated accuracy the last 3 election cycles predicts a Trump Victory. 
2004, 2008 and 2012 IBD outranked Pew, ABC, NBC, Fox news, and Rasmussen among many other pollsters with the top ranking and average margin of error of less than one percent. 
In their final poll prior to Election day, IBD/TIPP has Trump ahead 43% to 41% in a nail biter. While winning the popular vote would not in itself guarantee a Trump victory, if IBD / TIPP is once again accurate and Trump has a 2% or greater margin in the popular vote, it would far more likely than not he would also catapult above the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the Presidency. 
IBD’s polling partner TechnoMetrica uses “traditional” telephone methodology using live interviewers for data collection for its public opinion surveys. Roughly 65% of interviews come from a cell phone sample and 35% from a Random Digit Dial (RDD) land line sample. 
IBD’s result is a outlier if you compare it to polls conducted by network as CBS News, ABC, NBC and Fox News have Clinton up between 1 and 4% in their final pre-Election polls. 
However, today’s LA Times / USC poll has Trump with an even larger 5% margin of victory. 
We won’t have to wait long to see which national poll ends up being right. Trump supporters certainly hope the reigning king for accuracy will prevail once again. 
For once in our lifetime, we the people have an opportunity to elect a President who was NOT chosen by Multinational Corporations, Big Banks, DC Elites, and the Globalist Lapdog Mainstream Media.

7140,Your Facebook Page Could Land You In a FEMA Camp,"Your Facebook Page Could Land You In a FEMA Camp 


Against my better judgment, I often put my articles on Facebook. Lately, Facebook has been taking down my posts, particularily on topics related to World War III. One of my readers counted 14 sites saw my articles disappear. It is too late for me, but for most of you, you should consider not participating on Facebook. It is one more intelligence gathering tool designed to separate the sheep, from the independent thinkers! 
No matter how annoying Facebook’s censors may be, there are real dangers associated with posting and reading on Facebook. 
Facebook’s Friends Are Not Nice People 
Facebook is aligned with both the CIA and the NSA. I have several credible sources tell me that all data posted on Facebook goes into series of cataloged files which culminates with each person being assigned a “Threat Matrix Score”. The mere existence of a Threat Matrix Score should send chills up and the collective spines of every American. 
When, not if, martial law comes to America, this Threat Matrix Score, of which Facebook data is used to help compile an “enemies of the state” list, your future longevity could be seriously imperiled. It is too late for people like Steve Quayle, Doug and Joe Hagmann, John B. Wells and myself to avoid being placed on this list. However, it is not too late for the average American to limit their exposure by NOT posting and participating on Facebook. Facebook participation should come with a black box warning: 
“WARNING: The views expressed on Facebook can and will be used against you. Participation in Facebook could prove detrimental to the length of your life. All political dissident views are immediately reported to the CIA and the NSA. Risk of repeated exposure on Facebook could result in you and your family being hauled out of their homes at 3AM, separated from your family and sent to a re-education camp”. 
Before you dismiss this hypothetical black box warning as too much “tongue in cheek”, please consider that the NSA is presently extracting large amounts of Facebook data and I do not think they are compiling a Christmas card list. Facebook’s Welcome Is Wearing Off 
Many of us in print and broadcast media are rethinking our association with Facebook. Several of our journalistic brothers and sisters have been censored and/or otherwise treated unprofessionally by this entity. Facebook has become replete with trolls who patrol the cyber corridors of this monolithic entity chastising and censoring whoever exposes the liberal, anti-human, depopulation agenda of the New World Order. Whether it is gun control, criticism of NWO puppet Obama or anything that the alleged grandson of David Rockefeller, Mark Zuckerberg, and his people disagree with, they will kick your Facebook account to the curb for daring to express a legitimate political opinion. 
Facebook’s Zuckerberg, The Self-Perceived Purveyor of Integrity and Morality 
Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook emphasized three times in a single interview with David Kirkpatrick in his book, The Facebook Effect “ You have one identity, and the days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly. Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity .” 
Who appointed Mr. Zuckerberg to be the moral police and the judge of integrity? It sounds like Zuckerberg can take his place with Soros, Gates, Turner, et al., and the rest of the global elite who think they have the right to treat humanity as their own personal property and view the masses as a disposable commodity. Julian Assange Assessment of Facebook 
Whistle blower, Julian Assange, once stated that “Facebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented. Here we have the world’s most comprehensive database about people, their relationships, their names, their addresses, their locations and the communications with each other, their relatives, all sitting within the United States, all accessible to US intelligence. Facebook, Google , Yahoo – all these major US organizations have built-in interfaces for US intelligence. It’s not a matter of serving a subpoena. They have an interface that they have developed for US intelligence to use.” 
Never before in American cyber-history do we see such an arrogant and agenda serving entity operating their propaganda so far in the open as we do with Facebook. This propaganda end of the New World Order is being blatantly exposed. 
Facebook’s arrogance was on full display when highly respected journalist, Jon Rappoport was banned from sharing his articles on Facebook. In this instance of blatant censorship, Jon’s banned article was merely a review of certain aspects of American presidents ranging from Nixon to Obama. Like so many of us that understand history and can see the tyrannical path that Obama is taking us down, Rappoport identified Obama’s unconstitutional missteps. And for daring to tell the truth, Facebook banned Rappoport for the mere expression of a legitimate political opinion. 
Readers may also recall when members of Infowars.com and the popular talk show host, Michael Rivero were banned in December of 2012, until the public outcry for Facebook to reinstate their respective accounts backed Facebook into a corner from which they acquiesced and reinstated the previously banned media figures. Rules For Thee but Not For Me 
Facebook does not apply their holier than thou attitude to their own corporate behavior. As Zuckerberg talks about rectifying Americans lack of integrity through timely Facebook exposure, Facebook fails to pay its own fair share of taxes as a result of tax loopholes and deductions. Facebook paid no income tax for the fiscal year 2012 , despite reaping $1.1 billion in U.S. corporate profits. While Americans have just been subjected to higher taxes, billion-dollar corporations like Facebook, General Electric, Boeing and Wells Fargo have all been able to avoid paying any corporate income taxes, reports the Citizens for Tax Justice .",0

7142,Twitter’s Chief Operating Officer to Step Down - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   For many months, Twitter has been trying to reshape itself as a growing social media service. That attempt now includes reshaping the company’s top ranks. On Wednesday, Twitter said  that Adam Bain, its chief operating officer, plans to leave the company. Mr. Bain was well liked by Wall Street for building up and running Twitter’s once   advertising business. Many of Mr. Bain’s duties and his direct lieutenants, including those who manage ad sales and partnerships with marketers and broadcast media companies, will be under the purview of Anthony Noto, Twitter’s chief financial officer. Mr. Noto will take on the chief operating officer title, and Twitter said it would begin a search for a new chief financial officer. “The past six years have been incredible, and I’m inspired by what Twitter has become and what it will be in the future,” Mr. Bain said in a statement. “Anthony and I have worked side by side since he joined Twitter in July 2014 and I have full faith in what he and the teams will accomplish in the future. ” Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, added: “Since joining Twitter in 2010, Adam has built an amazing team and a global business from the ground up. ” The changes are more than just the     executive churn at Twitter, which has seen plenty of departures in the past. Together, they amount to the most significant   under Mr. Dorsey, who was appointed chief executive in October 2015 after an interim stint. He has been struggling to turn Twitter into a moneymaking enterprise with a growing audience, but his efforts have largely stalled and the company recently flirted with selling itself. Mr. Bain, 43, had his   anniversary at Twitter in August. Over his time at the company, he helped build Twitter’s ad efforts from the ground up, and was once considered a top candidate to be chief executive before Mr. Dorsey got the job. Inside Twitter, Mr. Bain was seen as a corporate cheerleader who was known for his positivity. Last year, employees circulated a hashtag, #AdamBainIsSoNice, after an article about him appeared online in Recode. In recent quarters, the growth of Twitter’s ad business has slowed and Mr. Bain has had to grapple with a more challenging digital advertising environment. Last month, Twitter said it would slash 350 jobs, or about 9 percent of its work force, as part of an attempt to move the company more quickly toward profitability in 2017. Many of those cuts are focused on restructuring Twitter’s sales and marketing efforts, which were under Mr. Bain. Mr. Noto, 48, who joined Twitter two years ago as chief financial officer, has been amassing more responsibilities. He has been instrumental in helping to orchestrate and execute Twitter’s plan to be more of a destination for live streaming video, including striking a partnership with the National Football League to stream Thursday night games. Internally, Mr. Noto is popular, frequently appearing onstage at companywide meetings cheering on Twitter’s   efforts. Mr. Bain, who is regarded as a top executive prospect and has been approached by a number of companies during his tenure at Twitter, did not disclose his plans. Current and former Twitter executives describe the relationship among Mr. Bain, Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Noto as amiable. Three people who work with Mr. Bain, and who requested anonymity because their conversations with him were private, said he would not join a major Twitter competitor like Facebook, a move that other Twitter executives have made in the past. Instead, Mr. Bain will most likely pursue something outside the advertising industry, these people said.",0

7145,"After Orlando Shooting, Talk Show Hosts Suggest Talk Is Not Enough - The New York Times","Talk show hosts talk. After a mass murder, the pattern goes, they take a moment to talk more seriously. They talk about grief, love and hope. And then  —   this being their job  —   they move on to talk about something else. Monday night, as   shows aired their first episodes after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. there was a recurring theme: Talk is not enough anymore. From more freewheeling cable shows to the mainstream broadcasters, the prevailing message was that   hosts had been here so many times, after so many mass murders, the sad comic’s display of apolitical grief response had become shtick. “You realize that you know what to say,” Stephen Colbert said on CBS, “because it’s been said too many times before. ” Samantha Bee, the host of “Full Frontal” on TBS, said that she was too angry to deliver some “  words about how we will get through this together, how love wins, how love conquers hate. ” She continued: “Love does not win unless we start loving each other enough to fix our [expletive] problems”  —   starting, she argued, with restricting access to guns like the semiautomatic that Omar Mateen used to kill dozens of clubgoers. Ms. Bee’s political comedy has been blistering from the second “Full Frontal” began in February, and taking sides is her mission, much as it was on her alma mater, “The Daily Show. ” (In his own commentary on the terrorist attack, Trevor Noah declared, “America needs to make it a lot harder for people who shouldn’t have guns to get guns. ”) What was new was the quaver in Ms. Bee’s voice  —   the barest suggestion that it was all she could do to keep it together even as she lashed the National Rifle Association and politicians who oppose gun regulations. Ms. Bee has been a   punk band of rage, sarcasm and urgency Monday’s show added an acoustic note of heartbreak. Ms. Bee’s   Conan O’Brien, made a bigger departure. Never a particularly political host, he told his audience, “I have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what I think. ” But on this night, he said, “I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semiautomatic assault rifle. ” Hosts evolve over the years  —   David Letterman became more political in his later seasons  —   and Mr. O’Brien has been at this since 1993. But he also now has the latitude afforded by a smaller cable audience. It’s questionable whether, were he still hosting “The Tonight Show,” he would have been able to speak out the same way. Compare the emotional but conventional plea for peace and understanding offered by the current host of “The Tonight Show,” Jimmy Fallon: “Maybe there’s a lesson from all this, a lesson in tolerance. We need to support each other’s differences and worry less about our own opinions. ” On CBS’s “Late Show,” Mr. Colbert’s reaction captured his delicate effort over the past year to find a middle ground between the sharp point of view of “The Colbert Report” and the more typical neutrality of late night. His monologue wasn’t as prescriptive as Ms. Bee’s or Mr. O’Brien’s, but it tiptoed up to the edge of   …     something. Opening behind his desk  —   a departure for his show  —   Mr. Colbert talked about love fighting despair, but with the suggestion that feeling, in itself, wasn’t enough. “Love the families and the victims and the people of Orlando, but let’s remember that love is a verb. And to love means to do something. ” Mr. Colbert was saying not that love is itself an action, but that love requires acts to mean anything. It was an idea that wouldn’t be out of place in a church group, and indeed, the former Sunday school teacher seemed to be trying to bring that experience to late night. Not to punt on the moral question or preach about it, but to think through a problem with his congregation. He continued that approach with his first guest, Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly, who had been scheduled before the attack. The conservative host was more eager to talk about the   angle of the killings, whereas it became clear that for Mr. Colbert, “do something” meant, in part, getting powerful guns off the streets. Conservatives will notice, correctly, that late night was not exactly an N. R. A.  zone. In his “A Closer Look” segment, Seth Meyers touted a Harvard study that linked more gun availability to more gun deaths. “Which should be obvious,” Mr. Meyers continued. “That’s like saying, where there’s more white people, there’s more brunch. ” But the “Late Show” exchange was strikingly civil. Mr. O’Reilly signaled openness to restrict some guns Mr. Colbert gently shushed his less conservative audience when it grumbled at his guest: “Listen to what he has to say, please. ” Trying to come to some mutual understanding about guns and terrorism at any time, let alone in an election year, seems quaint and quixotic. And it symbolizes the tough job Mr. Colbert has had in synthesizing the Comedy Central and CBS audiences on his new show. He might be too political for the car   crowd, too accommodating for partisans who want viral clips of their enemies being “totally destroyed. ” Whether he succeeds or not, there was a growing, exhausted sense Monday that the usual     approach wasn’t cutting it. As Mr. O’Brien put it: “It’s time to grow up. ”",0

7147,’Destiny 2’ – ’Rally the Troops’ Worldwide Reveal Trailer - Breitbart,"The Last City has fallen before the Cabal Empire. Gather the surviving Guardians and fight back to retake Earth in Destiny 2. [Destiny 2’s reveal trailer doesn’t tell players much more than yesterday’s teaser trailer did, but it does confirm theories that the sequel will focus on an invasion of Earth by the Cabal Empire and reveal the identity of the game’s antagonist. It also explicitly explains why   Destiny players won’t be able to carry over the weapons, armor, and other items they’ve been collecting for the past three years to the next installment: it was all destroyed when the city fell.

Destiny 2 will make an already great game franchise better than ever. ” Destiny 2 launches September 8 on Xbox One, PS4, and PC.",0
7148,Not Funny: ’Saturday Night Live’ Viewers Are Over the Trump Jokes,"A large chunk of Saturday Night Live’s audience says they are tired of the punchlines aimed at President Donald Trump and his administration. [A poll conducted by Morning Consult reveals that more SNL viewers want the   NBC show to move on from lampooning Trump than want the sketch comedy show to keep “ribbing” the president.  While 33 percent of respondents say they “would like to see more” Trump skits on SNL, 19 percent say they “enjoyed” the jokes but “would like SNL to focus on something else. ” Another 16 percent say they have “not enjoyed the impersonations of the members of President Trump’s administration. ” Perhaps oddly, 31 percent of respondents did not have an opinion. In total, 35 percent of SNL viewers want to see new    skits compared to the 33 percent who want more. The disparity is within the survey’s two percentage point margin of error. Ironically, Donald Trump’s political rise coincided with a surge in SNL’s ratings. After slumping in late November, the sketch comedy show’s ratings spiked in February to its highest level in six years. The rise in ratings came thanks to Melissa McCarthy’s impersonation as White House press secretary Sean Spicer, and Alec Baldwin’s record 17th outing as host. Baldwin first debuted his Trump impression during the 42nd season premiere of SNL and has continued to appear on the show to skewer the president.

A controversial bake sale meant to protest race-based admissions at the University of Texas at Austin drew its own opponents on Wednesday. 
The campus branch of the Young Conservatives of Texas hosted the bake sale — in which prices varied depending on the buyer’s race and gender — to draw attention to affirmative action, which the event’s organizers said “demeans minorities on our campus by placing labels of race and gender on their accomplishments.” A cookie cost $1.50 for Asian males, 75 cents for white females and 25 cents for Hispanic females. 
More than 100 of their classmates showed up to host a counter-protest, calling the bake sale an offensive and inappropriate stunt. 
“The labeling of races and the different prices of each is unacceptable…” said Jarvis Dillard, a UT freshman and one of the students protesting the bake sale. “White males have privilege above all the other races.” 
In a statement Wednesday, Greg Vincent, the university’s vice president for diversity and community engagement, called the event “inflammatory and demeaning.” 
“Focusing our attention on the provocative nature of the YCT’s actions ignores a much more important issue: They create an environment of exclusion and disrespect among our students, faculty and staff,” the statement says. 
The young conservatives group held a similar bake sale in 2013 and was similarly chastised by Vincent, who called that event “deplorable.” 
UT-Austin’s affirmative action policies have put the university in the spotlight over the past few years. In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the university’s affirmative action system in a 4-3 vote after it was challenged by a white woman, Abigail Fisher, who was denied admission. Fisher argued she was passed over by UT while less qualified minority students were not. 
The university considered the Supreme Court decision — which gives a small boost in admission to black and Hispanic students — a win. As of 2015, however, black students only made up 3.9 percent of the student population. During the protest, UT student body president Kevin Helgren said the campus has a long way to go in terms of inclusivity and diversity. 
“Institutionalized racism exists and affirmative action helps to combat that,” Helgren said during the protest. “The act of putting financial values on groups of people based on their gender or on their race, in my opinion, is a really prominent way to engage in racism in 2016.” 
On the young conservatives’ Facebook event page, the group wrote: “YCT is a truly colorblind organization and believes that all government institutions are constitutionally prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race in all circumstances, including affirmative action.” 
Christopher Shafik, a 19-year-old member of the young conservatives group, said “people assume that because we are in a position against affirmative action that we’re racist.” He said the opposite is true, and that the organization must work to change its image on campus.

7151,"Carl Paladino, Trump Ally, Wishes Obama Dead of Mad Cow Disease in ’17 - The New York Times","Carl Paladino, a western New York builder,   Republican candidate for governor of New York and political ally of   Donald J. Trump, came under fire on Friday for racially offensive comments about President Obama and the first lady, who Mr. Paladino said should be “let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe. ” Mr. Paladino’s comments were published in Artvoice, a weekly Buffalo newspaper. They came in response to  an   feature in which local figures were asked about their hopes for 2017. “Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford,” said Mr. Paladino, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010, making an apparent reference to the Hereford cattle breed. He said he hoped the disease killed the president. Asked what he most wanted to see “go away” in the new year, Mr. Paladino  —   who has a reputation in New York political and business circles for speaking in an unfiltered manner reminiscent of Mr. Trump’s  —   answered, “Michelle Obama. ” “I’d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla,” he said. Condemnation of the remarks was swift on social media and among elected officials around the state. The local county executive called for Mr. Paladino to immediately resign his post on the Buffalo school board. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who defeated Mr. Paladino in 2010, called the comments “racist, ugly and reprehensible. ” He said in a statement that Mr. Paladino had a “long history” of making similar comments and that he had “embarrassed the good people of the state with his latest   rage. ” Mr. Trump did not personally step to the defense of Mr. Paladino, who served as a New York   of the  ’s campaign and describes himself as a personal friend of Mr. Trump’s. “Carl’s comments are absolutely reprehensible, and they serve no place in our public discourse,” Jessica Ditto, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said. Mr. Paladino conducted several media interviews, framing his comments about the Obamas as “  humor” in an interview with a Buffalo television news station and as an effort to draw attention to the president’s “transgressions” in a telephone interview with The New York Times. “I did it to wake people up I did it to get people’s attention,” he said in the telephone interview. He pointed to a   statement, published after the comments were made, in which he outlined his grievances with the Obama administration. “He couldn’t care less about the people,” he said of the president in the statement. In an interview with The Buffalo News, he berated editors there for focusing on what he had said. “Tell that Rod Watson I made that comment just for him,” Mr. Paladino told the newspaper, in what the paper said was a reference to an editor and columnist for The News who is black. Mr. Paladino, in the interview with The Times, said he was “not politically correct,” though he disputed the notion that his comments were racist. Asked why he wanted to see the first lady live with a gorilla in Africa, he paused for a long time, then said: “What’s wrong with that?” An email and phone call to Artvoice were not immediately returned. Mr. Paladino was not the only respondent to the Buffalo paper’s survey to infuse their hopes for the coming year with politics, though most kept clearer of controversy, offering wishes for world peace and for the disappearance of such things as high taxes and State Route 198.",0
7152,"Trump Tries to Deflect Russia Scrutiny, Citing ‘Crooked Scheme’ by Obama - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump sought to turn attention away from the Russia investigation on Monday, saying that “the real story” was what he called a “crooked scheme against us” by President Barack Obama’s team to mine American intelligence reports for information about him during last year’s presidential campaign. The president’s broadside against his predecessor coincided with a string of reports in conservative news media outlets that Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, requested the identities of Americans who were cited in intelligence reports about surveillance of foreign officials, and who were connected with Mr. Trump’s campaign or transition. Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies. The process of “unmasking” Americans whose names are redacted in intelligence reports, they said, is not the same thing as leaking them publicly. But Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the news media reports to bolster his case that he was targeted by the departing administration for political reasons. As the F. B. I. and congressional committees investigate contacts that associates of Mr. Trump had with Russian officials and business figures, the president argued that he was the victim of dirty tricks and that, if anything, it was associates of his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, who were doing the bidding of Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia. “Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter early Monday morning in the opening burst of four messages aimed at Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats. “‘Spied on before nomination.’ The real story. ” In another post on Twitter later in the morning, he added: “@FoxNews from multiple sources: ‘There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump. This is unprecedented.’ @FBI” At his daily briefing later in the day, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he would not discuss the reports about Ms. Rice specifically. “There’s a troubling direction that some of this is going in, but we’re going to let this review go on before we jump to it,” he said. He chided reporters for showing more interest in the investigation into contacts between Mr. Trump’s team and Russia than in the conduct of Mr. Obama’s White House. Mr. Trump first accused Mr. Obama a month ago of tapping his phones at Trump Tower during the campaign last year. He has refused to back down, even though Mr. Obama and his top aides have adamantly denied it. The F. B. I. director and the former director of national intelligence have said the phone tapping charge is not true, and congressional leaders of both parties have said they have seen no evidence of it. In an interview broadcast on BBC on Monday evening, John O. Brennan, the C. I. A. director under Mr. Obama, chided Mr. Trump for making an unsubstantiated allegation against the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, has “a solemn obligation” to provide information “that is accurate, that is measured and that is not just a spontaneous or impulsive number of words. ” While other officials have said there is no convincing evidence so far of collusion between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russian officials who meddled in last year’s election, Mr. Brennan said that “it would be premature at this time to make any determination, or rule anything out. ” At the same time, he agreed with Mr. Trump about the seriousness of leaks to the news media in recent weeks. “These leaks are appalling,” he said. “They need to stop. ” In trying to combat what Mr. Trump’s aides see as a concerted campaign of leaks to undermine his legitimacy, the White House last month provided intelligence to Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, showing that the president or his associates may have been “incidentally” swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies last year. Since Mr. Nunes made that public, Mr. Trump’s team has focused on whether Mr. Obama’s White House improperly used that information. Republicans pointed to the reports about Ms. Rice on Monday. “Smoking gun found!” Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, wrote on Twitter. “Obama pal and noted dissembler Susan Rice said to have been spying on Trump campaign. ” Intelligence officials are supposed to guard the privacy of Americans caught up in routine eavesdropping of foreign officials. In daily intelligence reports to officials like Ms. Rice, they typically refer to Americans who came up in recorded conversations as U. S. Person One or U. S. Person Two. But   officials, as Ms. Rice was, can ask intelligence briefers to provide names to better understand the meaning of the report. It remains unclear how many names were unmasked by Ms. Rice. But several former officials said she did so for legitimate reasons: The Obama White House was concerned during the election about continuing attempts by the Russian government to hack Democratic email accounts and interfere in the campaign. Ms. Rice, they said, needed to understand if Americans were involved in that. They also said Mr. Obama’s advisers worried during the transition  —   as he imposed sanctions on Russia for its election meddling  —   that the Trump transition team was trying to undermine American policy before coming to office. The content of the intelligence reports at issue remains unclear. Some officials have said the reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about how they were trying to develop contacts within Mr. Trump’s family and inner circle before his inauguration. The former national security officials’ description of the intelligence is in line with Mr. Nunes’s characterization of the material, which he said was not related to the Russia investigations when he disclosed its existence. The White House and Mr. Nunes have not made clear whether they are concerned that actual names had been unmasked in reports, or whether one could tell who the person being discussed was from their context. But at least one name is known to have been unmasked: Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. He was selected for that post during American surveillance of Russia’s ambassador in December, when the two talked about the sanctions Mr. Obama had just imposed on Moscow. Mr. Flynn was forced out in February after it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls. But Mr. Trump and other White House officials have suggested that the real problem in the Flynn case involved the leaks about his calls with the Russian envoy, not the content of the calls themselves  —   or what Mr. Flynn did or did not tell colleagues about his communications. Intelligence agencies are permitted to record calls even if they involve Americans, and any American citizen who talks with, messages or emails a foreign official under surveillance would be picked up by intelligence agencies. During the transition, this would have included Trump associates and even Obama administration officials.",0

7154,"What If Consciousness Is a State of Matter, Just Like a Solid, a Liquid or a Gas?","What If Consciousness Is a State of Matter, Just Like a Solid, a Liquid or a Gas? Nov 5, 2016 0 0 
As a young child, I would randomly pause in my daily activities to thumb through my perception of the world. Not only could I think about things, I could reason, decide and analyze things. Events in life left me with feelings of confusion, which caused me to dig further into the meaning of what I had witnessed. 
All this sounds pretty normal and obvious, right? Well, to a child, realizing the existence of the conscious is a major thing. A child comes to the conclusion that they are an intelligent being living inside a meat shell. While thinking on this over and over, it becomes disturbing, so the child devises a way to understand what this means. 
I guess this is the best way I can explain it, but basically, I want to know what the conscious is . Could our conscious be more than a set of thoughts? Could this part of our psyche be a completely separate form of existence? The conscious, a state of matter? 
Another way to understand the conscious is by seeing it as the part of us that gives individuality , it separates us from other beings and gives us a sense of self. 
All these explanations are interesting, but they still don’t tell us what the conscious really is. Neuroscientists like Max Tegmark of MIT believe the conscious is a state of matter. Could this be? What’s the matter? 
Matter doesn’t necessarily mean liquid or sloshing substances. Matter, in this case, probably means mathematical conditions with varying degrees of consciousness. 
As water, ice and vapor need conditions to exist, so does our conscious. After all, if the conscious is indeed a state of matter, it helps us understand why the world works in the way it does. It’s hard to understand the conscious, but it helps to see this being as the tool that gives us the ability to reason, process and retrieve information – this is how the brain is compared to a computer. A fact that we know about the conscious is that it cannot be broken down into smaller parts , unlike the computer. But like the computer, being pushed by artificial intelligence , the conscious can work independently from its neighboring processes. Perceptronium 
Conscious as a state of matter is called perceptronium. It is seen as what gives us the ability to be self-aware . Our awareness is worked out exclusively within, offering no outside influence, at times. Perceptronium also has the ability to see parts as a whole as well as independent objects or entities. We take this ability for granted, but with a little work of our conscious, we can understand the mechanics of our own thought processes. 
Tegmark said , 
“The problem is why we perceive the universe as the semi-classical three-dimensional world that is so familiar. When we look at a glass of iced water, we perceive the liquid and the solid ice cubes as independent things even though they are intimately linked as part of the same system.” 
Quantum mechanics reminds us that the world we live in is just one of many possible planes of existence . Tegmark cannot explain why this is so but suggests that there is an incredibly close relationship between the conscious and other states of matter. 
Could what we know, reveal the meaning of everything we already know? Could our sole purpose for living simply be the realization of self? 
As a matter of fact, it really could be that simple.

7155,Riot by Drug Gangs in Brazil Prison Leaves at Least 56 Dead - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   A prison riot involving gangs vying for supremacy over the cocaine trade in the Brazilian Amazon left at least 56 people dead, the authorities in the city of Manaus said on Monday. Riots at Brazil’s prisons are common, but the episode in Manaus, which involved decapitated bodies being thrown over the walls of the penitentiary, ranks among the bloodiest in recent decades. Officials expressed dismay over the scenes of slaughter in the Compaj prison, which held more than 1, 200 inmates, about triple its official capacity. “I never saw anything like this in my life,” Judge Luís Carlos Valois, who helped negotiate an end to the riot, said in a Facebook post. He said that dozens of people had been killed, but that it was challenging to arrive at a precise count: “There were lots of bodies. Many of them were dismembered. ” The riot flared on Sunday and lasted about 17 hours, raising fears of even greater violence on the streets of Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon basin with a population of about 2. 1 million. Manaus has emerged as a brutal battleground between two prison gangs that are contesting control of the drug trade in the region. The authorities said that one of the gangs, Familia do Norte (Family of the North) which operates from the Manaus prisons, was responsible for the vast majority of the killings during the riot. The targets were from First Capital Command, a much larger rival gang commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P. C. C. which has its roots in the prisons of São Paulo in southeast Brazil. “There were deaths only on one side,” Sérgio Fontes, the top security official in Amazonas State, told reporters. “The Familia do Norte massacred members of the First Capital Command, and one or another guys who weren’t on their good side at the moment. ” The riot drew comparisons with the 1992 uprising at the Carandiru prison in São Paulo, when police forces stormed the building and 111 inmates were killed. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings, raising criticism from human rights groups. Since that episode, the Brazilian authorities have vowed to alleviate overcrowding in the country’s prisons and combat prison gangs. But soaring numbers of convictions for relatively minor drug offenses have pushed prison populations upward, the gangs’ clout is growing, and riots continue to erupt frequently all over the country. In the riot in Manaus, inmates took dozens of fellow prisoners hostage. They also seized 12 employees of Umanizzare, a private contractor that operates prisons in the Amazon. Negotiators eventually won the release of the hostages by assuring the inmates that they would not be harmed or transferred to other prisons. Security specialists say that Brazil could experience more riots like the one in Manaus as P. C. C. the São Paulo gang, extends its reach around the country. Familia do Norte, the Manaus gang, recently formed an alliance with Red Command, a gang that has been losing ground to P. C. C. in parts of Rio de Janeiro.",0

By: Cliff Kincaid | Accuracy in Media 
At this time in history, organizations like Accuracy in Media are needed more than ever. The bias in the media has been exposed as a poison that undermines the public’s right to know and threatens the future of democratic self-government. 
Our duty is to tell the American people what has happened to their once-great country. 
In his letter to Donald J. Trump, New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said, “Congratulations on a tremendous campaign. You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully.” 
Belichick is not alone. Poll after poll has confirmed that the American people understand and recognize the problem of liberal media bias. In fact, the bias is just one aspect of the corruption that surrounds us and infects the government. 
A Quinnipiac University poll found that 55 percent of voters told pollsters that Trump was right when he charged the media were biased against him. An Associated Press-GfK poll found that “Overall, 56 percent of likely voters say the media is biased against Trump…” 
One cannot say with certainty that the media bias in the 2016 campaign was worse than, say, the elections of 2008 or 2012. Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton enjoyed extraordinary media bias in their favor. One difference this time around is that the media bias has been extremely well-documented by the emails released from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. We have seen the evidence of how the collusion and collaboration occur. The evidence shows that “journalists” work secretly with one major political party, the Democrats, against conservatives and Republicans. 
Needless to say, all of this is a blatant violation of the ethical standards that journalists profess to uphold. 
The preamble of the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists says they “believe that public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy. Ethical journalism strives to ensure the free exchange of information that is accurate, fair and thorough. An ethical journalist acts with integrity.” 
Instead, they have compromised their integrity in order to elect a woman whose record as a security risk should make her ineligible to seek the presidency. 
But it’s worse than being unethical. 
We see in one of the emails that Washington Post “journalist” Dana Milbank was in touch with the Democrats about crafting one of his anti-Trump columns. 
This email proves that Milbank has been functioning as an operative of the Democratic Party. Of course, those of us who have watched his appearances at conservative events over the years had suspected what was going on. Now we have the proof of the actual collaboration. The email portrays help for Milbank as a “research request” from the columnist. 
In other words, he couldn’t even write his own columns. He was lazy and liberal. 
What this suggests is that Milbank’s function was to write (or put his name on) certain articles in order to divert attention away from scandals involving Democrats. In the latest case , in order to justify a Post black-out of Danney Williams’ charges that he was Bill Clinton’s black son, Milbank would cover his news conference and make fun of the event. 
Such an attack serves two purposes. One, it justifies the Post’s decision not to cover the event as a legitimate news story. Second, it scares others away from covering it. How many conservatives in the media shied away from the story? 
In his landmark book, The Corrupt Society , Robert Payne wrote, “There are many weapons that can be used to prevent the corruption of societies. The most powerful of these weapons are vigilance and knowledge. Hence the importance of the press, radio, and television to break through all imposed restrictions to discover how the government works, how it arrives at its decisions, how it manages its defenses, how it deals with traitors, especially the traitors in its midst.” 
Payne dedicated his book to Richard Nixon. That was a joke, of course, because Payne found Nixon and his administration to be utterly corrupt. Nixon was forced from office for covering up a burglary into the offices of the opposition political party, the Democrats. Stories in The Washington Post sparked his resignation in the Watergate scandal. Victor Lasky’s book, It Didn’t Start With Watergate , proved that Democrats had done similar things. 
In 2016, the Democrats nominated a candidate whose corruption made Nixon look like a choir boy. Nixon was ruthless, but he was determined to promote American interests in the world. He was critical in exposing State Department official Alger Hiss as a Soviet spy. 
By contrast, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is one of those “traitors” Payne had warned about. Her illegal private server, full of classified information, was open to hacking by foreign governments. Her top aide, Huma Abedin, arranged for some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails to be stored on a computer shared with her pervert husband. The Clinton Foundation laundered money to her husband on behalf of foreign governments seeking favors from the State Department. And the FBI, at this late date, refuses to hold any of them responsible for undermining the security of our nation. 
Meanwhile, The Washington Post facilitates this corruption in government by failing to expose it. And one Post “journalist” has been exposed as a lazy liberal pawn of those who were in charge of getting Mrs. Clinton into the White House. 
The Christian existentialist philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, wrote about the corruption in the church and how church and state had become one. In his critique of the Danish State Church, he said everyone knew privately that the system was rotten and corrupt but they would not say so publicly. “Just as one says that death has marked a man, so we recognize the symptoms which demand to be attacked. It is a battle against lies,” he said. 
The problem we face today is not just media bias, but corruption in government and the media that runs so deep that it is uncomfortable for some to even talk about it publicly. Cliff Kincaid

7158,Iraqi Christians Hold first mass in over 2 years pray for Trump to Win,"
IRAQI Christians will pray for Donald Trump’s election victory after they condemned US Government for “abandoning” them to the barbaric terror of Islamic State.
The Christian community in the latest Iraqi town to be freed from ISIS have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants.
The once-bustling Qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 Christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week.
Residents who stayed in the town have described how ISIS told every Christian to pay a massive tax, convert to Islam or face execution.
Those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that President Obama refused to protect them when Iraq’s largest Christian city fell to ISIS more than two years ago.
A man in the village said he hopes Donald Trump – a widely favoured candidate in the town – will bring a different approach to Iraqi Christians.
He told the camera: “Obama has never helped the Christians. In fact, he despises them. In the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them.
“But we have hope in the new president, Trump.”

Donald Trump has previously spoken up about how Christians have been left to fend for themselves by the US government.
A Catholic priest in the town said: “The US government led by President Obama could have protected us – or at least helped us to protect ourselves.
“But unfortunately Obama abandoned us, and chose not to get involved.”
A young girl wearing a crucifix then added: “We hope this new guy called Trump will help us more than Obama did.”
Last Sunday, Father Ammar took mass in a shelled-out Church of the Immaculate Conception for the first time in two years.
He said: “Yes, they destroyed and burned some houses and churches, but we can rebuild them.

7159,Republican Walks Out on Reporter Who Urged Non-Residents at Local Town Hall - Breitbart,"Rep. Rod Blum ( ) ended an interview with a reporter on Monday in which he was questioned about requiring identification for people taking part in his town hall meetings.   activists across the country have systematically disrupted these events  —   sometimes people who are not constituents. [Josh Scheinblum, a reporter with the   TV9 in Cedar Rapids, asked Blum “why the decision was made” to require identification.  “Because we want people from the first district to be at our town halls,” Blum said. “We don’t want people from outside of the first district. ” “We don’t need people from Chicago there or Des Moines there or Minneapolis there,” Blum said. “I don’t represent them. “They should go talk to their representatives at their town hall meetings,” Blum said. “I don’t know why they would want to be at my town hall meetings to start with. ” Instead of moving on to issues that face Iowans in Blum’s first district, the reporter said the Congressman “represents all Iowans” and shouldn’t they have a “voice at the table?” After Blum explained that, like voting, people should participate in town halls based on where they live, the reporter asked him if he would take a donation from a Republican in Iowa City, which is not in Blum’s district. At that point, Blum ended the interview, calling the questions “ridiculous” and saying that the he wouldn’t stand by and let the reporter “badger” him. As Blum left the room, children who accompanied him seemed to punctuate his departure with funny moves as the reporter tried to continue the interview. “Let’s talk about the issues here,” the reporter said to the empty chair.

7160,Turkish Government Arrests Opposition Parliament Members in Further Descent Into Dictatorship,"Turkish Government Arrests Opposition Parliament Members in Further Descent Into Dictatorship Posted on Nov 4, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
The Turkish government has detained 11 members of parliament from the leftist, feminist and pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), including the party’s co-chairs. This step is intended to give Erdogan the majority in parliament he needs to make himself president for life, and to give Turkey (currently a parliamentary government) an imperial presidency on the Egyptian model. The pretext was that these MPs declined to testify in a witch-hunt inquiry. I.e., this is precisely McCarthyism. 
Since the failed July 15 coup, the Turkish government of President Tayyip Erdogan has fired 110,000 people–10,000 of them just last weekend– from the police, judiciary and other government offices. He has had 12,000 professors fired. Some 15 private universities have been summarily shut down on the grounds that they have some Gulen link. If all of them were involved in the coup, that action might be understandable. But manifestly, all were not. It is true that the rightwing religious Gulen cult has seeded covert agents throughout the Turkish government and business sector. But surely there are hundreds of them, not 110,000. Among the authoritarian steps he has taken is the lifting of parliamentary immunity, setting the stage or his current coup d’etat. 
Erdogan has also closed down 45 newspapers , 16 television channels and all told, 130 media organizations. Some were accused of having Gulen tendencies. Others are pro-Kurdish. Still others are secular. Many are just sometimes critical of Erdogan, which apparently is no longer going to be allowed. 
In modern democratic law, you can’t fire or arrest someone for thought crimes. The arrestees need to have actually done something wrong. Erdogan is trying to criminalize entire groups, and suspiciously enough the only group left that is not taboo is followers of Erdogan–i.e. right of center, at least somewhat religious Sunni Muslim Turks, who make up about 40 percent of the population. Secularists are likely at least 25%, Kurds are 20% and Alevi Shiites are 20 percent (many Alevis are also secularists, and some religious Kurds vote for Erdogan, so you can’t just add these groups up–they overlap). So Erdogan is engineering a dictatorship on behalf of a minority. 
Erdogan moreover isn’t understanding when the rest of the world won’t arrest people for thought crimes. He had demanded that PKK members and Gulenists be extradited from Germany, but the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel declined. Erdogan then went on a rant accusing Germany of giving material aid to terrorism. I mean, this behavior is unhinged. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Erdogan now has three big domestic political struggles going on: 1) against the old secular Kemalist movement, now a shadow of its former self with only a quarter of the seats in parliament; 2) against all the major Kurdish political groupings; and 3) against the rival “Gulen” Muslim fundamentalist movement. 
Saturday’s arrests targeted the moderate pro-Kurdish HDP, which has stood for feminism, gay rights, and a multi-cultural Turkey with a place for both Kurds and Turks (hence it is the Democratic Peoples’ Party, with peoples in the plural). 
In June of 2015, the HDP won 13% of seats in parliament and left the ruling AKP or Justice and Development Party, Erdogan’s party, with only about 40 percent. This development threw a spanner in the works as far as Erdogan’s aspirations to become a powerful president for life went. He needed an absolute majority for his party in parliament. Whether he deliberately engineered a renewal of the war with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group that in the past has been radical and separatist but that had said it was moderating, is a matter of dispute. What is clear is that the polarization resulting from new hostilities hurt the HDP. Erdogan’s party refused to make a coalition with any of the other three major parties, causing snap elections. On Nov. 1, 2015, the AKP got a little over 50% of seats in parliament and the HDP shrank to only 10%. That outcome allowed Erdogan’s AKP to form a government without a coalition partner, but did not allow it to amend the constitution by fiat. 
If the HDP members of parliament are permanently removed, perhaps even jailed, then Erdogan may argue that he has a majority of the remaining MPs and can move forward with his coronation as dictator in chief. 
Unfortunately for Turkey, Erdogan’s erratic behavior is likely to tank the economy. The tourism sector has collapsed. Foreign Direct Investment depends on confidence, which is slipping away. 
Every new assault that Erdogan launches on democracy in Turkey has brought queries as to whether Turkish democracy is now definitively dead. The answer each time is yes. TAGS:",0
7161,Evictions by Armed Men Rattle a Mexican Tourist Paradise - The New York Times,"TULUM, Mexico  —   By the time Renaud Jacquet arrived at his compound of rental beach villas, invaders were crawling all over the place. They were storming through the buildings, emptying out rooms and dumping furnishings and supplies in piles outside. One of the men was wandering around clutching a bottle of Mr. Jacquet’s wine. Similar scenes unfolded up and down the coveted stretch of Caribbean coastline in Tulum, Mexico, in June. Hundreds of men working for a security firm  —   carrying sticks, metal pipes and machetes, witnesses said  —   raided 17 properties, including hotels, private homes, boutiques and a beach club. They evicted everyone on the premises, including tourists, some of whom had been roused from their sleep. “It was like the mob,” Mr. Jacquet recalled. “It’s the French Revolution!” Yet the takeovers, which seemed to catch the property owners by surprise, were apparently legal, authorized by a judge’s order. Several police officers stood by and watched they were there only, it seemed, to protect the court officers who had delivered the bad news. The evictions were the most recent, and by far the largest, in a series of   expropriations that have shaken this tourist town and stained its image as a     retreat that has become wildly popular among tourists, particularly those from the United States and Western Europe. Some here, including many of the business owners directly affected by the property seizures, say the evictions and their bitter fallout have exposed an ominous truth about Tulum: that this seemingly Edenic stretch of coastline on the Yucatán Peninsula is hardly immune to the kind of troubles bedeviling the rest of Mexico. Corruption, inconsistent government regulation and an opaque legal system, these residents argue, are threatening to ruin a Mexican paradise. At the heart of the dispute are competing land claims that go back decades. Business owners who have been evicted say they are being robbed of their beachfront property through an elaborate system of fraud involving forged land deeds, fake contracts and violations of due process, facilitated by corrupt government officials and judges. The paucity of public records, the business owners say, has made defending their property claims even more difficult. “American tourists need to really know what’s going on down here,” said Ken Wolf, an American entrepreneur who lost his hotel in Tulum in a similar raid several years ago. “There’s no rule of law. ” When Mr. Jacquet, who is French, bought his first parcel of land here in 2004, along beachfront known as Punta Piedra, he was vaguely aware that his ownership might not be airtight. “It was amazing to find a place like that: so undeveloped, so close to New York,” Mr. Jacquet, 52, said in a recent interview he was wearing a   and pink cotton pants styled after pajama bottoms. He and his wife had been considering buying an apartment in New York, but decided to instead build a house on the beach. “It was a ” he said. In the early 2000s, Tulum’s beachfront was largely undeveloped, with no public utilities and no cellphone service, but it drew entrepreneurs and rewarded their spontaneity. Simple hotels  —   some inspired by the palapas, the traditional huts fashioned out of tree limbs and palm thatch  —   started emerging from the dunes. Boutiques and restaurants opened. The vibe was relaxed, carefree and fun. “It was primitive luxury,” said Nicolás Malleville, an Argentine model who in 2003 opened Coqui Coqui, a hotel that became a favored destination for the fashion world and was seized in the June raids. “We got to play Robinson Crusoe. ” There was also a loose adherence to the rules, which at the time worked in the favor of the pioneers. New homes and hotels were often going up without all of the necessary government permits. And when permission was secured, it was sometimes through bribes. “Today, if the federal government comes with the law in hand and analyzes the ecological situation, I don’t think anybody would remain,” said Matías González, one of Mr. Malleville’s business partners. Tulum was able to maintain its   iconoclastic sensibility partly because of the legal uncertainties surrounding land ownership, which kept the big hotel chains at bay. When he bought his first parcel of land, Mr. Jacquet’s understanding was that it had been part of a   tract that had been set aside in the early 1970s for members of a farming collective, or ejido, as part of a government effort to formalize property rights for landless farmers and encourage settlement in underpopulated areas. Yet he soon learned that a family from the distant northern state of Nuevo León claimed to have a title to part of the ejido land, a conflict that had percolated for years. Mr. Jacquet did not let it deter him. “I looked at everyone else, and we weren’t worried because nobody had lost their land,” he said. By the late 2000s, though, Tulum had taken off as a vacation destination. Room rates soared, making beachfront properties more attractive as takeover targets. One of the first significant warning signs for business owners came on Nov. 30, 2009. That morning, two dozen police officers and a judge descended on Ocho Tulum, a hotel belonging to Mr. Wolf, the American entrepreneur. It sat on beachfront land that he had rented since 2005 under a   lease. In 2006, before he started building, he had learned there was a competing claim to part of the land, but decided to move ahead with the project. “I heard that it would probably not amount to anything,” he said. “I never thought that I was at risk of losing it. ” He challenged his loss in court, but was defeated after years of litigation. The seizure of Mr. Wolf’s property stunned Tulum, but people kept building and the tourists kept coming. For Mr. Jacquet, fear lurked in the back of his mind. “It’s like crossing from France to England swimming and you’re halfway across and you think: Maybe you shouldn’t have gone there. But what are you going to do? You’re going to go back? You keep swimming!” The evictions continued. There were some in 2011, and another round in 2013. In May 2014, four more hotels were seized on a judge’s order in a labor case. Two men had sued the estate of a former landowner, claiming they were owed millions of dollars in unpaid wages, and a judge awarded them the four properties as payment. The Tulum Hotel Association found no record of the two men having worked in Tulum. Furthermore, the hotel owners said they had never been notified that their properties were the subject of legal action. At that point, Mr. Jacquet said, “I knew anything was possible. ” Shaken by the evictions, many business owners began negotiating with the Nuevo León families to buy off their titles. (The current asking price is around $1, 000 per square meter, business operators said.) As in the previous rounds of evictions, the sweep in June appeared to catch the targets by surprise. And as in 2014, a court ruling  —   in a case that the evicted parties said they had no knowledge of  —   prompted the property seizures. Last month, the embassies of four European nations  —   France, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal  —   sent a joint letter to the Mexico foreign secretary expressing their “great concern” about the evictions and asking the authorities to conduct “a deep and serious investigation. ” (A spokesman for Gov. Roberto Borge of Quintana Roo, the state where Tulum is, did not respond to requests for comment.) Mario Cruz Rodríguez, the director general of tourism for Tulum, said the legal challenges had accelerated in recent years because Tulum is “a jewel  —   it’s a gold mine. ” The 17 properties seized in June are now guarded by the same group of men who participated in the evictions, some of whom are armed with machetes. Business signs have been torn down, gates padlocked, entrances walled off with cinder blocks. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Jacquet strolled down the beachfront and stopped in front of his property. “This is all us,” he said, gesturing beyond the dune vegetation and palms to the cluster of villas that he and his wife had built. Suddenly, a man in a   and shorts emerged from the shade of a tree on the property, mumbling into a  . Other men began streaming out of several of the shuttered properties. One was carrying a large branch. Young couples strolling along the beach in bathing suits slalomed through the swarm of tense men, looking perplexed. Mr. Jacquet was encircled and pelted with questions: Who are you? What are you doing here? That night, rumors swirled of a plot among aggrieved Tulum residents to start a counterinvasion and drive out the guards. There was talk of a paramilitary force of 300 to 400 people. The following day, protesters blocked two critical Tulum roads for more than an hour, paralyzing traffic, including the road along the beachfront. They carried fluorescent poster boards with handwritten messages denouncing the evictions and government corruption. At one point, a group of men dropped from a truck and hopped over the fence of one of the properties. Witnesses said they heard sounds that suggested clashing machetes and perhaps gunshots. The attackers were repelled, jumped back over the fence, climbed into their truck and took off. Soon after, the pickets dissipated and, as evening fell, the usual, lazy rhythms of beach life resumed, as if nothing had happened.",0

7163,"WikiLeaks: Hillary Clinton knew Saudi, Qatar were funding ISIS – but still took their money for Foundation","
21st Century Wire says… 
This should be the biggest revelation yet from WikiLeaks already epic email trove. Will the US media cover this story? 
Last night, in an RT Exclusive interview conducted by award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes is “the most significant email in the whole collection.” 
WikiLeaks reveals an early 2014 email where the outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was urging John Podesta , then advisor to President Barack Obama, to “bring pressure” on Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, “which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.” 
This constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in ‘charitable’ donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. 
In addition, the Clinton’s Foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies: 
(Infographic: Conservative Post ) 
This latest news validates what 21WIRE has been saying since the ‘ISIS crisis’ began in June 2014. 
According to FOX News , FBI sources have said that ‘indictments are likely’ for the Clinton Foundation investigation. One only wonders how this latest Assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation – as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy – two things which Clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning. 
Assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against Clinton and her family foundation: 
“All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some “rogue” princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.” 
During their 25-minute interview filmed at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange and Pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between Clinton as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Gulf monarchies who financed them. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript: 
John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. 
Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton – and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it – the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. 
JP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation? 
JA: Yes.

The interview will air in full on RT International this Saturday Nov 5th.

7164,Dozens of Barrio 18 Gangsters Escape Military Prison,"At least 22 prisoners from the 18th Street Gang  —   otherwise known as Barrio 18  —   escaped a   prison in Honduras. [Prison officials at the Marco Aurelio Soto prison were not exactly sure when the escape happened, but believed it to be sometime during the week of May 8, TeleSUR reported.  “Prisoners were locked up in the special ‘Scorpion’ unit for members of the notorious Barrio 18 gang, one of the strongest organized crime groups in Central America,” TeleSUR noted. Officials did not realize that the prisoners had escaped until days later when custodians noticed they were gone. Rosa Gudiel, the head of the National Penitentiary Institute, said in a news conference that the escape happened because the prisoners wanted to avoid going to a new facility. “The prisoners fled because arrangements are being made to transfer them to new,   jails and they don’t want to go to those places,” Gudiel said. Due to previous prison breaks, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez ordered the military to guard the country’s largest prisons. Marco Aurelio Soto prison, located just north of Honduras’ capital city of Tegucigalpa, is reportedly the country’s most   prison with 17, 000 inmates occupying a space designed to house 8, 000. Prison officials keep Barrio 18 gang members in special facilities that are equipped to handle violence and criminal activities common among prison gangs.

7165,‘I Want to Win Someday’: Tribes Make Stand Against Pipeline - The New York Times,"NEAR CANNON BALL, N. D.  —   Verna Bailey stared into the silvery ripples of a   lake, looking for the spot where she had been born. “Out there,” she said, pointing to the water. “I lived down there with my grandmother and grandfather. We had a community there. Now it’s all gone. ” Fifty years ago, hers was one of hundreds of Native American families whose homes and land were inundated by rising waters after the Army Corps of Engineers built the Oahe Dam along the Missouri River, part of a huge midcentury   project approved by Congress to provide electricity and tame the river’s floods. To Ms. Bailey, 76, and thousands of other tribal members who lived along the river’s length, the project was a cultural catastrophe, residents and historians say. It displaced families, uprooted cemeteries and swamped lands where tribes grazed cattle, drove wagons and gathered wild grapes and medicinal tea. That past has now become a poignant backdrop to protests over a $3. 7 billion oil pipeline project that would cross a rancher’s land just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s reservation and plunge under a dammed section of the Missouri River. The company building the Dakota Access pipeline across four states and 1, 170 miles says it will transport oil safely and reliably. Opponents say a spill or break could poison the river. The protests have drawn thousands here to the Plains, stirring a new environmental movement for dozens of Native American tribes across the country who are supporting the Standing Rock Sioux’s efforts here to block the pipeline. The fight is nearing a pivotal moment as a federal judge in Washington prepares to rule by Friday on whether to allow or block construction of a section of the pipeline near the tribe’s land. History, like a river, runs deep here. And residents like Ms. Bailey say the pipeline battle has dredged up old memories and feelings about lost lands and broken treaties with the United States government, as well as their worries about the future of land and water they hold sacred. “The trauma we deal with today is a residual effect of 1958, when the floods came,” said David Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The federal government has paid millions in compensation over the years to tribes affected by the dam project, including more than $90 million held for the Standing Rock Sioux. But people here say they are still haunted by the memories of being told to leave their homes and seeing families drift apart. The tribe has spent more than 20 years trying to gain control of 19, 000 acres of waterfront land that was taken through eminent domain during dam construction. “Even though it’s been more than half a century, they still feel this loss,” said Michael L. Lawson, the author of “Dammed Indians,” a history of the government’s dam projects along the Missouri. He said about 56, 000 acres of Standing Rock Sioux land had been condemned for the dams and 190 families relocated. Theirs was one of 23 reservations affected by the project. “Just about every part of their economy and living situation was impacted,” Mr. Lawson said. “They lost their most important resources in the bottom lands. ” For years, the legacy of the dam was perhaps the headline struggle for the Standing Rock Sioux. Now the pipeline has brought widespread attention, intense news media coverage and thousands of environmental pilgrims to this serene stretch of North Dakota. The Standing Rock Sioux have sued the Army Corps of Engineers, which approved an important permit for the pipeline, saying that building the pipeline would destroy sacred cultural and burial sites and raising concerns that a leak or spill would poison their water supply. The tribe has asked for a preliminary injunction. The Corps says it reached out extensively to tribes before it gave approval for the Dakota Access pipeline to cross bodies of water, including the Missouri. The Standing Rock Sioux, it says, canceled a meeting to visit the pipeline’s proposed crossing across Lake Oahe. The tribe says it was not properly consulted. In legal filings, the Corps said the Standing Rock Sioux also could not point to specific sites that would be harmed by the pipeline. A tribal history expert later walked the route of the pipeline, and said he had found stone cairns and rocks arrayed in circles, spirals and other patterns that he said probably marked burial sites. As the judge’s decision nears, tensions and fears of violence are rising. Last weekend, protesters upset that pipeline work crews were bulldozing what the tribe calls sacred ceremonial sites broke down a wire fence and surged onto a construction site. The sheriff’s office here in Morton County called it a “riot,” and said protesters had kicked workers, hit them with sticks and sent one to the hospital. Tribal officials say that the demonstrators were provoked, and that six were bitten by guard dogs brought in by the pipeline company’s security guards. On Thursday, Gov. Jack Dalrymple announced that he was sending about a dozen National Guard troops to help state troopers at a traffic checkpoint about 30 miles up the road from the protest, and that he was putting others on standby. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of Morton County said his officers would increase their patrols and their visibility around the demonstration itself. “The worst fear is that this gets escalated in some way and someone gets hurt,” Sheriff Kirchmeier said in an interview this week. “At some point, there has to be an end game. This can’t be going on for long periods of time. ” A total of 37 people have been arrested on trespassing and other charges, but no one has been charged in connection with the clashes on Saturday. Sheriff Kirchmeier said his office was still investigating. The protests have attracted activists, actors and politicians. This week, Jill Stein, the Green Party’s presidential nominee, camped out with protesters and was seen on videos   a bulldozer that sat at a pipeline construction site. On Wednesday, Morton County officials said they had filed misdemeanor charges of criminal mischief and trespassing against Ms. Stein and her   running mate, Ajamu Baraka. The Texas company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, said that it was operating entirely within the law and its agreements with landowners, and that it had all the necessary state and federal permits to build the pipeline. The company sued the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribal members, accusing them of illegally disrupting the pipeline’s construction. Theresa Pleets, 81, said she had a deep personal stake in coming out to the protest camp, a field speckled with teepees, campers, tents and fire rings. She grew up in a   log house along the Missouri River, where her parents would fill barrels with drinking water. After the river was dammed, she said, her parents were relocated to a small,   house. “I want to beat the Corps,” she said. “I want to win someday. ” The house where Ms. Bailey was born had just one room, she said. She arrived during a January blizzard in 1940, and her grandfather, Albert No Heart Sr. took a   sleigh eight miles south to the town of Fort Yates to fetch a midwife, she said. She went away to boarding school, and worked for decades in tribal administrative offices. Now, she said, she tells stories of gathering firewood and wild berries in land that is covered by water. “My kids don’t believe it,” she said, “when I tell them how things were. ”",0
7166,Teenager With Pellet Gun Is Killed by Police After Robbery in Brooklyn - The New York Times,"New York City police officers in plain clothes shot and killed a man in Brooklyn early on Sunday when he pointed a   pellet gun at them after robbing a bodega, the police said. Investigators recovered a black imitation pistol from the scene of the shooting, which occurred shortly after 12:40 a. m. on Starr Street near Irving Avenue in the Bushwick neighborhood, said Terence A. Monahan, the chief of patrol. The police officers involved were not identified. The man, whom officials identified as Sergio Reyes, 18, had used the pellet gun to rob the Garden Deli and Grill at 185 Starr Street, the police said. Officials released a surveillance video image of a man  —   dressed in a dark hooded sweatshirt and   pants with a mask covering part of his face  —   pointing the gun at a bodega clerk. The clerk, Mohamed Ali, said Mr. Reyes had entered the bodega and broken a   of beer on the floor. He then grabbed two more beers from the cooler and brought them to the counter, where he pulled out a gun and put it in Mr. Ali’s face, Mr. Ali said. “He said, ‘Bag it up,’” Mr. Ali recalled. “‘Bag it up, or I’m going to kill you. And shut the camera off. ’” Mr. Ali called 911 and a few minutes later heard gunshots down the block. Chief Monahan said the police responded to Mr. Ali’s 911 call around 12:40 a. m. A sergeant and two officers from an   unit in the 83rd Precinct went to the bodega, he said. As they talked to witnesses, the officers spotted Mr. Reyes, who was walking west on Starr Street, alongside Maria Hernandez Park. Chief Monahan said the officers gave Mr. Reyes verbal commands and confronted him in front of 169 Starr Street. “The suspect had a black firearm in his hand and raised it toward the officers,” Chief Monahan said. “The officers fired at the suspect and struck him multiple times. ” Jovan, 22, who lives on Starr Street and did not want his last name used out of concern for his safety, said he heard at least six gunshots and saw a chaotic scene unfold outside his window: people running, a van racing backward along the street  —   he said he thought it might have been an undercover police vehicle  —   and, soon after, a   officer with his gun drawn and briefly pointed at bystanders. Jovan said his first thought was that a gang confrontation had just erupted. He said he remained indoors for fear of being caught in crossfire. Outside, Mr. Reyes had been wounded in the torso, and he was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, the police said. The three officers involved in the shooting were not hurt. The police said on Sunday evening that they were investigating the shooting and the robbery that preceded it. Mr. Reyes lived a few blocks from the bodega, in a small,   apartment building on Wilson Avenue. On Sunday evening, Mr. Reyes’s father, Antonio Tlapanco, 48, wept as he stood next to a memorial to his slain son: a framed photograph of Mr. Reyes placed on a kitchen table alongside two floral bouquets in vases, candles and an illustration of the Madonna. Mr. Tlapanco, speaking through a Spanish interpreter, said that his son had never been in trouble with the police and that he never carried firearms or weapons of any kind. “I would have known,” said Mr. Tlapanco, who said he regularly checked the contents of all of his children’s backpacks. “The truth is, I don’t know where that came from,” Mr. Tlapanco said of the black pellet gun. “I never saw it around the house. If I would have seen something like that, I would have taken it away from him. ” Mr. Tlapanco said he had questions about the circumstances surrounding his son’s death and the Police Department’s account of it. He showed a photograph that he took at the hospital of bruising on his son’s neck. Mr. Reyes was one of six children, ages 15 to 23, born in the United States to Mr. Tlapanco and his wife, who are immigrants from Mexico. Mr. Tlapanco said Mr. Reyes was a student at Leadership  Public Service High School in Lower Manhattan and was studying to become a social worker. For hours on Sunday, police tape blocked off Starr Street from Irving Avenue to Knickerbocker Avenue, and no one was allowed in Maria Hernandez Park. The park is bordered by small grocers and restaurants, a Pentecostal church, a public school and rows of   apartment buildings. Signs of the neighborhood’s gentrification are evident, including a coffee shop with a youthful clientele directly across Irving Avenue from the scene of the shooting. Noah LePage, 21, said that he had lived on the Suydam Street side of the park since the summer and had seen the police conduct a few drug busts along Starr Street. “We see them a few times in their black vans and everything, but nothing like this,” he said.",0
7167,Trump Abruptly Orders 46 Obama-Era Prosecutors to Resign - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump administration moved on Friday to sweep away most of the remaining vestiges of Obama administration prosecutors at the Justice Department, ordering 46 holdover United States attorneys to tender their resignations immediately  —   including Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. The firings were a surprise  —   especially for Mr. Bharara, who has a reputation for prosecuting public corruption cases and for investigating insider trading. In November, Mr. Bharara met with then   Donald J. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan and told reporters afterward that both Mr. Trump and Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general, had asked him about staying on, which the prosecutor said he expected to do. But on Friday, Mr. Bharara was among federal prosecutors who received a call from Dana Boente, the acting deputy attorney general, instructing him to resign, according to a person familiar with the matter. As of Friday evening, though some of the prosecutors had publicly announced their resignations, Mr. Bharara had not. A spokesman for Mr. Bharara declined to comment. Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an email that all remaining holdover United States attorneys had been asked to resign, leaving their deputy United States attorneys, who are career officials, in place in an acting capacity. “As was the case in prior transitions, many of the United States Attorneys nominated by the previous administration already have left the Department of Justice,” she said in the email. “The Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially appointed U. S. Attorneys to tender their resignations in order to ensure a uniform transition. ” The abrupt order came after two weeks of increasing calls from Mr. Trump’s allies outside the government to oust appointees from President Barack Obama’s administration. Mr. Trump has been angered by a series of reports based on leaked information from a sprawling bureaucracy, as well as from his own West Wing. Several officials said the firings had been planned before Friday. But the calls from the acting deputy attorney general arose a day after Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator who is a strong supporter of President Trump, said on his evening show that Mr. Trump needed to “purge” Obama holdovers from the federal government. Mr. Hannity portrayed them as “saboteurs” from the  “deep state” who were leaking secrets to hurt Mr. Trump. It also came the same week that government watchdogs wrote to Mr. Bharara and urged him to investigate whether Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from taking payments from foreign governments. In Mr. Hannity’s monologue, he highlighted the fact that the Clinton administration had told all 93 United States attorneys to resign soon after he took office in 1993, and that “nobody blinked an eye,” but he said it became a scandal when the George W. Bush administration fired several top prosecutors midway through his second term. Several Democratic members of Congress said they only heard that the United States attorneys from their states were being immediately let go shortly before the Friday afternoon statement from the Justice Department. One senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect the identity of the United States attorney in that state, said that an   prosecutor had been instructed to vacate the office by the end of the day. Although it was not clear whether all were given the same instructions, that United States attorney was not the only one told to clear out by the close of business. The abrupt nature of the dismissals distinguished Mr. Trump’s mass firing from Mr. Clinton’s, because the prosecutors in 1993 were not summarily told to clear out their offices. Michael D. McKay, who was the United States attorney in Seattle under the George Bush administration, recalled that even though he had already made plans to leave, he nevertheless stayed on for about three weeks beyond a request by   General Janet Reno for all of the holdover prosecutors to resign. He also recalled at least one colleague who was in the midst of a major investigation and was kept on to finish it. “I’m confident it wasn’t on the same day,” he said, adding: “While there was a wholesale ‘Good to see you, thanks for your service, and now please leave,’ people were kept on on a    basis depending on the situation. ” Two United States attorneys survived the firings: Mr. Boente, the top prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia, who is serving as acting deputy attorney general, and Rod Rosenstein, the top prosecutor in Baltimore, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be deputy attorney general. “The president called Dana Boente and Rod Rosenstein tonight to inform them that he has declined to accept their resignation, and they will remain in their current positions,” said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. It remains possible that Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions could put others on that list later. It is not unusual for a new president to replace United States attorneys appointed by a predecessor, especially when there has been a change in which party controls the White House. Still, other presidents have done it gradually in order to minimize disruption, giving those asked to resign more time to make the transition while keeping some inherited prosecutors in place, as it had appeared Mr. Trump would do with Mr. Bharara. Mr. Obama, for example, kept Mr. Rosenstein, who had been appointed by George W. Bush. The abrupt mass firing appeared to be a change in plans for the administration, according to a statement by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “In January, I met with Vice President Pence and White House Counsel Donald McGahn and asked specifically whether all U. S. attorneys would be fired at once,” she said. “Mr. McGahn told me that the transition would be done in an orderly fashion to preserve continuity. Clearly this is not the case. I’m very concerned about the effect of this sudden and unexpected decision on federal law enforcement. ” Still, the cases the various federal prosecutors were overseeing will continue, with their career deputies becoming acting United States attorneys in their place for the time being. Mr. Bharara has been among the   United States attorneys, with a purview that includes Wall Street and public corruption prosecutions, including of both Democratic and Republican officials and other influential figures. His office, for example, has prosecuted top police officials in New York and the powerful leader of the city correction officers’ union they have pleaded not guilty. It is preparing to try a major public corruption case involving former aides and associates of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and is looking into allegations of    around Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. But Mr. Bharara is also closely associated with the Senate minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. Mr. Bharara was formerly a counsel to Mr. Schumer, who pushed Mr. Obama to nominate Mr. Bharara to be the top federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. At the time of the November meeting at Trump Tower, Mr. Schumer was saying publicly that Democrats should try to find common ground and work with the  . But relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer have since soured. Mr. Trump has called Mr. Schumer the Democrats’ “head clown” and accused him of shedding “fake tears” over the president’s efforts to bar refugees from entering the United States. For his part, Mr. Schumer has called for an independent investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and demanded that Mr. Sessions resign for having testified that he had no contacts with Russians even though he had met with the Russian ambassador. The White House officials ascribed the reversal over Mr. Bharara as emblematic of a chaotic transition process. One official said it was tied to Mr. Trump’s belief in November that he and Mr. Schumer would be able to work together.",0
7168,Newt on the Media: ’These Aren’t Reporters - These Are Propagandists’ - Breitbart,"Friday on Fox News Channel’s “The O’Reilly Factor,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich took aim at the media for its extensive coverage of last week’s women’s march on Washington, while largely ignoring the March for Life that occurred earlier in the day.  Gingrich blasted the press, saying they were not reporter, but instead “propagandists. ” Partial transcript as follows: ERIC BOLLING,   HOST OF “THE O’REILLY FACTOR”: Despite the march is big turnout, the mainstream media appearing to do its best to downplay it today, especially compared to the nonstop coverage given to last weekend’s   march. Joining us now to analyze from Arlington, Virginia. Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. Look at the coverage. You look at the coverage. It’s nonstop, it’s    last week for the   march, yet you hardly heard very much about this one even though Vice President Pence made an appearance, NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Well, this is just pretty natural. I think, you know, Callista is singing at the basilica last night in the mass for life. And when they announced that Vice President Pence was going to be there, it was 90 seconds along broken applause. I think all across America, people of faith, people who care for life, people who are concerned about stopping abortion are thrilled that the Vice President of the United States for the first time ever, came to the march. And let’s be honest, this is exactly what Steve Bannon was saying to “The New York Times. ” Left wing,     news media are going to do everything they can to hide from the reality that there are vastly more Americans who care about life then there are who care about weird people wearing strange hats with kitty cat ears and talking about bombing the White House. I mean, the grotesque difference between the hard left that we saw on Saturday and the Americans who came together today, the difference in attitude, the difference in tone, the difference in language, I think a lot more Americans are comfortable with Vice President Pence’s speech than with Madonna’s speech. BOLLING:  . And also, the difference is the media coverage as well. GINGRICH: Well, look, the media is 80 percent or 90 percent of the media is the opposition party. I mean, let’s be honest about it. These aren’t reporters, these are propagandist. There was one panel on journalism in the age of Trump in which I don’t think a single member of the panel voted for Trump. They’ve learned nothing, they were wrong during the primaries, he won. They were wrong in the general election, he won. They’ve been wrong about his cabinet, it’s a great cabinet. They were wrong about covering the inaugural, which is truly a historic inaugural, hearkening back to Lincoln’s first inaugural in 1861. They miss it every time because they’re so far to the left and of so out of touch with every day Americans. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
7169,EXCLUSIVE: Former Secret Service Agent Warns Trump ‘Not Secure’ in the White House - Breitbart,"A former Secret Service agent who served in the security details of both Presidents Bush and Obama warned on Saturday that President Donald Trump “is not secure in the White House right now as it stands. ”[Dan Bongino, who was also an instructor at the training academy of the Secret Service, was commenting on Friday night’s reported breach of the White House complex, at least the seventh such incident in recent years.  Bongino stated: “If one guy with a backpack and Omar Gonzales with a bad knee could get near the residence of the White House, can you tell me with a straight face that a   tactical assault team with heavy weapons wouldn’t take that place down?” Bongino was referring to a 2014 incident in which Gonzales penetrated the north portico doors of the White House, reportedly brandishing a      folding knife in a back pocket. “This is inexcusable,” Bongino said of the latest incident. “How many of these are we, as the citizenry, going to tolerate, whether under Barack Obama or now President Trump, before there is enough citizen outrage that the Secret Service actually does something?” Bongino is the author of the bestselling 2013 book Life Inside the Bubble: Why a   Secret Service Agent Walked Away from It All. He also previously ran as a Republican for Congress and the Senate. He was speaking in an interview set to air Sunday on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. “The secret service is not ready right now to defend the White House,” he charged. “They’re not. I know that may make people uncomfortable. And frankly, Aaron, I am really getting tired of some of the talking heads on cable news who have never done one minute in the shoes a secret service agent. ” “They have no idea what the security plan of the White House actually looks like on the ground. They’re all sitting here brushing it under the rug, going, ‘Oh no.’ ‘They were prepared.’ ‘This was a manageable incident.’ ‘This was how it was supposed to work.’ You really believe this is how it was supposed to work?” Regarding Friday night’s breach, Bongino warned, “Do you think that what happened today is not being beamed into every terrorists’ head, going, ‘Look at this fellows.’ I am sounding the alarm hoping and praying with fingers crossed that somebody wakes up and finally does what needs to be done. ” Bongino offered some security upgrade suggestions: “They need to fix the fence. Reinforce the manpower on the north and the south grounds. Add special weapons teams. Get the best technology in there right now. Clearly the technology sensors and cameras are not working as planned. Get them in there yesterday. There’s no other solution. ” Bongino outlined what he says are three major problems facing the Secret Service and the White House security plan. Problem number one, according to Bongino, involves staffing: They have had a brain drain of catastrophic portions in the Secret Service. They lost some of the best agents. If this wasn’t a public radio show that people could hear, I could tell you the names of ten or twenty   tier one guys who left the president’s detail just in the last 5 years who I still communicate with  …     They have had an even worse brain drain in the uniformed division side. They are responsible for the perimeter of the White House.   …    You can’t run a security agency without security officers who know what they’re doing. You just can’t. Problem number two, Bongino contended, is a lack of political will to address the purported security flaws: The management of the Secret Service right now is grossly unprepared for the evolving threats. Grossly. They say they are but they have no political will because a lot of them are out there  —   not all  —   but a lot are looking for their next consulting job. They are just praying that nothing happens on their next watch. They don’t want to be the ones to go on Capitol Hill to say this whole security plan around the White House needs to be fixed. And problem number three involves the actual security plan, he says: They are way too concerned right now, the management, with the optics of White House security. That we can’t make this look like an armed camp. The prior staff didn’t like that. There other entities around the White House that want to preserve the historic look of it. But do you want a secure White House grounds or do you want it to look pretty? CNN reported on Friday night’s breach: A man carrying a backpack was arrested Friday night after breaching security at the White House complex and was discovered by a Secret Service officer by the south entrance to the executive residence, officials said. The incident happened just before midnight while President Donald Trump was at the White House. The suspect, who had a California driver’s license, told Secret Service officers that he was there to see the president.

7170,Turkeys vote for Christmas,"  Gobbles addresses an angry crowd 
In a shock election result, turkeys have voted in favour of Christmas for the first time since they gained the right to hold elections in 1845. In every year since then, turkeys have voted firmly against the Yuletide feast. However, this year a populist right-wing turkey called Steve ""Paxo"" has managed the impossible, and persuaded turkeys to vote for Christmas. 
During the campaign, Paxo was helped by his sinister propaganda adviser, Gobbles, and made a series of promises to the other turkeys. He said that he would take back control of Christmas, and make it great again. He promised to ban the eating of turkeys at Christmas, although he has no power to enforce this. He also said that all the money spent on killing turkeys at Christmas could instead be used to provide free chocolate and HDTV to all turkeys. 
The win seems to have surprised even Gobbles and Paxo, and they began to backtrack on their pledges almost immediately.""Of course when we said we would take back control of Christmas we meant in a non-literal sense,"" said Gobbles. ""It is likely that many turkeys will be slaughtered this year anyway."" 
Some turkeys were disappointed with the result. Mr Clucky voted for Christmas but is beginning to regret it. ""I've had a rough year,"" he said. ""My cage is a mess and I thought voting for Christmas would fix it all. They promised so much."" 
No turkey farmers are thought to be considering taking the result seriously. In any case, the turkeys voted in favour of Christmas, so there is actually less controversy this year than when the birds have voted against it. Farmer Arse of Norwich said, ""Them turkeys is as dumb as chickens. They deserve everything they get."" Make Sir Geoffroy Cockface's  ",0
7171,"Using Air Quotes, White House Walks Back ‘Wiretap’ Talk - The New York Times","Two senior White House officials suggested on Monday that President Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama had tapped his telephone was not meant to be taken literally, arguing that Mr. Trump had been referring more broadly to a variety of surveillance efforts during the 2016 campaign when he made the incendiary accusation. “He doesn’t really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. In fact, Mr. Spicer said, when Mr. Trump charged in a Twitter post last weekend that Mr. Obama “had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower,” he was referring generally to surveillance activities during the 2016 race  —   not to an actual telephone wiretap. “The president was very clear in his tweet that it was, you know, ‘wiretapping,’” Mr. Spicer said, using his fingers to make a gesture suggesting quotation marks. “That spans a whole host of surveillance types of options. ” Mr. Spicer said there have been “numerous reports from a variety of outlets over the last couple months that seemed to indicate that there has been different types of surveillance that occurred during the 2016 election. ” The remarks were the first time the White House sought to explain the accusation Mr. Trump made in a series of posts on Twitter saying Mr. Obama “was tapping my phones” and calling the former president a “bad (or sick) guy. ” The explanations came as the Justice Department asked the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee, who had given a Monday deadline to produce proof of Mr. Trump’s claim, for more time “to determine what if any responsive documents exist. ” Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, said in an interview on Sunday that Mr. Obama could have employed any number of devices other than a traditional telephone wiretap, even including a microwave oven. Ms. Conway clarified on Monday that she was not accusing the former president of snooping via a kitchen appliance, arguing that her comments had been taken out of context. “I’m not Inspector Gadget,” she said Monday on CNN. “I don’t believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign. ” But in an interview with a columnist for The Record of Bergen County, N. J. the day before, she said Mr. Obama’s alleged spying efforts against Mr. Trump could have been far more extensive than a telephone wiretap. “What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,” Ms. Conway told the paper. “You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets  —   any number of ways. ” Surveillance can even be carried out with “microwaves that turn into cameras,” she added. “We know this is a fact of modern life. ” The unusual and shifting explanations from Mr. Spicer and Ms. Conway reflected the contortions that members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle have employed to explain the president’s explosive accusation, which he has yet to address personally. Neither Mr. Trump nor anyone at the White House has presented any evidence for the claim, instead asking Congress to investigate it as part of its inquiry into Russia’s interference in the presidential election. Both the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee have requested that the Department of Justice provide evidence it may have for Mr. Trump’s charge, but Mr. Spicer said on Monday that the president had not instructed the department to furnish any. He suggested that Mr. Trump had relied on multiple news reports, including in The New York Times, to make his charge. “It is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now are wondering where the proof is,” Mr. Spicer said. The Times and other news outlets have reported extensively on surveillance in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, particularly related to Russia’s efforts to influence the election. But The Times has never reported that intelligence or   officials were themselves spying on Mr. Trump. What The Times and other news organizations have reported is that American intelligence agencies have communication intercepts that officials believe show contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russian officials during the campaign. Still, several   websites, including Infowars, which traffics in conspiracy theories and whose eccentric operator, Alex Jones, has interviewed Mr. Trump, have erroneously asserted that The Times and others had reported that the president was under surveillance. In a story dated March 6, Infowars cited a Jan. 19 article in The Times detailing how American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and Trump associates. “Flashback: NYT admits wiretaps used against Trump,” the headline read. The story noted that The Times “didn’t specifically mention that Trump himself, or Trump Tower, was bugged,” but the caveat has not stopped Mr. Trump’s supporters from insisting that The Times was a source for the president’s tweet. Ms. Conway told CNN that in her interview, she had not been referring to the president’s charges when she talked about microwave surveillance, nor could she offer any proof of his allegations. “I’m not in the job of having evidence,” she said. “That’s what investigations are for. ” Ms. Conway said she had never meant to imply that Mr. Obama had used a microwave to spy on Mr. Trump.",0

7173,"SpaceX Launches Rocket, Its First Since Explosion on Launchpad - The New York Times","VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.  —   A Falcon 9 rocket roared into the sky on Saturday carrying 10 communications satellites  —   a return by SpaceX and its billionaire leader, Elon Musk, to the business of launching satellites to orbit. But financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk’s   plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars. SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif. has been set back since September, when a different Falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in Florida, destroying the rocket and its payload, a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to lease to expand global internet services. The company’s rockets had been grounded since then. An internal investigation concluded that a failure of a helium vessel in the second stage liquid oxygen tank had led to the conflagration. The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial space launches, accepted SpaceX’s report on the explosion’s causes on Jan. 6 and issued a launch license, clearing the way for Saturday’s liftoff here, on the other side of the country. To prevent a recurrence, SpaceX adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium. Saturday’s countdown proceeded smoothly, with the liftoff occurring within a   window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current Iridium Communications satellites. The new satellites are more powerful than the original ones, which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes. SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named “Just Read the Instructions” in the Pacific. Less than 90 minutes later, mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed. Over the next 14 months, the company plans six additional Falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more Iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation. In the   the successful launch helps put SpaceX back on track. The explosion and subsequent   grounding created a backlog of launches, including cargo missions for NASA to the International Space Station. September’s explosion was SpaceX’s second failure in 15 months a Falcon 9 rocket carrying NASA cargo disintegrated in flight in June 2015. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX had lost $260 million in 2015 after the earlier accident, and revenue dropped 6 percent to $945 million. In earlier years, SpaceX officials including Mr. Musk described the company as consistently profitable that claim has been removed from SpaceX’s website. Company officials did not dispute the numbers reported in The Wall Street Journal article, but portrayed a rosy future. “Since 2002, we have been at the forefront of revolutionizing space technology, with a solid track record of success, strong customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts,” Bret Johnsen, SpaceX’s chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Furthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth. ” SpaceX hopes to launch its larger Falcon Heavy this spring. The Heavy, years behind schedule, would become the world’s most powerful rocket since NASA retired the Saturn 5 more than 40 years ago. SpaceX also plans to refly one of its recovered boosters this spring. By reusing instead of throwing away rocket boosters, SpaceX hopes to significantly reduce the cost of launches. Also on the schedule is an   abort test of SpaceX’s Dragon 2 capsule, a crucial safety prerequisite that it must conduct before the company can begin ferrying NASA astronauts to the space station next year. By applying Silicon Valley entrepreneurial practices to aerospace, SpaceX has undercut prices and disrupted the rocket launch business. That brought in many customers like Iridium, which is paying more than $450 million for the seven launches. The   bid from one of SpaceX’s competitors was $1. 2 billion, said Matthew J. Desch, Iridium’s chief executive. Without SpaceX’s lower costs, Iridium could not have afforded to replace its group of satellites, Mr. Desch said. “The Falcon 9 is perfect for what we want to do,” he said. But the lower costs make it difficult to see how SpaceX could earn enough profit to finance its grand ambitions. In September, Mr. Musk unveiled his vision for what he called the Interplanetary Transport System  —   a gigantic rocket with 42 engines that could take 100 passengers to Mars as early as 2024. SpaceX has described plans to offer satellite internet services with more than 4, 000 satellites. The forecasts described by The Wall Street Journal, which were produced in early 2016, show how much the company is depending on this new business. SpaceX projected that current rocket launching business would quintuple in revenue, to $5 billion, in 2025. Satellite internet services, still in the early planning stages, were projected to bring in more than $30 billion in revenue and generate the bulk of more than $20 billion in profit for the company. During the September announcement, Mr. Musk spoke of “a huge   partnership” to get to Mars, but did not describe what kind of partnership he foresaw. The incoming Trump administration has not outlined in detail its plans for NASA, although some of the  ’s advisers, including Newt Gingrich, are pushing for a greater reliance on commercial companies like SpaceX. Other Republicans, however, have been strong defenders of the Space Launch System, the big, expensive rocket that NASA is developing for a Mars mission.",0

7179,"Christopher Steele, Ex-Spy Who Compiled Trump Dossier, Goes to Ground - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence agent who prepared the dossier on Donald J. Trump’s supposed activities in Russia, has gone underground. The strange story of the dossier, which United States intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. Senator John McCain and many journalists have had for weeks, if not months, and which Mr. Trump presumably must have known about, appears to have had personal consequences for Mr. Steele. According to neighbors and news reports, Mr. Steele hurriedly left his home in Surrey, a county southwest of London, on Wednesday to avoid attention or possible retribution once his identity as the author of the dossier was revealed, first by The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that Mr. Steele had declined its interview requests because the subject was “too hot. ” Mr. Steele, 52, was a longstanding officer with MI6, the British equivalent of the C. I. A. serving in Paris and Moscow in the 1990s before retiring. In 2009, he started a private research firm, Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. with Christopher Burrows, now 58. Mr. Burrows has refused to confirm or deny that Mr. Steele and Orbis wrote the memos that made up the dossier, initially under contract to a Washington firm paid to dig into harmful matters from Mr. Trump’s past. Mr. Burrows’s profile page on LinkedIn describes him as a former counselor in the Foreign Office, with postings in Brussels and New Delhi in the early 2000s. Diplomatic postings are sometimes used to provide cover for intelligence agents. Mr. Steele’s profile on LinkedIn gives no specifics about his career. He is known in British intelligence circles for his knowledge of the intricate web of   companies and associates that control Russia. Mr. Steele, as a known former MI6 agent, was thought not to have gone to Russia in his investigations but to have used contacts inside and outside the country to prepare the dossier, which United States intelligence agencies have said they cannot substantiate. But the file was used to prepare a   appendix to the intelligence presentation American officials gave to Mr. Trump last Friday. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations in the dossier in the sharpest terms, and called them “fake news. ” Russia has denied that it holds any compromising material on Mr. Trump. John Sipher, who retired from the C. I. A. in 2014 after 28 years with the agency, described Mr. Steele as having a good reputation and “some credibility. ” Mr. Sipher was stationed in Moscow in the 1990s, and then ran the C. I. A. ’s Russia program for three years, according to an interview he gave to PBS NewsHour. He now works at CrossLead, a   technology company. “I have confidence that the F. B. I. is going to follow this through,” Mr. Sipher said. “My nervousness is that these kind of things are going to dribble and drabble out for the next several years and cause a real problem for this administration going forward. ” An investigator for a business research firm in London similar to Orbis, who knows the work of the company but who has met Mr. Steele only briefly, said he was not impressed by the dossier. “I have a lot of experience in this world,” he said. “If I were the client, I would throw it back and say, ‘Where’s the evidence guys? I can’t use this.’ ” The investigator, who asked for anonymity because he did not want to discuss publicly the work of a competitor, said that “all intel has to be caveated. ” “Maybe they went to a usually reliable source,” he added, “but there’s no explanation about the credibility of these sources. ” He continued, “Maybe sometimes sources want to tell the investigators what their clients want to hear. ” Referring to companies like Orbis and his own, he said: “Usually your job would be to stop clients from dealing with corrupt, questionable counterparts in a   country like Russia, but this same network could be put to use” to compile reports like the one on Mr. Trump. “There’s a risk that maybe the sources fed questionable intelligence, knowing that it would do more damage to Trump’s enemies than to Trump,” the investigator suggested. Orbis’s website says that it was “founded by former British intelligence professionals. ” Based in Grosvenor Gardens, near Victoria Station in London, the company says it has a “sophisticated investigative capability” and mounts “  operations” and “complex, often   investigations. ” According to the website, it also offers “  source reporting on business and politics at all levels,” and “draws on extensive experience at boardroom level in government, multilateral diplomacy and international business to develop bespoke solutions for clients. ” Mr. Steele and Orbis have previously investigated corruption at FIFA, the governing body of world soccer. In October, David Corn of Mother Jones magazine wrote about the dossier and described his conversations with Mr. Steele, whom he did not identify by name or nationality. According to the British newspaper The Telegraph, a friend of Mr. Steele’s said that after his name and nationality were revealed, he had become “terrified for his and his family’s safety. ” Mr. Steele’s wife and children also were not at home.",0
7180,Pro-Palestinian Propaganda Lowering Standards of Truth in America,"Pro-Palestinian Propaganda Lowering Standards of Truth in America Manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere. October 28, 2016 
Reprinted from IsraelNationalNews.com . 
Commendably, organized American Jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott, de-legitimize, and sanction Israel. However, focusing primarily on Israel, and not also on America and Europe, is short-sighted. 
The BDS campaign has not devastated Israel economically. Israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliances—but fifty years of a well-funded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed Israel's good name and has rendered her and Jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic, academic, and mob attacks. 
It has also lowered the standards for truth among Americans. This is a very important point. 
An Islamic-style of Jew hatred has merged with Western, politically correct anti-racism to breed an unnatural passion for ""Palestinians,"" (Fakestinians), which has infiltrated every corner, every crevice of our lives and world. It has infected Americans and Europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class, race, and ethnicity. 
This is utterly astounding, amazing really; something like this does not happen overnight. 
The BDS campaign is rooted in the Arab League, PLO, and Soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s, the UN proposed its infamous Zionism=Racism resolution. 
In 1967, the day after Israel won yet another war of self-defense, Israel--not the Arab aggressors--was seen as the alleged ""occupier."" 
By the late 1970’s, Edward Said's treacherous, lying work had begun to have its way with Western academics, (and with Western-style academics in Israel), European governments, and international organizations. 
I only realized how successful his campaign was in 1980, when Israel was demonized at a UN conference on Women in Copenhagen. The Soviets, the Iranians, the Arab League, the PLO-- roamed the hallways chanting ""Death to Israel;"" European feminists called upon ""Palestinian"" refugees but refused to hear Jewish-Israeli refugees from Arab and Muslim countries. By 2001, the UN World Conference Against Racism in Durban was an even more out-of-control Hate Fest and riot against Israel. 
As we approach 2017, UN Resolutions against Israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque. UNESCO’s recent decision to De-Judaize Jerusalem, the Western Wall, and the First and Second Temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend. At the same time, pro-Israel professors and students in America are increasingly being harassed, even fired. 
Such Lies have infiltrated my private social world. For example: At a recent holiday dinner, our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism, no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink. 
A like-minded gathering, yes? Not exactly. One man, a genial, well-heeled, well-educated Jewish-American suddenly began hectoring us about the ""Palestinians."" ""What if they did not hate the Jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize Jews and Israelis? What if they were peaceful? Wouldn't we have to admit that Palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own? You can't deny that the Palestinian people have always lived there, can you?"" Oh my. Where to start? The company included two author-scholars who, between them, have published 15 books and thousands of articles, many of them dealing with the history and nature of Islam, tribal gender and religious apartheid, Israel, and anti-Semitism, etc. Among us was a third author, who had also served four tours of duty in the IDF. I held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table. This man was punching way above his pay grade and I could not understand why. 
The two author-scholars presented facts, cited statistics. I pulled down book after book from my shelves. We got nowhere. ""Look,"" he said. ""I have some really good Muslim friends, they're Americans, totally Westernized, they are Palestinians. They strongly feel that this is their identity. Why deny them the identity of their choice?"" And then I understood that the pro-Palestinian/anti-Zionist propaganda behind the relentless BDS campaign is successful precisely because so many Americans of all ages, are without knowledge; without respect for knowledge; do not know this; and frankly, don't care. 
""Fair is fair,"" he said. In other words: What's good for the Jews has to be good for everyone else. If not, the Jews don't deserve whatever it is either. 
Here's a man who's not an anti-Semite or an anti-Zionist; not an active member of any organization--yet who needs to believe the canard that non-Jewish ""Palestinians"" have always existed; or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than 1948, the year that another stateless people--the Jews--chose a national sovereign identity. 
He would not listen to reason. It was quite astounding. How is this possible? 
His mind-set is part of our ruling American zeitgeist. If Rachel Dolezal can say she's ""black"" even when she's ""white"" and direct a chapter of the NAACP; if a man can say that he's really a woman, trapped in a man's body; if all truth(s) are ""relative;"" if everything is ""subjective;"" if objectivity is no longer important; if doctored narratives have supplanted fact-based histories; if revisionism is preferred to truth--then, yes, anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they ""feel"" or ""believe"" that they do. 
I am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such, is a great enemy; that educated people have been especially vulnerable to False Ideas; that, psychologically speaking, we must approach them as if they've been brainwashed by a cult. 
Facts alone will not work. We must consider all known techniques for de-programming. 
This is one of our greatest challenges.",0
7181,"An Evolving Sports City, Atlanta Chases a Championship - The New York Times","ATLANTA  —   The most arresting vista in town comes into view around a curve on westbound Freedom Parkway, on the periphery of downtown. The road crests just before it intersects Boulevard, at a traffic light that always seems to glow red, as if to allow motorists a minute to savor the panorama before them. The striking thing is not the majesty of the skyline but its accessibility  —   here I am, the city beckons, come and gawk. For from that vantage point, Atlanta just is: a   mecca, the cradle of the civil rights movement, a magnet for transplants, a college football locus, the shimmering capital of the South, and more. All of which are accurate but still do not capture the city’s nuances. “I don’t think people understand Atlanta,” Doug Hertz said. Aside from his schooling at Tulane, in New Orleans, Hertz, 64, has lived here his entire life, which makes him a rarity. The city teems with people who moved here for work, school, family, or just to live nearer to the spinach and sausage meatloaf at Murphy’s. They have contributed to a booming growth  —   the metropolitan area’s diverse population has swelled to more than 5. 7 million, an increase of more than 1. 46 million since 2000  —   that over the past few decades has also shaped Atlanta’s layered relationship with its sports teams. Hertz is a limited partner of the Falcons, who on Sunday will play the New England Patriots in the team’s second Super Bowl appearance since its inception in 1966. They last reached the championship game in the 1998 season, losing to the Denver Broncos, when I was a freshman at Emory University here and, more to the point, was one of those people Hertz was talking about, struggling to understand Atlanta. That September, I joined surprising brigades of Philadelphia Eagles fans invading the Georgia Dome for the Falcons’ home opener. Not even three weeks later, a group of us arrived at Turner Field, maybe two hours before Game 1 of the Atlanta Braves’ baseball playoff series against the Chicago Cubs, and still managed to buy tickets. Six of them. In the same row. My frame of reference was Philadelphia, whose zealous fans in analogous circumstances would never accept such apathy. Season after season, the Braves won their division, destroying the Phillies, and this is how their fans responded? “Are we as rabid and overtly   like Boston or New York? No, we could be better,” Gavin Godfrey, a native Atlanta journalist who chronicles culture and sports  said over lunch in Castleberry Hill, a historic arts district by the Georgia Dome. “But that doesn’t mean we don’t care, and not every town has to be held to that standard. Not every city’s built the same. ” In the Northeast, for instance, with a deep and abiding sports culture that spans generations, and in some cases centuries, there is less competition for sports fans’ loyalty. The emotional connection with college football, for instance, is not as strong as it is with some professional sports. For years, the opposite has been  —   and to a degree, still is  —   true of Atlanta, where on autumn Saturdays fans pack bars and living rooms, or flee for Georgia, Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, South Carolina, Tennessee, all within a   drive. “Most of us, that D. N. A. is not there for professional sports franchises,” Hertz said. The Falcons have built a base of loyalists  —   the City Council president, Ceasar Mitchell, said he drove down to Miami for the Falcons’ last Super Bowl appearance despite not having a ticket  —   but so struggled to pack the Dome that home games were not shown on local television because of the N. F. L. ’s old blackout rule. The team’s middling history has also failed to entice the local residents and persuade the newcomers to come out. The arrival of the quarterback Michael Vick, in 2001, mirrored the city’s spirit at the time  —   ascending, vibrant and   forward  —   and his downfall, for his involvement in an interstate dogfighting ring, created tension, on a racial and cultural level, that lingered for years. Vick’s successor, Matt Ryan, is his antithesis in nearly every possible way  —   be it race, playing style, pedigree or personality. “Some of our fans will always be proud that an   quarterback succeeded,” Hertz said. “What I think has happened over a period of time is a growing appreciation and acceptance in Matt Ryan, and that his style is every bit as spectacular on and off the field. ” The city’s evolution, coupled with an effort by the owner of the Falcons, Arthur Blank, to promote a sense of community around the team, has strengthened its bond with the Falcons. Since 2012, when the Falcons lost in the conference championship game, the Georgia Dome, which seats 71, 250, has achieved at least 98 percent of its   capacity every year. This season’s mark of 98. 2 percent, 15th among the 32 teams and the lowest since 2011, bested that of, among others, the venues for the Giants, Jets, Chiefs and Patriots. As the Braves bolt northwest for a new stadium in Cobb County, a move that has left many fans feeling betrayed, the Falcons remain moored to Atlanta. Next season they move into a new home,   Stadium. “There’s something about the nature of fans here that makes them take pride,” said Molly Slavin, 29, who moved here in 2012 from Illinois. “Although it might not be in a way that translates to sports fandom as seen in other cities. ” Ryan Cameron, 47, an Atlanta radio personality and a   holder since 1998, explained that phenomenon like this: “There are people who will fight you about these Falcons,” he said. “But we’re not trying to prove to you that we’re so crazy. For us, it’s just being loud. We don’t have to brag. It’s Southern charm. ” Still, Atlanta’s gentility, a core virtue, would give way to utter delirium on Sunday  —   and for weeks and months thereafter  —   if the Falcons were to win. This city has been teased before, by those Braves behemoths of the ’90s, by the Falcons in 1998, even by the Hawks, who went   two seasons ago before losing in the conference finals. Counting the futility of its two departed N. H. L. franchises, the Flames and Thrashers, Atlanta can claim only one championship  —   Braves, 1995  —   across a combined 167 completed seasons. Pellom McDaniels, who played the final two of his eight N. F. L. seasons with the Falcons, suggested that a victory would register a psychological impact  —   an acknowledgment of the city’s trajectory, from aspirational to   and mature. During the 1996 Olympics, and in the years that followed, Atlanta seemed eager to convince others that it was cosmopolitan, sophisticated, worth exploring. Even as it grapples with its identity now, reckoning with gentrification and redevelopment forces that are at once eroding and improving neighborhoods, Atlanta projects a different image  —   of comfort and confidence in its direction, whatever that is. “It would be almost like a beacon,” said McDaniels, now the curator of   collections at Emory, said of a potential title. “That we’re working together as a community, and the success the Falcons have experienced is our success  —   that we’re doing something right. ” The term Mitchell used was runway, a point of departure for a nascent sports city that has added a Major League Soccer franchise set to begin play next season. The Falcons are thriving, interest is soaring, and from Mitchell’s perspective, he sure likes the view.",0
7182,"Light Pillars, a Million-Mirror Optical Illusion on Winter Nights - The New York Times","Don’t worry. It’s totally natural. There’s no mother ship hovering above the earth, waiting to carry you away, and no demon shooting light from beneath, signaling to pull you below. It’s a light pillar  —   or a few of them  —   a colorful column of sparkling light that appears to beam up toward the sky. It’s all just an icy illusion. And now, during winter, when nights are long and cold, you have a good chance to spot one as long as conditions are right. If you’re lucky enough to spot a light pillar, what you’re seeing is actually artificial light from a ground source reflecting off millions of floating ice crystals. “It’s not an upward beam of light,” said Les Cowley, a physicist who runs a website on atmospheric optics, or the way light travels through the atmosphere. “Although they look pretty, they’re also a sign that someone, somewhere could do better with their lighting. You might call them light pollution pillars if you wanted to be environmental about it. ” Light pillars occur when   clouds  —   normally miles high in the atmosphere  —   cling closer to the Earth’s surface, just a hundred or a few thousand feet above it. These thin clouds contain millions of flat, hexagonal crystals of ice that float horizontally in the air Each ice crystal acts like a mirror pointed downward, reflecting the artificial light back to your eyes  —   as long as the cloud is about halfway between you and the light source. Together, the crystals form a cluster of mirrors floating at different heights, which allows you to see the light as a column if they all were at the same level, you’d see only a spot of light. The pillars can be quite colorful at times because each reflected beam is the same color as its source. To find a good source  —   one bright, close to the ground, and just far enough away  —   your best bet is to travel a few miles outside your city or town on a dark night. The weather doesn’t have to be frigid, but it helps. Light pillars are frequently spotted in Scandinavia, upstate New York, Canada and other cold spots in the winter. But Dr. Cowley said that this week he received a photo of light pillars from about 30 miles outside of a town in Iran  —   perhaps because the desert can get cold at night. If leaving the city is not an option, look up at streetlights on a freezing cold night. You may spot the sparkly, ghostly blur of diamond dust. This illusion is created by the same flat ice crystals that produce light pillars, but this time, they’re so low to the ground you can feel them prickling your skin. “When that happens, you see other nearby halos, and it’s quite a spectacular sight,” Dr. Cowley said.",0
7183,Beyoncé Unearths Pain and Lets It Flow in ‘Lemonade’ - The New York Times,"Let’s see. Last thing she remembered was their beautiful bodies grinding up in that club. Drunk  —   as she sang in 2013 of a gritty tryst with her husband  —   in love. Oh well. On Saturday night, Beyoncé walked the streets of a soundstage with a baseball bat, treating parked cars and police surveillance cameras like piñatas, “jealous and crazy,” but in an elaborate   dress fit for Fat Tuesday. It didn’t feel any more disjunctive than seeing Suzanne Lenglen rush the net in a   dress in say, 1916. Except the woman at this net also has a bone to pick with her spouse, Jay Z. This was “Lemonade,” a “visual album” and array of salvos, which tells the story of woman in a marriage she didn’t know was bad, until, of course, she knew. Beyoncé, and HBO, were shrewd about keeping a lid on what this thing was going to be. Based on the only available image  —   someone in cornrows, face disguised by a big fur coat  —   I assumed drag queen prison drama. But it was bolder and deeper and more uncomfortable than anything I could have predicted. “Lemonade” is less a dramatization than a daydream, infused with black magic, embracing  —   if only notionally  —   African tribalism, science fiction, menstruation and witchcraft. The music’s emotional odyssey is conjugal. (The song chapters are presented as stages  —   “intuition,” “denial,” “forgiveness,” “hope,” etc.) Most of the corresponding images commune with the psyche and with history. The Deep South  —   New Orleans, mostly  —   occupies the landscape. Throughout, black women are standing, sitting, phalanxed on the porches of what feel like plantations and antiquated houses, rich with pain. The cameras get in close on beautiful faces that lack pigment, that bear scars, burns and sorrow. The mothers of slain young men exude regal stoicism, holding photographs of their sons. Visually, “Lemonade” invokes a lot  —   Madonna’s “La Isla Bonita,” “Carrie,” “Beasts of the Southern Wild” and the   at the end of Michael Jackson’s “Black or White. ” But what its   spiritualism calls to mind is “Daughters of the Dust,” Julie Dash’s landmark tone poem from 1991, loosely  —   very loosely  —   about three generations, descended from slavery, and their migration north in 1902. The juicy immediacy of “Lemonade” is what this one man did to this one woman. Not far in, Beyoncé looks tearfully into the camera and, with her own song playing around her (“I pray you catch me,” she sings to a higher power) lets herself fall from a roof. The street below becomes a body of water. It complements the submerged churning all over the soundtrack. It has the effect of a leviathan astir. That interlude with a baseball bat begins with Beyoncé, in that yellow dress, throwing open the enormous doors of an old,   building and a deluge pouring out. “Are you cheating on me?” she asks in the running offscreen narration that’s credited to the young   poet Warsan Shire. It’s like something out of Toni Morrison. The water on her rage just broke. “Ring the alarm,” Beyoncé once sang of being   before enumerating the stuff of hers this other woman would never touch. On a different occasion, she sang: “To the left, to the left. Everything you own in the box to the left. ” That all feels pedestrian now. Beyoncé’s prized possessions here are her trust, love and dignity. But she’s daring to think beyond herself. The heavy hangover of the piece involves what lots of men have done to lots of women, black women in particular. Between songs, we hear Malcolm X intone that no one has had it rougher than they have. Think about what it takes to make lemonade. You have to split open a lot of citrus, remove the seeds, strain for pulp and add a lot of sugar. It’s a process. Black women are good at lemonade. I watched this thing in a state of exhilarated shock. At first, I thought: How is this not a work of pretentious  ? How isn’t this the mistake of the year? This is a woman who, in 2011, seemed incapable of gauging both the marketplace and what it wanted from her. She couldn’t choose a good single from her uniformly superb album “4. ” The surprise release of “Beyoncé,” at the end of 2013, was a major course correction. It cratered the Internet in a way that seemed to unify a   pop universe. Carnal, reflective, almost platitude free: It was the best and most creatively adventurous of her albums. The arrival of that record, the debut of a video for “Formation” last Super Bowl eve and the premiere of “Lemonade” have put her atop the      complex in a way that rivals Madonna, Janet and Michael Jackson. “Lemonade” has all of the formal coherence that kept “Formation” from being as good a video as it was a cultural bombshell. Its seven credited directors  —   Jonas Akerlund, Kahlil Joseph, Melina Matsoukas, Dikayl Rimmasch, Mark Romanek, Todd Tourso and Beyoncé  —   give this project texture, mystery and life. Restraint, too. The only memorable dancing is by the world’s greatest living female athlete: Serena Williams, a tennis player. And all of that opacity  —   the sense from her previous special that no matter how much Beyoncé talks, she isn’t telling you anything? That doesn’t exist here. Feelings gush like water. The piece opens with Beyoncé kneeling on a stage, a curtain behind her. She’s getting out in front of the drama. Her so doing puts everybody in a compromising position. Beyoncé and Jay Z have made room for a different third party: us. Last week, HBO showed “Confirmation,” which   a different fight between a black woman and a black man. In one corner, Anita Hill in the other, Clarence Thomas. It was never a fair fight. He manages to wrest all the power from her side of the story. “Lemonade” feels like a cultural rebuke on behalf of lots of aching women, whether they’re standing on that plantation porch, watching from their living rooms, or running for president. The queasiest part of “Drunk in Love” comes when Jay Z raps, “Eat the cake, Anna Mae,” invoking a diner scene from “What’s Love Got to Do With It” when Ike (using Tina’s birth name) shoves dessert in her face. Is “Lemonade” a rebuke of that, too? Why not? Any wife who outs her husband on an album and in an hourlong video as a cheater, then makes him release that album on his streaming platform  —   exclusively  —   is having her cake and making him eat it, too. That feels only partially triumphant since we’re left in a moral murk. He might be paying for his sins. But we’re still paying him.",0

7185,Ann Coulter: Swamp People: 47 Trump: 0,"If this is the budget deal we get when Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency, there’s no point in ever voting for a Republican again. [Not only is there no funding for a wall, but  —   thanks to the deft negotiating skills of House Speaker Paul Ryan  —   the bill actually prohibits money from being spent on a wall.  At a CYA press conference on Tuesday, Trump’s ridiculously chipper budget director, Mick Mulvaney, described the bill’s prohibition on building a wall as a MAJOR win. (At least Mulvaney said it in English, unlike his   2014 townhall.) True, there will be no wall. But the Democrats graciously agreed to allow the administration to fix broken parts of any existing fences on up to 40 miles of our 3, 000 mile border. The other big wins, according to Mulvaney, are: 1) more defense spending, which is fantastic news, because I was worried Boeing and Lockheed Martin CEOs were falling behind Mark Zuckerberg with their gluttonous salaries and, 2) school choice, an obsession of Washington wonks that is hated out in America, where parents move to   towns for the express purpose of avoiding schools full of disaffected urban youth, and the disaffected urban youth don’t want to spend two hours on a bus every day. But Mulvaney assures us that this monstrosity of a spending bill has set things up beautifully for the next budget negotiation in October. That has become the GOP’s official motto: “Next time!” We can never win this time. Instead, Republicans’ idea is always to surrender this time, in hopes that their gentlemanliness will be rewarded by their mortal enemies next time. Then, next time comes, and Republicans again surrender in hopes of currying favor with the Democrats and the media for the next time. Mulvaney’s most disturbing comment was to say that what upset Trump the most was the Democrats’ “spiking the football” on this deal. Apparently, Trump’s fine with no wall  —   and everything else in a bill straight out of George Soros’ dream journal  —   if only the Democrats hadn’t been so rude as to tell the public about it. When your main complaint is that the other side is gloating too much, maybe you’re not that great a negotiator. Yeah, sure, it’s only 100 days in, it’s an artificial deadline, the media is dying to say Trump has failed and so on. Except: Planning for the wall should have begun on Nov. 9, and a spade should have been put into the earth to begin building it the day after Trump’s inauguration. Now, it’s 100 days later, and we still don’t have the whisper of a prospect of a wall. Moreover, this isn’t one random bill funding Planned Parenthood (which this bill does). This is the budget deal. There won’t be another one like it until next October. That’s a spectacular failure. Democrats have got to be pinching themselves, thinking, Am I dreaming this? It’s theoretically possible that Trump could still build a wall, but he’s just massively lengthened the odds of ever prevailing. Sure, you can let the other team build a   lead in first half and still come back to beat them, but it’s a lot easier if you don’t go into halftime 20 points down. Trump entered the presidency with the only kind of power that matters. He didn’t owe Wall Street a thing. He didn’t owe anyone  —   not donors, lobbyists nor any political party. What he had was the people, passionately on his side. But as soon as he got into office, Trump started giving away his miraculous, unprecedented power. Hey, Wall Street! Even though you didn’t give me any money, is it too late to be your friend? No amount of abandoning his supporters will get Trump anywhere with Wall Street, Hollywood or the media. Their ferocity will simply shift to ridicule. Admittedly, Trump has the enormous handicap of having to work through congressional Republicans, who are feckless cowards. If Speaker Ryan and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell had been around for Reagan’s firing of the air traffic controllers, they would have been hysterically screaming, No! You can’t do that  —   the planes will crash! This isn’t new information. We knew Washington Republicans were useless. That’s why we elected such a comically improbable president as Donald J. Trump. The deal was that we were getting the Hollywood version of a New York businessman: an uncouth, incurious rube  —   who would be ruthless in getting whatever he wanted. In addition to being the only candidate for president in either party taking America’s side on trade, immigration, jobs and crime, what set Trump apart was his promise that we would finally win. Remember? There would be so much winning, we were going to get “sick and tired of winning,” and beg him, “Please, please, we can’t win anymore.   …     It’s too much. It’s not fair to everybody else. ” We’re not winning. We’re losing, and we’re losing on the central promise of Trump’s campaign. How would Trump, the businessman, react if an underling charged with developing a new golf course could never break ground? What if the subordinate’s progress reports sounded like this: I have given 21 speeches to various chambers of commerce and neighborhood groups, assuring them that there’s going to be a golf course. Everywhere I go, I say, “Don’t worry about it. It’s going to be built!” I have started a commission to study developing a golf course. I have put up a sign saying, “Golf course coming!” And I have caved, and caved, and caved  —   so now our opponents know what good guys we are. Trump would fire that employee so fast your head would spin. We want the ruthless businessman we were promised.",0
7186,Judge Presses Prosecutors on ‘Rough Ride’ in Death of Freddie Gray - The New York Times,"BALTIMORE  —   A judge here on Monday asked pointed questions of prosecutors who are seeking to prove that the death of Freddie Gray, the black man who died of a spinal injury while in police custody, was   murder, underscoring the difficulties for a team that has already tried two officers on other charges without getting a conviction. “The state said to the world it was a rough ride,” Judge Barry G. Williams of Baltimore City Circuit Court said as he pressed a prosecutor, Michael Schatzow, to explain whether his team had proved that Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. showed willful disregard for Mr. Gray’s life by driving a police van dangerously through West Baltimore on a sunny April morning last year. Monday’s closing arguments wrapped up a trial that has conjured vastly different pictures of Mr. Gray’s ride in the police van and the exact timing of the injury, and left prosecutors treading carefully around the “rough ride,” once a central piece of their case. “When I said rough ride, I didn’t talk about driving 100 miles per hour,” Mr. Schatzow told the judge, who will render a decision on Thursday. “I said he wasn’t secured for the conditions in which the defendant drove. ” There were other questions. Could Mr. Gray have suffered his injuries in an accident? Was there evidence of elevated speed? And what, specifically, had Officer Goodson, who is also black, done to risk Mr. Gray’s life? Mr. Schatzow said that Officer Goodson, 46, knew Mr. Gray was shackled, handcuffed but not seatbelted that the officer made a wide right turn and an unannounced stop and that he then failed to get medical care. “The intent is to bang him around,” Mr. Schatzow said. “The consequences to the prisoner were worse than what he anticipated. ” Officer Goodson’s lawyer, Matthew Fraling, argued that the officer did not intentionally endanger Mr. Gray. Instead, “Mr. Gray created a high degree of risk by removing himself from the prone position in which he had been placed to secure his transport,” Mr. Fraling said, dismaying some activists watching in the courtroom. Most days, Officer Goodson, a   veteran of the Police Department, came to court in a suit with a gold tie clip and sat quietly without expression. He did not testify in his defense. His fate is now in the hands of Judge Williams. The death of Mr. Gray, 25, set off violent protest, looting and arson here and put the city at the center of the national debate over race, policing and the use of force. The city’s top prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, charged six officers with Mr. Gray’s arrest and death, and she reserved the steepest charge  —     “depraved heart” murder  —   for Officer Goodson. He faces six other charges, three of which are counts of manslaughter. The first trial, of Officer William G. Porter, ended with a hung jury in December. The second trial, of Officer Edward M. Nero, ended in an acquittal in May. Mr. Gray was arrested on April 12, 2015, after fleeing officers in the Sandtown neighborhood. He was eventually loaded, shackled and handcuffed, onto the floor of Officer Goodson’s police wagon, which made several stops before it arrived at the Western District police station, where Mr. Gray was found unresponsive. His neck was broken and his spinal cord compressed he died a week later. Prosecutors introduced the rough ride theory during their opening statements, but it ran into hurdles when one of their witnesses said he had not seen the van make abrupt starts, stops or turns in his review of the evidence. Another witness, a policing expert, said he could not say whether a rough ride had occurred. In delivering her closing argument, a prosecutor, Jan Bledsoe, argued that Mr. Gray was injured between the second and fourth of six stops. She focused on what she said was Officer Goodson’s duty to place a seatbelt on Mr. Gray and to seek medical attention after he asked for it at the van’s fourth stop. “Officer Goodson never calls for a medic. He never takes Freddie Gray to the hospital,” Ms. Bledsoe said. But she did not use the term “rough ride,” and Mr. Fraling argued in his closing argument that prosecutors had tried to reshuffle their case when the evidence did not cut their way. Officer Goodson was justified in not putting a seatbelt on Mr. Gray because he had been “combative,” Mr. Fraling said, although Judge Williams questioned whether the officer had a duty to reassess such a characterization over the course of the ride. “At no point in time did he present as being in medical distress or in need of medical treatment,” Mr. Fraling said of Mr. Gray. He added that Mr. Gray was injured between the fifth and sixth stops of the ride and that medical help was immediately summoned when Mr. Gray was discovered unconscious at the sixth stop. David Jaros, an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore, said the case had raised important questions about policing in the city. “I think it’s a mistake for people to focus entirely on whether or not there’s a criminal conviction here,” Professor Jaros said, “rather than on whether or not we have ample proof of serious problems with police in Baltimore that require that we explore: How are we going to prevent these in the future?”",0
7187,Trump vs. the REAL Nuts—the GOP/ “Uniparty” Establishment,"  => Credit: VDare.com. 
A couple of remarks in Professor Susan McWillams’ recent Modern Age piece celebrating the 25th anniversary of Christopher Lasch’s 1991 book The True and Only Heaven , which analyzed the cult of progress in its American manifestation, have stuck in my mind. Here’s the first one: 
In the most recent American National Election Studies survey, only 19 percent of Americans agreed with the idea that the government, “is run for the benefit of all the people.” [ The True and Only Lasch: On The True and Only Heaven, 25 Years Later , Fall 2016] 
McWilliams adds a footnote to that: The 19 percent figure is from 2012, she says. Then she tells us that in 1964, 64 percent of Americans agreed with the same statement. 
Wow. You have to think that those two numbers, from 64 percent down to 19 percent in two generations, tell us something important and disturbing about our political life. 
Second McWilliams quote: 
In 2016 if you type the words “Democrats and Republicans” or “Republicans and Democrats” into Google, the algorithms predict your next words will be “are the same”. 
I just tried this, and she’s right. 
These guesses are of course based on the frequency with which complete sentences show up all over the internet. 
An awful lot of people out there think we live in a one-party state—that we’re ruled by what is coming to be called the “Uniparty.” 
There is a dawning realization, ever more widespread among ordinary Americans, that our national politics is not Left versus Right or Republican versus Democrat; it’s we the people versus the politicians. 
Which leads me to a different lady commentator: Peggy Noonan, in her October 20th Wall Street Journal column. 
The title of Peggy’s piece was: Imagine a Sane Donald Trump . [ Alternate link ]Its gravamen: Donald Trump has shown up the Republican Party Establishment as totally out of touch with their base, which is good; but that he’s bat-poop crazy, which is bad. If a sane Donald Trump had done the good thing, the showing-up, we’d be on course to a major beneficial correction in our national politics. 
It’s a good clever piece. A couple of months ago on Radio Derb I offered up one and a half cheers for Peggy, who gets a lot right in spite of being a longtime Establishment Insider. So it was here. Sample of what she got right last week: 
Mr. Trump’s great historical role was to reveal to the Republican Party what half of its own base really thinks about the big issues. The party’s leaders didn’t know! They were shocked, so much that they indulged in sheer denial and made believe it wasn’t happening. 
The party’s leaders accept more or less open borders and like big trade deals. Half the base does not! It is longtime GOP doctrine to cut entitlement spending. Half the base doesn’t want to, not right now! Republican leaders have what might be called assertive foreign-policy impulses. When Mr. Trump insulted George W. Bush and nation-building and said he’d opposed the Iraq invasion, the crowds, taking him at his word, cheered. He was, as they say, declaring that he didn’t want to invade the world and invite the world. Not only did half the base cheer him, at least half the remaining half joined in when the primaries ended. ORDER IT NOW 
I’ll just pause to note Peggy’s use of Steve Sailer’ s great encapsulation of Bush-style NeoConnery: “Invade the world, invite the world.” Either Peggy’s been reading Steve on the sly, or she’s read my book We Are Doomed , which borrows that phrase. I credited Steve with it, though, so in either case she knows its provenance, and should likewise have credited Steve. 
End of pause. OK, so Peggy got some things right there. She got a lot wrong, though 
Start with the notion that Trump is crazy. He’s a nut, she says, five times. His brain is “a TV funhouse.” 
Well, Trump has some colorful quirks of personality, to be sure, as we all do. But he’s no nut. A nut can’t be as successful in business as Trump has been. 
I spent 32 years as an employee or contractor, mostly in private businesses but for two years in a government department. Private businesses are intensely rational, as human affairs go—much more rational than government departments. The price of irrationality in business is immediate and plainly financial. Sanity-wise, Trump is a better bet than most people in high government positions. 
Sure, politicians talk a good rational game. They present as sober and thoughtful on the Sunday morning shows. 
Look at the stuff they believe, though. Was it rational to respond to the collapse of the U.S.S.R. by moving NATO right up to Russia’s borders? Was it rational to expect that post-Saddam Iraq would turn into a constitutional democracy? Was it rational to order insurance companies to sell healthcare policies to people who are already sick? Was the Vietnam War a rational enterprise? Was it rational to respond to the 9/11 attacks by massively increasing Muslim immigration? 
Make your own list. 
Donald Trump displays good healthy patriotic instincts. I’ll take that, with the personality quirks and all, over some earnest, careful, sober-sided guy whose head contains fantasies of putting the world to rights, or flooding our country with unassimilable foreigners. 
I’d add the point, made by many commentators, that belongs under the general heading: “You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but it helps.” If Donald Trump was not so very different from run-of-the-mill politicians—which I suspect is a big part of what Peggy means by calling him a nut—would he have entered into the political adventure he’s on? 
Thor Heyerdahl sailed across the Pacific on a hand-built wooden raft to prove a point, which is not the kind of thing your average ethnographer would do. Was he crazy? No, he wasn’t. It was only that some feature of his personality drove him to use that way to prove the point he hoped to prove. 
And then there is Peggy’s assertion that the Republican Party’s leaders didn’t know that half the party’s base were at odds with them. 
Did they really not? Didn’t they get a clue when the GOP lost in 2012, mainly because millions of Republican voters didn’t turn out for Mitt Romney? Didn’t they, come to think of it, get the glimmering of a clue back in 1996, when Pat Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary? 
Pat Buchanan is in fact a living counter-argument to Peggy’s thesis—the “sane Donald Trump” that she claims would win the hearts of GOP managers. Pat is Trump without the personality quirks. How has the Republican Party treated him ? ORDER IT NOW 
Our own Brad Griffin , here at VDARE.com on October 24th, offered a couple more “sane Donald Trumps”: Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee. How did they fare with the GOP Establishment? 
Donald Trump is no nut. If he were a nut, he would not have amassed the fortune he has, nor nurtured the capable and affectionate family he has. 
Probably he’s less well-informed about the world than the average pol. I doubt he could tell you what the capital of Burkina Faso is. 
That’s secondary, though. A President has people to look up that stuff for him. 
The question that’s been asked more than any other about Donald Trump is not, pace Peggy Noonan, “Is he nuts?” but, “ Is he conservative? ” 
I’m sure he is. But my definition of “conservative” is temperamental, not political. My touchstone here is the sketch of the conservative temperament given to us by the English political philosopher Michael Oakeshott : 
To be conservative, then, is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to utopian bliss. 
Rationalism in Politics and other essays (1962) 
That fits Trump better than it fits any liberal you can think of—better also than many senior Republicans. For example, it was one of George W. Bush’s senior associates—probably Karl Rove—who scoffed at opponents of Bush’s delusional foreign policy as “the reality-based community.” It would be hard to think of a more un -Oakeshottian turn of phrase. 
Trump has all the right instincts. And he’s had the guts and courage—and, just as important, the money —to do a thing that has badly needed doing for twenty years: to smash the power of the real nuts in the GOP Establishment. 
I thank him for that, and look forward to his Presidency. (Reprinted from VDare.com  ",0
7188,"Podesta in Leaked E-mail: ""Dump Those Emails""","Date: 2015-03-08 15:49 Subject: Fwd: Lanny Davis We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can't believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV. On March 4, 2015, two days after the e-mail in which Podesta wrote, “we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later,” the House Select Committee on Benghazi subpoenaed Clinton demanding “any and all documents and communications in your possession, and/or sent from or received by the email adresses [sic] ‘ ,’ ‘ ,’ or any other email adress [sic] or communications device used by you or another on your behalf, referring or relating to” the committee’s investigation into Benghazi. The subpoena specifically demanded all such “communications” “for the time period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.” Clinton — in a possible move to buy more time to “dump all those emails” — falsely claimed that she had not been subpoenaed. The committee responded by making the subpoena public. Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy wrote, “I would not make this [subpoena] public now, but after Secretary Clinton falsely claimed the committee did not subpoena her, I have no choice in order to correct the inaccuracy.” The press release , dated July 18, 2015 says, in part: “The committee has issued several subpoenas, but I have not sought to make them public,"" said committee Chairman Trey Gowdy. “I would not make this one public now, but after Secretary Clinton falsely claimed the committee did not subpoena her, I have no choice in order to correct the inaccuracy. The committee immediately subpoenaed Clinton personally after learning the full extent of her unusual email arrangement with herself, and would have done so earlier if the State Department or Clinton had been forthcoming that State did not maintain custody of her records and only Secretary Clinton herself had her records when Congress first requested them.” “The fact remains, despite when this subpoena was issued, Secretary Clinton had a statutory duty to preserve records from her entire time in office, and she had a legal duty to cooperate with and tell the truth to congressional investigators requesting her records going back to September of 2012. Yet despite direct congressional inquiry, she refused to inform the public of her unusual email arrangement. This information only came to light because of a Select Committee request, not a voluntary decision to turn over records almost two years after leaving office, records which always should have been in State’s custody."" ""Moreover, the timing of the Secretary's decision to delete and attempt to permanently destroy emails is curious at best. The Secretary left office in February of 2013. By her own admission she did not delete or destroy emails until the fall of 2014, well after this Committee had been actively engaged in securing her emails from the Department of State. For 20 months, it was not too burdensome or cumbersome for the Secretary to house records on her personal server but mysteriously in the fall of 2014 she decided to delete and attempt to permanently destroy those same records."" The press release contains a link to the actual subpoena . As the press release makes clear, “By her own admission” Hillary Clinton “did not delete or destroy emails until the fall of 2014.” What is left unclear is this: If those e-mails had already been deleted (as she claimed), then what e-mails was Podesta referring to when he said they were “going to have to dump” them “sooner” rather than “later”? And if the e-mails had been deleted in 2014, why did Hillary have her server wiped using BleachBit before turning it over to investigators? It is hopeful that two things will happen following this most recent disclosure. The first is that this will find its way into the newly reopened investigation into Clinton’s use of the private, unsecured server. The second is that WikiLeaks will release additional pieces of the puzzle to clarify what is still unclear. With less than a week left until the election, it is likely to be an exciting few days.

7191,FBI Director Comey Sent Letter To Staff All But Admitting He Botched The Email Announcement,"  
Hey, we’ve all been there. You make a judgment call at work, it blows up in your face and you go home humiliated and stewing. Only in James Comey’s case, you’re the director of the FBI, and you may have just wrongfully influenced the presidential election with a single baffling mistake. “Whoops” doesn’t cover it. 
Comey set off a firestorm of controversy with the release of an open letter to Congress, letting them know that the FBI would be “reopening” the case into Hillary Clinton’s emails, despite clearing her of any wrongdoing several months ago. Republicans handled the news with something approaching orgasmic ecstasy. Finally , they thought, Hillary Clinton is going down and Trump’s double digit polling deficit can be erased . 
Trump himself seemed to believe this letter was the key to victory. Less than an hour after it was spread around the internet, Trump was boldly claiming it to be “bigger than Watergate”– a statement as ludicrous as it was premature. 
Within two hours, the entire new story fell apart. The emails were not sent by Hillary Clinton. They were not stored on her private server. They appeared to contain no incriminating information. Despite the lack of any story, the media ran with it. Republican hacks like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan were breathlessly demanding Clinton lose her right to classified briefings. Trump’s campaign manager was taking a victory lap. Conservatives were saying this proved Clinton was a crook. 
All of it was nonsense. And nobody seemed to realize how crazy this reaction was than Comey himself, who reportedly sent a second letter that day, this time to his staff, basically saying “I fucked up. I’m so sorry.” FBI Dir. Comey sent a second letter today – to FBI employees. He seems to have some doubts about what he did (via WashPost) pic.twitter.com/IagFJRZYyU 
— West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) October 29, 2016 
Comey seemed to understand what many critics had been saying all day: This email announcement was misleading and pointless, and gave Republicans a ton of free ammunition in their disingenuous fight against Hillary Clinton. It’s unclear just how much it would affect the election, but the very fact that it could affect the election was a serious issue. The FBI, as a rule, is not supposed to use their department to sway voters. Comey, whether intentionally or not, was doing just that. 
The fact that Comey had these misgivings and still sent his first letter raises serious questions about his judgment. As a lifelong Republican (albeit one who has distinguished himself as a man of strong integrity with respect on both sides of the aisle), one has to wonder if he would have been so flippant in publishing a letter that would wrongfully damage the campaign of a Republican candidate. 
Ironically, it is the question raised around Comey which seem more pressing for the national interest than a few new emails found on a computer not used by Hillary Clinton. Let’s hope we get some answers.

7192,Potential N.C.A.A. Bracket Busters. You’ve Been Warned. - The New York Times,"The key to winning your N. C. A. A. tournament pool is identifying and picking some teams to knock off   opponents. The tournament is often volatile, so with that in mind, here are a few surprises to consider as you fill out your brackets: Why It Will Happen: Heading into Friday night, Oregon was a trendy pick as a possible No. 1 seed. But all that changed when Chris Boucher, who led the   in blocks, tore his anterior cruciate ligament against Cal. A tight loss to Arizona in the tournament championship a day later only added to the emotional toll. The Ducks’ shallow depth will be tested against the   Gaels, who had seven different players score 20 points or more this season. This is Iona’s fourth N. C. A. A. tournament appearance since 2012, and Coach Tim Cluess will finally notch his first win. Why It Might Not: Iona is   this season when it hits at least 10   in a game, but Oregon is 23rd in the nation at defending against the 3. The Ducks will shake off the sorrow of losing Boucher and ride the experience of Dylan Ennis, Tyler Dorsey and Dillon Brooks to get them over the hump.  : Kavell   averages only 9. 7 minutes per game, but he is going to be thrust into a much more prominent role now that Boucher is out. A junior from London, he played soccer until age 15, then took up basketball. Now he is a key figure in Oregon’s N. C. A. A. tournament hopes. Why It Will Happen: It sounds obnoxious to say in so many ways, but the Ivy League is very good. Of the last 10 league champions, four won their first N. C. A. A. tournament games  —   in which they were always    —   and one lost by 2. And none were as hot as Princeton, which ran the Ivy League table and then, in the   Ancient Eight tournament, beat Penn at the Palestra. Why It Might Not: Notre Dame is a   favorite, sure, but it is also extremely well coached and fundamentally sound in addition to the ordinary thing where they are much more talented than the scrappy Ivy squad.  : Princeton needs to sink its 3s. Princeton’s . 381   percentage is barely above milquetoast, but they lean on the shot, scoring nearly half their points through it. At the very least, Princeton must make the Irish take the 3 away, opening up some of those backdoor cuts the Tigers are so famous for. Why It Will Happen: Giddy Potts is back. So are six other players from last year’s Cinderella team, which knocked off No. 2 seed Michigan State in one of the most stunning tournament upsets in history. There is a reason Middle Tennessee State has been consistently receiving votes in the Top 25 poll for weeks. Coach Kermit Davis again has his team playing as one of the toughest defensively in the nation, and Minnesota was   this season when they scored fewer than 70 points. The Gophers were never expected to be this good after going   a year ago. Their remarkable season ends early. Why It Might Not: Minnesota can defend, too. Coach Richard Pitino, like his father, Rick, loves a   brand of basketball, and the Gophers are led inside by the Big Ten defensive player of the year Reggie Lynch (3. 47 blocks per game). Middle Tennessee State is also missing one key element from last season: the surprise factor.  : The Blue Raiders’ senior Reggie Upshaw is one of only three active players with 1, 000 points, 500 rebounds, 200 assists, 100 steals and 100 blocks in his career. The    forward scored 21 points vs. Michigan State and will be a handful again. Why It Will Happen: What happens when fast meets slow? We are about to find out. Nobody suffocates a game better than Tony Bennett’s Virginia team, which this season, per KenPom. com, has the most efficient defense and averages the slowest games in Division I. Less than a month ago, they beat North Carolina, which boasts one of the best offenses,  . But U. N. C.  likes to play fast and score a lot. The Seahawks amassed 100 or more points seven times this season, including against William  Mary in the Colonial Athletic Association semifinals. Even if the Seahawks are not able to maintain their typical pace against the Cavaliers, limiting possessions tends to neutralize talent disparities  —   which may be part of why even Bennett’s excellent squads have disappointed in March. Why It Might Not: There is a substantial talent disparity to be neutralized. Virginia finished sixth in the   Atlantic Coast Conference this season. U. N. C.  played one other N. C. A. A. tournament team  —   Middle Tennessee State  —   and lost.  : Get on the glass. Virginia is among the best in the country at limiting offensive rebounds. The Seahawks’ Devontae Cacok averages nearly 10 rebounds per game in just over 25 minutes. Play him, and camp him out. Why It Will Happen: South Carolina was seeded higher than even Coach Frank Martin expected, considering that the Gamecocks have lost six of their last nine games. Balanced Marquette (five players average   scoring) spreads the floor and is one of the most efficient offensive teams in the country. In fact, their   percentage, 43. 1, is the nation’s best  —   led by freshman Markus Howard’s 54. 9 percent shooting from beyond the arc. The last time another Marquette team averaged more than 80 points a game for an entire season was 1971. That team went to the round of 16, and this one could, too. Why It Might Not: This will essentially be a home game for South Carolina, with the game being played in Greenville, S. C. The crowd will energize one of the nation’s staunchest defensive teams, which forces more than 17 turnovers per game, fifth most nationally. South Carolina will take the air out of the ball and hope Marquette goes cold.  : Marquette’s Andrew Rowsey, the Big East’s sixth man of the year, will have the ball in his hands at the end of the game. His 93. 3 percent shooting from the   line is third in the country. Why It Will Happen: Bad seeding. Florida State has some great A. C. C. wins, but the Seminoles were   playing away from home. Meanwhile, the Atlantic Sun champion played No. 3 Baylor close and No. 9 Michigan State really close  —   both on the road  —   and lost just two conference games. Add in that magnetic March mojo that pulls close teams even closer together, and the Eagles are an excellent candidate for an upset in Orlando, which is a solid 100 miles closer to Fort Myers than Tallahassee. Why It Might Not: Florida State recruits nearly as well in basketball as it does in football. From a pure talent perspective, the Seminoles should be able to run the Eagles right off the court. X Factor: The Eagles need to slow it down. A slow pace is more to their liking, but especially against Florida State’s   athletes a track meet will leave them in the dust. Why It Will Happen: You can start poking at Kansas’s résumé more easily than is typical of a second overall team. Their average margin of victory, 10. 3 points, is 29th in Division I (its fellow No. 1 seeds are all in the top 10). And Kansas is coming off a loss to a team that did not even make the tournament. Why It Won’t Happen: I mean . .. it won’t happen.  : In Kansas’s last loss, they were without the superstar freshman Josh Jackson, who was suspended for a game after he reportedly backed into a parked car and failed to leave a note, and then did not tell his coach about it. Jackson will be back, but will the team  —   which has plenty more potential   issues where that came from  —   continue to be distracted?",0

Follow him @paulcallan (CNN) Donald Trump’s oft-repeated claim that the FBI’s investigation of “Crooked Hillary” and the presidential election itself were and are “rigged,” seems to have thrown FBI Director James Comey into a state of panic. In foolishly making a public announcement that the bureau is reviewing newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton’s personal server, he has inserted himself yet again into the presidential campaign. The FBI virtually never announces the commencement or termination of ongoing criminal investigations or the discovery of new evidence. Such inquiries are often conducted in relative secrecy, enabling a more efficient investigation. The old, sensible FBI rule book apparently has been thrown on the trash heap this year.

7194,Exclusive—NFL Great Burgess Owens: The Left Destroyed Strong Black Communities - Breitbart,"A member of the   Oakland Raiders Super Bowl winning team told Breitbart News at the Conservative Political Action Conference that it is time for   to reclaim their traditional conservatism. [“Today’s generation has been trained to think differently from my generation. We would stand for the flag in a heartbeat —  because we realized the opportunities we had,” said Burgess Owens on Thursday.  Owens was an   safety at the University of Miami, who was drafted by the New York Jets in 1973 and played for the Jets until joining the Raiders for their run at Super Bowl XV. Owens was at CPAC to discuss with people his new book “Liberalism or How to Turn Good Men into Whiners, Weenies and Wimps” and attend a book signing. “Today’s generation came from BET group —  the BET has been talking down our country for the longest time. ” Black Entertainment Television is the top cable channel focused on the   community. Today’s young   have been twisted up by BET, he said. “They tend to be more racist. They tend to be more ” he said. “I was the third black American to be recruited by the University of Miami and I remember going down there —  my goal was not to fail,” he said. “That was really what allowed our community to think,” he said. “We didn’t want to leave our families down. We didn’t want to let our race down. We would work as hard as we could, so we would not fail. ” Owens said that when he was coming of age in the late 1960s, there was always a racial consciousness that was trying to break through and disrupt the traditional ways of life. In those times in his hometown of Tallahassee, Florida, the black community was stronger than most other communities, black or white, he said. “The community as that time was totally committed to the family,” he said. “We had the highest percentage of men committed to marriage. We had the fastest growing   in the country. ” Conservatism, with its emphasis on work, entrepreneurship, and faith traditions, is a natural fit for   but somehow the narrative got switched up. Owens said he wrote his book because   politics and policies have destroyed thriving black communities, but no one else seemed to want to talk about it. “Back in 1910, the NAACP, started by 21 white Marxist, socialist, atheist Democrats, began to intertwine the thought of liberalism into my community,” he said. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is the most prominent of the civil rights organizations. “We started to pull away from the pillars that always made our country great and towards being and feeling like victims,” he said. “They taught our race that the real value was in being with the white race, instead of what we were doing at the time,” the father of six said. “I would say to a young   man: Recognize who you are, let’s  . Take the rolls you are supposed to take. Take care of your family. Respect women —  big time —  and we will be a great country again,” he said. His message to white Americans: “Don’t apologize anymore for who they are. We have a great society with great ancestors, who did their best. ”",0

There were no processed foods, no genetically modified organisms, no chemical pesticides, no toxic vaccines loaded with mercury and aluminum, no over-the-counter medications loaded with artificial food dyes and heavy metal toxins, no artificial sweeteners, no fluoride in the tap water, no leaking nuclear reactors, and of course, there were no insidious oncologists giving people lethal chemical drugs (chemotherapy) to fight off cell disorder (cancer) that's caused by chemical consumption in the first place.None of that was going on, because the American Medical Association had yet to figure out that if all mainstream medicine was simply made of chemicals, everybody who got sick would stay sick, and the medicine industry would become one of the biggest money makers in the history of the world.Yes, that was the time of amazing indigenous medicine , when natural healers were doing wonders for sick folks using natural remedies . And when people did get sick, they took medicine that had worked for millennia, not some lab-concocted chemicals that crooked science journals swore would work.

7198,ЕАЭС – новая сила в АТР | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: Азиатско-Тихоокеанский регион 5 октября 2016 г. вступило в силу Соглашение о зоне свободной торговли между Социалистической Республикой Вьетнам (СРВ) и Евразийским экономическим союзом (ЕАЭС). Оно было подписано главами правительств СРВ и всех стран ЕАЭС – Армении, Белоруссии, Казахстана, Киргизии и России в мае 2015 г., однако вступить в силу смогло лишь после ратификации парламентами указанных стран. Уже много лет ЕАЭС активно торгует с Вьетнамом. Только за 2010-2014 гг. объем торговли увеличился более чем на 60%, превысив $4 млрд. Создание ЗСТ – закономерный итог этого сотрудничества. По прогнозам Евразийской комиссии, оно может привести к более чем двукратному росту товарооборота к 2020 г., причем не менее 80% объема придется на Россию. Совокупное население ЕАЭС – 183 млн человек, а общий объем ВВП превышает $2 трлн. Льготный доступ на такой обширный рынок – это, несомненно, большой успех для вьетнамской экономики. ЕАЭС также не в обиде: ведь население СРВ превышает 95 млн человек, а ВВП составляет $192 млрд. По данным за последние годы, экономика страны стремительно развивается. Таким образом, Соглашение о ЗСТ весьма выгодно обеим сторонам. В соответствии с документом, в ближайшее десятилетие большую часть товаров как СРВ, так и ЕАЭС ожидает полное или частичное освобождение от ввозных таможенных пошлин, что должно привести к снижению их стоимости и быстрому развитию торговли. Кроме того, в Соглашении уделяется внимание защите интеллектуальной собственности, сотрудничеству в сфере электронной коммерции и в области государственных закупок. Также оговариваются вопросы защиты конкуренции. Помимо импорта и экспорта, договор о ЗСТ облегчит взаимные инвестиции. Вьетнамское руководство видит большое будущее в отношении торгового партнерства как с ЕАЭС, так и непосредственно с Россией. По данным 2016 г., российско-вьетнамский товарооборот достигает $3,7 млрд. Ожидается, что к 2020 г. благодаря созданию ЗСТ он может превысить $10 млрд. Помимо положений, общих для всех участвующих стран, Соглашение о ЗСТ изначально включало разделы, касающиеся только СРВ и России. В них оговариваются дополнительные условия, облегчающие торговлю, инвестиции и перемещения физических лиц между двумя странами. После подписания Соглашения начал действовать российско-вьетнамский «Межправительственный протокол о поддержке производства моторных транспортных средств на территории Социалистической Республики Вьетнам». Этот документ был подписан в марте 2016 г. вьетнамским министром промышленности и торговли Ву Хи Хоангом во время визита в Россию. С российской стороны протокол подписал Д. Мантуров, министр промышленности и торговли РФ. В соответствии с документом, в СРВ будут созданы совместные предприятия вьетнамских фирм с российскими компаниями «Группа ГАЗ», «КамАЗ», «Соллерс», которые будут производить различные виды автомобильной техники. Заключение договора о свободной торговле с Вьетнамом – приятное событие для ЕАЭС и для России в частности. Однако его значение больше, чем просто приобретение хорошего торгового партнера. Можно сказать, что это выход российской экономики на новый уровень, ведь раньше у РФ не было подобных соглашений со странами дальнего зарубежья. Кроме того, это начало масштабного продвижения ЕАЭС и России в Азиатско-Тихоокеанском регионе. С самого своего появления в 2015 г. ЕАЭС пытается наладить торговые связи со странами АТР. Как известно, Вьетнам – важный член Ассоциации стран Юго-Восточной Азии, которая объединяет многие государства АТР. Не исключено, что ЗСТ с Вьетнамом – это шаг на пути к созданию ЗСТ со всеми странами-участницами АСЕАН. Многие члены АСЕАН благосклонно относятся к такой идее. Переговоры уже ведутся с Индонезией, Королевством Камбоджа, Малайзией и Сингапуром. Кроме того, рассматриваются возможности создания ЗСТ с государствами АТР, не входящими в АСЕАН, такими как Индия, Китай, Новая Зеландия. Так что, можно сказать, что позиции ЕАЭС в АТР постепенно укрепляются. Еще одним подтверждением этого стало заявление Монголии о желании присоединиться к ЕАЭС, сделанное в ноябре 2016 г. На первый взгляд может показаться, что приход ЕАЭС в АТР приведет к конкуренции с Китаем, который сейчас, на фоне ослабления США, является одним из главных игроков в регионе. Однако на самом деле рост влияния ЕАЭС скорее выгоден Поднебесной. Как известно, наиболее заметный процесс в АТР в наше время – противостояние между Китаем и США. Экономическое и политическое влияние США в регионе заметно ослабло в последние годы, однако оно по-прежнему велико. Америка по мере сил старается сохранить свое могущество, притянуть на свою сторону как можно больше стран. Так, в феврале 2016 г. было подписано соглашение о создании Транстихоокеанского партнерства (ТТП). В ТТП вошли Австралия, Бруней, Вьетнам, Канада, Малайзия, Мексика, Новая Зеландия, Перу, Сингапур, США, Чили и Япония. Все эти страны объединила зона свободной торговли и ряд общих правил. Несомненно, с таким союзом конкурировать сложно, ведь на долю стран-участниц Партнерства приходится около 30% мировой торговли. При этом сейчас ведутся переговоры о создании ТТИП – Трансатлантического торгового и инвестиционного партнерства, в которое США хотят вовлечь Евросоюз. Вероятность, что эти переговоры увенчаются успехом, невелика: проект слишком невыгоден для Европы. Однако если это все же случится, то по обеим сторонам Евразии могут возникнуть крупные и богатые экономические объединения, на долю которых придется около 80% мировой торговли. При этом каждое из них будет контролироваться США. В этой связи страны, вошедшие в состав ТТП и ТТИП, могут значительно снизить объемы торговли со всем остальным миром, в том числе и с КНР, которая является сейчас крупнейшим торговым партнером многих из них. Более того, ставится под удар один из главных проектов Китая, на который он возлагает огромные надежды – «Новый Шелковый путь», который должен соединить Европу и Азию и сам стать со временем зоной свободной торговли. Несомненно, такое развитие событий не может устроить ни КНР, ни множество других стран Евразии и АТР. Чтобы успешно конкурировать с ТТП и ТТИП, страны ЕАЭС и АТР должны приложить как можно больше усилий к взаимной интеграции. Объединившись Россия, Китай, Индия, АСЕАН и Центральная Азия смогут не опасаться никаких конкурентов. Однако многие государства, не желающие сотрудничать с США, опасаются мощного и экспансивного Китая. Это препятствует объединению региона. Возможно, появление третьей силы, такой, как ЕАЭС, станет для них выходом и поможет наладить успешное сотрудничество.

7199,The Iraqi Christians Who Are Struggling to Survive After Isis,"Here's   
In the half-burned church of St Mary al-Tahira in Qaraqosh, several dozen Syriac Catholics are holding a mass in Aramaic amid the wreckage left by Isis . The upper part of the stone columns and the nave are scorched black by fire and the only artificial light comes from three or four candles flickering on an improvised altar. Isis fighters used the courtyard outside as a firing range and metal targets set at one end of it are riddled with bullets. 
In his sermon, the Syriac Catholic Bishop of Baghdad Yusuf Abba calls for the congregation to show cooperation and goodwill to all. But the people of Qaraqosh, an overwhelmingly Christian town 20 miles south east of Mosul , wonder just how much goodwill and cooperation they can expect in return. . 
The Christians are still traumatised by the disasters of the last two-and-a-half years. When Isis took Qaraqosh on 8 August 2014 it had a population of 44,000, almost all Syriac Catholics, who fled for their lives to Irbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Regional Government. Some 40 per cent of these have since migrated further to countries like Australia and France or, within the Middle East, to Istanbul and Lebanon. 
But the 28,000 people from Qaraqosh who stayed inside Iraq have understandable doubts about going home, even if Isis is fully defeated and loses Mosul. “There is no security while Isis is still in Mosul,” says Yohanna Towara, a farmer, teacher and community leader in the town, but even when Isis is gone the Christians will be vulnerable. He says that “the priority is for us to control our local affairs and to know who will rule the area in which we live.” He adds that the need for permanent security outweighs the need to repair the destruction wrought primarily by Isis but also by US-led air strikes. 
This destruction is bad enough, though it is not total. Isis fighters set fire to many ordinary houses in addition to the churches in the days before they left, but – possibly because there was no furniture left to burn since it all had been looted – most of these houses look as if they could be made habitable after extensive repairs. It will take time because not only has the furniture gone, but cookers and fridges so, even if light fittings or taps are still in place, there is no water or electricity. 
Isis did not fight for Qaraqosh and there are no booby traps or improvised explosive devices. But they must at one time have thought of doing so because they dug networks of tunnels in the nearby Christian village of Karemlash as if they intended to wage an underground guerrilla war against the Iraqi army. In the event, there are few signs of Isis resistance, except the rather pathetic remains of burned out tyres which they set fire to in order to create a smoke haze to impede the visibility of the aircraft of the US-led coalition. There were not many air strikes, but where they did take place the results devastated whole buildings reducing them to heaps of rubble. 
Visiting Qaraqosh from Irbil 40 miles away, it is easy to understand why people displaced from Qaraqosh and in the rest of the Nineveh Plain feel insecure and dubious about returning to their old homes, even where they are still standing. They know that if they do they will be at the mercy of Arab and Kurdish authorities eager to fill the vacuum left by the fall of Isis and wishing to stake new claims to territory and power. 
Arriving at a Kurdish Peshmerga checkpoint on the main road from the Kurdish region to Mosul at 9am, we make our way through crowds of people originally from Qaraqosh waiting to pass through. “See how they are treating people,” says a critical Christian observer. “People have been waiting here since 5 or 6am, but the Peshmerga say they need a senior officer to give permission for them to pass.” 
After another two Peshmerga checkpoints, we reach an Iraqi army checkpoint with whom the Christians have better relations. The Nineveh Plain east of Mosul was home to a mosaic of minorities and its abandoned villages show various levels of destruction, depending on their sectarian and ethnic complexion. For instance, some had once contained Sunni and Shia Shabak (a heterodox sect speaking a dialect of Kurdish), but Isis had destroyed the houses of the Shia but left the Sunni. 
Closer to Qaraqosh the checkpoints are manned by soldiers of the Iraqi Army and local Christian members of the Nineveh Protection Units (NPU) with their multi-coloured red, white and blue flags. Relations between the NPU and the army appear good, but the soldiers are Shia and at one checkpoint they had laid out a table and were serving sweet tea and biscuits as part of the Shia Arbaeen commemoration. The diversity of officially-sanctioned armed groups appears never-ending: at some checkpoints there were also visible the dark uniforms of federal police, whom locals say are recruited from the Shabak and Turkmen communities. 
Fear of Isis had united diverse groupings and communities, but that unity is showing signs of fraying. The Peshmerga are excluded from fighting inside Mosul city, but are building a rampart and ditch to denote their front line. The Kurds may be pleased to see Isis defeated in Mosul, but if it is defeated by a reconstituted and effective Iraqi army – very different from the large but ill-commanded and corrupt army that fled from Isis in 2014 – then the balance of power in northern Iraq will change against the Kurds. 
The outcome of the war all over Iraq and Syria has ensured that minorities that were once spread throughout the two countries, now only feel secure if they can rule their own territory. But in Iraq the Christians do not have the numbers to defend themselves. (Reprinted from The Independent by permission of author or representative)",0
7200,Global Migration Meets Magic in Mohsin Hamid’s Timely Novel - The New York Times,"In an unnamed,   city in the Muslim world, two young lovers face a wrenching choice. They can stay in their barricaded apartment as their country descends into sectarian bloodshed and chaos, or entrust their lives and fortunes to a human smuggler who promises to spirit them to safety through a magic portal in an abandoned dentist’s office. The couple choose the mysterious doorway and are instantly transported to a Greek island, where they find themselves among hundreds of other desperate refugees. With its surreal premise, “Exit West,” an acclaimed new novel by Mohsin Hamid, might feel hallucinatory and distant had it arrived at a different moment. Instead, the novel  —   which fuses magical realism with a harrowingly vivid story of global migration and displacement  —   feels ominously relevant. Mr. Hamid, a cultural chameleon and polyglot who was born in Pakistan and spent more than half his life in the United States and London, didn’t intend to write a dystopian parable about the current refugee crisis. When he began working on “Exit West” four years ago, he started with an abstract idea: a global network of passageways that circumvent borders, allowing migrants to immediately cross oceans and continents and erasing the already porous barriers between nations and cultures. “The idea of these doors, which I feel already exist, unlocked the form of this novel,” Mr. Hamid, 45, said in a Skype interview from his home in Lahore, Pakistan. “I wanted to write a very large book about the entire world on a very small scale, so I needed to find some way of covering a lot of ground. ” Mr. Hamid’s literary profile has been growing ever since he dazzled critics with his 2000 debut novel, “Moth Smoke,” which explored the lives of   Pakistani youth and was a finalist for the   Award. Since then, his three novels have collectively sold a million copies and been translated into 35 languages. But “Exit West” is likely to draw a much broader audience, and seems poised to become one of this year’s most significant literary works. To meet demand from booksellers, Mr. Hamid’s publisher, Riverhead, had already ordered four printings before the book’s release on Tuesday. Prominent novelists like Zadie Smith, Michael Chabon, Joyce Carol Oates and Kiran Desai have praised the novel as an urgent and essential story, particularly at a moment when immigrants and Muslims have been demonized. Mr. Hamid, who lived in the United States for 17 years and describes himself as “culturally and emotionally at least half American,” said the last few months have left him frightened and depressed. He wonders whether he will still feel welcome in an America that appears increasingly hostile to foreigners and Muslims. His native country, where he is raising his two young children, has suffered a wave of terrorist attacks by the Islamic State and the Taliban. The world seems to be veering toward the upheaval and entrenched polarization that Mr. Hamid envisioned in the novel. He never imagined “Exit West” would become so grimly prescient, with the crisis in Syria displacing millions, and nationalist movements gaining ground in the West. He started writing the story long before rising nativist sentiment led to ‘Brexit’ and Donald J. Trump signed executive orders targeting illegal immigrants and barring refugees from entering the country. “The basic impulse, this growing need for so many people to move because of political calamity and environmental catastrophe, and the rise of nativism and tribalism  —   those things were quite clearly happening,” he said. “While I hadn’t imagined we’d be where we are now, I guess I’m not surprised. ” But while “Exit West” seems like a dark reflection of our tumultuous times, Mr. Hamid said the novel grew out of a hopeful impulse. “What if we look at a very difficult future  —   can we still find hope and beauty and love and things that we want?” he said. “For me, this is not a novel about dystopia actually it’s about looking for signs of hope and optimism in the future. ” The novel represents bold new territory for Mr. Hamid, whose earlier works, including “The Reluctant Fundamentalist” and “How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia,” were formally innovative and experimental but firmly grounded in reality. “I’ve tried to abide by the laws of physics up until now,” he said. He drew inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges, and from children’s literature, one of his favorite genres. He grew up devouring books by J . R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, and lately has been reading Harry Potter to his    daughter. The spare prose in “Exit West” feels almost biblical at times. The magic doors give the story a mythical sweep, as the refugee couple, Nadia and Saeed, escape to Mykonos, then London, then finally the Bay Area, encountering angry nationalist mobs but also benefiting from the unexpected generosity of strangers. Mr. Chabon said that the surreal elements of the novel allowed Mr. Hamid to write about the refugee experience in ways that “few writers would have the courage or chutzpah to get to. ” “What makes this book special is that it takes on a subject that a lot of readers are going to wish they could avert their eyes from,” he said. “Magical realism is about getting you to look at something with fresh eyes and see something marvelous in the everyday, and there’s something radical about treating the refugee experience as something with the potential to be marvelous. ” Like his protagonists, Mr. Hamid has spent much of his life feeling displaced, rootless and alienated. “Grappling with movement, and the wrenching and painful nature of that, has been very central to my life,” he said. Born in Lahore in 1971, Mr. Hamid moved at age 3 to Northern California, where his father was studying for a Ph. D. at Stanford. A chatty child, he suddenly found himself cut off from language, unable to communicate with other children. He assimilated, only to be uprooted again at 9, when his family returned to Pakistan. By then, he had forgotten how to speak Urdu, his first language. “When I was younger I used to imagine I was some kind of a freak, I’m not really anything,” he said. “I became a very good chameleon. ” At 18, he returned to the United States to attend Princeton, where he took writing workshops with Ms. Oates and Toni Morrison. Ms. Oates recalled him as “quietly well spoken, though forceful in his critiques of others’ work. ” He later went to Harvard Law School, and continued to write fiction, working on a draft of “Moth Smoke. ” He worked as a consultant at McKinsey  Company in New York, and convinced the company to give him three to four months off a year to write. He later moved to London, where he met his wife, a classically trained singer and musician who is also from Lahore. After the birth of their daughter, Mr. Hamid felt a pang of homesickness, and convinced his wife to move back to Lahore to be near their parents. (He is a dual citizen of Pakistan and Britain.) “I remember him saying, ‘I have to go back, it’s a waste of happiness to be away from them,’” said the filmmaker Mira Nair, who directed a film adaptation of “The Reluctant Fundamentalist. ” Mr. Hamid has lived in Lahore for the past seven years. He writes while his two children are at school  —   pacing around his office and reading passages out loud  —   and works as a consultant for the branding agency Wolff Olins. His wife runs a restaurant. He’s deeply attached to Lahore. But Mr. Hamid feels conflicted about whether he belongs there. “The life of a writer is more fraught here than it might be in other places,” he said. Sometimes, he considers leaving again, but worries about the emotional toll on his family. “It’s not so easy to pick up and leave,” he said. “As is the case in the novel, leaving home is an emotionally violent act. ”",0
7201,"School Principal Dresses Up as Trump For Halloween, Triggers Parents","We Are Change 
A Virginia principal has outraged humorless parents after he and his secretary dressed up like Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton — with the former First Lady in an orange prison jumpsuit.
The well-executed costumes were worn by Robert E. Lee High School’s Principal Mark Rowicki — who dressed as Trump, and the school’s secretary Stephanie Corbett — who dressed as Clinton. A photo of the duo was posted to the school’s website in a playful album of costumes worn by students and staff.
Principal Mark Rowicki and secretary Stephanie Corbet
Political figures have long been fodder for satirical Halloween costumes, and Clinton masks with the orange jumpsuits were an extremely popular choice this year — as the holiday falls just before the election. On the other side of the political aisle, many people dressed as cats with “don’t grab my p*ssy” signs, “bad hombres,” or “nasty women.”
After the photos were posted, a parent reportedly complained about the “politically charged costumes” on Facebook, leading to the photos being removed from the website.
“I don’t care who you are or are not voting for. You are professionals, who work with children. Some more impressionable then others. The fact that any school official would think it’s okay to dress like this leaves me appalled and floored,” Emberly Lynn Martin, who has two daughters, wrote on a Facebook post, WTVR reports. “What message are you sending to any of them when their high school principal dresses up like a man who wants to deport them, says things like “she’s a nasty woman”, or “grab em by the p—–?”
Judging by the last portion of her comment, it isn’t the fact that the school administration dressed up in politically relevant costumes, but rather the fact that they appear to support a candidate that she doesn’t.
Outrage over Halloween was once associated with the religious right — but these days, complaints about the holiday from liberals are as predictable as trick or treaters. Nearly every costume can be deemed offensive by someone, and colleges have even offered counseling for students upset over what peers are wearing for this year’s celebrations.
Though its arguable about whether or not it was necessary, Principal Rowicki has apologized to anyone he may have offended.
“It is a longstanding tradition of Staunton City Schools—and of many school divisions across the United States—to allow students and staff to engage in festive activities and dress in costume for Halloween,” Dr. Linda Reviea, Superintendent of Staunton City Schools said in a statement on the school’s website . “That said, the particular costumes worn by two employees at R.E. Lee High School were in poor judgment, given the current political climate and the extraordinarily strong sentiments for the 2016 presidential candidates. I became aware of the situation on Tuesday night and instructed our staff to remove the images in question from Lee High School’s website today (Nov. 2). We are handling the situation as a personnel matter and addressing the issue with relevant staff.”
It is unclear if Rowicki or Corbett were disciplined over the harmless costumes.

7202,"Scuba, Parrots, Yoga: Veterans Embrace Alternative Therapies for PTSD - The New York Times","ATLANTA  —   Thomas Harris slid into the cool, salty water of a 6.   tank at the Georgia Aquarium here and let himself float limp as kelp. Mr. Harris, a former Army medic, gazed through a diving mask at a manta ray the size of a hang glider doing slow somersaults above shifting schools of silver fish. A   whale shark brushed silently by, inches from his face, its broad, spotted back taking up his entire view. Immersed in the moment, he forgot about the world. This is not a weekend hobby. It is part of his therapy for the   stress disorder he has been grappling with after his tours in Iraq. And like Mr. Harris, more veterans are turning to these sorts of    treatment. The broad acceptance of PTSD after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has posed an unexpected challenge. Acknowledging PTSD has only spurred a   debate over the best way to treat it. Traditional medical approaches generally rely on drugs and controlled   of trauma, called exposure therapy. But this combination has proved so unpopular that many veterans quit before finishing or avoid it altogether. This has given rise to hundreds of small nonprofits across the country that offer alternatives: therapeutic fishing, rafting and backpacking trips, horse riding, combat yoga, dogs, art collectives, dolphin swims, sweat lodge vision quests and parrot husbandry centers, among many, many others. A decade ago, mainstream psychiatry often dismissed these therapies. But now, as new studies suggest that things like yoga and interacting with animals can be as beneficial as drugs in reducing depression and anxiety without side effects or stigma, a growing number of psychotherapists are building them into treatment plans. It is not hard to find veterans who had bad experiences with traditional treatment. Mike Hilliard, the dive master who leads swims in the Georgia Aquarium’s huge tank, fought depression and anger after two combat tours, including a stint in Iraq in which he was shot in the head. “Treatment had always been someone telling me I was dysfunctional and giving me a bunch of pills. I became more withdrawn to the point where I was considering ending it all,” said Mr. Hilliard, a former Army sergeant. He repeatedly dropped out of care, and found nothing that really helped until he tried scuba diving. “As soon as I was underwater, everything went quiet. Seeing the fish, hearing the ocean  —   there is a complete innocence about it. There are no bad memories in the water. Everything just wants to live. It made me want to live again. ” He now guides groups sent by the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs on a similar journey in the aquarium several times a week. “It’s not just a ‘thank you for your service’ thing,” he told a group on a recent morning, moments before plunging in with the sea life. “This is a real tool you can use to rebuild your life. ” The crush of veterans seeking treatment beyond drugs and exposure therapy has pushed psychologists to try to scientifically evaluate programs that were once largely dismissed as field trips. But many psychiatrists are troubled by a lack of hard evidence supporting alternative therapies. “Interest has just exploded,” Lt. Col. Gary Wynn, a psychiatrist who teaches at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, the military’s medical school. “I work with the V. A. and the military. There is no one who thinks this is just silly alternative medicine stuff anymore. ” But, he cautioned, evidence of real benefit is in many cases still often slim or nonexistent, in part because of a lack of funding for studies, and in part because alternative therapies are harder to assess than drugs. “If I’m studying the benefits of fly fishing, do I control for the number of fish people caught? Or for the weather?” he said. “There is still a lot of work to be done on this. ” PTSD was not formally recognized until 1980. In the relatively young field, people are still figuring out the best ways to treat it, said Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, a   psychiatrist and a   author, who helped get the disorder recognized. The consensus seems to be shifting away from reflexively medicating patients, and toward complementing psychotherapy with things like yoga, he said. “In the beginning I was very   on drugs. I did a lot of the early studies for drugs for PTSD. But we very quickly realized they don’t work very well,” he said. “Every veteran since Homer has been doping himself up to keep his issues under wraps, but it doesn’t help process the trauma. ” In the 2000s Dr. van der Kolk published one of the first studies about the effects of yoga on PTSD. “It had very good results. After eight weeks, six months, the positive effects are still there,” he said. He has since made yoga a core part of his practice. Long before medical researchers began trying to document benefits, veterans sought out the healing potential of the world beyond the doctor’s office. The first person  to walk the entire Appalachian Trail, Earl Shaffer, had just come home from World War II and told friends he needed to “walk the Army out of my system, both mentally and physically. ” After Vietnam, hundreds of veterans sought refuge in the wilderness. “Most of my work is being driven by the veterans,” said Daniel Libby, a   psychologist who teaches yoga at a veterans center in Oakland, Calif. run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. “They don’t want to be on medications. Yoga offers a therapy that is  . You don’t have to rely on the medical system. ” In 2010, Mr. Libby surveyed the department’s health system and found that 28 percent of hospitals offered yoga. Now he estimates that it is more than 60 percent. Dr. Barbara Rothbaum, a psychologist at Emory University who runs an intensive   PTSD treatment program, complements her traditional therapies with alternative ones. She recently helped compile a National Academy of Sciences report on therapies for PTSD. “We met a lot of   clinicians around the country creating programs with equine therapy or wilderness therapy or whatever, and there was no way to know if any of it worked,” she said. “Because of that, we couldn’t recommend it. ” Dr. Rothbaum relies on exposure therapy in her clinic. At the same time, though, she has added yoga and meditation to help patients relax. “It’s not a core treatment, but it’s a life skill that helps maintain the gains,” she said. She also sends patients to places like the Georgia Aquarium to challenge them to overcome fears and build new experiences that put traumatic memories in perspective. After 30 minutes, Mr. Harris, the former Army medic, emerged from the water with a broad grin. “Amazing,” he said. When Mr. Harris got out of the Army, he went to the Department of Veterans Affairs several times for therapy and medication, but always dropped out in frustration and threw his pills away. “I didn’t want to have to take meds. I’ve always been a cornerstone, helping other people,” he said. “I guess I was mad at myself. ” But nightmares and violent outbursts grew worse. One day he blew up at his sister over a vacuum cleaner cord left out in a hallway and slapped her. Shocked at his actions, he vowed to give therapy another try. He now does a combination of traditional exposure therapy and medication, but also meditation and yoga, which, he said, “makes you feel better all day. ” Swimming with the sharks, to him, was more than a field trip. “It’s relaxing, sure. It made me feel great. But it’s also kind of scary, with those big sharks,” he said. “And part of therapy is doing what you have been avoiding, overcoming your fears. ”",0

He found that there has been a sea change in expectations on both sides since Oct. 7 when The Washington Post reported on the existence of the ‘Access Hollywood’ tapes… Republicans have become increasingly concerned that they could lose statehouse majorities in as many as 10 states, Storey said” [ RealClearPolitics ].

UPDATES Good heavens! 
“FBI to take new ‘investigative steps’ on Clinton emails” [ WaPo ]. “The FBI will investigate whether additional classified material is contained in emails sent using Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was secretary of state, FBI Director James B. Comey informed congressional leaders Friday. The announcement appears to restart the FBI’s probe of Clinton’s server, which previously ended in July with no charges…” 
“New Emails in Clinton Case Came From Anthony Weiner’s Electronic Devices” [ New York Times ]. “Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner… The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the thousands.” Then again, if Weiner runs true to form, classification won’t be an issue. But that most definitely does not mean Clinton’s home free . 
Quite the Friday afternoon news dump. And not a good week for the Clinton campaign, despite the triumphalism. 
Stats Watch 
GDP, Q3 2016 (Advance Estimate): “The consumer and the nation’s exports are the headliners in third-quarter GDP which topped expectations at an annualized 2.9 percent. Personal consumption expenditures rose at a solid 2.1 percent annualized rate led by the all important durables component which surged at a 9.5 percent rate. Personal consumption was the largest contributor in the quarter, adding 1.5 percentage points to the quarter’s rate.” [ Econoday ]. “Another important positive in the report is a second straight quarter of improvement in what has been the long lagging business investment component. Contributing 0.2 percentage points to GDP, nonresidential fixed investment rose at a 1.2 percent rate on top of the second-quarter’s 1.0 percent rate.” But: “Yes of course, this is an improvement. But the consumer went limp [?], and GDP is gamed with inventory hocus-pocus and export-import adjustments. I am not a fan of quarter-over-quarter exaggerated method of measuring GDP – but my year-over-year preferred method showed moderate improvement from last quarter” [ Econintersect ]. And: “The Federal Reserve has been notably uneasy surrounding investment levels in the economy with a prolonged series of weak releases, although the second-quarter data was revised higher. The third-quarter data will offer some limited relief over investment trends” [ Economic Calendar ]. 
Consumer Sentiment, October 2016: “[W]eakened substantially” [ Econoday ]. “[I]t was one year further back, September 2014, that the expectations component, at 76.8 this month, was this weak. Weakness here points to lack of confidence in the jobs outlook.” 
Employment Cost Index, Q3 2016: “Year-on-year, total costs held steady at a moderate plus 2.3 percent with wages & salaries dipping 1 tenth to 2.4 percent and benefits up 3 tenths to 2.3 percent” Econoday ]. “This report, which isn’t raising any red flags, is closely watched by Federal Reserve policy makers who, given the strength of the labor market, are on the look out for early signs of wage-related inflation.” 
Hotels: “On the one hand, plenty data from STR , HNN’s parent company, shows that things in the United States hotel industry are slowing down. Other the other hand, we have a report that September RevPAR  ;was up 5.6%. And, yes, both are true” [ Hotel News Notes ]. “The great performance—this was the highest RevPAR growth this year—really reminded me of the better days we have seen in the past few up cycles. Of course, the results are not actually a sign of anything but a calendar shift of the Jewish holidays Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur out of September into October. So I would strongly caution against reading anything, good or bad, into these monthly numbers.” 
Rail: “This week the one year rolling average did not worsen – but it remains in contraction” [ Econintersect ]. 
Rail: “Two [CSX] trains collided head-on on a stretch of track south of Philadelphia around 8:25 a.m. Friday, leaving four people injured, according to officials” (with classic photo) [ NBC Philadelphia ]. “It was not immediately clear what caused the trains to be on the same track.” 
Shipping: “Shippers, Consignees, Exporters, Importers must take heed to the packing and container transport requirements at both ends of the supply chain” [ Shipping and Freight Resource ]. “[I]t is clear that in this case, no one considered or was aware of the road weight limitation at the [Point of Departure] or along the route to the final destination… There would have been 2 containers that doesn’t subscribe to the country’s road weight limitation loose on the road.. Such instances could even result in loss of lives. this is ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS a lot of the big importers employ the services of a local freight forwarder who are au fait with these transport and documentary requirements, rules, regulations etc etc in each of their countries.” 
Shipping: “United Parcel Service Inc. is forecasting record holiday shipments after traffic surged in the third quarter, spurred by rising e-commerce in the U.S. and robust growth in Asia and Europe” [ Wall Street Journal , “Package-delivery company expects record shipments during holiday season as it boosts capital spending, orders new Boeing jumbo jets”]. And: ” United Parcel Service Inc. is placing a big bet on growth in shipping demand” [ Wall Street Journal ]. “UPS is backing up its bullish outlook by buying 14 Boeing Co. 747-8 freighters, the company’s first aircraft order since 2008. The deal pushes UPS more deeply into jumbo-jet operations at a time when international shipping demand has been soft for many companies and populist anti-trade currents seem to present new barriers to global goods movement. The company is pressing lawmakers to support new trade agreements that are drawing scorn in the presidential campaign but would bring new freight volume for its new, bigger planes. In the meantime, UPS says cross-border e-commerce is surging six times faster than the broader economy, growth that helped the company show big gains across its business lines in the third quarter.” 
Shipping: “The tale of two canals – game theory in action” [ Splash 247 ]. Panama and Suez canals play tit-for-tat on infrastructure and pricing. 
IT: “The latest data breach count from the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) reports that there have been 809 data breaches recorded this year through October 25, 2016, and that nearly 30 million records have been exposed since the beginning of the year” [ 247 Wall Street ]. ” The 809 data breaches reported so far for 2016 are nearly 22% above the number reported (666) for the same period last year.” Won’t be a problem when we go cashless, though. 
IT: “Apple demolished by Microsoft at their respective PC events” [ MarketWatch ]. Among other minor changes, Apple introduced a programmable “Touch Bar” which replaced the row of function keys at the top of the keyboard — including the ESC key. Fortunately, there’s a solution. For only $69.95 : 
IT: “New MacBook Pro is not a Laptop for Developers Anymore” [ DevTeamSpace Blog ].“[D]evelopers are drawn towards Apple products primarily for software reasons: the Unix-like operating system and the proprietary development ecosystem. But developers need to have a functional keyboard to make use of that software and now they don’t. Why Tim Cook, why?” And: “The 2016 MacBook Pro ships with RAM and processor specs that are nearly identical to the 2010 model. Deja vu?” 
IT: “Apple, it seems, is angling for the ‘amateur creative’ and isn’t interested in anything else anymore. It wants the market that sits in coffee shops with its brand and only buys Apple, but doesn’t mind so much if the core demographic disappears. Maybe that’s OK — there’s probably good money in it — but it’s a real shame” [ Medium ]. Massive takedown, and fun to read. 
The Bezzle: “A grown-up Airbnb now has to face regulation” and “New bill could further delay Airbnb IPO, strategist says” [ MarketWatch ]. “In a sense, recently passed New York regulations on Airbnb Inc. return it to its community roots of sharing homes.

7204,Bill Clinton CAUGHT ON TAPE; Told Mistress to DENY He Got Her…,"Pinterest 
There isn’t a question that the Clintons are the most corrupt politicians in United States history. There also isn’t a question that Bill Clinton is a womanizing, philandering piece of filth. Apparently, one of the women Bill had an affair with while Governor of Arkansas, Gennifer Flowers, has released a series of taped conversations with Bubba from that time. 
According to Breitbart : 
On October 1991, Clinton announced his bid for the Oval Office, with rumors of extramarital affairs threatening to derail his campaign. 
Flowers recently provided this reporter with complete original cassette recordings of her taped conversations with Clinton, recordings that take on renewed significance as the issue of Clinton’s alleged treatment of women has reemerged during the 2016 presidential campaign. 
The sections of the audio recordings related to the state job are not exclusive to Breitbart News. Those excerpts were played for the news media in 1992, one day after Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared side by side on 60 Minutes , where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers. 
Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit. 
You can hear the recordings here:

It’s not just that Clinton had an affair, he was also trying to help his lover get a job with the state. Pay to play on her part or his? Maybe a little of both. Why not take advantage of screwing the married governor of a state and getting something other than an STD from it? Flowers just had to make sure she didn’t tell anyone the governor, her married lover, was helping her to get the job. 
This is just one other aspect of the corruption and despicableness that is the Clintons. They care little for actually governing, care absolutely nothing about the people they actually represent or govern, and care nothing about the consequences, because other than fines for their criminal activity or behavior, they have PAID NO consequences for their lifetime of corruption. 
Unfortunately, it won’t matter what comes out about Bill and Hillary Clinton. The main stream media won’t report it and even if it’s a criminal act, Obama’s Department of Justice won’t prosecute them. 
That’s the reality of the Clintons. They aren’t representatives of the people, they are representatives for themselves and the moral bankruptcy that has invaded our country.",0
7206,Anatomy of a Media Conspiracy - The New York Times,"Look, Mom, there I am in WikiLeaks. Right there among the rest of the media sellouts, Clinton shills and biased tools of the MSM who are apparently bent on destroying Donald J. Trump. Sarah Palin tweeted about me, Trump himself derided my actions in a stump speech and I’m pretty sure Bill O’Reilly just called on me to resign, if I’m reading the barrage of Twitter mentions correctly  —   and it is a barrage (or was before I stopped reading Twitter). This is all because of those “damn emails,” as Bernie Sanders would say, although he was referring to a different bunch of damn emails. These belonged to John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman whose hacked emails WikiLeaks has been releasing in daily batches over the last few days. In all, the emails offer a glimpse into the Clinton campaign as the crucible of   you would expect. Pretty much any reporter who has covered this enterprise can attest to its stinginess with information and access to the candidate. Official interviews between reporters and campaign aides tend to be aggressively monitored and  . Clinton recently broke an ignominious streak of 275 consecutive days without holding a formal news conference. As I detail in an article in this Sunday’s magazine, an argument actually broke out aboard the Clinton plane between campaign aides and the traveling press corps over whether it was O. K. for reporters to tweet the candidate’s apparent preference for Vladimir Putin as a dinner companion over Donald Trump (as revealed in a note scrawled on a clementine  —   it’s complicated, just read the article). But the leaked emails make for instructive reading nonetheless, though they can be somewhat uncomfortable, if you happen to be the author and recipient of a few of them. By way of background: In July of last year, I embarked on a profile of the former secretary of state a few months after she began seeking the Democratic nomination. True to form, her campaign was nervous and hypercontrolling from the outset, a point that I fleshed out in the story. I described, among other things, the experience of visiting Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters and receiving, before I arrived, an email request from a press aide requesting that I keep “the office itself” off the record. In other words, they wanted me not to relay anything that I saw inside the entire    space, as if I were being granted access to a   Pentagon bunker or something. It was a ridiculous request that I refused. I also said no initially when the campaign said I could interview Secretary Clinton but only on the condition that we do it off the record. Reporters speak off the record to politicians all the time, but this was an unusual provision and felt slightly weird: a major candidate for president’s agreeing to speak to a reporter on the condition that readers not be privy? It would be one thing if the campaign had also agreed to an    discussion, but it had not. I pleaded my case over a few weeks, but Clinton’s staff was not budging. I discussed the dilemma with my bosses  —   the principle at stake versus the payoff of what I could learn in an    setting. Finally, I agreed to an    interview. At the very least, I figured I could pitch Clinton directly on doing an actual interview without any mediation from her army of agonizers. Clinton and I spoke for about 45 minutes in a conference room of the Omni Mount Washington resort in Bretton Woods, N. H. She is, as advertised, “funny and thoughtful in    and   settings” (even the Clinton clichés are clichés at this point). Donors pay top dollar for the opportunity to experience this “funny and thoughtful Hillary in    and   settings. ” I paid only with annoyance and a few pounds of dignity. Nonetheless, it was a good discussion, and I learned some things. Clinton touched on a number of topics, from the   psychological effects of the internet on young people, to the challenges of running for president as a woman, to how her experience seeking the presidency this time differed from 2008. After our conversation, I asked her aides if they would allow me to put any of our discussion on the record. It was their prerogative to decide, given the    provision to which I had agreed. I sent large portions of the Clinton transcript in an email to Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director. “These exchanges were pretty interesting,” I wrote. “Would love the option to use. ” Ideally Palmieri would have reviewed portions of the interview  —   about 2, 000 words  —   and come back with a simple “Fine, use what you want. ” There was nothing damning or embarrassing in there, at least that I could tell. I heard nothing for a few days. Palmieri shared my email with others in the campaign, including Podesta, apparently. Finally, after consulting with Clinton herself, Palmieri said they would agree to put two sections of the interview on the record. One of them was an icebreaker exchange between Clinton and me in which I mentioned that I had just seen a moose on the side of the New Hampshire road. This elicited an animated response from Clinton about how she herself had encountered lots of moose   when she worked in Alaska one summer during college. Simple enough, right? Well, not quite. Palmieri demanded that I not include an aside that Clinton made in the midst of her moose monologue  —   about Sarah Palin. Now it can be told. “I always got a big kick out of Sarah Palin with all of her ‘We’re cooking up some moose stew here,’ ” Clinton told me. She did not seem to be belittling the former Alaska governor in any way, though I should also point out  —   and this does not come through in the transcript  —   that Clinton uttered her “we’re cooking up some moose stew here” line with a passable Palin impersonation. I have no idea why Clinton would not want this Palin aside in the article, though I’m guessing she did not want to invite a public    with Palin, as can happen. As it turns out, one of the “newsier” takeaways from this week’s WikiLeaks trove involved the Palin remark. “NY Times’ Mark Leibovich Obeyed Request to Cut Palin Joke From Hillary Interview,” said a headline Tuesday in Breitbart, the adamantly   news site. Putting aside that it wasn’t really a joke, the word “obeyed” here goes to the essence of the criticism, mockery and vitriol I’ve been receiving from the right in recent days. “Hillary, let’s make a deal!” Palin tweeted on Wednesday. “I’ll swap ya  —   my special moose chili recipe for your   trick that lets you edit media coverage of yourself. ” Or as Trump put it Wednesday night at a rally in Florida, The Times granted Clinton “veto power over her quotes in a story,” he said. “Nobody ever called and said, ‘Mr. Trump, we’ve written this story, would you give us a little feedback?’ ” This is obviously not what happened in my case, but given the   revealed in the leaked    I can see how the uninitiated might get that impression. Politicians in fact go “off the record” with reporters with some frequency. As soon as the reporter grants the    provision, he is effectively allowing “veto power” over that material. That part of the conversation remains private unless he or she says otherwise. That’s the “  trick” Palin was referring to. Trump, for his part, goes off the record with reporters all the time. Last September, I spent several hours over a period of a few weeks with the Donald himself for an article in this magazine. On several occasions, in the midst of our conversations, Trump would go off the record  —   usually with good reason. This was fine, understandable and, yes, the price of “doing business,” to adapt an unfortunate phrase that Palmieri used to sign off on our last   email (“Pleasure doing business! ”). I wish Palmieri had not used those exact words, but there are in fact collusive aspects to these relationships. Political profiles are, by definition, an awkward dance that involves competing agendas, mutual cynicism and, in many cases, negotiation. It can involve great levels of trust and distrust at the same time. I’ve written a few hundred of these profiles over the years, and each dynamic is complicated for its own particular reasons. Looking back, I realize that Trump’s campaign was a relative pleasure to deal with compared with the coiled thicket of Clintonia. His was a simple and nimble operation, consisting at the time of just himself and his communications director, Hope Hicks. Decisions came fast and without obvious   usually from the candidate himself. Trump was more than generous with his time, access and willingness to say provocative things. He was the   in this regard, just as Clinton is the   in other regards. But Trump was hardly unplugged or unaware. A lot of the stuff he said to me that he declared to be “off the record” was potentially harmful to him. He was fully conscious of where lines were, whom he did not want to be disparaging publicly and of what could bring needless offense. He trusted me to honor this agreement, and of course I did, and will continue to. If I had asked Trump, after the fact, whether I could put some of that material “on the record,” it would have been his right to say no, to exercise his veto power. As it turned out, there might have been one or two    things I asked him if I could use in our final conversations, but I don’t recall exactly. Another advantage of writing about Trump: He does give you plenty to work with. For as   as he was, Trump has been equally hostile to the “unfair” and “dishonest” press  —   increasingly so, and to a point where it’s reaching an unnervingly fevered pitch. “Without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing,” Trump railed Thursday at a rally in Florida. The Times and The Washington Post are mere “cogs for a corrupt political machine,” he said. These are days of many cogs in Trump’s America  —   everything from the Republican officials who Trump says have abandoned him to the United States Justice Department to the women accusing him of sexual harassment. But the media is first among cogs, probably the first entity Trump will blame if he doesn’t win. “The corrupt establishment knows we are a great threat to their criminal enterprise,” Trump said Thursday. We are all part of the enterprise, “doing business” together. We know all the secret handshakes and   tricks. The darkest of days could lie ahead for America, Trump warns, and only he has veto power to stop them.",0
7207,ISIS Thugs Horrified to See Bodies of Their Dead Comrades Trapped to Kurds’ Oncoming Humvees,"ISIS Thinks They Took Christian Village, Then Look Around & See Terrifying Surprise 
You can watch the video right here, but be forewarned that it contains some graphic content : 
It is unclear at this point whether the bodies were strapped to the hoods to serve as a warning to the rest of their fellow Islamic radicals, or merely as trophies to serve as encouragement to other Kurdish fighters.   
Regardless, it was a clear sign that the bloody battle to retake Mosul was underway in earnest, a battle that will most certainly result in incredible bloodshed and loss of life on all sides. 
It is possible that the Kurds deliberately chose to strap the dead bodies of their foes on the hood of their vehicles as something of a “one-up” on the Islamic State group thugs, considering that those jihadists have used this tactic before with dead Kurdish fighters and captured Yazidi sex slaves who no longer served their purpose. 
This is sadistic and brutal and utterly atrocious, but war often is.",0
7208,Freedom Center Urges College Presidents to End Aid to Campus Supporters of Terror,"Freedom Center Urges College Presidents to End Aid to Campus Supporters of Terror “We ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to SJP.” October 31, 2016 Frontpagemag.com 
Editor’s Note: The following letter was sent to the presidents of the ten campuses named in the Freedom Center’s report on the “Top Ten Schools Supporting Terrorists.” In alphabetical order, the ten campuses are: Brooklyn College (CUNY), San Diego State University, San Francisco State University, Tufts University, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Irvine, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Chicago, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Vassar College. 
October 27, 2016 
University of California 
Dear Dr. Napolitano, 
Your school purports to promote the values of diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources, funding and legitimacy to Students for Justice in Palestine. Students for Justice in Palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against Jews and the Jewish state for the terrorist organization Hamas. The explicit goals of Hamas are the destruction of the world’s only Jewish state and genocide against its Jewish population. For these reasons, among others, three campuses of the University of California—Irvine, Los Angeles, and Berkeley—have been named among the “Top Ten Schools Supporting Terrorists” by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. You may read the full report here: http://www.stopthejewhatredoncampus.org/news/top-ten-schools-supporting-terrorists-fall-2016-report 
While it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group, SJP is an integral part of Hamas’s efforts to annihilate Israel through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. This is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize Israel, and smear it as a rogue “apartheid” nation. These claims are ludicrous. More than a million Palestinians enjoy Israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the Israeli courts and parliament. Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz has said of the BDS movement, “It is anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist, anti-human rights, anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-negotiation, anti-peace, anti-compromise, and anti-Palestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work.” Both Larry Summers and Hillary Clinton have denounced BDS as anti-Semitic Jew hatred. Yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors. 
With university support, SJP also conducts “Israeli apartheid” hate weeks on campus quads. These events feature pro-Hamas advocates, the construction of “apartheid walls” featuring pro-Hamas, anti-Semitic propaganda, and the creation of mock checkpoints and die-ins that disrupt student movements on campus. SJP actively disrupts pro-Israel campus events—a threat to free speech and a violation of your university’s stated values and rules of conduct. 
In addition to being scripted by Hamas terrorists, SJPs pro-terror campaign is funded and guided through a Hamas front called American Muslims for Palestine. In recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Jonathan Schanzer, who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the United States Department of the Treasury from 2004-2007, described how Hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) for the purpose of promoting BDS campaigns on American campuses. AMP was created by SJP co-founder Hatem Bazian, a pro-terrorist lecturer at UC Berkeley who called for a suicide bombing “Intifada” inside the United States. It employs high-ranking officials from other Muslim “charities” that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists. 
Schanzer described AMP as “arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which is the most visible arm of the BDS campaign on campuses in the United States.” He detailed how AMP “provides speakers, training, printed materials, a so-called ‘Apartheid Wall,’ and grants to SJP activists” and “even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with SJP and other pro-BDS campus groups across the country.” Furthermore, “according to an email it sent to subscribers, AMP spent $100,000 on campus activities in 2014 alone.” 
Students for Justice in Palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine. Despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas, Students for Justice in Palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges, including university offices, and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of Hamas on university property. These privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group, let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men, women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them. 
In light of these facts, we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to SJP and other campus groups who promote the genocidal Hamas agenda, and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of Jewish students on your campus, but of all Americans.

7210,Donald Trump and Janet Yellen Look to Be on a Collision Course - The New York Times,"Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, made it clear Wednesday that she believes that the American economy is pretty much back on track. And that, in turn, sets the stage for a potential conflict with the incoming Trump administration in the months and years ahead. Congress assigns the Fed two goals: seek maximum employment and maintain stable prices. Ms. Yellen, in a speech in San Francisco, rather explicitly made clear that the nation isn’t far from attaining those goals. “Now, it’s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment, and inflation is moving toward our goal,” she said. The unemployment rate, 4. 7 percent, is back near where it was before the 2008 recession. And “although inflation has been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year. ” It is Ms. Yellen’s clearest indication to date that the era of extraordinary efforts by the central bank to get the economy back in shape is nearing its end. The Fed has raised   interest rates in each of the last two Decembers, and it is looking likely that there will be more than one rate increase this year. She said in her speech that she and her colleagues were expecting to increase the federal funds rate “a few times a year. ” As central bankers are wont to do, Ms. Yellen emphasized that those plans were contingent on the economy’s behaving as the Fed expected. If inflation starts to slip again, or improvements in the job market recede, the Fed will presumably hold off. But she spoke clearly of the risks of moving too slowly toward the   neutral interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy. “Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road,” she said. “Either too much inflation, financial instability or both. ” But if things go as planned, there is a clear risk that the Fed’s goals could be on a collision course with the Trump administration’s goals. The   and his advisers have often spoken of seeking stronger economic growth than the United States has experienced the last several years, perhaps seeking 3. 5 percent to 4 percent instead of the   percent growth that has been the standard since 2009. A white paper by advisers to Mr. Trump released in the fall assessed the view that this lower growth rate reflected demographics and that it amounted to a “new normal,” and declared it “incomplete  —   and unnecessarily defeatist. ” That view is at odds with both Ms. Yellen’s comments Wednesday and   economic projects that Fed officials have released. For example, the median Fed policy maker viewed the economy’s   rate of G. D. P. growth as only 1. 8 percent a year, very much in the ballpark that Trump advisers would view as unnecessarily defeatist. So here’s one way things could go: The Fed steadily raises rates, to the degree that employment and inflation data cooperate with their forecasts, with faster rate increases the higher growth rises. It’s possible that what people in Mr. Trump’s orbit view as a desirable boom will look to Ms. Yellen and her colleagues as overheating, and prompt equal and opposite interest rate increases. There are a couple of potential twists in this story. The first would involve potential Trump appointments to the Fed the second could involve big moves in the dollar. Ms. Yellen’s term as chairwoman expires in about a year. Mr. Trump could appoint a new leader to the Fed who is more hospitable to his view (though she would have the option of continuing her time as a Fed governor, one of seven policy makers who are appointed to   terms). There are two governor vacancies available now, so Mr. Trump could quickly influence the direction of the Fed with new appointees. But it’s not clear whether any new Trump appointees would steer the bank toward higher interest rates and greater concern about inflation or let a potential Trump boom advance unconstrained. Big fluctuations in the dollar could also shape a potential tension between Trumponomics and Fed policy. Economists believe a key element of a corporate income tax overhaul advanced by House Republicans, known as a border adjustment tax, would have the effect of creating a huge rally in the value of the dollar compared with other major currencies, perhaps 20 percent or more. The Fed has been more focused than ever in the last few years on how its decisions ripple through the global economy. It held off on rate increases in 2015 and early 2016 in significant part because a rally in the dollar seemed to be destabilizing many emerging markets and fueling risks of a global slowdown. A stronger dollar also reduces inflation in the United States, which in turn makes the Fed more inclined toward caution on rate increases. Mr. Trump has sent mixed messages on his views of a border adjustment tax, seeming to slap down the idea in a Wall Street Journal interview published this week. But if it looks as if policies on Capitol Hill are going to push the dollar up significantly. Of course, that too could cut in the other direction. A stronger dollar doesn’t help with Mr. Trump’s goals of reducing the trade deficit, and just this week he has seemed to try to talk the dollar down. Add up a week of new signals from incoming Trump administration officials and now Ms. Yellen’s speech, and it is looking like a distinct possibility that Ms. Yellen could wake up one morning in the year ahead to   tweets directed her way, originating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",0

7213,Few Consular Visits for American Held in North Korea - The New York Times,"An American college student sentenced by North Korea to 15 years of hard labor on charges that he tried to steal a political poster has been granted only one consular visit in nearly six months, the State Department said Tuesday. The prisoner, Otto F. Warmbier of Cincinnati, a    honors student at the University of Virginia, has been held in North Korea since January. He was seized by North Korean security officials on the day he was to depart the country at the end of an organized tour. Mr. Warmbier’s incarceration, against the backdrop of North Korea’s growing isolation over the country’s nuclear and missile tests, is widely viewed as tool of leverage by the North Korean authorities against the United States. Over the past several years, North Korea has periodically seized roughly a dozen Americans who have visited the country, which has considered the United States its most dangerous enemy since the   Korean War. Most of the Americans have either been expelled or eventually released. Mr. Warmbier was shown on North Korean television tearfully apologizing for the attempted theft of a political propaganda poster in his hotel in Pyongyang, the capital, a seemingly minor offense that the government regarded as a major crime. In   he was punished with a   term in the North Korean penal system, angering the United States government and drawing rebukes elsewhere for what was seen as a disproportionately harsh sentence. People in contact with the Warmbier family, which has declined to give interviews, said Mr. Warmbier had received only one consular visit, in March, from the embassy of Sweden, which looks after American interests in North Korea. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, confirmed that information on Tuesday. “A representative from the Swedish Embassy last visited Mr. Warmbier on March 2, 2016,” Mr. Kirby said in a statement. Despite requests by the Swedish Embassy, he said, the North Korean government “still routinely delays or denies consular access to U. S. citizens. ” It is considered unusual for prisoners to get only one consular visit over such a long period. The State Department has warned Americans not to travel to North Korea because of the risk of arbitrary arrest. But that has not dissuaded people curious about the country’s hermetic society and the population’s fealty to the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea since its founding. Mr. Warmbier traveled there with Young Pioneer Tours, a   group that specializes in visits to North Korea. There has been no indication from the North Korean authorities of when they might be prepared to release Mr. Warmbier. He received the harshest punishment of any American detained there since November 2012, when Kenneth Bae, an American missionary of Korean descent, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Mr. Bae and another imprisoned American, Matthew Todd Miller, were freed by the North Koreans in November 2014 during a visit to North Korea by James R. Clapper Jr. the Obama administration’s national intelligence director, who brought them home aboard his plane after secret negotiations.",0

7216,Officials Fight Donald Trump’s Claims of a Rigged Vote - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Republican leaders and election officials from both parties on Sunday sought to combat claims by Donald J. Trump that the election is rigged against him, amid signs that Mr. Trump’s contention is eroding confidence in the vote and setting off talk of rebellion among his supporters. In a vivid illustration of how Mr. Trump is shattering American political norms, the Republican nominee is alleging that a conspiracy is underway between the news media and the Democratic Party to commit vast election fraud. He has offered no evidence to support his claim. “The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary  —   but also at many polling places  —   SAD,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Mr. Trump made the incendiary assertion hours after his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, tried to play down Mr. Trump’s questioning of the fairness of the election. Mr. Pence said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he and Mr. Trump “will absolutely accept the result of the election. ” Mr. Trump’s words, though, appear to be having an effect on his supporters, and are setting off deep concern among civil rights groups. According to an Associated Press poll last month, only   of Republicans said they had a great deal of confidence their votes would be counted fairly. And election officials are worried that Mr. Trump’s continued pressing of the issue could dampen turnout or cause his supporters to deny the legitimacy of the results if he loses. Last week, Mr. Trump called the presidential election “one big fix” and “one big, ugly lie. ” Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio, said it was “wrong and engaging in irresponsible rhetoric” for any candidate to question the integrity of elections without evidence. Mr. Husted, a Republican, said he would have no reason to hesitate to certify the results of the election. “We have made it easy to vote and hard to cheat,” Mr. Husted said Sunday in an interview. “We are going to run a good, clean election in Ohio, like we always do. ” American elections are, unlike those in many democracies, largely decentralized, rendering the possibility of   fraud extraordinarily unlikely. Further, the balloting in many of the   states will be overseen by Republican officials, individuals who would be highly unlikely to consent to helping Mrs. Clinton rig the vote. Chris Ashby, a Republican election lawyer, said Mr. Trump’s attacks on the electoral process were unprecedented and risked creating a fiasco on Election Day. Mr. Ashby also said that Mr. Trump was “destabilizing” the election by encouraging his supporters to deputize themselves as amateur poll monitors, outside the bounds of the law. “That’s going to create a disturbance and, played out in polling places across the country, it has the potential to destabilize the election,” Mr. Ashby said, “which is very, very dangerous. ” Mr. Trump’s claims, a little more than three weeks before the election, are once again forcing elected Republicans into a difficult spot as they try to balance offering assurances of the integrity of the election while not undercutting a   many of their voters fervently support. “Our secretary of state, Ken Detzner, has been very focused on making sure we have a smooth election,” said Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, noting that Mr. Scott’s “goal is 100 percent participation and zero percent fraud. ” Representatives of other Republican governors offered only a terse “yes” when asked if their state’s balloting would be conducted fairly. Yet other Republicans are appalled at Mr. Trump’s claims of widespread fraud, which are now a staple of his stump speech. “It is so irresponsible because what he’s doing really goes to the heart of our democracy,” said Trey Grayson, a Republican and former secretary of state of Kentucky. “What is great about America is that we change our leaders at the ballot box, not by bullets,” Mr. Grayson said. Still, some of Mr. Trump’s loyal backers are rousing one another with talk of insurrection should Mr. Trump be defeated. In Wisconsin, David A. Clarke Jr. the sheriff of Milwaukee County, posted on Twitter on Saturday that it was “pitchforks and torches time,” along with a photograph of an angry mob wielding weapons. Mr. Clarke addressed the Republican National Convention in July and appears regularly on television as a Trump campaign surrogate. Also, elements of Mr. Trump’s crowds have turned violent. At a rally in North Carolina on Friday, in which he alleged a   conspiracy against him, one supporter lashed out physically at a protester in the crowd. And a CBS affiliate in Virginia reported over the weekend that   demonstrators had flashed firearms outside the office of a Democratic congressional candidate near Charlottesville, in a threatening signal. Republicans are also facing signs of menace: A party office in North Carolina was set on fire and   over the weekend, an act Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter was the act of “animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina. ” Still, Mr. Trump’s campaign surrogates have not hesitated to join him in questioning the fairness of the electoral process: Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, both advisers to Mr. Trump, used TV interviews on Sunday to suggest that Democrats tended to cheat in elections, accusing them of counting votes from dead people. And Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump’s closest congressional supporter and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has warned that “they are attempting to rig this election. ” Civil rights groups have begun to express alarm at remarks from Mr. Trump that they see as goading his supporters to intimidate minorities at the polls. Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials Education Fund, said he planned to formally contact the Justice Department as soon as this week, to ask that it guard against the kind of voting disruptions Mr. Trump has encouraged. “It is a major concern that we have this candidate promoting vigilante poll watching,” Mr. Vargas said. And Michael Podhorzer, the political director of the A. F. L. . I. O. said that progressive groups were deeply concerned about the possibility of disruptions at the polls on Election Day. Mr. Podhorzer said that Mr. Trump’s recent comments about a rigged election had the potential to “incite violence and bloodshed. ” Mr. Podhorzer said that Democrats would be closely monitoring polling places for signs of interference in states where voters can cast their ballots before Election Day. “We will start to see whether folks are out intimidating voters in predominantly   communities, and at least get a sense of what direction that might be going in,” Mr. Podhorzer said, adding of Mr. Trump’s speech, “This is beyond the pale. ” Other Democrats were just as bothered but also amused about the unlikely prospect of a vast fraud plot unfolding at thousands of disparate polling places. “He’s fine with the system when he wins the primary, but now he’s   claiming   fraud?” said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, calling Mr. Trump’s language “unambiguously racist, but also absurd, ludicrous and pathetic. ” Even Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who just last week all but removed himself from the presidential campaign, was forced to issue a statement. “Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. Mr. Pence is trying to walk a fine line. The governor, in a series of Sunday television interviews, sought to portray Mr. Trump’s criticism of the electoral process as relating entirely to what he described as unfair news media coverage.",0

7221,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 6, Episode 6: A Dragon Queen on the Campaign Trail - The New York Times","The problem with emerging naked from a flaming temple is that it’s hard to top. It’s hard to top, that is, unless you happen to have a dragon with a flair for dramatic timing. So it went on Sunday, as Daenerys Targaryen wrapped up this week’s “Game of Thrones” with a stump speech for the ages. Populist rhetoric? Check. I know most khals prefer an elite inner circle of bloodriders, Dany told the assembled, but I want you all. Relatable local reference? Check. I remember like it was yesterday, Khal Drogo promising me the Seven Kingdoms at the Mother of Mountains, easily my favorite mountain in Essos. Demonization of outsiders? You better believe it. Look at them over there, with their iron suits and stone houses. They think they’re better than you, but we’re going to show them different. Oh and by the way, did you happen to notice that I’m sitting on an actual dragon right now and let me hear you say it: Are you with me? Now and always? They were. It’s hard to blame them  —   it was quite the performance. I was ready to air out some iron suits and tear down a stone house or two myself, and I don’t even own an arakh. Dany’s dragon rally wrapped up an episode titled “Blood of My Blood,” which you may recall is how Dothraki leaders and bloodriders address one another. The phrase also applied neatly to nearly every other story of the night. There was the excruciating      in Horn Hill, as well as the loathsome Walder Frey’s harsh treatment of his own   . (Welcome back, Tobias Menzies.) In King’s Landing, the marriage of Tommen and Margaery and their ongoing issues create all sorts of awkward ties between the Lannisters and Tyrells. That whole thing’s not going to end well. Finally there was Uncle Benjen, the brother of Ned Stark, who made a heroic return to the story, saving Bran and Meera from their Wight pursuers with some sort of flaming mace. (I guess all the other Wights got lost?) But first back to Dany. The speech, a near copy of the one Khal Drogo made in Season 1, was fiery enough to almost make me overlook a couple of things. One was the convenience of Drogon’s arrival, as alluded to above. You’ll recall that he was the one who kicked off this whole Dothraki revival tour at the end of last season by dumping Dany in a field and apparently disappearing. Now he’s back at her beck and call? Or are we to believe that Drogon knew all along that Dany’s capture was for the best in the long run? (Can dragons have greensight?) I guess another possibility is that this was the plan all along  —   that once Dany realized where she was, she hatched a plan to be captured and assume command of the Dothraki forces. But if that was the case, why not just use the dragon to do it? (Or why leave the ring for Daario and Jorah to find?) It’s not a huge thing, but I hope the writers clarify at some point rather than continuing to rely on the Drogon ex machina route. The other thing: Dany didn’t exactly refute Daario’s point that she was a conqueror, not a   did she? Rather, he almost seemed to remind her oh yeah, I’ve been meaning to rile up everyone with my dragon  …     My colleague James Poniewozik recently wrote about Dany’s inclination toward “permanent revolution,” contrasting it with Tyrion’s belief in realpolitik solutions. Will Tyrion’s steadying hand be enough to offset Dany’s   proclivities, or at least keep her from burning everything up the way her mad father did? She certainly seems to have a knack for it. I assume that was him, the Mad King Aerys II, in Bran’s visions. He seemed just as charming as advertised. It was interesting that the show chose to include him in the same episode that found Dany reaffirming her   toppling intentions  —   could it have been a warning? Which is to say: Are we sure we want Dany to be successful in her attempt to retake Westeros? She’s been a sympathetic character largely because she’s been a liberator of the oppressed, but isn’t that also an expedient way to build an army? Have we been backing someone who would actually be a disastrous ruler? For the record, I would love it if the mother of dragons turned out to be a villain in this story, though I don’t really expect it to go that way. (The dragons seem destined to be the fire opposing the White Walkers’ ice.) But there could be a fascinating reckoning coming, though it likely won’t be anytime soon. This is Dany we’re talking about  —   so far she’s more prone to spinning wheels than breaking them. It could take her another season and a half just to get back to Meereen. Speaking of leisurely arcs, Benjen’s been missing for a while  —   it turns out he was killed by White Walkers but saved by a strategic dragonglass stab by some forest children. (Read that sentence again this show is so nutty sometimes.) Bran spent much of the escape trying to boot up like a   cable box, downloading seemingly the entire story, including some intriguing things we haven’t seen yet. (Troubling thought: What if this whole show ends with Bran staring at a snow globe?) The good news for Bran is that he traded a Hodor for a ranger, an upgrade in ability if not in heart. (No offense, big guy, wherever you are.) The previous   Raven brought in Benjen to watch Bran’s back, and he also suggested that they’d all be returning to the main story soon, hopefully, by heading to the Wall to wait for the Night King. I’m sure Jon Snow will appreciate having another formerly dead guy around, too  —   maybe they can start a support group. Back in King’s Landing, the High Sparrow is proving cagier than many of us probably expected (or wanted). The joint   offensive came to naught because the Sparrow and Margaery brought Tommen into the fold. What just happened? Mace the lovable doofus asked his mother in King’s Landing. “He’s beaten us,” she replied. Of course, it’s easy to look smart when your opponent is an inbred   a few swords shy of a throne. (If Joffrey’s penalty for Jaime and Cersei’s sins was psychopathy, Tommen’s would seem to be imbecility.) Not only did Tommen thwart the planned overthrow of the Faith Militant by embracing it, he shunted Jaime off to deal with the Blackfish situation at Riverrun. That’s fine with me: I like Jaime better on the road, anyway, especially if he takes Bronn with him. (The preview of next week’s episode seemed to suggest as much.) Cersei was good with it, too. “Stand at the head of our army where you belong,” she told him. “Show them what Lannisters are   …    ” And then they both got so fired up with all the revenge talk, they collapsed into each other’s arms. Don’t ever change, you crazy kids. I don’t think for a second that Margaery is buying any of the Sparrow rhetoric  —   if you had any doubt that she was a formidable operator, notice how slickly she avoided her own walk of shame. But I’m actually more intrigued by the person we’ve seen hardly at all: her brother Loras. When we last saw him, he was coming apart, groveling in the dirt and ready to do anything to make it all stop. I can’t help thinking the show is setting him up for some sort of shocking kamikaze act. Tommen is too valuable to Margaery  —   she controls him and if he goes, she’ll be left looking for another heir to hook up with. (I don’t even know who would be next, aside from the eternally rowing Gendry.) Jaime is heading out to Riverrun. So that leaves   …     Cersei? Would the show go there? She has a trial by combat coming up, as she reminded us Sunday. And when’s the last time anything went wrong at one of those? Sorry  —   I meant “right. ” When’s the last time anything went right at one of those? Finally, over at Tarly Acres, Sam’s big reunion with his family combined the real twin pillars of “Game of Thrones”: Awful fathers and terrible dinner parties. Meeting the prospective   is always tense, even if you don’t belong to a loathed people and your significant other isn’t hated by one of his parents. Which is to say: Gilly never really stood a chance of being accepted. And Sam knew it, strategically withholding all potentially inflammatory information from his letter. “It wasn’t a very large piece of parchment,” he explained pathetically, which I enjoyed. But hey, at least they got a nice sword out of it. I’m not totally sure why the show’s spending so much time on Sam and Gilly, aside from perhaps using them to stand in for all the humble family units at risk of getting ground up by these clashes between more powerful clans. That said, you saw Sam’s house. He’s not exactly the salt of the earth. I imagine the whole point of the homecoming was to put that Valyrian steel sword in Sam’s hands for future use. You will never wield that sword, his father told him, which I imagine most of us heard as “you will definitely be wielding that sword before long. ” It happened quicker than I thought, but good for him. With a dad like that, he deserves it. • It looks like our long, faceless nightmare may almost be over: Arya has effectively cut her ties with the House of Black and White. We thought she seemed unlikely to kill the Meryl Streep of Braavos and she did not, which no doubt delighted the horrible Waif. (Jaqen’s “don’t let her suffer” absolutely went in one ear and out the other.) I’m happy for Arya to introduce the Waif to Needle and then move on, perhaps as a new understudy to replace the troupe’s resident Eve Harrington. I’m not sure we’ve seen the last of those guys, based on the warmth between Arya and the actress, and the casting of Richard E. Grant as the temperamental playwright. • I don’t think we’re through with Jaqen either, or he with Arya. I suspect all the apparent exceptions he’s made for her  —   overlooking her nobility, giving her another chance after she killed Meryn Trant  —   signal an agenda he hasn’t revealed yet. I do think we’re done with stick beatings though, and for that, a man is glad. • “I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father,” Sam’s sister told Gilly, which made me laugh, and then made me feel guilty for laughing. Craster was the worst, which is saying something on this show. • You need at least 1, 000 ships, Daario told Dany. Hmm, if only there were a couple of renegade siblings with a bunch of ships   …     • Hodor. (Never forget.) • What did you think? Was dinner at the Tarlys the worst one yet? What did you make of Bran’s visions? Who’s naming these swords, anyway? (Heartsbane?) Who’s been the most reprehensible father on this show? Please let us know in the comments.",0

Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn’t help that white voters can’t agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they’ll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats – the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else – the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
Look to Mexico for your future – or any Third World country. Or to Univision’s Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) 
Explaining Latino culture’s acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that “the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. … Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.” 
One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an “open mind” about child rape because “it’s a cultural thing.” 
When it comes to multiculturalism, you can’t say, We love the empanadas – but we don’t want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . This isn’t an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we’re importing. 
As described in excruciating detail in “Adios, America: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole,” our media already have a totally “open mind” about incest and child rape – and murder! – when it’s committed by immigrants. 
Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: “Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,” the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: “Man guilty in case of human smuggling.” 
And where I would have used the headline, “Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,” the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, “Columbus resident charged with molestation.” 
Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too – provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
In 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from “traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood.” The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. 
Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) 
In 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. 
When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) 
Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for “Austin men.” Or “Two.” 
Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: 
– “Two held in attack on child” – Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013 
– “Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack” – Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 
Needless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. 
The ultimate primer on the “blue-collar billionaire”— order Ann Coulter’s book “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” 
By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape – of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. 
The second case only was “rape” because of the girl’s young age – she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. 
Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. 
That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. 
Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? 
When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary’s foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. 
Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters’ American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) 
Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan’s rape: 
– “Why We Need Women in War Zones” (“I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. … This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.”) 
– “Reporting While Female” (“Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. … In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.”) 
Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. 
Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans – or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) 
Our country will be Zimbabwe, but – if all goes according to the Democrats’ plan – they’ll get to be Mugabe! 
That’s Hillary’s dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran’s parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: “Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.” Receive Ann Coulter's weekly commentaries in your email BONUS: By signing up for Ann Coulter’s alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email.

7223,"U.S. State Dept Says Assad Is Preventing Peace In Syria; U.S. Proxy War, Nusra Not Cause For Worry","Activist Post 
A month after the last ceasefire in Syria fell apart as a result of the failure of the United States and its terrorist proxies to adhere to just one of their obligations under the agreement, the United States government is still claiming that the reason there is no ceasefire ongoing in Syria is entirely the fault of President Bashar al-Assad and, of course, the scary Russians. 
In fact, on October 20, infamous narcissist, State Department Spokesman John Kirby openly stated that the “only thing” standing in the way of a “permanent ceasefire” in Syria is the “regime” of Bashar al-Assad. 
“The only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar al-Assad and his supporters,” he said. 
In other words, “If Assad would just step down and let us have our way with his country, we wouldn’t have to keep killing civilians, funding proxy terrorists, and bombing Syrian infrastructure.” Doesn’t Assad understand that the U.S. owns his country and that he is supposed to follow the dictates of Washington regardless of what the Syrian people desire? The nerve of Assad, trying to defeat terrorists and maintain the sovereignty of his nation! 
Kirby did, at least, acknowledge the presence of al-Nusra, but only tepidly. “We recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I’ve talked about this ad nauseam,” he said. 
Of course, al-Nusra is more than just a mere “spoiler,” it is open terrorist organization that the United States armed, funded, and trained to act as a proxy force that is no ideologically (or even physically) different than ISIS, Ahrar al-Sham, or the “moderates” of the Free Syrian Army. It is also an organization that the United States was supposed to separate from the groups of these shadowy “moderates” we have heard so much about over the course of the last five years but who are apparently phantoms lurking about in the rafters of the Syrian theatre. 
The very fact that the United States blamed Russia (along with Assad) for the collapse of the ceasefire and argued that the U.S. was not supposed to separate the “moderates” from the “extremists” until after seven days is thus an admission that, without the requirements of the ceasefire in place, the U.S. would never have separated them at all. But this was the crux of the U.S. position; essentially that it knew who the “moderate” cannibals were and that they were different from the extremist cannibals. If that is the case, then wouldn’t separating the two be the goal all along? Why did the United States need to be required by a ceasefire agreement (as a concession no less) to separate the two different elements of the “opposition” if it was truly in support of defeating the “extremists?” 
As Joseph Thomas writes for New Eastern Outlook , 
It also appears to be no coincidence that this scenario now openly unfolding in Syria fulfils warnings published by Western journalists as early as 2007 ( Seymour Hersh, The Redirection ) in which it was revealed that the US was already at that time providing material support to extremist organisations “sympathetic to Al Qaeda” toward the end goal of overthrowing the governments of both Iran and Syria. 
While the US now claims Russia has sabotaged US efforts to bring an end to hostilities in Syria, Washington is also illogically attempting to argue that the failure of its feigned “peace talks” has also somehow prevented the US from targeting terrorists organisations in Syria, the alleged pretext of America’s presence in Syria to begin with. 
Despite strained relations with Russia, the US is still cooperating with Moscow regarding the use of Syrian airspace to avoid unintentional confrontations. While the cessation of hostilities may have collapsed, is there really any excuse as to why separating designated terrorist organisations from militant groups the US and its allies are providing billions in weapons and equipment to is still not an absolute and urgent priority? 
The answer is, no — there is no excuse. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say, it is simply an excuse for the US to continue funnelling men and materiel into Syria Washington knows with absolute certainty will end up in the ranks of Al Qaeda, whom the US admittedly intended to use as early as 2007 to overthrow the Syrian government with. 
As a result, the State Department’s ridiculous leveling of the blame for the failure of the ceasefire on Assad can be chalked up to yet another statement based in absolute falsehood and intentional deception. Indeed, this is the type of statement the U.S. State Department is becoming renowned for the world over, from blaming Russia for bombing a convoy even if it didn’t bomb the convoy , claiming Russian aggression in Ukraine, asserting that Assad is “killing his own people,” “barrel bombing civilians,” and attacking hospitals, what little shred of credibility the State Department may have left outside of American borders is rapidly disappearing.

Kirby the human Furby communicates in Furbish to confuse and deflect the reporters’ questions in the press secretary briefing room. He stated that, ‘the “only thing” standing in the way of a “permanent ceasefire” in Syria is the “regime” of Bashar al-Assad.’ 
Yes, the well worn political science propaganda phrase, “the only thing standing in the way of a permanent ceasefire is …” has been used across the centuries to twist the truth in favor of the aggressor. Imagine England’s King George III proclaiming this to the American colonists or the Nazi’s dictating it to the French Maquis, or in more modern times, the Israelis persuading the Hamas resistance in Zionist occupied Palestine. 
“Surrender to U.S. hegemony and relinquish all sovereign rights to Syrian land and its natural resources so our corporations can exploit it,” is what the stark message really means. 
At the end of the session, Kirby left the journalists dumbfounded with his favorite Furbish goodbye, “u-nye-way-loh-nee-way” which translates to, “You go sleep now”. The whole world is in a slumber, insouciant to the ground swell of evil slime that flows out of the Potomac’s foggy bottom to spread tyranny everywhere. madrino 
Mr. Swanson’s research of America’s history of coups, wars and similar acts identifies to me, not to expect change to come from the power structure that has been in place since the country’s inception. Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and countless others are under the boot of the war of terror. Those of us that want peace must wage peace since all other organizations that claim to be such have proven otherwise. Since the creation UN, the wealth gap between rich and poor nations has gotten much greater, and the movement of wealth within rich nations is concentrated at the top .01% as so aptly described by Carl Herman. Charles Hugh Smith has promoted ideas and solutions to change the current system of privlage of the few, to opportunities for all willing to put in the effort to succeed socially and economically. twinfishfour . 
The US has left Iraq and Libya in chaos, and it intends to leave Syria in chaos, with portions of the spoils promised to Israel and other portions promised to the Kurds. The chaos inflicted on Syria by US policy with help from the Saudis and others will not resolve immediately, but it will resolve a lot sooner if the US ceases to attempt regime change in Syria. Which is more “convert to failed state” than regime change if you look at the pattern established in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Even Ukraine, in spite of the conversion of property and power to the Fortune 500 and crony capitalists from the west, is worse off than it was before US attempts (through proxies) at regime change. So, now, when it comes to foreign policy, if Uncle Sam’s lips are moving, they are telling lies. Irony of ironies. skygroup

7224,House Oversight Testimony: ’America Has Spoken-We Want the Wall Built Right Away’ - Breitbart,"The National Security Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee held a hearing Thursday on President Donald Trump’s signature election pledge of a wall on the southern border. [Five witnesses, four speaking in favor of the wall’s construction and one against, testified before the Subcommittee.  Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) framed the issue before the testimony of the witnesses. “A central issue of the President’s 2016 campaign was the promise to build ‘an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,’” he said. DeSantis cited Israel’s successful border wall as a model for our own: President Trump has identified Israeli border security measures as a potential model for securing the U. S.  border. The construction of a security fence on the   Border cut illegal entries from over 16, 500 in 2011 to just 43 in 2013 and 12 in 2014  —   a 99 percent decrease. DeSantis also disputed Democrats’ claim that the wall might cost $70 billion, citing the Democrats’ own witness at the hearing, Seth Stodder, an Assistant Secretary in the   as estimating a cost of only $14 billion in January. Mark DeSaulnier, a Democratic Member of the National Security Subcommittee, used part of his opening remarks to play a video featuring Republicans like Sen. John McCain ( ) who never supported President Trump’s plans for a wall, saying they did not think he could get “Mexico to pay for the wall” as he promised on the campaign trail. Maria Espinoza, national director of the Remembrance Project, a   representing the victims of illegal immigrant crime and their families, testified that: Americans will continue to be under assault until the wall is built   …     While it seemed as though the politicians listened and even publicly gave the families their condolences, congressional leadership, the bodies of both houses, Republican and Democrat, have failed to enact the very measures that would have saved American lives. America has spoken. We want the wall built right away   …     those who falsely state that a great border wall would not work either don’t know their history or are in denial. ” Agnes Gibbony, one of Espinoza’s “angel mothers” whose son was murdered by an illegal alien, took over to add her own horrific experience with lax border enforcement to the congressional record. Gibbony’s herself is an immigrant, fleeing to America with her parents in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev’s bloody Soviet intervention in her native Hungary in 1956. Her memory of immigration is a far cry from the lawless chaos on the southern border today. “We followed all the rules, the law. We followed all the background investigation   …     We also had to have character witnesses testify that we had good moral standing and my father was required to have a job contract,” she recalled for the Subcommittee. Gibbony’s  son, Ronald da Silva, was shot to death by an illegal in 2002. She told the Subcommittee: The shooter, the murderer, was an illegal alien with a long criminal record who had been previously deported. Immediately after the shooting, he fled to Mexico. His wife was depositing his welfare check at the credit union so he could live on it. He eventually returned to the United States and was sent to prison. He is due to be released in two years and seven months. I am afraid California will fail to notify ICE of his pending release. Gibbony’s pain, however, will go on longer than Ronald’s killer’s criminal case. “Ronald was my first and my only son,” Gibbony said, “I live a life sentence of pain and suffering, wondering what would Ronald look like. Would he have grey hair at age 44? Would he be married? What would he be doing?” Gibbony drew a direct link for the Members of Congress present from poor border enforcement to her and many other American’s victimization, pointing out that the true toll of illegal alien crime remains poorly documented: I will forever miss all the tomorrow and everything that was taken from me, all because of broken open borders   …     Hundreds of victims, innocent lives. I wonder how many more there are, because our government does not keep statistics on illegal aliens’ crimes. Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced the creation of the “Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement” office or VOICE in an effort to better track excess crime from illegal border crossing. Gibbony also called out the culture of giving sympathetic treatment to the illegal alien issue while ignoring people like her, victims of that same unchecked border crossing. “You may say it is inhumane to deport illegal aliens who didn’t care about breaking our laws. How inhumane is it that my son Ronald and thousands of innocent victims’ lives were cut short?” she asked. Steven A. Camarota, Director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a   dedicated to studying the consequences of immigration, laid out the economic case for the wall. He cited dates from a National Academies of Science paper and estimates of illegal alien educational achievement to reach some striking conclusions. “On balance if you take all the taxes that they’re likely to pay over their lifetime, given their education levels, and the services and costs they create, there’s a net drain on tax payers of about $75, 000 per illegal border crosser,” he told the subcommittee. If the illegal aliens’ descendants here in the United States are included, the net burden rises to $94, 000 for each illegal border crosser. “The fiscal cost of illegal immigrants is not due to the fact that they don’t want to work. It’s not even due to the fact that many work off the books. Rather, it reflects their educational attainment,” Camarota noted, “The bottom line is, unskilled immigration, which characterizes most illegal immigrants, is costly to tax payers. ” Camarota told the Subcommittee that the wall stands a good chance of being a net fiscal boon to the United States. “If we were to stop just  % of those crossers in the next decade, it would generate $  billion in savings  …    in effect, the wall could pay for itself even if it only kept out a small fraction of people expected to come,” he testified. Agent Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, added his own practical experience on the border to the mix. “As an agent who worked in two of the busiest sectors in the history of the border patrol, I can personally tell you how effective border barriers are,” he told the Subcommittee. Judd was clear that he does not think it is necessary to build 2, 000 miles of wall across the entire border, but that the effect in certain strategic locations could be substantial. “Border security is not cheap, but the cost of doing nothing is much higher,” he stressed. Judd further testified that the wall is not a “silver bullet” and would have to work in conjunction with other border security measures including staffing up the Border Patrol and cracking down on   “sanctuary” cities. Mr. Stodder, the former Obama administration official opposed to the wall, called it a “massive waste of billions of taxpayer dollars. ” Stodder mocked analyses like Camarota’s, noting that net immigration from Mexico has markedly decreased in recent years, telling the Subcommittee, “The fear that America is somehow being overwhelmed by massive numbers of Mexican economic migrants seeking to cross the Rio Grand to take our jobs   …     [is an] outdated talking point from the 1990s. ” While disapproving of the wall, Stodder agreed that “our immigration system is indeed in crisis. ” But he attributed this to “straining from the flow of Central American asylum seekers. ” According to him: The Wall will not help address the most pressing migration challenge we face, which stems from the crisis in Central America, whereby thousands of Guatemalan, El Salvadoran, and Honduran families (and unaccompanied children) have been fleeing violence, extreme poverty, and environmental crises, and coming to our border to seek asylum here, we need more resources specifically devoted to addressing this challenge   …     suffice it to say, a wall is not going to help. Asked by Chairman DeSantis whether the drop in border crossings referenced by Stodder was related to the new “posture” of the Trump administration, Agent Judd replied, “I know it is. When we interview these individuals who are currently crossing the border, they know that the laws are going to be enforced. ” “But I must warn you,” Judd added, “We’re in a ‘honeymoon period.’ We have to continue to enforce the laws, because if we don’t, illegal immigration is going to go back up. ”",0

Megyn Kelly is a news person with an agenda. Instead of reporting the news, she attempts to distort and manipulate facts to support her own agenda. Her latest victim is Donald Trump. A news source should not be trying to influence the American Voter. FOX professes to be fair and balance but Kelly loads her panels with those that support her views.

7226,Review: ‘Bad Santa 2’ Works Through Mommy Issues - The New York Times,"In the hall of fame of   comic characters, between wax works of W. C. Fields and Larry David, there ought to be a monument to Billy Bob Thornton’s work as Willie, the alcoholic safecracker of “Bad Santa. ” As much as Terry Zwigoff’s 2003 film relied on the spectacle of Mr. Thornton soiling himself in a Santa suit or saying unspeakable things to children, the performance was a master class in timing and sly reaction shots. Only Mr. Thornton could have played the role. Now comes a belated sequel, “Bad Santa 2,” directed by Mark Waters (already a connoisseur of bad behavior from “Mean Girls”) whose pitch meeting seems to have proceeded from two unnecessary questions: What if bad Santa weren’t as bad as all that? And what if he had an estranged mother whose conduct is at least as foul as his? Yet even the profanity has lost its zing in this   retread, which mostly prompts admiration for how far Mr. Zwigoff ran with one joke. When we   Willie (Mr. Thornton, looking resigned to his task) he is working as a valet parking attendant, a job that goes south after he is distracted by a   mother. Following our reunion with Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly)  —   Willie has promised to get the kid deflowered for his 21st birthday, which leads to a mortifying interlude with a prostitute (Octavia Spencer)  —   Willie accompanies his former partner (Tony Cox) to a prospective robbery in Chicago. (Shots of the city may be entirely stock footage, as if the movie crew knew tagging along might be a bad idea.) The target is a charity run by Diane (Christina Hendricks) and by her unfaithful husband (Ryan Hansen) who pockets most of the revenue. Dismayed about ripping off    —   mawkishness is the only aspect in which “Bad Santa 2” outpaces its predecessor  —   Willie is not above beating up a street Santa (Mike Starr) who gets into a dispute with him over a spot to stand. Diane, a target for Willie’s lewd advances, takes up the function of Lauren Graham’s character in the first film. If “Bad Santa 2” has anything new to offer, it’s the spectacle of Kathy Bates as Willie’s mom, whom Willie resents. (He offhandedly mentions having taken the fall for her at age 11.) Her remarks about her careless parenting (“Hell, I didn’t even know I’d given birth until I’d tripped over him”) constitute the movie’s best effort at a running joke, and while Ms. Bates can be a nimble scene stealer, decking her out in tattoos and punk jewelry is not enough to spark an uninspired script. “Bad Santa 2” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for Bad S’antics.

7227,Weekly Astrology for Nov. 7 -13 US Election Prediction [Video],"Leave a reply 
Joseph P Anthony – It’s presidential week in the United States, and although the job of being president has proven to be incredibly stressful, two candidates vying for this position are willing to take on this responsibility. 
On Election Day, Tuesday, November 8th, Mars is on schedule to leave Capricorn and enter Aquarius. This sign’s switch for Mars is an unmistakable signal that whoever is elected will move things in a new (and, given the nature of Aquarius, possibly surprising) direction. 
On Wednesday we should know whether the first female is elected or someone who is not a politician will break the glass ceiling, or simply that something unusual and surprising could be in store. 
On Friday, to November 11th, it’s time for Venus to rein in the wilder side of its nature in Sagittarius and buckle down as it enters practical Capricorn, focusing her attention on realistic aspirations regarding love and money for the next month. On Saturday, November 12th, Mercury emerges out of the depths of Scorpio and begins to bask in the Sagittarian worldview of cheerful and optimistic communication. 
This sign likes to focus it energy on the future of sports, travel, religion, politics, education, and philosophy. Mercury paints with a very large brush in Sagittarius, so for the next three weeks, be on the lookout for embellishments and exaggerations (the fish was this big), especially from the newly elected president.

7228,Mark Levin: Open Letter to CNN’s Brian Stelter - Breitbart,"The following is an open letter from conservative radio and television host Mark Levin to CNN host Brian Stelter, in response to Stelter’s article Monday at CNN. com, “Birth of a conspiracy theory: How Trump’s wiretap claim got started. ”[Did you listen to my show on Thursday, before President Trump tweeted? Did you watch my appearance on Fox and Friends Sunday morning? I know you are ticked I did not appear on your show, despite your numerous requests. Your ad hominem attacks about “right wing” radio host and conspiracy theory stuff   …     incredible.  I simply put together the stories that YOUR profession reported, on the public record. Do you deny there were two FISA applications? Do you deny the first was turned down? Do you deny the second was approved? It’s called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. It is about surveillance. The fact that we cannot discern all the details because of the secrecy, except for what the media have revealed and selective leaks by the government, should cause you to want to know more, not to trash those who point it out. And yes, we can make several logical implications based on events and experience. A FISA application is a big deal. One, or two in this case, that involve campaign surrogates, or a server or computer related to a candidate or campaign, etc. is a big deal. President Obama’s statement is not a definitive statement of anything, other than he, personally, did not order a wiretap, which I never claimed. But that does not mean he was unaware of surveillance activity by several of his departments, even through routine reports to the president, such as the Daily Intel Briefing or information conveyed to him or his staff via the Justice Department re the FBI   activities. As for Clapper, despite his past dissembling before Congress, he may not have been aware of what was taking place since the FBI   operation reportedly sought the warrant. The Daily Intel Briefing might provide useful information in that regard as well. Of course, the release of the FISA applications would also shed a lot of light on events, assuming YOU believe reports that they were filed. Furthermore, Clapper has said, as recently as yesterday, that no connections between the Russians and the Trump campaign have been found. I am extremely critical of Russia, Putin, and the efforts to influence our election, although I do not believe they succeeded. That said, how would Clapper know of no connections if he, as former Director of National Intelligence, didn’t look? On what is that based? Your lack of curiosity and dishonesty about such matters and in dealing with me demean you and your profession. You are free to circulate this communication to whomever you wish, as I am making it public.",0
7229,Knicks Invent New Type of Loss as Owner Banishes Charles Oakley - The New York Times,"The Knicks, who were already raising dysfunction to an art form with bad basketball and   Twitter posts from their famous team president, moved further into the surreal on Friday when the team’s owner announced that he was indefinitely barring one of the most popular players in franchise history from Madison Square Garden. The owner, James L. Dolan, can go years without engaging with the news media. But on Friday, he went on the radio to say that Charles Oakley, a stalwart member of some outstanding Knicks teams from the 1990s, would not be let into the Garden as a result of an altercation on Wednesday night that ended with Oakley being led from the arena in handcuffs while fans chanted his name. It was hard to find precedent for the Knicks’ decision  —   former players are normally treated like celebrities, not told they will not be allowed into a game even if they buy their own ticket  —   but it fit the almost bizarre image the franchise now seems to be busy creating for itself. Dolan, who announced the decision on Michael Kay’s afternoon program on ESPN Radio, said he was taking the step to bar Oakley out of concern for the safety of the team’s other paying customers. “We need to keep the Garden a place that’s comfortable and safe for everybody who goes there,” Dolan said. “So anybody who comes to the Garden  —   whether they’ve been drinking too much alcohol, they’re looking for a fight, they’re abusive, disrespectful to the staff and then fans  —   they’re going to be ejected and they’re going to be banned. ” Several times over the course of the   interview, Dolan described Oakley’s behavior on Wednesday night as out of line. Dolan also said that Oakley “may have a problem with alcohol” and that Oakley needed to seek help to control his anger. If Oakley were to address his behavioral issues, Dolan said, the Garden would most likely welcome him back. Oakley, 53, has long been estranged from the Knicks and has had an adversarial relationship with Dolan. But he has insisted he was not acting inappropriately on Wednesday night when he sat down not far from Dolan to watch the Knicks play the Los Angeles Clippers. A number of fans who were sitting near Oakley said they had not seen or heard him being belligerent. Other fans suggested that he seemed somewhat combative. In any case, after security guards approached him, a shoving match ensued, and that was followed by the    sight of Oakley being grabbed and led away. But many things with the Knicks are not easy to fathom. Their starting point guard, Derrick Rose, went AWOL for a day. The team itself has lost 20 of its past 26 games, continuing a run of futility that has dominated Dolan’s two decades as owner. And the team president, Phil Jackson, mimicking Dolan, has not spoken with reporters who cover the team since September. Jackson’s few communications have come via an isolated interview or two and occasional Twitter posts, some of them cryptic. But despite the little that he has said, he has still managed, at various moments, to anger both LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. And although he seems intent on trading away Anthony, the Knicks’ only star, Jackson has a problem: Anthony’s   clause. Asked about Jackson during the radio interview, Dolan asserted that he would stay out of his way despite the dismal results Jackson has produced in his nearly three years as team president. He said he would honor Jackson’s   contract “all the way to the end. ” But while Dolan has long been unpopular in New York and Jackson does not have many admirers these days, Oakley has plenty of support. The incident on Wednesday led to an outpouring of acclaim for him, not only from the team’s frustrated fans but also from current and former N. B. A. players, who have long admired the tough work ethic that Oakley displayed on the court. Given all the negative fallout from Oakley’s ejection, Dolan was asked in the interview whether the organization now felt embarrassed. “Well, I certainly think Charles should be embarrassed,” he said. Oakley, who was reached by telephone after Dolan’s radio interview concluded, said that he had not listened to the broadcast but had already heard about some of Dolan’s comments. “Nothing they’re doing makes sense,” Oakley said. “I mean, this man, something’s wrong with him. He crossed a bridge the first night, and then he’s been crossing another bridge every day since. ” Oakley, who has acknowledged that he had a couple of drinks before he arrived at Wednesday’s game, declined to address Dolan’s statement that he might have problems with alcohol. “I don’t talk about that stuff,” he said. “I have no comment on that. I don’t have to defend myself on that. The people around me know if I have a drinking problem or not. ” Asked if he planned to pursue legal action against Dolan or the organization, Oakley said, “We’ll see what happens. ’’ Oakley later wrote on Twitter that he was planning to hold a news conference next week. Meanwhile, neither Oakley nor those backing him are liable to take kindly to repeated suggestions by the Knicks  —   the first came in a statement on Wednesday night  —   that Oakley needs some kind of “help” for his behavior. Instead, there was more support for Oakley, with Michele Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, weighing in after Dolan’s interview. “Painful to believe that my last image of Oak at MSG is him dragged out of the arena,” Roberts wrote on Twitter. “Is that how we remember our Legends? #NoBan. ” Dolan said he hoped that Oakley would not be barred forever. He said he would love to honor Oakley at midcourt along with several of his former teammates  —   again, provided that he seeks help. “But his behavior, it just doesn’t work with that,” Dolan said. “Until he can address it and get it under control, then we probably won’t be able to do it. ’’ Dolan said it was clear to him that Oakley had gone to Wednesday’s game with an “agenda” to be disruptive. Oakley never should have been allowed to take his seat, Dolan said, which he cited as one of his reasons for firing Frank Benedetto, the Garden’s senior vice president for security, on Friday morning. Benedetto, who previously served with the United States Secret Service, could not be reached for comment. Dolan recalled how, during the first quarter of Wednesday’s game, a security guard approached him to relate that he and his   were having difficulties with Oakley. Dolan said he had asked if they could wait to deal with the problem between quarters to avoid a big scene on national television. The security guard agreed with him, Dolan said, but the situation escalated. “And I said, ‘You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do,’” Dolan said. “It wasn’t until it was pointed out to me that he was behind us, I sort of opened my ear and started to hear and what I heard was terrible,’’ Dolan added. At one point during the radio interview, Dolan was reminded that he does not give many interviews. “No,” he said, “this isn’t my favorite thing. ” Nor, no doubt, is watching his team lose again, which the Knicks did on Friday night at the Garden, falling to the Denver Nuggets,  . Dolan sat in his customary seat near the court. Oakley, meanwhile, was absent, except for the chants bearing his name.",0
7230,Hillary Clinton Maintains Swing State Leads As Comey Email Letter Flops,"By Jason Easley on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 10:52 am Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comey's letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The CBS News Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comey’s letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. 
Battleground tracker found that by a small margin Comey’s letter made Democrats more likely (net +7) to support Clinton. 
In the individual battleground states, Clinton leads by eight points in Pennsylvania 48%-40%, North Carolina (48%-45%), and in Colorado (42%-39%). The only state of the four polled where Trump has a small two point lead in Arizona (44%-42%). 
According to CBS News , “And the larger demographic difference defining the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has been a gender gap – slightly larger now than the last time in these states – that offsets a smaller movement of Republicans to Trump.” 
To put it another way, Hillary Clinton’s support with women is going up at a larger rate than Republican movement towards Trump. 
These are the first swing state polls to be taken since FBI Director Comey released his now infamous letter on Friday. The email story isn’t moving voters. It is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. Democrats are going to vote Clinton. Republicans are going to vote for Trump, and there aren’t enough undecided voters to swing the election to Trump. 
Republicans were hoping for a Hail Mary touchdown to save Trump, but Clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. If the Comey letter is the big October surprise, it isn’t working on voters.

7231,FBI Director James Comey’s Internal Memo On Hillary Investigation Was Just LEAKED,"Pinterest 
An internal letter to FBI employees from Director James Comey has just been leaked. 
The memo reveals some startling information that Democrats, and the liberal media, certainly would have preferred to keep hidden from the public. 
Among other things, we’ve learned that Comey believed the election required full disclosure regarding the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. 
Here is the full text: 
To all: 
This morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation. Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case. Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them. 
Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it. 
Jim Comey 


We’ve really got to hand it to Comey in this case. By all appearances, he decided to move quickly on this matter not in spite of , but because of the election. 
Now, the truth might turn out to be quite different from this take on things, but for right now, our judgments should be based on the reliable information at hand. 
And as it stands, Comey seems by all appearances to be genuinely interested in getting to the bottom of this Hillary email mess BEFORE the election, if at all possible. 
That’s admirable, especially coming from a public official. 
We’ll just have to wait to see what comes from it, and if Director Comey will stick with his guns. 
The survival of American democracy may depend on it.",0
7232,Chelsea Handler to Lead Anti-Trump ’Women’s March’ at Sundance,"Talk show host Chelsea Handler is set to lead a “Women’s March” at the Sundance Film Festival in January to protest the inauguration of   Donald Trump. [The march, set for January 21, will reportedly be held as part of a nationwide series of simultaneous marches set for the same day in all 50 states.  The flagship march, set to occur in Washington D. C. is expected to draw more than 100, 000 participants and has drawn endorsements from some   celebrities, including Amy Schumer. The Park City, Utah march is not sponsored by the Sundance Film Festival, which runs from January 19 to the 29 this year. Variety reports that Handler will also host a rally following what’s being dubbed “The Women’s March on Main. ” “Sundance has always been a platform for change, not only for filmmakers and filmmaking but also for big ideas for the future,” Handler said in a statement. “If there’s anything I learned in the last year, it’s that we need to be louder and stronger than ever about what we believe in, so I joined some incredible women from around the country to bring our voices together in the streets of Park City. The Women’s March on Main will be an opportunity for the creative community and those in Utah to stand beside those in D. C. ” Handler has been an outspoken critic of Trump since well before Election Day. She previously posed   with an   message scrawled on her back, and has also posed with a piñata bearing Trump’s likeness. In an interview at Variety‘s Entertainment and Tech Summit in September, the    talk show host said that Trump “represents everything that’s wrong in the world. ” “It’s always a good thing to be able to look at somebody and be like, ‘That’s the worst thing that could happen,’” she said. “And I think we should keep him in the spotlight. Not as president, obviously, but, you know, as The Apprentice or whatever that show is called. ” After Trump defeated former Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton in November, Handler penned an essay in which she criticized white women for voting for the Republican. “We don’t just have a problem with men supporting women in this country we have a problem with women supporting women,” she wrote in the essay for Arianna Huffington’s new company Thrive Global. “We can wake up America and American women to do a better job going forward to create an activist fire under women to start treating other women and our America with more respect than we have obsequiously shown for our traditional male dominators. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
7233,"At Donald Trump’s Convention, Matters of Control (and Self-Control) - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump has asked his wife, Melania, to address “women’s issues” in her speech at the Republican National Convention, he says, and his daughter Ivanka will talk about “her passion for gender equality. ” He plans to read their remarks beforehand and perhaps suggest “ideas, jokes, points about Trump. ” And when they take the podium in Cleveland, he may hop on Twitter to offer his own analysis and feedback. “They’re very smart women,” Mr. Trump said in a recent interview. Smiling, he added, “I’m sure there won’t be anything for me to criticize. ” A political newcomer, an impulsive provocateur, a man who likes total control: Mr. Trump is unlike any presidential nominee who has tried to organize and execute a convention before. For some Republicans, his fiery and   style has heightened their excitement about the   political pageant that begins Monday, while others are fearing what’s in store. These Republicans are queasy over the possibility of Mr. Trump going off   if a convention moment is not to his liking or rebellious delegates go ahead with a plan to try to block his nomination, while some are concerned that he will be   in urging speakers to attack the Clintons, immigrants or others with language that alienates undecided voters. With waves of protesters expected outside Quicken Loans Arena and more than 850 delegates inside the hall who are pledged to Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, Mr. Trump will have only so much ability to influence the proceedings or keep the cameras away from his antagonists. His   instincts have fueled peculiar behavior before, like calling the CNN control room this spring to try to shape coverage of a critical story. If he indulges in rash decisions, they could easily create media firestorms that overshadow the convention themes and messages that are intended to unite and rally the party. He could also undercut one of his top goals at the convention: to rebrand himself as a steady leader, caring father and unwaveringly optimistic American after a stormy two months when his temperament and character have been relentlessly attacked and even fellow Republicans have accused him of making racist statements. Conventions can be a golden opportunity to recalibrate battered campaigns, as George Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all discovered. Yet the Republican convention looms as one of the most unpredictable in recent history because of Mr. Trump’s own     nature. “Trump has got to balance what made him successful in the primaries  —   his unrehearsed, unvarnished way of communicating  —   with the forethought and demeanor that people still expect from a   president,” said former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a Republican. “But if he doesn’t show   things could go very badly at the convention. ” Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser to the Republican nominee John McCain in 2008, said the convention was riding on Mr. Trump’s behavior, unlike in past years when the speeches and the rollout of the running mate were more significant factors. “All of Trump’s recent mistakes will be wiped away if the convention coherently frames this race as ‘change vs. more of the same,’ ” Mr. Schmidt said. “The biggest threat to that could be Trump’s own actions. ” Mr. Trump’s management of the convention has not been reassuring to many Republicans. While he said in the interview that Cleveland would be “overbooked with speakers,” his list of speakers came out only on Wednesday night  —   a week later than originally planned  —   and he has so alienated leading Republicans and rising party stars that many of them, from the two former presidents Bush to various Senate candidates, plan to stay away. At one point, Mr. Trump even said that Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, and Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, would not be invited to speak at the convention unless they endorsed him. Mr. Cruz, after a meeting with Mr. Trump last week, is now expected to speak Mr. Kasich has indicated that he won’t be spending time inside the convention hall  —   an   snub for a governor of the state hosting his own party’s convention. At his office at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been   about the   event  —   calling up political allies and friends to invite them to speak  —   but also delegating organizing duties to top aides who already have enormous responsibilities, given the relatively small number of campaign staff members. “Trump is a guy who sees he has three weeks to plan a convention, but thinks he only needs the last week to pull the whole thing together,” said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker and a possible running mate. “He’s still new to all this, but at the same time wants a lot of control over how the convention will work. ” Two Trump advisers declined to predict how the nominee would react to the    proceedings and media coverage of the convention, though one of them expressed concern that Mr. Trump might say something or unleash a Twitter post that undercuts a unifying message or roils Republicans in the arena. They described planning for the convention as somewhat haphazard, saying that Mr. Trump’s focus on lining up speakers had been hot or cold on any given day, and that he had not spent much time making calls to convention speakers to strategize about their remarks and encourage them. The advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said they could not rule out Mr. Trump making decisions on the fly next week to try to influence the convention. Low points at past conventions, like the empty chair next to Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican convention and Pat Buchanan’s fiery and  divisive speech in 1992, were the result of impulsive decisions, according to several Republicans involved with those gatherings. They warned that Mr. Trump could do himself real damage if he injected himself or his opinions into carefully scripted or choreographed convention moments. “More than anything Republicans want to see Trump demonstrating discipline and unity and a message that will appeal to independents,” said Kevin Madden, a senior adviser in Mr. Romney’s 2012 campaign. “A     convention could really help Trump, but he has a way of being undisciplined, bombastic and controversial at the worst possible moments. ” Some of the most successful convention moments were often the result of careful planning, stagecraft and writing. For some Republicans, Ann Romney delivered the best speech of the party’s gathering in 2012 because she went to great lengths to present a loving portrait of Mitt Romney that was more fully rounded than his reputation as a wealthy businessman. The energetic performance of Sarah Palin electrified the 2008 Republican convention, and the 2004 Democratic keynote address by Barack Obama, then a Senate candidate from Illinois, catapulted him to national prominence. And Bill Clinton enjoyed one of the biggest   bounces in the polls in 1992 after several nights of uplifting speeches and pageantry, from the glowing documentary film “The Man From Hope” to memorable moments from Hillary Clinton, a beaming Virginia Kelley (Mr. Clinton’s mother) and the nominee himself. James Carville, the senior strategist for the 1992 Clinton campaign, said Mr. Clinton had had a specific problem to fix at the convention: Too many Americans assumed he was an entitled baby boomer, perhaps even a child of privilege who grew up to become a wealthy liberal elitist. “We needed to put his ideas and policies in a personal context, and once they understood he was ‘the man from Hope,’ it started to change a lot of people’s attitudes about him,” Mr. Carville said. “We couldn’t afford to go into the convention without a clear plan and strategy. Few nominees can. You just can’t wing this and succeed. ” Mr. Trump, during the interview in his Trump Tower office, pointed to his decades as a real estate developer and popular television personality as evidence that he knows how to manage major projects without being unnecessarily controlling or impulsive. He said he would be happy if Americans came away from the convention with a clearer understanding of his hopes and aspirations for the nation and a better sense of him as a person, which he is counting on his wife and his children to provide in their speeches. And while he said he cared greatly about his poll numbers, his top goal wasn’t to leave the convention with a greater edge over Mrs. Clinton. “I don’t really care about a bounce, not as much as other things,” Mr. Trump said. “My measure of success is we have a good solid message about trade, terrorism, the Second Amendment, Obamacare and the depletion of our military. If I can control that message, if we can deliver it really clearly in Cleveland, that will be a big success. ”",0

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Speaking at Reverend Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park in Fort Lauderdale, Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton was interrupted by a Donald Trump supporter who shouted: “Bill Clinton is a rapist!” He was no doubt working for the $5,000 reward offered by InfoWars. But Clinton was having none of it. Rather than ignoring the man, she issued a stern rebuke. Stabbing her finger at the man, she said: 
“You know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump.” 
The man continued to shout, waving his sign, and the crowd countered with cries of “Hillary! Hillary!” as she said, 
“It is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we’re going forward into a brighter future.” 
The protester was escorted out by security, and Clinton told the man, and everyone like him, “You may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. Don’t be used. Don’t be exploited.” 
See the protester’s antics here. Note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by Clinton supporters: 
Sadly, all too many angry white Christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by Donald Trump, who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the American dream, a man whom, as Clinton says, has taken everything, and given nothing. 
Last night, in Florida, Hillary Clinton was taking nothing, and giving everything.

7237,Afghanistan Is in Chaos. Is That What Hamid Karzai Wants? - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Hamid Karzai, the former Afghan president and current antagonist to his successor’s government, likes to describe Afghan politics as a marathon. To the long roll call of visitors he meets each day  —   regional power brokers and elders, government officials, religious leaders,   who reminisce longingly about his years in power  —   the metaphor is clear. Mr. Karzai has never stopped running, never stopped maneuvering, and he won’t. Mr. Karzai’s critics, especially those close to President Ashraf Ghani, accuse him of working from the wings to destabilize the government and exploit a moment of national crisis to try to return to power  —   or at least to force some concessions. They say Mr. Karzai is actively undermining a vulnerable president, maintaining an alternate pole of political influence and patronage, and stoking protest movements that some fear could turn violent. So what is Mr. Karzai’s answer? He flatly denies that he is trying to harm the government. But then there’s the hint of a wry smile: “If there are some people running faster, those who are falling behind should not complain. ” Following Mr. Karzai through days of meetings  —   dozens of discussions, and interviews on and off camera  —   it becomes clear that he is still operating like a man in power. His many visitors come to seek his leverage in the government, and he is happy to pick up the telephone to call a minister, a governor or an ambassador. He still communicates with world leaders, signing letters to them on a weekly basis. Much of Mr. Karzai’s politics happens around noon, when a larger crowd gathers for a group prayer on the grass outside and then follows him upstairs to a sunlit dining table for lunch. On a given day, there are former and current government officials, generals, judges, bankers, tribal elders, former members of the Taliban and preachers from Kabul’s major mosques. A master storyteller and conversationalist, Mr. Karzai takes his seat at the head of the table. “Who is raising this question out there, that I am returning?” Mr. Karzai began one recent conversation over stuffed peppers, vegetable rice, and chicken cooked with carrots. “I have made it clear I don’t want to. ” But that was good enough to stir a spirited conversation, full of anecdotes about his days in power and how people do not trust the current government. One former cabinet minister, who still serves as an adviser to Mr. Ghani, insisted that Mr. Karzai was the only natural alternative, and a great hope to the 90 percent of the country disenchanted with the current government. Mr. Karzai listened attentively. He took another bite. He seems to invite the question hanging over him: If Mr. Karzai does not want to return to power, just what is he trying to achieve by increasing pressure on a government already on the brink? And it is on the brink. In private conversations, Afghan and Western officials alike worry that Mr. Ghani’s administration may be facing an existential crisis that could peak as soon as next month. The end of September is the deadline for the government to meet the commitments of a political deal brokered by Secretary of State John Kerry after the catastrophic 2014 election dispute. By then, Afghanistan is supposed to hold parliamentary elections, enact sweeping electoral reforms, and amend the Constitution to create the position of prime minister for Mr. Ghani’s election rival and current governing partner, Abdullah Abdullah. But staying on schedule was already impossible many months ago, and Mr. Kerry has publicly insisted that Mr. Ghani’s government will remain through the end of its   term, regardless. That is just the beginning. The country’s security situation is worsening, despite the American military’s increased  involvement in the fighting. The Taliban have seized many districts, and they threaten to take many more. Mr. Ghani, the constant technocrat, has been forced to focus on security, and his economic initiatives have stalled. And suddenly he has also been challenged by a street protest movement in which ethnic Hazaras are accusing his government of systematic discrimination. The most recent of the demonstrations was struck by a suicide bombing, claimed by the Islamic State, that left at least 80 people dead. Now the demonstrators accuse the government of purposely leaving them vulnerable to attack, and they have given Mr. Ghani an ultimatum to meet their demands  —   another September deadline, as it turns out. On top of all that, a new protest movement, potentially more dangerous, is growing just north of Kabul, the capital, calling for the government to rebury with dignity a northern bandit king who has been dead for nearly a century, shot by a firing squad. Among the people calling for the reburial, and threatening protests, are northern militia commanders who have long been skeptical of Mr. Ghani, and they have also given him a September ultimatum. Government officials accuse Mr. Karzai and his allies of having a hand in the recent protests. But he says he is after neither the collapse of the government nor a return to power. “I have absolutely no doubt about that,” he said. He just wants the government’s legitimacy affirmed after the September deadline, he said, and the only way left is to call a traditional loya jirga  —   a grand assembly of tribal elders from across the country. Mr. Karzai’s push for a loya jirga is the move most widely seen as a game plan for returning to power, or at least for negotiating more leverage. His strength is with the tribes and the power brokers he has maintained at his side, while Mr. Ghani has alienated many of them. It helps to understand that Mr. Karzai represents an entire network of power  —   national as well as local  —   accumulated over 13 years and beyond. That network feels that it is slowly being uprooted under Mr. Ghani’s presidency, and that it could be vastly weakened if the current government survives the September deadline intact. In Kandahar, powerful strongmen who owe their rise to Mr. Karzai’s protection have had standoffs recently with officials sent by Mr. Ghani over lucrative custom taxes and where the money goes. A northern lawmaker who stopped by to see Mr. Karzai complained that the government was cutting her off and working “so beautifully and systematically” to weaken their mutual support base. She might not return from vacation abroad, she said, if the situation continued and Mr. Karzai did not signal his plan clearly. If it came to an open political struggle, it is unclear whether Mr. Ghani would be able to score points with what would be perhaps his best case to make against Mr. Karzai: that the seeds of the current security and political crises were sown on Mr. Karzai’s watch, and that the former president left him a system suffocating in corruption and patronage. That is in part because Mr. Karzai has been busy using his social acumen to try to shed a more favorable light on his legacy after 13 years in power. Mr. Karzai, who lives a stone’s throw from the presidential palace, says his routine has changed little since he was president. He has more free time to relax in the afternoons, but his mornings are busier. He meets more people than he did when he was in power. On average, his office estimated, Mr. Karzai sees more than 400 people a month. Every Eid,   Muslim celebrations that come twice a year, Mr. Karzai opens his gates to a flow of visitors, reaching up to 6, 000 people. From the moment he leaves his residence in the morning, his two young daughters tugging at his trousers, he is a man on the move, trailed by secret service agents. Mr. Karzai, 58, describes himself as hyperactive, and he is  . He drinks four or five espressos a day. He still moves with ease among drastically different groups of people, from Oruzgan elders who interrupt him with passionate diatribes, to groups of youths coming to present him with their latest research. Mr. Karzai makes them laugh, and when they shed tears, as one group visiting from central Afghanistan did during a recent audience, he offers tissues. As for what he might be seeking from all of this, Western officials in Kabul acknowledge that Mr. Karzai, a masterful tactician and politician, does not necessarily need to have a clear concept of what he wants. He can mount pressure on the government in ways big and small, throw many irons in the fire, and perhaps force a critical blunder from Mr. Ghani. But Mr. Ghani is not without resources. Much will depend on how many opposition figures the president can   to keep Mr. Karzai at least partly on the margins. Mr. Karzai reserves his sharpest criticism of the government for what he considers its biggest sin: cozying up, “immensely, sadly,” to the United States and relying on it for its survival. Mr. Karzai, who sent flowers to the American ambassador for the Fourth of July and then signed a   note to the ambassador for thanking him, said in an interview with The New York Times last week that “the Americans, whose primary slogan is democracy, are making a sham of democracy in Afghanistan. ” He is not fundamentally against the American presence, he says: He just wants them to stop bombing his country and interfering in the political process, which he accused Mr. Kerry of doing in the spring when he insisted on a   Ghani government. “This is a blatant interference to undermine the sovereignty of Afghanistan,” Mr. Karzai said in the interview. “Look at this country: What do we have other than our pride and sovereignty? Then someone comes  —   from a good place, America  —   stands here in our country to determine the duration of our government as he sees fit? That is an insult. ” Meanwhile, the streams of visitors continue, and Mr. Karzai regales them with parables that at times seem like bids for redemption, and at others like foresight. During one lunch, he told a story of a group of tired travelers in a desert who see a fire in the distance and hear drums. Men are dancing the   called Attan. The travelers decide to spend the night there, and to make their hosts feel comfortable, they join in the dance. But the dance stretches on and on. “One of the travelers is wise, he realizes it is the devil’s dance and it will go on all night,” Mr. Karzai told the guests. “When the morning comes, there would be no sign of a dance or the devils. ” He paused, then drove the point home: “We are stuck in the dance of the devil,” he said, to chuckles. “When the sun rises, the devils will be gone, but we will be left in this dry land. ”",0
7238,Memo to the Next Administration: Defense Spending Must Be For Actual Defense,"Written by Ron Paul Sunday November 13, 2016 In a disturbing indication of how difficult it would be to bring military spending in line with actual threats overseas, House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry (R – TX) told President Obama last week that his war funding request of $11.6 billion for the rest of the year was far too low. That figure for the last two months of 2016 is larger than Spain’s budget for the entire year! And this is just a “war-fighting” supplemental, not actual “defense” spending! More US troops are being sent to Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere and the supplemental request is a way to pay for them without falling afoul of the “sequestration” limits.The question is whether this increase in US military activity and spending overseas actually keeps us safer, or whether it simply keeps the deep state and the military-industrial complex alive and well-funded.Unfortunately many Americans confuse defense spending with military spending. The two terms are used almost interchangeably. But there is a huge difference. I have always said that I wouldn’t cut anything from the defense budget. We need a robust defense of the United States and it would be foolish to believe that we have no enemies or potential enemies.The military budget is something very different from the defense budget. The military budget is the money spent each year not to defend the United States, but to enrich the military-industrial complex, benefit special interests, regime-change countries overseas, maintain a global US military empire, and provide defense to favored allies. The military budget for the United States is larger than the combined military spending budget of the next seven or so countries down the line.To get the military budget in line with our real defense needs would require a focus on our actual interests and a dramatic decrease in spending. The spending follows the policy, and the policy right now reflects the neocon and media propaganda that we must run the rest of the world or there will be total chaos. This is sometimes called “American exceptionalism,” but it is far from a “pro-American” approach.Do we really need to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars manipulating elections overseas? Destabilizing governments that do not do as Washington tells them? Rewarding those who follow Washington’s orders with massive aid and weapons sales? Do we need to continue the endless war in Afghanistan even as we discover that Saudi Arabia had far more to do with 9/11 than the Taliban we have been fighting for a decade and a half? Do we really need 800 US military bases in more than 70 countries overseas? Do we need to continue to serve as the military protection force for our wealthy NATO partners even though they are more than capable of defending themselves? Do we need our CIA to continue to provoke revolutions like in Ukraine or armed insurgencies like in Syria?If the answer to these questions is “yes,” then I am afraid we should prepare for economic collapse in very short order. Then, with our economy in ruins, we will face the wrath of those countries overseas which have been in the crosshairs of our interventionist foreign policy. If the answer is no, then we must work to convince our countrymen to reject the idea of Empire and embrace the United States as a constitutional republic that no longer goes abroad seeking monsters to slay.

7239,"Mosul Suicide Bomber Was British, Says Islamic State","BAGHDAD (AFP)  —   The Islamic State group on Monday claimed responsibility for a suicide attack near Mosul it said was carried out by a British suicide bomber, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. [“The   brother Abu Zakariya    —   may Allah accept him  —   detonated his   vehicle on a headquarters of the Rafidhi army and its militias in Tal Kisum village, southwest of Mosul,” the claim quoted by SITE said.  The IS statement did not say when the bombing occurred. The jihadist group uses the word “rafidha” which means “rejectionists” to refer to Shiite Muslims in a derogatory way because it considers them heretics. Forces from the Hashed   (Popular Mobilisation) a paramilitary umbrella dominated by Shiite militias backed by Tehran, are active in the area mentioned in the statement. They are fighting alongside other Iraqi forces  —   including the army and the federal police  —   as part of a push that started on Sunday to retake the west bank of Mosul. Tens of thousands of Iraqi forces launched a massive offensive on October 17 to retake the city, which is Iraq’s second largest and the only remaining major stronghold of the jihadists in the country. They retook control of the eastern side of Mosul last month. IS fighters of a variety of nationalities, including Britons, have carried out suicide attacks on many occasions in Iraq and Syria in the past three years. The IS statement said that the British fighter’s attack, and that of another suicide bomber of Iraqi nationality, caused many casualties but AFP could not immediately verify the claim.",0
7240,Kazakhstan on the Lookout for Nuclear Security | New Eastern Outlook,"Region: Central Asia In November 2016, the Majilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan approved the creation of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Low-Enriched Uranium Bank on its territory. Low-enriched uranium (LEU) is a material used for making fuel for nuclear power plants (NPP). The International Atomic Energy Agency decided to create a strategic LEU warehouse in 2006. The project’s aim is to secure an uninterrupted supply of fuel to the NPPs of the IAEA Member States. However, the Bank will not be used for regular LEU supply. This will be an emergency reserve, which will only be used in exceptional circumstances. The IAEA will own the official LEU reserves. It was decided to place the Bank in one of the Agency’s Member States. The location of choice might be a state with no nuclear weapons but with the technologies and infrastructure to work with LEU. In addition, the country should enjoy a good reputation in the IAEA. Kazakhstan complied with all these requirements. The Republic of Kazakhstan is a large-scale producer of uranium with the relevant technologies and experience, which includes processing high-enriched uranium into LEU (which is important for nuclear disarmament). Kazakhstan decided to participate in the development of peaceful atomic energy and filed an application to the IAEA in summer 2011. Kazakhstan proposed two locations for the Bank: a plot at the former Semipalatinsk test site and the Ulba Metallurgical Plant (Ust-Kamenogorsk). After inspection of both sites by the Agency’s experts, the second site was chosen. The Ulba Metallurgical Plant has almost a half a century of experience in working with radioactive materials and high-skilled experts – a legacy of the Soviet school. In addition, the enterprise has been greatly upgraded and it meets the highest safety requirements. In April 2015, a decree of the Kazakhstan Parliament approved a treaty with the IAEA on the creation of the LEU Bank in Kazakhstan. In August 2015, this Treaty was signed by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Kazakhstan Erlan Idrissov and the IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano. The preparation works involving IAEA experts are in full swing. Prior to the placement of the LEU Bank in Kazakhstan, its government will have to improve both the infrastructure and legislation in order to comply with international safety criteria. The foundation has already been laid: the law On the Use of Nuclear Power was adopted in January 2016. IAEA experts participated in the preparation of some amendments to the new law. There is a lot still to be done to make the new warehouse as safe as possible for the local citizens and the environment. All the material will be stored in containers that comply with European standards. According to IAEA data, the uranium reserves will be enough to provide electricity to a big city for 3 years. The IAEA will bear all the expenses related to uranium transportation, taxes, and guarantees in respect of the LEU Bank. Kazakhstan will have to run the warehouse at its own expense – provide it with electricity, pay salaries to the employees (citizens of Kazakhstan), etc. In acknowledgement of the placement and maintenance of the LEU Bank on its territory, Kazakhstan expects that the IAEA will assist it in the development of the nuclear industry. Right now, the IAEA Commission is working in Kazakhstan and conducting general research of the nuclear infrastructure. Upon completion of its work, the Commission will prepare a report with recommendations for the development of Kazakhstan’s nuclear industry. The Republic possesses huge reserves of uranium and ranks first in the world in terms of its production. Uranium from Kazakhstan forms a large part of the world uranium market. Moreover, Kazakhstan has long dreamed of supplying more than just raw materials or semi-finished products to other countries. It hopes to independently carry out all the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle right up to uranium conversion into nuclear fuel for the nuclear power plants. The export of nuclear fuel is greatly more profitable. The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev mentioned this objective during a meeting with the Chairman of the Board of Kazatomprom Askar Zhumagaliyev that took place in early November 2016. He noted that to reach this goal, Kazakhstan should intensify cooperation with other states and international organizations in the nuclear industry. It should be noted that one of the major partners of Kazakhstan in the nuclear industry is Russia. Owing to its interaction with Russia, Kazakhstan has made progress in the independent production of nuclear fuel. This cooperation continues: in October 2016, Astana hosted the Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum with the participation of the Presidents of the two countries – Vladimir Putin and Nursultan Nazarbayev. As a result, Russia and Kazakhstan adopted a plan of collaboration until 2018 and signed a Memorandum on expanding strategic partnership in the field of the nuclear fuel cycle. The Memorandum confirms all the previous agreements between the two countries in respect of the collaboration in the nuclear industry, including uranium production and processing. In addition, the document mentions the opportunity of Russia and Kazakhstan’s mutual participation in IAEA projects. The placement of the LEU Bank in the territory of the Republic is a grand gesture towards the IAEA, which will raise the profile of Kazakhstan in the eyes of other states. The LEU bank will prevent existing nuclear reactors from experiencing fuel deficit and it will promote the non-proliferation of the nuclear weapons. In fact, countries wishing to develop peaceful atomic energy often have to enrich uranium on their own in order to make fuel from it. Meanwhile, the IAEA fears that some of them may exceed the enrichment level for peaceful purposes and obtain material for the creation of nuclear weapons. The LEU Bank, which any of the IAEA Member States may turn to, will mean they no longer have to enrich uranium independently thus reducing the threat of the nuclear weapon proliferation. Thus, Kazakhstan may become a strategically important member of the IAEA and participate in ensuring global security. Apart from a reputation boost and assistance in the nuclear projects, this may attract the attention of foreign investors. According to the government of Kazakhstan, the volume of foreign investment in the country’s economy increased 5 times in the first half of 2016 and amounted to almost 6 billion US dollars. This growth is undoubtedly linked to Kazakhstan’s improved international standing, which has partially resulted from its cooperation with the IAEA.

7241,Russia Asks CIA: Why Did Hillary Clinton Just Buy $137 Million Worth Of Illegal Arms?,"
A stunning Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that the Security Council (SC), this morning, authorized the sending to the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of an emergency communiquĂŠ requesting an immediate explanation as to why Hillary Clintonâ€™s money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, this past week, purchased over $137 million of illegal arms and ammunitionâ€”and whose destination is to be the United States, with delivery being marked as â€œmid-November 2016â€. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, SVR analysts began expressing â€œurgent concernâ€ earlier this year when the main â€œelements/factionsâ€ of the feared Viktor Boutâ€™s international arms smuggling crime organization began arriving in the Republic of Albaniaâ€”that is the only Muslim nation in Europe.
Viktor Bout, this report explains, is most popularly known in the West as the â€œLord of Warâ€ for his workings with the CIA to smuggle illegal weapons throughout the world to further the maniacal interests of the United Statesâ€”until 2011 when then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had him jailed.
Though a citizen of the Federation, this report continues, the SVR had no â€œcomplaint/concernâ€ with Hillary Clinton having Bout jailed for 25 years as it was an internal matter of the CIAâ€”but whose intelligence analysts expressed â€œworry/confusionâ€ this past May (2016) when US Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin said he should have had a reduced sentenceâ€”and that led, yesterday, to Bout â€œsuddenly/magicallyâ€ being transferred out of maximum security to the â€œcountry club atmosphereâ€ of the general ward of the US Federal Prison heâ€™s been confined to.
CIA illegal arms smuggler Viktor Bout
Coinciding with Boutâ€™s â€œmysterious/magicalâ€ prison transfer yesterday, this report notes, was Hillary Clintonâ€™s money laundering Clinton Foundation transferring $137.7 million to the Socialist Party of Albania (SPA) controlled by that nations Prime Minister Edi Ramaâ€”who is not only the head of the Xhakja Clan (known in the West as the Albanian Mafia) but who was, also, and shockingly, put into power by the Obama-Clinton regime over the protests of the Albanian people who did not want a â€œmafia governmentâ€ controlling them.
Hillary Clinton (left) and Albanian Xhakja Clan mafia crime leader Edi Rama (right)
With Hillary Clintonâ€™s international arms merchant Prime Minister Rama having turned the entire Balkan region into one of the worldâ€™s largest areas for arms smuggling that now threatens its very security, this report warns, she has been aided in this effort by what many are calling her â€œpuppet masterâ€â€”the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros that recently released, and shocking, secret emails show him ordering Hillary Clinton to install this mafia criminal as the leader of Albania.
To fully understand why Hillary Clinton made this massive arms purchase, and no doubt was aided in doing so by the CIAâ€™s arms smuggler Viktor Bout, SVR analysts in this report explain, is her adherence to George Sorosâ€™s radical vision of open bordersâ€”and that he singlehandedly began implementing by creating the European refugee crisis that will, likewise, engulf the United States should Hillary Clinton become president, and as exactly as her secret emails reveals she plans on doing.
Also, this report continues, and as the Federation knows all to well, the Soros-Clinton â€œmaster planâ€ to take down a nation begins with the establishment of what are called Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) to act as a â€œshadow governmentâ€ ready to take power once the established order is thrown into chaos by massive protestsâ€”and why, in 2013, President Putin banned them from operating in Russia.
In the United States, however, this report grimly states, the American people have no defense against these â€œshadow governmentâ€ NGOâ€™sâ€”and that SVR intelligence assests have documented in this report as being the â€œreceiving partiesâ€ of Hillary Clintonâ€™s massive arms purchase and include the George Soros created NGOâ€™s called: Open Society Foundations, Media Matters, American Institute for Social Justice, The New America Foundation, The Migration Policy Institute, Tides Foundation, Center for American Progress, and the Democracy Allianceâ€”every single one of which stands violently opposed to the US Constitution and the American people.
Once these weapons are in the hands of Hillary Clintonâ€™s â€œnew revolutionariesâ€, this report continues, they will then be used to unleash a â€œterror waveâ€ across America protesting Donald Trumpâ€™s landslide victoryâ€”thus enabling President Obama to declare martial law to disarm all of these people, and once doing so, allow the US Electors to place Hillary Clinton in power. [Note: American presidents are NOT elected by the voting of citizens, but by the vote of the Electors selected from each of that nations 50 States.]
This report sadly concludes, though, by noting that the massive vote fraud already being committed by Hillary Clintonâ€™s â€œnew revolutionariesâ€ throughout the United States, and that led this past week to former US Congressman Joe Walsh stunningly stating â€œIf Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musketâ€â€”a reference to one of the darkest times in American history when that nationâ€™s ordinary citizens banded together to fight the British Empire for their freedomâ€”should strike fear into all Americans of what Hillary Clintonâ€™s â€œnew revolutionariesâ€ are doing right nowâ€”and if not, nothing will.

Con la mesa repleta de vasos vacíos de whisky, un destrozado Pedro Sánchez lleva más de treinta horas llorando delante de Jordi Évole y continúa contestando la entrevista para ‘Salvados’ que se emitió el pasado domingo por la noche. Han informado de ello dos miembros del equipo de Salvados que han logrado abandonar el bar. 
“Pedro está agarrando a Évole muy fuerte del brazo mientras explica cómo la gestora truncó sus planes de futuro”, explica el realizador del programa. Según dice, Sánchez lleva pidiendo “una última copa” desde ayer al mediodía para poder seguir hablando con alguien. 
Évole ha podido dormir tres horas esta madrugada mientras Pedro Sánchez le explicaba cómo le habían sentado los artículos de opinión publicados en El País en los que le atacaban. 
“Al final la gente… la gente mira por lo suyo y ya está”, ha explicado Pedro Sánchez ante las cámaras, apagadas desde ayer a las seis de la tarde. 
“Yo qué sé. ¿Me compensa todo esto? Pues no sé… Yo… No sé. De todo se aprende y se me pasará, claro, pero no sé si me compensa o no”, ha declarado Sánchez ignorando por completo si el programa se había emitido ya o no. 
“Yo… no sé”, ha insistido Pedro Sánchez ante un agotado Jordi Évole. 
“Estoy genial, esto es una oportunidad”, ha dicho entre lágrimas un total de 159 veces, según las fuentes. El propietario del bar en el que se ha grabado la entrevista les ha entregado la cuenta un total de 17 veces. 
Durante toda la mañana, Sánchez ha intentado convencer a Évole de que se una a él y a Pablo para formar un partido político porque “le gustamos a la gente”. “El PSOE nació en un bar como este, Jordi, con gente joven y con empuje como nosotros”, decía el exdiputado socialista. 
“Mira, lo hemos hablado ya mucho, pero yo creo que al final… la gente hace lo que puede y algunos tienen más suerte y otros no tanta. El País, González… la gente hace lo que puede, ¿entiendes?”, ha insistido Sánchez durante toda la tarde. 
“Contigo se puede hablar, no como con esa gente, tú eres el único que me escucha”, le ha dicho Sánchez a Évole mientras éste intentaba no dar cabezadas. 
Según los testigos, el presentador hace tres horas que ya ni se molesta en decirle a Sánchez “ahora tienes que intentar protegerte, a nivel personal, emocional”, como le decía esta mañana. 
A última hora, fuentes de La Sexta han informado de que Pedro Sánchez ha pedido dos últimas últimas copas de whisky. “Y luego me ayudas a enviarle un WhatasApp a la gente del partido y me ayudas a decidir qué les pongo”, ha dicho.",0
7243,News: Animal Welfare FTW! Oscar Mayer Now Requires Pork Producers To Give Their Pigs One Thrilling Sexual Experience Before Sending Them To Slaughter,"Email 
The cruelty of factory farms is a daily nightmare for billions of animals, but that might soon start to change thanks to a forward-thinking initiative by one of the biggest names in the meat industry. In a humane act of compassion for their livestock, the Oscar Mayer Company now requires its pork suppliers to give their pigs one thrilling sexual experience before sending them to slaughter. 
It’s pretty difficult to overstate what a huge leap forward this is for animal rights. 
The details of the new policy are extremely promising: Once a pig reaches sexual maturity, factory workers must lather it in a warming lubricant and place it in an outdoor pen, where it will encounter dozens of sows in heat and boars specially bred to produce voluptuously potent pheromone levels. The pigs will then be encouraged to partake in any variety of sow-on-boar, sow-on-sow, boar-on-boar, or autoerotic swineplay they prefer. Only after they’ve bellowed long, guttural squeals of satisfaction will these pigs be killed, processed, and separated into their desirable parts for human consumption. 
Conscious consumers can rest assured: Oscar Mayer pork will have been treated to full prostate and teat stimulation via double-prodded toys, clamps, and strategically placed ice cubes before being sent to the slaughterhouse. Farmers will even have to install sprinklers emitting warm hog urine for any pig who might be into that. 
Wow. It seems like Oscar Mayer is truly dedicated to setting a new bar for ethical animal treatment. 
To put this in perspective, not even free-range operations keep pig behavior specialists on-site to spot hogs nearing ejaculation and pull them away in order to temporarily evade orgasm, thereby extending the hog’s arousal and making their eventual climaxes that much more explosive. For a household meat brand like Oscar Mayer to endorse this kind of practice is a really, really big deal. 
“Before slaughter, we intend to treat our pigs to nothing less than the absolute highest order of hoof-shattering orgasms,” said Oscar Mayer President Mark Magnesen in a press release. “Our commitment to the well-being of animals means ensuring that no pig reaches an abbatoir without first experiencing a flesh romp so sensational it causes their numbing limbs to buckle under full-bodied tail-to-snout pleasure.” 
Just yes. Even PETA has to admit that this is a great new direction for pork producers. 
Taste tests held by the company revealed that customers unanimously preferred meat from sexually gratified pigs over meat from pigs raised under typical factory-farm stresses. Interested in trying some yourself, or just want to support the cause? Look for the special label they’ve created to specify that their products came from a pig they made squeal in wanton rapture. 
Well, it looks like Oscar Mayer is finally getting on the right side of animal rights history. This is exactly the thoughtful kind of action consumers want to see food companies enact. They could have easily just asked suppliers to masturbate a few pigs to completion and called it change, but the level of care they’re pouring into these bacchanalian thrills shows that they’re truly making animal welfare a priority. 
Any progress for farm animals is welcome progress, and hopefully this is a sign of even better living conditions to come. One blowout circus of carnal delights is the least they can do for these pigs.",0

[The minister told local media that closing the route and securing Europe’s external borders “is the only way to end the tragic and senseless dying in the Mediterranean.  “A rescue in the open sea cannot be a ticket to Europe, because it gives criminal gangs every argument to persuade people to escape their countries for economic reasons. ” Asked about measures Austria has in place to cope with a sudden influx of migrants over its border with Italy, Sobotka said the nation is now “equipped and able to ramp up controls within hours”. Last year, Austria backed closing the Western Balkan route used by migrants seeking to enter the more wealthy nations in Europe. Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said the country was one of 16 around the Balkan route, used by more than a million migrants to journey from Greece into Europe, who are working together to defend the borders. According to United Nations (UN) aid agencies, nearly 9, 000 migrants were picked up by European vessels and private charity ships in the Mediterranean over the Easter weekend. Despite the   numbers last year, Italy has seen a 30 per cent rise in immigration in the first quarter of 2017 over the same period in 2016. With the Easter weekend arrivals, the year’s total immigration into Italy now exceeds 37, 000. Last month, the European agency in charge of border control, Frontex, released a report accusing NGOs and “aid” organisations operating in the Mediterranean of complicity in human trafficking by lowering their costs and improving their “business model”. “Migrants and refugees  —   encouraged by the stories of those who had successfully made it in the past  —   attempt the dangerous crossing since they are aware of and rely on humanitarian assistance to reach the EU,” the report said.",0
7247,MSNBC’s Hunt to Sen Warren: Is McConnell ’Sexist’? - Breitbart,"Wednesday on MSNBC, Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) discussed being reprimanded on the Senate floor Tuesday for her comments against President Donald Trump’s Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ).  Several times, MSNBC political correspondent Kasie Hunt asked Sen. Warren if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) invoked Rule 19 to shut her down while reading a letter by Coretta Scott King because he is “sexist. ” Partial transcript as follows: HUNT: Let’s talk about what’s happened in the intervening hours since this happened on the floor. Your democratic colleagues have gone down to the senate floor. They’ve been reading this letter out loud. Was that something you asked them to do? WARREN: Nope. HUNT: And so far, they’ve been allowed to continue speaking. Some say it was sexist to silence you on the floor last night. WARREN: You’d have to ask Mitch McConnell. He’s the one who shut me down for doing this. But I will tell you what I did. As soon as I was no longer allowed to read, I went outside the senate chamber and I read the whole speech, just did it live on video and posted it on Facebook. I hope everybody reads the speech. I have tried to put up as many connections. I want children to read this speech. I want adults to read this speech. I want all people, and particularly, I want the Republicans who are going to vote tonight on whether or not Jeff Sessions becomes the next attorney general of the United States. I want them to read this speech before they vote. HUNT: Do you think what Senator McConnell did last night was sexist? WARREN: I think what he did was wrong. HUNT: But it wasn’t sexist? WARREN: I think reading the words of Coretta Scott King on the floor of the United States senate honors the senate. She talks about a very difficult time in our history. And a time and a reminder that even today,   are often denied access to voting. And she talks about how it happened and why it happened. I think it’s an important part of our history that we cannot just push behind us. that we cannot just gloss over. everyone needs to read Coretta Scott King’s letter.

7248,Gold and Monetary Populism: The Oligarchs’ Mortal Enemies – The Peoples’ Salvation,"Financial Markets , Gold , Market Manipulation , Precious Metals , U.S. Economy Deep State , silver , silver eagles , war on cash admin 
Desperation is setting in. The blatant attacks on gold are occurring almost exclusively during the Comex floor-trading hours now. Every night gold pushes higher as Asia’s appetite is seemingly voracious. The two most systemically dangerous banks right now, it was revealed according to the IMF, are JP Morgan and Citibank. I’m sure part of the smash is in response to that. All this action between gold and the dollar means is that the counter-force reaction to what the Fed is doing is going to be even more forceful. They already can’t control the dollar and the strong dollar is going to decimate Q4 revenues and earnings. Give it 6 months and I bet they start talking about the need to print more money. Gold will sniff that out well ahead of time. 
Stewart Dougherty has provided another guest post for IRD. I think this is his best commentary yet. 
The people hold in their hands the key that can unlock the door to financial independence and steadily increasing wealth, but they do not realize it. An obvious truth, being clear, is the hardest thing for people to see. They look right through it, as though it were not there, even though it is. Once they do see a truth, they never overlook it again. It becomes an invaluable fixture of their thinking. 
Like the adult elephant taught from youth that the light chain around its leg cannot be broken, the people believe that the strangulating government currency chain around their necks is unbreakable. The fact is that if the grown elephant pressures the chain, it will snap, setting him free. The people, too, have the power to break the currency chain that chokes them and reclaim their financial freedom from the plunderers who have usurped it, if only they would study, understand and act. 
The key to which we refer is private money, the most important forms of which are physical gold and silver. Cash is another, albeit greatly inferior form, in that currencies (not technically money) are controlled by their issuers. Global Deep State efforts to restrict or even eliminate the people’s ability to possess private money are now rampant, and running into resistance. Denied the ability to possess private money in the form and quantity they desire, the people will be deprived of financial freedom, and in the end, given that freedom is indivisible, any freedom at all. 
Given the oligarchs’ clear, unmistakable intention to deprive the citizens of financial freedom, the people now have not just a financial, but a moral obligation to redenominate a portion of their liquid assets into private money. The people need to tell the Oligarchy in clear terms that they have gone too far, and will not be going any farther. 
There are 7,000,000,000,000 people on this earth. There are fewer than 5,300,000,000 troy ounces of gold. If every person were allotted an equal share, each could possess 0.76 troy ounces of gold. In that gold can only be mined, and not printed by Deep State oligarchs, this sum is projected to remain consistent going forward, and may even shrink if mining cannot keep up with population growth. 
The actual ownership of gold is vastly skewed. Fewer than one billion troy ounces of physical gold worldwide are thought to be potentially available to the market, in current circumstances. This is not gold actually offered at this time, but that could be offered to the market if the selling climate were opportune and owners decided to sell. The other 4,300,000,000 ounces are believed to be immobile, at least for now, and include government reserves, non-trading private reserves, and forms of jewelry that are highly unlikely to be sold unless people’s personal or financial circumstances significantly change. People do not sell their wedding rings or other jewelry having deep sentimental value unless there is a pressing reason to do so. 
This means that there are perhaps 1,000,000,000 ounces of gold available to 7,000,000,000 people. Put another way, 1,000,000,000 ounces are available to what is estimated to be well more than $200,000,000,000,000.00 in net private wealth. Which translates into 0.143 available ounces per person; and total available gold amounting to only 0.65% of total global private wealth, at a price of $1,300 per ounce. If a low single-digit percentage of the people or the private wealth decided to mobilize into gold, where would the gold come from? The answer is: from radically higher prices, because that is the only place it can come from. We wonder, what is it about these numbers that the people cannot see? The conclusion is: the obvious, which is the hardest thing for them to see. Gold is so rare, and demand for it so potentially overwhelming that it is literally ridiculous it sells at today’s price. Yes, the “Great Oz” of price manipulation and corruption continues to hold sway for now, but Toto is sniffing him out and zeroing in. He is going to find the curtain and pull it back, and then all hell is going to break loose, because the current price of gold is a colossal fraud and lie. An historic price reset is inevitable. 
At its core, gold’s price is not a Deep State oligarchy manipulation problem, even though we know for a fact that the oligarchs totally dominate and rig the precious metals market to manufacture fraudulent profits for themselves while advancing a corrupt, statist narrative to assist their government puppets. 
Gold’s absurd price is, in fact, a marketing problem. The gold mining industry has been singularly incompetent when it comes to marketing its precious product. The gold industry has not produced one original marketing idea in 250 years, and gold’s current price proves it. Once people’s eyes are opened to gold’s unparalleled virtues as private, personal money, everything is going to change, most notably, its price, which is going to surge out of fundamental necessity. 
Brexit and the Trump victory reflect a rising populist tide in the west. The people are saying that they want to take back their countries and their lives. We believe that the same type of popular anger and dissatisfaction that has produced the sharp and ongoing political reset in the west is likely to erupt next in the field of currency and money. The populist movement was fomented in the first place by people who had become disgusted by constant financial regression and the real prospect of and trajectory toward eventual impoverishment. Their sentiments have set the stage for a populist monetary revolution. A determined segment of the people, those who still have liquid assets, is going to figure out that now is an excellent time for them to take back their money. They are going to say it’s time to “drain the monetary swamp” of its Wall Street swindlers and central bank fakers, escape the financial tyranny of zero interest rates, and return to ancient money that is rare, possesses intrinsic value, is beautiful and is virtually certain to appreciate. 
For the oligarchs, it is one thing if the people want to take back their countries; it is an entirely different, and totally unacceptable thing if they want to take back their money. The control of national currencies, money supplies and interest rates has been the Deep State oligarchs’ secret preserve and heavily protected “No Go” zone for decades. Their domination of this preserve has enabled them to mint phenomenal amounts of, guaranteed, risk-free profits; profits not measured in the millions or billions, but in the trillions of dollars. To the oligarchs, monetary populism means war. Which now rages, even though most people don’t yet know it. 
To combat monetary populism, the oligarchs have launched a War on Private Savings. To put the monetary genie back in the bottle, they need to herd the people’s liquid funds into institutions they control. Now that they can clearly see the whites of the people’s eyes, as the populist sentiment spreads into finance, they have put their actions into overdrive. They need to defeat monetary populism before it becomes a “movement,” which it has every potential of doing. 
The War on Private Savings is the largest conflict ever declared in the history of mankind. It is different from all other wars because: it is being fought against humanity, not a national or political enemy; it is global; it is being waged with trickeries, lies, schemes, propaganda, prohibitions and demonetizations, not military weapons; it is synchronized; it targets personal, after-tax savings, not a country’s natural resources, geography, government or political leaders; it has been declared by a non-elected Oligarchy; it is about contempt for freedom; and its ultimate objective is about one thing and one thing only: the conquest of other people’s money. 
The War on Private Savings, while massive in itself, is actually part of a larger conflict, the War on Human Freedom. While human freedom has been under attack in various ways since the dawn of mankind, it has never faced such a concerted, coordinated, massively well-funded attack as the one now declared against it by the Deep State oligarchs. If the initiators of the War on Private Savings win, the real casualty will be human freedom, because there can be no human freedom if there is no financial liberty. The stakes of this war for the people are impossible to overstate. 
India has been turned into a 1.3 billion person human laboratory for the advanced research, development and testing of the weapons to be used in the full-scale, global War on Private Savings. The weapons that prove successful in India will then be used on other people in other nations throughout the world. What happens in India is a global prologue of what is yet to come. 
The term “War on Cash” is a deliberately misleading misnomer. It is merely one act in a much more sweeping drama. There is no war on cash; there is an attack on cash. The attack on cash is just one of the many battles within the much larger War on Private Savings. We can now observe a rapidly intensifying, synchronized, global effort to demonize, control and eliminate cash in Australia; Europe, especially the Nordic countries; the United States; India; and virtually everywhere in between. The War on Private Savings is strategic; cash controls are tactical. The oligarchs want you to focus on the tactic, not the full strategy. You don’t want to fall for that. 
In addition to the attack on cash, other tactics currently being used in and planned for the War on Private Savings include: 1) Low and negative interest rates that are less than the rate of inflation and therefore rob savers; 2) Civil asset forfeitures; 3) The explosion of government regulations accompanied by confiscatory fines; 4) Across the board tax increases; 5) The creation of entirely new tax categories (e.g., Obamacare; carbon taxes) that pile onto but never streamline or reduce existing tax structures; 6) The intense manipulation of precious metals prices, resulting in artificially low prices that lessen savings; 7) Endemic corruption resulting in increased consumer costs and national debt that must be borne by the people (e.g., Medicare; Medicaid; Military (for example, the $6 Trillion in unaccounted-for Army spending, alone, all of which is now constitutes additional national debt); 8) Massive, structural government deficits that heap even more non-repayable debt upon the people; 8) Open borders, which spike the cost and deficits of government, which are similarly borne by the people and nationally impoverishing; 9) Deliberately engineered inflation that devalues national currencies and savings; 10) Outright demonetizations and forced conversions of currencies, with massive attendant costs, a new weapon that has been rolled out in India; to name just a few examples of the existing and emerging weapons being used against the people in the War on Private Savings. 
To sum up the situation, we believe that: 1) Populism is spreading into the Forbidden Zone of currency and money; 2) To prevent Monetary Populism from becoming a “movement” that they cannot contain, the Deep State Oligarchs have declared a War on Private Savings, as part of a larger conflict, a War on Human Liberty; 3) Precious metals, particularly gold, are an extraordinarily powerful weapon in the hands of the people, and one that can defeat the Oligarchs’ oppressive, anti-humanitarian campaign, but only if the people take up the weapon en masse, and soon; 4) The Deep State oligarchs are fully aware of the threat posed to them by the weapon of private money wielded by the people, which is why they are attacking; 5) If, through simple messaging, the people’s eyes are opened to the unique capability of precious metals to restore to them the financial stability, freedom and dignity that are rightfully theirs, no less than their other constitutionally guaranteed rights, they will embrace this obvious solution in large numbers, ensuring their victory. In the process, monetary populism will be transformed from a sentiment into a powerful, invincible movement. 
In our next article, we will discuss the simple ways by which the managements of publicly traded precious metals mining companies can ignite demand for and price escalation of their product, as is required by their fiduciary obligation to shareholders.

7249,Turkeys face deep divisions over Thanksgiving vote,"November 2, 2016 
A group of about 200,000 White Holland turkeys in a gigantic shed at a farm in Ohio is now debating whether or not to vote in favour of Thanksgiving. The vote to be made next week by pecking once at a pile of grain for ‘Thanksgiving’ or twice for ‘Something Else’ comes after bitter arguments in which claims and counter-claims were made about the availability of dust for bathing in over the turkeys’ long-term (i.e. three-week) future. 
Many turkeys have deplored the resulting divisions, which have seen elevated levels of pecking in the once harmonious community five miles from Wapakoneta. ‘I’ve lived here all my life, y’all,’ said turkey hen Wanda-Mae Cabrera. ‘What was it we were deciding on again? Me an’ my folks before me, we all lived here, yes we did.’ 
Voting for Thanksgiving means that the turkeys will be able to build a wall from their own faeces to deter any incoming poultry from Kentucky from trying to get into the shed, once they have mastered the intricacies of building a wall from their own faeces. Many also believe that this will make the shed great again, as it hasn’t been great for a long time but definitely used to be. They also said they liked the sound of a new farmer called Donald, who recently grabbed a pussy-cat that raided the shed before it could do any damage. 
Some turkeys prefer to carry on not celebrating Thanksgiving because the past 244 generations had not and had all gone away to live happily on a farm somewhere else, apparently. ‘One labourer said we will get a right stuffing either way,’ said anti-Thanksgiving turkey DeMarius Jackson, aged 28 weeks. ‘Well, that’s democracy. I imagine.’ 
‘I ain’t having no goddam American Bronzes sharing my shed, no sirree,’ raged White Holland cock Burl Griffin CCXXVI. ‘Before you know it, they’ll be gobblin’ around your hens, stealin’ your water and sayin’ you can’t worship the Great Spotlight in the Roof no more. I ain’t breedist but have you seen the size of their wattles? I like my shed the way I like it, so I’m for Thanksgiving, sure thing. What is Thanksgiving, anyway?’ Share this story...

7250,Exclusive — Sarah Palin: Trump ‘Makes America Great Again’ by Lifting Obama’s ’Anti-American’ Offshore Drilling Ban - Breitbart,"Former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin told Breitbart News that she welcomes President Trump’s executive order aimed at lifting the ban on offshore drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic and Atlantic areas. [Governor Palin said, “Quashing Obama’s   energy plan makes America great again. We’ve been working for years to remind people that our exceptional nation came to be by developing our   natural resources and by expecting reward for an unsurpassed work ethic. We capture that again when we drill, baby, drill!”  Trump’s executive order directs the U. S. Department of the Interior to review the   bans to allow “responsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our treasury and jobs to our workers. ” Obama’s prohibition on new drilling in U. S. water around Alaska includes most of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, and in 31 underwater canyons in the Atlantic Ocean. President Obama enacted it last December under using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority to designate certain offshore areas unavailable for commercial use. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton also invoked the legislation. President Trump said that the offshore drilling ban harms the economy. He explained, “Our country’s blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves, but the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production. ” Trump added, “This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. ”",0

7252,The man who spoke softly but carried a big stick,"The man who spoke softly but carried a big stick Bill Federer remembers military philosophy of Theodore Roosevelt Published: 1 min ago Print Theodore Roosevelt 
Theodore Roosevelt was born Oct. 27, 1858. His wife and mother died on Valentine’s Day, Feb. 14, 1884. He wrote in his diary “The light has gone out in my life.” Depressed, he left to ranch in the Dakotas. 
Returning to New York, he entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the Navy. He resigned during the Spanish-American War, organized the first Volunteer Cavalry, “the Rough Riders,” and captured Cuba’s San Juan Hill. Elected Vice-President under William McKinley, he became America’s youngest president in 1901. 
Republican Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to invite an African-American, Booker T. Washington, to dine in the White House on Oct. 16, 1901. A Southern Democrat newspapers condemned him it, as printed in the Memphis Scimitar: “The most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the United States was committed yesterday by the President, when he invited a n- to dine with him at the White House. It would not be worth more than a passing notice if Theodore Roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a Pullman car porter, but Roosevelt the individual and Roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light.” 
In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt warned: “The thought of modern industry in the hands of Christian charity is a dream worth dreaming. The thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining. The choice between the two is upon us.” 
In 1917, the New York Bible Society had Theodore Roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket New Testament & Book of Psalms given to World War I soldiers: “The teachings of the New Testament are foreshadowed in Micah’s verse (Micah vi. 8): ‘What more does the Lord require of thee than to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?’ Do justice; and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of Germany and Turkey, for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of Moloch and Beelzebub on this earth. Love mercy; treat prisoners well, succor the wounded, treat every woman as if she was your sister, care for the little children, and be tender to the old and helpless. Walk humbly; You will do so if you study the life and teachings of the Saviour. May the God of justice and mercy have you in His keeping. – (signed) Theodore Roosevelt.”

Theodore Roosevelt, in his book “Fear God and Take Your Own Part” (NY: George H. Doran Co., 1916), wrote: 
Armenians … for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war … are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors, the Turks, have not been pacifists but militarists. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 61, 64) 
Armenians, have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the Napoleonic Wars…the wars of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane in Asia. Yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged. … This course of national infamy … began when the last Administration surrendered to the peace at-any-price people, and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties. Individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milk-and-water invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of blood-and-iron. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 111) 
American eye-witness of the fearful atrocities, Mr. Arthur H. Gleason (New York Tribune, Nov. 25, 1915)… Serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish. Now, the Armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an old-time Apache Indian. … 
Even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heaped-up horrors of the past year and a half, the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the Armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation. Let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation, and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds. … If this people through its government had not shirked its duty … we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of Armenia. 
Mass meetings on behalf of the Armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them. … The principles of the peace-at-any-price men, of the professional pacifists … will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness. … This crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the Armenians … must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the United States for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed. … The devastation of Poland and Serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenth-century Europe. … 
Weak and timid milk-and-water policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the blood-and-iron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world. The crowning outrage has been committed by the Turks on the Armenians. They have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them, atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of Attila and of Genghis Khan. 
It is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks ‘neutral not only in deed but in thought,’ between right and the most hideous wrong, neutral between despairing and hunted people, people whose little children are murdered and their women raped, and the victorious and evil wrong-doers. … 
I trust that all Americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful Armenian atrocities. I trust that they feel … that a peace obtained without … righting the wrongs of the Armenians would be worse than any war. … 
Wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just, who put honor above safety, who are true to a lofty ideal of duty, who prepare in advance to make their strength effective, and who shrink from no hazard, not even the final hazard of war, if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness. When our people take this stand, we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesses…on an even greater scale in Armenia. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, pp. 377-383) 
In his book “Fear God and Take Your Part,” 1916, Theodore Roosevelt wrote: 
Christianity is not the creed of Asia and Africa at this moment solely because the seventh century Christians of Asia and Africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the Moslems were trained to fight. Christianity was saved in Europe solely because the peoples of Europe fought. 
If the peoples of Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and on up to and including the 17th century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the Mohammedans who invaded Europe, Europe would at this moment be Mohammedan and the Christian religion would be exterminated. 
A contemporary of Theodore Roosevelt was the English author G.K. Chesterton, who wrote of Western Christian civilization (“The Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton: Volume XX,” Introduction and Notes by James V. Schall, Ignatius Press): “They seem entirely to forget that long before the Crusaders had dreamed of riding to Jerusalem, the Moslems had almost ridden into Paris.” 
Theodore Roosevelt continued in “Fear God and Take Your Part,” 1916: “Wherever the Mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the Christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, Christianity has ultimately disappeared. From the hammer of Charles Martel to the sword of Jan Sobieski, Christianity owed its safety in Europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the Mohammedan aggressor.”

7253,Collective Consciousness: The Individual is Gone,"Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/collective-consciousness-individual-is.html In the middle of all the brain-research going on, from one end of the planet to the other, there is the assumption that the individual doesn’t really exist. He’s a fiction. There is only the motion of particles in the brain. Therefore, nothing is inviolate, nothing is protected. Make the brain do A, make it do B; it doesn’t matter. What matters is harmonizing these tiny particles, in order to build a collective consensus, in order to force a science of behavior.” (The Underground, Jon Rappoport)Individual power. Your power.It stands as the essence of what the founding documents of the American Republic are all about, once you scratch below the surface a millimeter or so.Therefore, it stands to reason that colleges and universities would be teaching courses in INDIVIDUAL POWER.As soon as I write that, though, we all fall down laughing, because we understand the absurdity of such a proposition. Can you imagine Harvard endowing a chair in Individual Power?Students would tear down the building in which such courses were taught. They’ve been carefully instructed that the individual is the greatest living threat to the planet.If you can’t see that as mind control, visit your local optometrist and get a prescription for glasses.So we have this astonishing situation: the very basis of freedom has no reflection in the educational system.You can say “individual” within certain limited contexts. You can say “power,” if you’re talking about nuclear plants, or if you’re accusing someone of a crime, but if you put “individual” and “power” together and attribute a positive quality to the combination, you’re way, way outside the consensus. You’re crazy. You’re committing some kind of treason.In order to spot the deepest versions of educational brainwashing, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME STANDARD AGAINST WHICH YOU CAN COMPARE WHAT IS COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE INTO THE MINDS OF STUDENTS.If you lack that standard, you miss most of the action.If you lack that standard, you have already been worked over by the system.And in this case, the standard is INDIVIDUAL POWER.Clean it off, hose off the dirt, polish it, look at it, think about it, remember it.Then you’ll see some Grade-A prime mind control. Everywhere. Because schools either don’t mention it, or they discredit it.Back in the days when I was writing on assignment for newspapers and magazines, I pitched a story about individual power to an editor. I wanted to trace its history as an idea over the past ten years.He looked at me for a few seconds. He looked at me as if I’d just dropped some cow flop on his desk. He knew I wasn’t kidding and I had something I could write and turn in to him, but that made it worse. He began to squirm in his chair.He laughed nervously. Then he stopped laughing.He said, “This isn’t what we do.”For him, I was suddenly radioactive.I had a similar experience with a high-school history teacher in California. We were having lunch in a cafe in Santa Monica, and I said:“You should teach a course in individual power. The positive aspects. No group stuff. Just the individual.”He frowned a deep intellectual frown, as if I’d just opened my jacket and exposed a few sticks of dynamite strapped to my chest. As if he was thinking about which agency of the government to report me to.Now, for the schizoid part. The movies. Television. Video games. Comics. Graphic novels. They are filled to the brim, they are overflowing with individual heroes who have considerable power. These entertainment businesses bank billions of dollars, because people want to immerse themselves in that universe where the individual is supreme. They want it badly.But when it comes to “real” life, power stops at the front door and no one answers the bell.Suddenly, the hero, the person with power is anathema. He’s left holding the bag. So he adjusts. He waits. He wonders. He settles for less, far less. He stifles his hopes. He shrinks. He forgets. He develops “problems” and tries to solve them within an impossibly narrow context. He redefines success and victory down to meet limited expectations. He strives for the normal and the average. For his efforts, he receives tidbits, like a dog looking up at his master.If that isn’t mind control, nothing is.Once we enter a world where the individual no longer has credibility, a world where “greatest good for the greatest number” is the overriding principle, and where that principle is defined by the elite few, the term “mind control” will have a positive connotation. It will be accepted as the obvious strategy for achieving “peace in our time.”At a job interview, a candidate will say:“Yes, I received my PhD in Mind Control at Yale, and then I did three years of post-doc work in Cooperative Learning Studies at MIT. My PhD thesis? It was titled, ‘Coordination Strategies in the Classroom for Eliminating the Concept of the Individual.’”From Wikipedia, “Cooperative Learning”: “Students must work in groups to complete tasks collectively toward academic goals. Unlike individual learning, which can be competitive in nature, students learning cooperatively can capitalize on one another’s resources and skills… Furthermore, the teacher’s role changes from giving information to facilitating students’ learning. Everyone succeeds when the group succeeds.”That is a towering assemblage of bullshit.“Everyone succeeds when the group succeeds.”You could use that quote on the back cover of Orwell’s 1984 or Huxley’s Brave New World . Everyone does not succeed — because the individual never finds out what he can do on his own. That avenue is cut off. He only knows what he can achieve in combination with others. He only knows what he can understand when he borrows from others. He may never glimpse what he truly wants to do in life.This is a tragic situation, but the tragedy is concealed, because the memory of shifting from individual independence to group dependence is gone. There is no such memory. A child is brought up without independence. Therefore, how can he recall losing it?He only knows the group and the team and the participation and the praise. He only knows the organizing of his life within a synthetically produced context.He is taught that this is good and necessary.So, one day, when a bolt comes out of the blue and he recognizes he is himself, what will he use to grasp that revelation and build on it?Yes, there are productive groups and teams, and one is always working with others, to some degree. But the core and the starting point is one’s self. That is where the insight and the magic begin. That is where the great decisions and commitments are made. That is where the world is born, every day.I see no end of writing about this magic, because civilization has been turned upside down by treacherous people who have been fabricating a counter-tradition that will sink the ship.

Two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered NFL fan. The game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
Democrats can be counted upon to call the Republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly Mitt Romney or the Supreme Court justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision. Donald Trump, you see, is “racist” because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him “my African-American.” Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-Semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husband’s former congressional campaign manager as a “f–-ing Jew bastard.” 
With a Republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies – big or small, real or imagined – while giving the Democrat a pass. So Trump’s “failure to ever apologize” outweighs an examination of Clinton’s flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the Supreme Court Heller case was about “toddlers,” as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
In Heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word “toddler” appear. Clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, “The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.” To normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
Meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an “email scandal,” when the accurate description is “national security scandal.” The Espionage Act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. The law does not require, as FBI Director James Comey falsely stated, an “intent.” Nor is it relevant, as Clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was “hacked.” 
Five people who worked with or for Clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. Some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. But the “target,” that is to say Hillary Clinton, was deemed by Comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. So why the immunity deals? Who knows – and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
Clinton insists that “President Obama doesn’t get enough credit” for the swell job he did with the economy. This would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. This would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that Gallup CEO Jim Clifton calls “the big lie,” given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
Meanwhile, it’s yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by Trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist Gloria Allred. Allred, a Clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of Trump’s sexual misconduct and her support for Clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husband’s accusers. One such accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by Bill Clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, Hillary Clinton verbally threatened her. 
Hillary Clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about Broaddrick’s allegation. Never. And only one national reporter, Sam Donaldson, has ever asked Bill Clinton about Juanita Broaddrick’s allegation. Ever. Clinton’s answer? He referred Donaldson to his lawyer, David Kendall. Donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to “simply deny it.” Same answer: “My attorney … speaks for me.” And that was that. 
So Hillary Clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy that’s given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the Espionage Act and placed the nation’s security at risk; who told the Benghazi victim’s families that the death of four Americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in Haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the Second Amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of ISIS, Russia and the Chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the New York Times, Washington Post and CNBC, have been outed by WikiLeaks as colluding with her campaign. And she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States.

7258,Beer Outdoors and Around the Clock - The New York Times,"Come summer (and what is Memorial Day weekend but the unofficial start of summer?) the impulse is to move outdoors. The draw is open air. For those of us who live where the winters are cold and urban, we’ll take outdoors any way we can, whether balcony or beach, city park or ballpark, rooftop or sidewalk cafe. Haul out the shorts, pop on the shades, wriggle the bare feet in the grass or sand. Only one more thing is necessary for utter relaxation: beer. This is not to say that beer is better for outdoor drinking than wine. Rosé, for one, seems to have been invented for consuming in the bright sunlight. But occasionally, certain conditions simply cry out for beer. The ballpark is beer territory. So is the beach. Memorial Day weekends in particular call for a celebratory brew. While I am ordinarily one to call for moderation, a summer holiday seems an occasion to enjoy beer pretty much around the clock, though not necessarily continuously. Just pick your moment. Me? I like to get an early start, say 10:30 or 11 a. m. While a morning beer may seem excessive, allow me to cite the Bavarian tradition of the brotzeit, which means “bread time” or second breakfast. This      may include some cheese and bread, or preferably a fresh pretzel, some sausage, perhaps some long white radishes and a wheat beer. On a holiday weekend, make it a   . In Oakland, Calif. where a lovely beer garden that’s actually called Brotzeit looks out over a marina, I would happily start my day with a König Ludwig hefeweizen, the leading Bavarian style of wheat beer, a cloudy gold in the glass with aromas of cloves, fresh yeast and sweet malt. Or as an alternative, I may drink an Andechs dunkelweizen, a dark wheat beer with an aroma of ripe bananas and a touch of chocolate. Aside from their liveliness, these beers share a necessary characteristic for outdoor drinking, especially if you are in it for the long haul. They are relatively low in alcohol, 5. 5 percent for the hefeweizen and 5. 0 percent for the dunkelweizen. Yes, you can find an appropriate time for your gnarly barley wines and imperial stouts. Those powerful brews, which can be upward of 10 percent alcohol, are better for sipping in front of a winter’s fire. Not so much in the sun, where the pleasure is in the drinking, not in dainty tastes. My favorite styles of beer tend to be lower in alcohol, under 6. 0. For warm weather, they must be invigorating, with enough flavor and aroma to capture and hold the attention while refreshing the mouth and inviting the next sip. Few beers fit these criteria better than good pilsner, with its brilliant bitterness that snaps the palate to attention and its dry refreshing aftertaste. It’s a great lunchtime brew and, as I’ve insisted for years, the perfect ballpark beer, especially for an early afternoon game. Not the vapid   imitations that purport to be pilsners yet are really diluted and dull, but any number of craft expressions. Some favorites of mine include Schlafly from St. Louis, Victory Prima Pils from Downingtown, Pa. and Brooklyn Pilsner. Imported pilsners can be great if they are fresh. I’ve always liked Jever pilsner on a hot day, and recently I found a Pilsner Urquell in a   can with its Czech packaging, labeled Plzensky Prazdroj. No, I can’t pronounce it, but it sure was good. Beer is easily enjoyed without paraphernalia, which can make outdoor   cumbersome, especially for picnics. You can bring proper glassware for beer if you like, but why burden yourself? Beer bottles and cans can be their own drinking vessels. Just have a cooler to keep them cold. Of course, if you are staking out an outdoor place at a bar or restaurant, you don’t even need to think about that. Recently, on a clear, sunny Thursday midafternoon in London, I noticed many corner pubs where crowds had spilled out onto the street, pint glasses in hand. Some people were smoking, yes, which is illegal indoors. But many others were simply enjoying the fresh weather. I felt compelled to join in, particularly as I love English beer styles, especially when they are   ales. These cask ales are   brews, carbonated not by injecting kegs with carbon dioxide, as is the case with most draft beers today, but naturally, in the cask, by yeast transforming sugar into alcohol with a byproduct of carbon dioxide that provides the fizz. Some fizz anyway. The carbonation in   ales is exceedingly gentle, which is why many people tasting one for the first time think the beer is flat. This gentle carbonation actually gives the beer a beautiful purity and creamy texture. I love no beer more than a   ale, whether a mild bitter, a malty porter or an   India Pale Ale, made without the ungainly piney, grapefruit flavor of American hops. For a full day of outdoor drinking, however, make mine a bitter, around 4 percent alcohol. Perfect for sitting at a sidewalk table (or standing, as they do in London) and watching the world go by. Many good beer bars in the United States have at least one or two   selections. After you’ve finished a bitter or two, it’s late afternoon. Perhaps it’s time to eat again. One of my favorite outdoor places in New York for beer and food is the beer garden at Loreley on the Lower East Side. Aside from the excellent sausages and schnitzels, Loreley serves a nice selection of Kölsch, one of my favorite styles of beers, on tap. Kölsch, with its delicately bitter flavors, light carbonation and subtle fruitiness, is like a slightly more complex pilsner. I find Kölsch particularly refreshing, and American brewers seem to have taken recent interest in the style. Schlafly and Captain Lawrence in Elmsford, N. Y. make good versions, but the German Kölsches are still the best. Look for Reissdorf, Gaffel and Sünner, all from the city of Cologne, where the tradition originated. The sun is going down, and it’s been a long day. The taste buds are possibly fatigued, and you need something to awaken them. May I suggest the pleasure of a gose? This style is wonderfully odd in so many ways. It’s a tart wheat beer spiked typically with coriander and salt, and occasionally lime or lemon. It’s powerfully   and absolutely delicious. The style is identified with the German city of Leipzig, and good German goses come from Bayerischer Bahnhof and Ritterguts. But American craft brewers like Westbrook and Sixpoint make excellent versions, too. It’s nighttime now, and because you’ve paced yourself, it feels as if you’re just beginning. But you know better, so you want to keep it light. Full Sail Brewery makes an excellent selection of beers labeled Session, after the beer lovers’ term for brews low enough in alcohol to be consumed during a long drinking session. The Session lineup includes a crisp lager and a balanced I. P. A. They come in squat bottles that look awfully cute by candlelight. As midnight approaches, it’s time to think about calling it a night. But a last round is in order. Why not a beer as black as night? An Irish stout or English porter, that is. Guinness is often disregarded because of its ubiquity, but if on draft and poured skillfully by a good bartender, it is thick and toasty, yet light and graceful, and not, as many people believe, high in alcohol. I love English porter, with its coffee, chocolate, malty flavors. It, too, is not high in alcohol. St. Peter’s   Porter and Samuel Smith’s Taddy Porter are both excellent versions. Now, get some sleep. You’ve earned it.",0
7259,F.B.I. Steps Up Use of Stings in ISIS Cases - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. has significantly increased its use of stings in terrorism cases, employing agents and informants to pose as jihadists, bomb makers, gun dealers or online “friends” in hundreds of investigations into Americans suspected of supporting the Islamic State, records and interviews show. Undercover operations, once seen as a last resort, are now used in about two of every three prosecutions involving people suspected of supporting the Islamic State, a sharp rise in the span of just two years, according to a New York Times analysis. Charges have been brought against nearly 90 Americans believed to be linked to the group. The increase in the number of these secret operations, which put operatives in the middle of purported plots, has come with little public or congressional scrutiny, and the stings rely on F. B. I. guidelines that predate the rise of the Islamic State. While F. B. I. officials say they are careful to avoid illegally entrapping suspects, their undercover operatives are far from bystanders. In recent investigations from Florida to California, agents have helped people suspected of being extremists acquire weapons, scope out bombing targets and find the best routes to Syria to join the Islamic State, records show. Officials said in interviews that because social media had given extremists a cloak of anonymity, these undercover stings  —   online and in person  —   had become increasingly vital to gathering evidence and deterring possible attacks in the United States. “We’re not going to wait for the person to mobilize on his own time line,” said Michael B. Steinbach, who leads the F. B. I. ’s national security branch. He added that the F. B. I. could not afford to “just sit and wait knowing the individual is actively plotting. ” Counterterrorism officials said the Islamic State had inspired loyalists to strike quickly, even within days or weeks of their radicalization. Unlike wiretaps or searches, undercover operations do not require a judge to sign a warrant. They are overseen by F. B. I. supervisors and Justice Department prosecutors, and so can usually be started more quickly. But defense lawyers, Muslim leaders and civil liberties advocates say that F. B. I. operatives coax suspects into saying and doing things that they might not otherwise do  —   the essence of entrapment. “They’re manufacturing terrorism cases,” said Michael German, a former undercover agent with the F. B. I. who researches national security law at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. In many of the recent prosecutions, he said, “these people are five steps away from being a danger to the United States. ” Karen J. Greenberg, the director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University, said undercover operations had become the norm for the F. B. I. in the most recent Islamic State cases, with little debate or understanding of how the bureau actually conducts its investigations, especially its online stings. “I think the F. B. I. is really going down the wrong path with a lot of these ISIS cases,” she said, using a common acronym for the Islamic State, also known as ISIL. Court records and interviews give a glimpse of the aggressive undercover methods that have become typical in investigations once the F. B. I. identifies someone as a possible threat. In Rochester, a paid informant went undercover and drove a man suspected of being an Islamic extremist, Emanuel Lutchman, to a Walmart in December to buy a machete, ski masks, zip ties and other supplies for a   terrorist attack on New Year’s Eve. Because Mr. Lutchman, a mentally ill panhandler, had no money, the informant covered the $40 cost. In North Carolina, an undercover agent pressed another suspect, Justin Sullivan, on whether he was willing to commit acts of terrorism for the Islamic State  —   “do you think you can kill?” the agent asked in one online message  —   before giving him a silencer for an   assault rifle in June 2015. And in Washington State, an undercover informant paid $1, 100 to Daniel Franey, a former soldier, for acting as a lookout on several trips to buy duffel bags filled with assault weapons for a possible attack last summer. The F. B. I. arrested all three suspects before any attacks occurred, and has used similar undercover techniques to prosecute dozens of others it believes had ties to the Islamic State, court records show. While some defendants have pleaded guilty, most are still awaiting trial. At least 40 agencies use covert operatives to investigate everything from tax cheating and welfare fraud to Supreme Court demonstrations. But in no agency have undercover stings been more central than in the F. B. I. While the F. B. I. ’s internal guidelines, last updated in 2011, require the “least intrusive” methods possible in investigations, bureau officials said they believed less intrusive methods might be impossible because suspects have the ability to remain anonymous on encrypted online sites. “When the bad guys turn to encrypted areas, we’re dark, and the only way to gain a better understanding of what we’re up against may be through an undercover,” Mr. Steinbach said. He said using undercover agents online allowed the F. B. I. to “flesh out” suspects by gaining their trust and persuading them to disclose their real identities. The F. B. I. has about 1, 000 open investigations into “homegrown violent extremists,” which it defines as Americans motivated by a foreign terrorist group, including the Islamic State, to conduct attacks at home, officials said. They said that a “significant number” of cases  —   hundreds in all  —   had entailed undercover operations against people suspected of being Islamic extremists, but that the F. B. I. did not have precise numbers. But court records examined by The Times indicate that the F. B. I. has used undercover operations with increasing frequency in its Islamic State investigations since the earliest cases emerged in March 2014. (For years before that, the bureau had carried out similar sting investigations against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.) Only about 30 percent of the first few dozen prosecutions through late 2014 appear to have relied on evidence gathered through undercover operations. That number climbed to about 45 percent by early last year, with a string of undercover prosecutions in New York, Minnesota and Illinois. And since February 2015, about 40 of 60 Islamic State prosecutions, or 67 percent, have been based on undercover operations. The number of Islamic State prosecutions over all has slowed since January officials believe a spate of prosecutions late last year may have deterred plotters. But undercover stings have remained the norm. So far this year, eight of the dozen Islamic State prosecutions have relied on undercover operatives, court records indicate. In the most recent case, prosecutors two weeks ago charged a Bronx man, Sajmir Alimehmeti, 22, with traveling to Europe twice to try to fight with the Islamic State. He met with at least three undercover agents during the F. B. I. ’s investigation. Undercover activity also appears to have risen in the hundreds of Islamic State investigations run by the F. B. I. in the last two years, but it is not as sharp a spike as seen in those cases that led to formal charges, officials said. Asked about The Times’s data, F. B. I. officials said any increase in undercover activity probably reflected the emergence of what they believed to be a larger and more dangerous pool of Islamic State suspects. The officials said there had been no deliberate decision or policy change to rely more heavily on undercover agents. Often, the targets in the stings first attracted the F. B. I. ’s attention for espousing what agents saw as support for the Islamic State or violent extremism online, on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. The F. B. I. insists that its agents comb these sites not as “thought police,” but rather to look for people who are threatening acts of terrorism. Once the F. B. I. has identified someone as a potential threat, supervisors often have an undercover agent contact the suspect online. In Northern Illinois, for instance, an undercover agent sent a friend request on Facebook to Hasan Edmonds, a National Guardsman who had published posts on social media that the F. B. I. had deemed alarming. Over the next several months, Mr. Edmonds and the undercover agent exchanged numerous online messages, discussing the possibility of traveling to the Middle East to help the Islamic State, or perhaps mounting an attack at the Illinois armory where Mr. Edmonds trained. “Oaths have been given,” Mr. Edmonds wrote to an informant in one online message in January 2015, according to a criminal complaint. “When the time is right, we will strike. ” A few days later, Mr. Edmonds wrote that he and a cousin were eager to help the cause and “would love to do something like the brother in Paris did”  —   a reference to the terrorist attack a few weeks earlier on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The undercover agent responded by suggesting to Mr. Edmonds that if he could not make it overseas to fight with the Islamic State, he could show his commitment and achieve martyrdom in the United States, court filings said. The online messages led to a meeting in person in March 2015 between a second undercover operative and Mr. Edmonds’s cousin, Jonas Edmonds, prosecutors said. Weeks later, the cousins were arrested at Chicago Midway International Airport  —   with Hasan Edmonds apparently on his way to the Middle East  —   and charged with   offenses. Both men have pleaded guilty and are facing long prison sentences. In that case and in many others, F. B. I. undercover operatives have let plots play out until a suspect acquires a weapon, for instance, or buys a plane ticket to Turkey en route to Syria. An investigation that ended last month in Miami followed this pattern, with the normal tableau of undercover operatives and talk of a bloody attack. The F. B. I. received word  —   exactly how is unclear  —   that James Gonzalo Medina, 40, a Muslim convert who also went by James Muhammad, might have been considering attacking a synagogue, according to court records. It opened an investigation into Mr. Medina in March, but the initial evidence was spotty. At one meeting with an undercover informant and several other men, Mr. Medina accused a friend of wanting to blow up a synagogue he seemed to distance himself from the idea. Five days later, as Mr. Medina was driving with the F. B. I. informant in a suburb of Miami, he pointed out a synagogue with what he called “David’s triangle star” on the outside. The F. B. I. informant suggested attacking the synagogue during a Jewish holiday two weeks later, according to court files. “Now that’ll be a good day to go and bomb them,” Mr. Medina responded, according to the files. The informant took the proposed plot a step further, introducing Mr. Medina to an acquaintance the informant said was experienced with explosives. The acquaintance was actually an undercover F. B. I. agent, who questioned Mr. Medina several times about why he wanted to bomb the synagogue. Mr. Medina said he wanted to carry out a bombing and claim responsibility on behalf of “ISIS in America. ” “You need to be sure, brother,” the undercover agent told him, adding, “You know you don’t have to do any of this. ” Mr. Medina reaffirmed his commitment, according to the court files. Finally, in late April, the agent met Mr. Medina in a parking lot and gave him the bomb, which was inert and “posed no danger to the public,” prosecutors said. The two men drove toward the synagogue a few miles away, and after Mr. Medina stepped out of the car with the bomb in hand, he was arrested. Officials said they were keenly aware that such cases would almost inevitably lead defense lawyers to charge that the F. B. I. had entrapped their clients. That is why, the officials said, they often gauge suspects’ commitment to carrying out an attack and give them an “out” to back away. F. B. I. officials are also quick to point out that, despite dozens of challenges to undercover terrorism cases brought since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a judge has yet to throw one out on the grounds of entrapment. Not that some judges have not considered it. “I believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that there would have been no crime here, except the government instigated it, planned it and brought it to fruition,” Judge Colleen McMahon of the United States District Court in Manhattan said in 2011 in a case involving four Muslim men in Newburgh, N. Y. The F. B. I. planted an undercover informant inside a mosque in Newburgh as part of what became an elaborate, nearly yearlong plot to launch a Stinger    missile at a local air base and two synagogues. The F. B. I. even built a fake Stinger missile and had it delivered to the men. Judge McMahon said she was troubled by the F. B. I. ’s conduct, but she upheld the charges. So did the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, finding that the F. B. I. ’s conduct did not amount to entrapment. The stings have left many Muslim leaders wary, even as the F. B. I. has sought to build bridges to Muslim Americans. At mosques in Oregon, imams sometimes warn of F. B. I. informants and caution “that we have those among us who are not with us,” said Tom Nelson, a Muslim lawyer in Portland who has represented a number of local men in   cases. His message for his Muslim friends, Mr. Nelson said, is blunt. “Avoid the F. B. I. like the plague,” he said. “They’re definitely not an ally. That’s what the F. B. I. does  —   they infiltrate. ”",0
7260,Adele vs. Beyoncé: What’s at Stake for the Grammys? - The New York Times,"The 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday will feature perhaps the show’s most electric contest in years: Adele versus Beyoncé. Both are megaselling queens of pop whose every move reverberates throughout the culture. The fact that they will face off in each of the top three categories  —   album, record and song of the year  —   gives the Grammys a rare tension that can only be good for ratings. Yet their competition is also fraught in ways that have long dogged the awards. One concerns race, a subject the Grammys have a tangled history with  —   especially this year, when one of the most acclaimed young black artists, Frank Ocean, has boycotted the process altogether. Another sensitive area is the Grammys’ spotty record in recognizing the vanguards of contemporary pop. Added to the mix is a heightened political climate in which issues of race and identity are front and center, raising the question of whether the music industry will use this year’s Grammys as a soapbox. Many longtime Grammy watchers say that a sweep by Adele  —   and therefore a Beyoncé snub  —   could feed into   complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories. Ebro Darden, a disc jockey on the New York   station Hot 97 and on Apple’s Beats 1, said that a big Beyoncé win would be “the best move” for the Grammys “if they want to get the most attention and keep people interested. ” Should Adele dominate, he added, some music fans “would come for them and say #OscarsSoWhite. ” With the news media closely focused on diversity at awards shows  —   and the public relations nightmares that result from an absence of it  —   that would be an unwelcome response for the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys. (A representative for the academy declined to comment.) Adele and Beyoncé are both hailed in music circles as supremely deserving talents. But for voters, the singers also represent a choice between two strains of modern pop: Adele’s album “25” and her hit ballad “Hello” are examples of the finely   traditional style that is Grammy catnip. Beyoncé’s “Lemonade,” with its dynamic single “Formation” and accompanying politically and racially charged hourlong art film, represents an edgier    sound that rarely takes the top prize  —   Exhibit A for those who contend that the Grammys are perennially out of touch. Beyoncé’s own example is telling: She may already have 20 Grammys on her shelf, but only one is in the   big four categories (album, record and song of the year, or best new artist). She has also been passed over twice for album of the year, losing to Taylor Swift in 2010 and Beck in 2015 (much to the consternation of Kanye West, a frequent Grammy critic). “The #OscarsSoWhite controversy really shook the motion picture academy, and I think the Grammys are saying, ‘There but for the grace of God go we, so let’s make sure this doesn’t happen to us,’” said Paul Grein, a former Billboard columnist who performs detailed Grammy analysis for the industry magazine Hits. The Grammys may be more diverse than most shows this year, Beyoncé is the top nominee, with nine nods, while the newcomer Chance the Rapper has seven. But the show’s record in recognizing black talent has come under plenty of fire. Mr. Ocean declined to submit his work for consideration in this year’s Grammys at all, saying that the institution “just doesn’t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from,” and calling the boycott his “Colin Kaepernick moment. ” Rap fans were outraged when Kendrick Lamar lost best rap album to the white rapper Macklemore in 2014, though Mr. Lamar took all four rap trophies last year. (Eminem has won best rap album six times.) The last black artists to win album of the year were legacy picks: Ray Charles in 2005, and Herbie Hancock, covering Joni Mitchell, in 2008 a black woman hasn’t won since Lauryn Hill did nearly two decades ago. Russell Simmons, the entertainment mogul who is a founder of Def Jam Recordings, said that Beyoncé “is overdue for being accepted by the mainstream in the way she deserves. ” “She’s obviously the most mainstream thing on the planet,” Mr. Simmons said. He added: “When they define her, her color has something to do with the way she’s viewed and the amount of awards she wins and the accolades she gets. I would venture to say were she white and blond from Texas, she would be recognized differently. ” Some, however, reject the idea of the   contest as a referendum on race. “I don’t think it’s a black and white thing it’s a quality thing,” said Joel Peresman, the chief executive of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. Kevin Liles, a veteran record executive now with 300 Entertainment, said that the Grammys had evolved in recent years: “If it was truly a dormant or stagnant association, then Beyoncé wouldn’t be there. All shapes, sizes, colors and genres are represented. ” The odds on Adele and Beyoncé are hard to read, even among industry insiders. Adele may be a safe choice, but she also swept all three top prizes five years ago, making a repeat seem unlikely. No   or contemporary RB album has won the top prize since Outkast’s “  Love Below” in 2004, a tough precedent for Beyoncé on the other hand, there is a wide sense in the industry that it may simply be her turn. At the Grammys, however, anything is possible: Contenders for an upset album of the year winner are streaming hits like Drake’s “Views” and Justin Bieber’s “Purpose,” and this year’s darkest horse, “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth” by the country outsider Sturgill Simpson. The awards   also comes at a cultural crossroads, following a divisive presidential election. Now, even the most mainstream events are weighted with ideological expectations. “The gloves are off: It is absolutely in style to have a political opinion right now,” the D. J. Mr. Darden said, predicting that the Grammys would “absolutely have that moment” where current events come up, such as with Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech aimed at President Trump. Lady Gaga, a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter, did not make a grand political statement, as some had hoped, at the Super Bowl, but she will have another platform when she performs with Metallica at the Grammys. Among the other performers scheduled on Sunday are Katy Perry, who was a dedicated surrogate for Mrs. Clinton, and Chance the Rapper, a frequent guest of President Obama’s White House. Beyoncé and Adele, who is British, both expressed support for Mrs. Clinton last year. “We want to be a place where artists can feel they can come and express themselves,” Ken Ehrlich, the Grammys producer, said of the possibility that performances or speeches could become political. “Our guidelines are taste and the F. C. C. The F. C. C. is more concerned with profanity than it is with political discourse. ” Mr. Simmons said that no matter who comes away the night’s big winner, a foray by a major artist into politics would be a boon for the show. “If Trump says the Grammys are overrated on Monday morning, people will go looking for what he’s talking about,” Mr. Simmons said. “I hope he does. ”",0

About the time they figure out how they screwed the pooch on those issues, they will be smacked up-side the head by the continuing disintegration of their EU project, as more countries leave it on the ash heap of history and move forward into the light of a much more positive, productive, and free world.

7264,Televisión: lo más visto ayer,"televisión 
La fórmula de emitir capítulos de Los Simpson en cualquier momento parece que le sigue funcionando a Antena 3, que ayer fue líder de audiencia con un especial de esta serie de animación. La continua repetición de sus capítulos hizo que la cadena ni siquiera los emitiera. En su lugar, aparecía Matías Prats recordando sus momentos preferidos. “Me gusta cuando Bart vende su alma a Milhouse. ¿Y el del Tenacitas? Ese me gustó mucho”, explicó Prats. 
Telecinco también consiguió un excelente resultado. Aprovechando el estreno de la película “Animales fantásticos”, la cadena de Mediaset quiso subirse al carro de la “Harrypottermanía” y emitió “ Live at Hogwarth’s “, un especial de dos horas en el que Belén Esteban, con una chistera, enseña a la audiencia cómo se usa el juego Magia Borrás. 
La nostalgia vende, y eso lo sabe bien La 1 de Televisión Española. Tras anunciar que adaptará a la pequeña pantalla el best seller “ Yo también fui a EGB .”, protagonizado por Dani Rovira en el papel de bote de Tipp-ex, la cadena pública decidió exprimir la fórmula de la nostalgia emitiendo íntegramente la programación de anteayer. 
Cuatro, por su parte, parece que no acaba de encontrar un formato que le funcione en el “prime time”. Fría acogida del estreno de su nuevo docureality “ Callejeros Condescendientes “, en el que diversos imbéciles recorren el mundo diciendo frases como “son tan felices con tan poco” o “lo mejor de esta ciudad son sus gentes”. 
Tampoco fue la noche de La Sexta. El show de Chicote centrado en las reuniones de vecinos, “ Pesadilla en el rellano “, no está obteniendo los números esperados. Ayer, Chicote se presentó para mediar en un conflicto relacionado con el posible cambio de los buzones. El cocinero utilizó su táctica de irse muy enfadado y volver poco después, para que los concursantes recapaciten. Pero esta vez no le funcionó: a su regreso, Virginia del sexto le había abierto la cabeza a la Puri, del bajo, golpeándosela contra los buzones. Ni por esas la audiencia mostró interés. 
En clave autonómica, la catalana TV3 consiguió su máximo histórico con la “ Telemarató” , un espacio solidario que este año ha conseguido 20 mil millones de euros para pagar la multa de Messi a Hacienda.

7265,Civil War Museum Closes Doors After Politician Demands Confederate Flags Be Eliminated,"A Civil War battlefield museum in Georgia is closing its doors after a local politician demanded that the establishment discontinues its use of the Confederate flag. [After Commissioner Dee Clemmons of Hampton, Georgia, demanded that the Nash Farm Battlefield Museum tear down the flags in its Confederate displays that explain the battle to visitors, the museum decided to close its doors, saying it could not properly explain history if half of its displays were to be censored, WFMY reported.  Tim Knight, who represents the nonprofit group that runs the museum, said Clemmons spoke with the color of authority of the county and felt that he was given no choice but to close the museum. “Nash Farms has always represented both sides of the conflict,” Stuart Carter, a supporter of the museum, said of the    establishment. “Sure I understand some people find the imaging of (the Confederacy) offensive,” Carter added. “But if we try and erase it from history, then we can’t remember how we messed up and why we shouldn’t go back there again. ” The group running the museum insisted that it could not properly relay the history of the 1864 battle without its Confederate artifacts and displays. But a county spokesperson said it was “reasonable” to demand that the Confederate flag displays be censored. “I think it’s reasonable. I think there were plenty of artifacts in the museum that can tell the story of the Civil War. And I think it was a reasonable request,” county spokeswoman Melissa Robinson said. The controversy comes amid similar discussions in states across the south, as Charlottesville, Virginia, and New Orleans, Louisiana, debate removing Confederate symbols and memorials.

7266,"In a Smoky Haze, Turks Cling to Their Cigarettes - The New York Times","ISTANBUL  —   The Italians have a saying for it: “Fuma come un turco,” meaning, “He smokes like a Turk. ” There are actually plenty of people who smoke more than the Turks, but there are times when a visitor here may find that hard to believe. The famous Istiklal Avenue, one of the world’s most appealing pedestrian spaces with its cobbled pavement and little red trams clacking down the middle, bells dinging, can be covered over on a crowded weekend night by an inescapably dense,   cloud of secondhand smoke, hovering between the elegant, tall buildings on either side. Along dusky alleyways in Kadikoy, the trendiest part of Istanbul, on the once less fashionable Asian side of the Bosporus, cafes typically have a few tables inside and many more outside  —   where smoking is allowed. On even the coldest days, the outside tables are crowded, smokers kept warm by overhead heaters and lap blankets provided at each chair. Some restaurants go so far as to remove their outside walls, replacing them with transparent plastic sheeting, to make the entire place at least officially outdoors. If the government has its way, however, the cafe culture’s smoking days are numbered. In April it proposed a law limiting outside smoking tables to no more than 25 percent of an establishment’s total  —   almost the reverse of the present trend, at least in major cities like Istanbul. That prospect is greeted with horror in the cafes. “If there’s such a law, we’ll have to close down,” said a waiter named Okan, at a hip bar in Kadikoy. (He asked that the bar not be named, as there were not only smoking scofflaws inside, but Che Guevara posters and    logos too.) “We don’t want to get shut down. ” Turkey has made tremendous efforts to counteract its reputation  —   and its smoking habit  —   with measures that are nearly as strict as those in any Western country, and far stricter than those found in most developing societies. It has outlawed smoking in public places, not only inside restaurants but also outside government buildings, and even banned it above decks on the innumerable ferry boats plying the Bosporus. Turkey’s    President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used his growing power and popularity to push through most of these antismoking measures beginning in 2008. Even the cherished tradition of the nargile, or Turkish water pipe, in which flavored plugs of tobacco are smoked through long tubes that cool the smoke, has faced tough legislation during his administration. As Mr. Erdogan famously said, “There can be no such freedom as the freedom to smoke,” likening it to suicide. Turkey’s health system even pays for drug and nicotine replacement cessation therapies, and some doctors regularly text their smoker patients to remind them of the risks. When a cigarette appears in a movie, Turkish censors either blur it or put a cartoon flower over it. As progressive as those measures may be, they have had relatively little impact on getting Turks to cut back. The percentage of smoking Turks did initially fall in the years after the new measures, and continued to decline among young people, according to the latest government figures, from 2012. But more recent data from the Turkish Thoracic Association in 2014 show a slight increase in the percentage of smokers: 42 percent of men and 13 percent of women. That may well be because taxation of cigarettes and tobacco products in Turkey remains substantially below the guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization. A pack of   cigarettes here costs $3, compared with as much as $15 in some European countries. Three dollars is a lot of money for people on the modest salaries paid here, although not enough to affect habits in a country where many people can remember a time when it was common to smoke inside hospitals. Many Turkish smokers feel aggrieved by the changes, and reports that smoking bans may be extended to parks and other outdoor spaces distress them further. Ismail Gungor, 26, a lawyer, is a     smoker who says “my aim is to turn my mustache yellow  —   I’ll smoke as long as my health allows it. ” But he’s tired of freezing half to death in the process, when he goes to restaurants and bars, and feels there should be licensed places for smokers to frequent. He was at the Tarantula Cafe drinking  —   and smoking  —   with his friend Gurkan Kurt, 26, an engineer. Mr. Kurt had quit smoking for three days, until he met up with Mr. Gungor on a recent Saturday. “Oh, well,” he said. Government regulation is not the only obstacle faced by Turkish smokers, who are more than three times as likely to be men. “The women smoke less, and they’re always pressuring us to quit smoking,” Mr. Gungor said. Mr. Kurt does not have that problem. “I don’t tell them I smoke,” he said. Like many other Turkish smokers, they do not dispute their country’s   reputation. Barkan Karsh, a Turkish academic consultant who works in Macedonia, said people there not only use the “smokes like a Turk” expression, but they also use a Turkish word for tobacco, “tutun,” as slang for a cigarette. This is a bit rich, because Macedonia ranks   among countries in per capita cigarette consumption, according to the Tobacco Atlas, published by an antismoking group, while Turkey is only 29th. “Even Macedonians say they should change ‘smokes like a Turk’ to ‘smokes like a Macedonian,’” Mr. Karsh said. Somehow, it doesn’t have quite the same ring. “Actually it’s kind of an urban legend that Turks smoke so much,” Gokhan Bicici, a local journalist, said. “Especially younger people are smoking much less. ” He has a point. The Tobacco Atlas maintains that some countries consume more than twice as many cigarettes per person as Turkey, among them Montenegro (the world leader with 4, 124 cigarettes consumed per adult annually) Belarus and Lebanon. Macedonia and Russia are nearly as bad. As for Italy, it’s really not much better than Turkey. No. 34 among nations in smoking, Italians consume roughly the same number of cigarettes as Turks. According to World Health Organization data for Turkey and Italy, fewer adult Italians are smokers than adult Turks, but among young people, smoking rates are more than twice as high in Italy. Perhaps the expression should actually be, “Fuma come un italiano” (or, as they say in Turkish, “O bir Italyan gibi sigara iciyor”).",0
7267,How the West Provoked the New Cold War - Ray McGovern,"Taming the corporate media beast How the West Provoked the New Cold War Originally appeared at Consortiumnews.com 
The mainstream U.S. media portrays the New Cold War as “white-hatted” Americans standing up to “black-hatted” Russians to stop aggression against NATO and to save children in Syria, but the reality is much more gray, says ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern. 
How did the “growing trust” that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his “working and personal relationship with President Obama ” change into today’s deep distrust and saber-rattling? 
Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. 
But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented: “My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.” He complained about “people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.” 692968.jpg President Barack Obama addresses the United Nations General Assembly’s seventy-first session on Sept. 20, 2016 (UN Photo) 
A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, “My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry’s] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.” 
Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire — not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals — were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. 
A New Nadir 
Relations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. 645495.jpg Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses UN General Assembly on Sept. 28, 2015. (UN Photo) 
On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft — including any stealth aircraft — over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. 
It seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course — perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, “I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft … if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.” 
Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia’s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft. 
Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing “a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team” as a “major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.” 
“This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,” he explained, referring to NATO’s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. “The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.” 
On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the “myth” of a “Russian military threat,” calling this a “profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets … expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.” 
Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia’s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against “saber-rattling,” adding that, “We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.” 
Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two-and-a-half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d’état in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia’s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by “mainstream” media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which “Yats” (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington’s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. 
This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, “really the most blatant coup in history.” 
It’s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now?",0
7268,How to Pick a Preschool in Less Than an Hour - The New York Times,"As soon as I walked into Celia Rojas’s prekindergarten class in Union City, N. J. I was sucked in by the hum of activity. Art plastered the walls, plants were hanging from the ceiling, and in every nook there was something to seize a child’s imagination. Some kids were doing cutouts of paper clothing and others were at an easel, painting. A bunch of children were solving puzzles on a computer, while another group was building a pink cardboard chair, which they called “A Chair for My Mother. ” In the reading nook a girl was learning about how, when the wasp larva hatches, it eats the spider. Three classmates were playing   trying on old felt hats and checking themselves out in the mirror. The teacher was everywhere  —   praising kids, offering suggestions when they were stumped and, sometimes, peacemaking. Two boys were peering at insects through a microscope when they started fighting over who got to look next. Ms. Rojas deftly diverted them. “How many parts does an insect body have?” she asked. The boys knew: “Three parts  —   the antenna, abdomen and legs. ” “How about an insect salad  —   would you want to eat it?” she inquired. “Ugh,” the boys chorused. “Why not  —   are they bad for you?” she asked. The boys thought about it. “Maybe if you chopped them up they’d be O. K.,” one volunteered. At that moment I wished that I were 4 years old and could join the festivities. But most   classrooms look entirely different. After surveying preschools nationwide, Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia Curry School of Education, concluded that “superficial task demands, including giving directions and assigning routine tasks, predominate over children’s involvement in appropriate conceptual or   activities. ” A preschool in Chicago that I visited a few years earlier boasted that it was certified by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the   equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal. But it didn’t merit that encomium. A big room that might once have been a storeroom had been split into   each about 15 feet square, separated by   partitions. Noise reverberated throughout the building. “Stay within the lines,” a teacher commanded a    boy. “You’re not tracing the triangle. ” After he started coloring, she returned, exasperated. “You weren’t paying attention during circle time. Only color the triangles, not the circle or the heart. ” The teacher turned to me. “I like the kids when they stay within the lines and color beautiful,” she said. In another class, children were told to paint the bottom section of a pyramid. The directions were the same: Stay within the lines. It turned out that the kids were painting the food pyramid, but they didn’t know that’s what they were doing. What I saw made me wish that I could round up a passel of children and make a run for safety. Deborah Stipek, a professor of education at Stanford, makes the point more bluntly: “What I see in a lot of preschools is much worse than coloring between the lines. It’s teachers yelling at kids all day. ” These two prekindergartens serve very different populations, but perhaps not the ones you might expect. The “stay within the lines”   enrolls mainly   youngsters, whose parents pay to send them there, while Ms. Rojas’s classroom is in a public school in a poor immigrant community. Though I’ve spent many hours crouching in these classrooms, I’m no expert. What I witnessed should be obvious to any mom or dad. That’s why, even if you are an   parent, you can rapidly determine whether you want to send your child to a particular preschool. You may also be able to save a boatload of money, since public preschools are often as good as their $30, 000 alternatives. When you walk in the door of a prekindergarten, check out the walls  —   they should be festooned with children’s projects, and not, as is too often the case, plastered with posters that are calculated to please adults and mounted too high for    to see. Look around. There should be lots of different things for children to do. If the kids say hello, and quickly return to what they have been doing, that’s a good sign, for it suggests that they’re developing social skills. But if they mob you, you have your answer: This isn’t the place for your child. You might consider yourself to be a fascinating person, but you shouldn’t be more interesting than whatever activity these   and    are engaged in. Is the class   silent? I’ve talked with    parents who equate obedience with quality, but unless you want your child in boot camp, that’s unhealthy. (Of course, running wild isn’t a good thing either that   energy belongs on the playground.) Kids should be quiet, if a bit squirmy, during circle time, when they are gathered around their teacher. But mostly they should be engaged with one another, because that’s when most learning occurs. Their teacher should be talking with them, not at them. And if the classroom looks like a healthy mix of kids from different backgrounds, that’s all to the good. Children learn a lot from their classmates, and kids with different experiences have much to contribute to one another. That’s it, more or less. If you have a chance to talk briefly with the teacher, ask her how she decides to spend time with one group or another. Inquire about how she handles children who haven’t fully learned how, as the argot goes, to use their words, take turns or share. While the answer matters, you mostly want to make sure she has really thought about those things. Winging it doesn’t make for good teaching. I imagine many readers believe that I’ve committed heresy. To them, Montessori or HighScope, Reggio Emilia or Waldorf, or some other school of   pedagogy embodies the Holy Grail. But there’s no reason to believe that one of these is better than the others. The key is how well a particular model of teaching is being carried out. A class can be a joy when the teacher truly understands how properly to use, say, the HighScope approach, which has the children decide what they want to do that day, then tackle the chosen project and later review what they’ve learned. But these techniques are devilishly hard to pull off. When done badly the result is a mighty mess. That’s why the school district in the first example allows the best teachers to design a curriculum that, while borrowing from   approaches, makes the most sense for their kids. For parents, the bottom line is simple: Watch closely what’s happening in the classroom, pick a preschool that you wish you had gone to, and your child will do just fine.",0

7270,Scientists Turn Spinach Leaf into Beating Human Heart Cells - Breitbart,"Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute have created artificial heart tissue with functioning vasculature by stripping a spinach leaf of its original cells and replacing them with human cells. [The spinach leaf was used to solve a problem faced by biological engineers when creating artificial tissues and organs. Methods such as 3D printing that generally make good copies do not have the ability to recreate the complicated vascular systems that are needed to ensure the success of any bioengineered tissue. If oxygen and nutrients cannot be transported to the cells, then that organ will fail and die.  While plants use their vasculature to transport water and nutrients rather than blood, the access to the cells that it provides is similar in design to animals. Combined with the fact that cellulose is compatible with human biology, the researchers saw a new opportunity to utilize plants in bioengineering. The process was relatively simple. The spinach leaf was first bleached via a detergent pumped through the veins, stripping away the plant cells. This took several days to complete, after which human blood vessel cells were implanted to make the veins to be compatible with human biology. The process was finished off by covering the leaf in human heart cells, which attached themselves to the skeleton. Eventually, the cells started beating like an actual heart, allowing mock blood to flow through the system. Similar experiments were conducted with peanut plants and parsley.  Joshua Gershlak, a researcher at WPI in Massachusetts and the first author on the study explained in a press release where he got the inspiration from: When I looked at the spinach leaf, its stem reminded me of an aorta. So I thought, let’s perfuse right through the stem. We weren’t sure it would work, but it turned out to be pretty easy and replicable. Its working in many other plants. This is just one step on a long road to successfully utilizing this process in medical science. Researchers need to make sure that plant scaffolds like these would not be rejected, once inside a host, with a further plan to make the new creations stronger. Glenn Gaudette, a professor of biomedical engineering wondered if they could “stack decellularized leaves, can we create a large thickness more along the thickness of a human heart wall?” Another theory was perhaps broccoli or cauliflower could be made to replicate lung tissue. Along with requiring further optimisation, it also is unclear how the tissues could be used to actually create a new organ. Researchers are upbeat, claiming that while further investigation may still be needed, “it has the potential to develop into a ‘green’ solution pertinent to a myriad of regenerative medicine applications. ” Jack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

Creative Artists Agency, dominant for decades in the entertainment business, stepped into the sports world in 2006 with the creation of CAA Sports. Many competitors regarded, and still regard, that foray as a disaster, a loss leader, or both. Even inside C. A. A. there was debate about whether the agency’s move onto the playing fields of the world reflected strategic genius or hubristic disaster. But both C. A. A. and TPG, the   firm that owns more than half the company, see CAA Sports as a new classic among growth stories, pointing to prosperous property sales with the New York Yankees, the San Francisco 49ers and FC Barcelona to talent and athlete marketing hits like Cristiano Ronaldo, J. J. Watt, and Dwyane Wade and to such media advisory successes as the PGA, the Chicago Cubs and Riot Games, among many others. In 2015, for the first time in C. A. A. ’s history, sports was the agency’s top revenue producer  —   surpassing TV and film  —   bringing in more than $215 million. In other words, the revenue baton has been passed, and with it, perhaps the very identity of C. A. A. itself. After advising the International Olympic Committee on   deals for the 2012 London Games and the 2014 Sochi Games, CAA Sports moved on to a fully American icon. The New York Yankees became the department’s first large institutional client when, in October 2007, it reached a stadium sponsorship deal for the new Yankee Stadium that would open in April 2009. In total, C. A. A. sold more than $700 million in sponsorships for the Yankees. Sponsorship partners included ATT, Delta and Pepsi. Back in 2010, LeBron James had asked his agent Leon Rose and C. A. A. to hire young Rich Paul, whom James had met in Cleveland while Paul was a teenager. For James, the move was reminiscent of what he had done years before with his childhood friend Maverick Carter. James, who was only 20, gave Carter, 23, the keys to managing his empire. By most accounts, Paul was no charity hire but rather a solid professional, and Rose was happy to bring him into the fold. The C. A. A. consultant William Wesley, flamboyantly known as World Wide Wes, was a close friend of Rose’s and heavily involved in the recruitment of athletes as a consultant for C. A. A. All might have been well, but Wesley and Paul operated on different circuits. Tension continued to build between them to the point where Rose decided the ticking bomb must be defused. In London at the 2012 Olympics, Rose had Wes and Paul join him for a lunch and a frank discussion designed to clear the air, with Rose later telling colleagues he felt better about the situation. And so he did  —   until the night of Sept. 12, less than one month later, when it was abruptly announced that Paul was leaving C. A. A. Rose, shocked and hurt, had come to think of Paul not just as a protégé but as a friend and thus didn’t see why Paul failed to give him warning  —   or even tell him personally that he’d decided to leave. The bigger surprise would come just 24 hours later, when LeBron James sent notice that he, too, was leaving the agency  —   and would join Paul’s new firm, Klutch Sports, to be based in Cleveland. The move confirmed a shift in James’s business strategy since joining the Heat. In 2011, he’d struck a deal with Fenway Sports Group (F. S. G.) led by the Red Sox owner John Henry and chairman Tom Werner, to partner with his own sports marketing firm LRMR Branding  Marketing and oversee the firm’s global marketing opportunities and commercial interests. James also received a minority stake in Liverpool, the soccer club owned by FSG. According to The Wall Street Journal, it was the first time that a professional athlete at his peak had invested in a team that in terms of prominence and prestige ranked among the most elite and formidable in the world. One year after the parting of LeBron James and C. A. A. Maverick Carter approached the agency on behalf of his client to see if there was any interest in handling James for television and movie opportunities  —   everything not covered by his N. B. A. contract or endorsement deals. The deal would be exclusively about getting James into show business. C. A. A. said no. James signed with WME the next day.   …     C. A. A. Sports made an initial foray into European soccer in 2009 when it became involved with international athlete and property representation, along with corporate consulting and media rights, but the big move occurred on Oct. 1, 2012, when CAA Eleven, a   subsidiary of C. A. A. was awarded the contract over dozens of other companies to sell broadcast rights for the latest cycle of UEFA’s national team competitions  —   the 2016 UEFA European Championship Qualifiers, along with the 2016 UEFA European Championship, and the European qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The UEFA deal garnered much attention. Previously, the organization had only sold off rights to matches individually. Now, for the first time ever, they centralized the media and the sponsorship rights to hundreds of matches. Those broadcast rights could be extraordinarily lucrative given the sport’s global footprint. A match between Germany and France isn’t just sold in those two countries but to territories around the world, and if you wanted to show that game in Argentina, South Africa, Japan, or even the United States, then your network and your money were headed to C. A. A. The deal called for C. A. A. to take the risk on overhead, in exchange for a range of commissions (roughly between 3 and 5 percent) based on revenue performance. Recently, the agency was given even more inventory to sell, and C. A. A. ’s commissions from the deal are already in the tens of millions. On June 30, 2015, David O’Connor was announced as   executive of the Madison Square Garden Company, leaving C. A. A. the following month to begin his new position. In his new deal with MSG, O’Connor was awarded $40 million in stock grants to compensate for the equity in C. A. A. that he’d left behind, vesting in just three years. His deal at MSG also came with a   contract, and if he serves all five, his total compensation will be around $115 million, with only a portion of that tied to stock performance.",0
7272,Donald Trump Names White Supremacist As Chief Strategist; Alt-Right Rejoices,"Share on Facebook 
Many of us, for some time now, have been calling out the white nationalism brewing in the nation, most specifically from the Donald Trump campaign for president and many, many of his supporters. Well, now Trump has brought that white supremacy directly into the White House with who he has named as his Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor. 
Trump just named Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon to the role of Chief Strategist and that should horrify all of us. President-elect Trump to name Stephen Bannon of Breitbart his Chief Strategist & Senior Counselor 
— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 13, 2016 NEW YORK, NY – NOVEMBER 09: Republican president-elect Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) 
According to Think Progress : 
“Trump also named Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, as “chief strategist and senior counselor” to the president. He will be one of Trump’s closest advisers and, one can presume, one of the most powerful people in America.” 
Bannon previously served as the Trump campaign CEO, and apparently, Trump believes he should carry that role into the White House. 
While at Breitbart, Bannon gave white supremacy and the alt-right a voice, embracing it with open arms. According to the Daily Wire : 
“ Andrew Breitbart despised racism. Truly despised it. He used to brag regularly about helping to integrate his fraternity at Tulane University. He insisted that racial stories be treated with special care to avoid even the whiff of racism. With Bannon embracing Trump, all that changed. Now Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website, with Yiannopoulos pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.” 
Think Progress reported: 
“Bannon gave a platform to Milo Yiannopoulos, a prominent white nationalist figure who was banned from Twitter for indicting racist abuse and harassment .” 
So now, a man who openly gave white supremacists an open platform to spread vicious hate has now been given one of the most powerful roles in the Trump administration, and in turn, the world. 
You can best be sure the alt-right white supremacists are rejoicing at this choice that gives calling it the White House a whole new meaning. 
We should all be disgusted and terrified. This is absolutely shameful, yet not at all surprising. The fact that this all comes after our first black president is all the more mortifying.

7273,Spurs’ Tim Duncan Retires After 19 N.B.A. Seasons and 5 Titles - The New York Times,"After 19 years and five championships with the San Antonio Spurs, Tim Duncan announced Monday morning that he would retire at age 40. Duncan was an elite player on an excellent Spurs team for his entire career. The Spurs made the playoffs every year in his tenure, never with a winning percentage lower than . 610, and won five titles, with Duncan the finals’ most valuable player in three of them. He also won the league M. V. P. Award twice. A relative latecomer to basketball growing up in the Virgin Islands, the    Duncan was initially a swimmer. He was the No. 1 pick in the N. B. A. draft after four years at Wake Forest. (The Spurs had the top pick as a result of a rare down season largely caused by an injury to David Robinson.) The player selected just after Duncan, Keith Van Horn, has been out of the league for a decade. Duncan initially starred in a “twin towers” lineup with Robinson, winning two titles. After Robinson’s retirement in 2004, Duncan carried on as the team’s star, winning three more N. B. A. crowns, most recently in   over the Miami Heat in LeBron James’s last year there. Duncan’s   nature often kept him out of the spotlight, but the sheer force of his accomplishments pushes him onto just about every list of the greats. Duncan ranks fifth in career blocked shots (3, 020) sixth in rebounds (15, 091) seventh in games played (1, 392) and 14th in points (26, 496). Duncan’s playing time had gradually been reduced in recent years, and he had ceded his starring role on the Spurs to Kawhi Leonard. Though he started 60 of the 61 games he played this season, he hit career lows in just about every category. But he was an   as recently as 2015. Duncan’s retirement was as quiet as Kobe Bryant’s was colorful and protracted. The Spurs released a statement highlighting his achievements, but without a quotation from the player. That did not stop many others from singing his praises on Monday: Now Duncan is highly likely to join Bryant in the Hall of Fame in 2021.",0
7274,"ISIS Destroys Part of Roman Theater in Palmyra, Syria - The New York Times","Islamic State militants have destroyed the facade of a   Roman theater and another ancient monument in the historic city of Palmyra, Syria, the Syrian   news agency reported  on Friday. The news agency, SANA, said the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had destroyed part of the theater and severely damaged a tetrapylon, a square structure of four plinths, each with four columns. The agency said the tetrapylon had two columns still standing and appeared to have been “intentionally destroyed using explosives. ” The smashing of the ancient structures was a further attempt by the group to impose its will by destroying monuments or artifacts that it says do not conform to its strict interpretation of Islam. The group’s demolition of historic sites in Iraq, Libya, Syria and elsewhere has drawn international opprobrium Unesco has branded the actions “cultural cleansing. ” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, said the destruction of the two sites in Palmyra appeared to have taken place on Jan. 11. The observatory said the acts could have been a demonstration of force before the militant group, which is under siege in Iraq and in Syria, retreats from the city. The Islamic State retook Palmyra in December, nine months after Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, pushed the group out. The militant group had terrorized citizens and destroyed numerous priceless remains in the desert city, declared a World Heritage site by Unesco. The targeting of Palmyra’s cultural treasures has particular resonance as the city’s heritage, which embodies Greek, Persian, Roman and Islamic cultures, is a vivid symbol of a prewar, multicultural Syria that is anathema to the Islamic State’s brutal and monolithic worldview. Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria’s director general of antiquities and museums, called Friday for the world to save Palmyra from further destruction. “ISIS is destroying Palmyra, building after building,” he said. “In the past, their goal was ideological,” he added, but as the group is steadily losing territory, it has become a matter of “revenge. ” The Islamic State captured Palmyra in May 2015, and it quickly started targeting cultural sites and killing soldiers and some residents who had been left behind. In a matter of months, the militants began to plunder and destroy ancient artifacts, including the    Arch of Triumph, once a popular draw for tourists, and the nearly    Temple of Baalshamin. At the time, Unesco’s director general, Irina Bokova, said the destruction of the Arch of Triumph “shows how extremists are terrified by history and culture. ” Celebrated as the “Pearl of the Desert,” Palmyra, about 150 miles northeast of Damascus, was once a refuge for travelers on the Silk Road, the ancient trade route. Temples have stood in Palmyra for thousands of years.",0

7277,"Matteo Renzi Resigns, Ending Italy’s 63rd Government in 70 Years - The New York Times","ROME  —   Matteo Renzi officially stepped down as prime minister on Wednesday, three days after his stinging defeat in a critical referendum, formally ending Italy’s 63rd government in 70 years. Mr. Renzi had already tendered his resignation early Monday, after Italians overwhelmingly rejected a series of proposed changes to the Constitution on which he had staked his seat. On Monday, President Sergio Mattarella asked the prime minister to stay on to approve the budget for the coming year. The budget was passed on Wednesday, and Mr. Renzi formalized his resignation soon after. This time, Mr. Mattarella accepted, but he asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity to handle    affairs. The ball now falls into Mr. Mattarella’s court. On Thursday, he will begin consulting with the leaders of Italy’s political parties to verify the various options open to him. The Italian president could call for new elections, but he has made clear that he will not consider returning to the polls before a new electoral law has been passed. The current electoral law for the lower house is under review by Italy’s constitutional court. The court announced on Tuesday that it would issue a decision on the constitutionality of the law, known as the Italicum, on Jan. 24. Another electoral law applies to the Senate, and Mr. Mattarella says he will not call new elections until a single electoral system covers both houses of Parliament, the Italian news media reported. The government crisis did not appear to rattle the Italian stock market on Wednesday, which closed up 2. 1 percent. Even Italy’s banks, saddled with bad loans, closed higher. Political stability has always been elusive in Italy. A combination of a multiparty system and its electoral laws make it difficult for any one party to have a strong majority. The changes Mr. Renzi asked Italians to approve were meant to streamline the legislative process and shrink the Senate by   making it easier to pass necessary, if unpopular, overhauls to   the moribund Italian economy. Mr. Renzi had campaigned vigorously in favor of the changes to the Constitution, but 59. 1 percent of the voters rejected them. Mr. Renzi’s government was one of only four governments to last more than 1, 000 days. He came to power in 2014 after staging an internal party coup, alienating his Democratic Party’s more   factions. The referendum and subsequent fall of Mr. Renzi further aggravated this fissure, and speculation was rife in the news media this week over Mr. Renzi’s role at the helm of the party. “There’s an internal discussion that must be held that I think will be difficult,” Mr. Renzi told members of his party on Wednesday afternoon. But he asked that the showdown not take place until after the Italian president resolves the government crisis. Mr. Renzi also said he would not be part of the delegation that is to meet with Mr. Matterella in coming days. The failure of the measures on the referendum call for “ample considerations,” he said during a relaxed,     speech at the party’s headquarters. He was warmly applauded. The problems that he, and the Parliament, had hoped to resolve through the proposed changes to the Constitution still have to be dealt with, he said. In a nod to the populist pull of the Five Star Movement, the party set to pose the biggest threat in the next elections, Mr. Renzi took a page from their playbook and said that his party’s discussions in coming days would be streamed online. “We want to be transparent to all citizens, and to our people,” Mr. Renzi said. Various people have been discussed as possible successors to Mr. Renzi, Among them are Pietro Grasso, president of the Senate, and Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister, who is respected in Europe. The president could also ask Mr. Renzi’s party to try to form another government. In a newsletter published on his website on Wednesday, Mr. Renzi said he was not in a position to decide on Italy’s future anymore. “The parties  —   all the parties  —   must accept their responsibilities,” he wrote.",0
7279,Baghdad Pans Kurdish Freedom Referendum as U.S. Warns Against Islamic State Distractions - Breitbart,"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   issued a statement Friday rejecting the call by Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Masoud Barzani for a national independence referendum, declaring that the Kurdish people cannot “decide its fate unilaterally. ”[Iraqi News carried the statement by   which followed Barzani’s declaration that the Kurds would hold a referendum vote in September.  “Iraqi relies on the constitution as the reference for shaping the relation between the federal government and Kurdistan region,” the statement, issued by spokesman Saad   read. “No party can decide its fate unilaterally.   …     All Iraqis should have their say regarding their homeland’s fate. ” A number of interested government parties have weighed in on the announcement, including the governments of Turkey, Germany, and the United States. The U. S. State Department issued its remarks on the matter on Thursday, warning against the referendum taking place before the ultimate defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq. A coalition including Kurdish Peshmerga forces,   Iraqi Shiite militias, and the Iraqi military are currently fighting to eradicate the Islamic State completely from its final major stronghold in the country of Mosul. “We support a unified, stable and a federal Iraq. We appreciate and understand the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Iraqi Kurdistan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. “We   …     encourage the regional authorities to engage with the government of Iraq on the full range of important issues, including the future of relations between Baghdad and Erbil, on the bases of the Iraqi constitution. ” Nauert added concern that the referendum could damage efforts to address “more urgent priorities” than a free Kurdistan, including the fight against the Islamic State. American officials have long expressed a belief that Kurdistan would become an independent state in the near future, however. “Kurdish independence is on a trajectory where it is probably not if, but when,” Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the head of Pentagon intelligence, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. “And it will complicate the situation unless there’s an agreement in Baghdad —  an agreement that all of the parties can live with. ” The KRG, based in Erbil, cooperates with the United States on   activities and maintains friendly relations with neighbors like Turkey, currently embroiled in a regional conflict with two other Kurdish entities, the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The KRG has repeatedly demanded that both the YPG and PKK stay out of KRG territory. The Turkish government has, nonetheless, loudly opposed the KRG independence referendum, with officials calling the vote a “grave mistake. ” Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım personally referred to the vote as “irresponsible. ” The Kurdish outlet Rudaw quotes a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) member saying that Turkish officials also privately “threatened” Iraqi Kurds who sought to organize the referendum. Barzani announced through a Twitter statement on Wednesday that the referendum would take place on September 25. The presidential office also released an official announcement confirming that the KRG leadership had “decided that the date for the independence referendum shall be Monday, September 25, 2017. It will be on that day when the people of the Kurdistan Region, as well as those living in the disputed areas, will cast their votes on whether they accept independence for the Kurdistan. ” The announcement triggered mass exclamations of support from Kurds on social media, according to Kurdistan24, which notes that “Kurds are believed to be the largest stateless nation in the world, estimated to be over 40 million. ” Many added the Kurdish flag to their profile photos and expressed support for Barzani. Opinion polls among Kurds also corroborate the strong support for independence that appeared online. We crossed the Rubicon with that decision, there is no going back,” KRG senior adviser Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters Thursday. “A referendum is a democratic process, no democratic country can oppose having a referendum we are not talking about independence, we are talking about the referendum. ” The Kurdish outlet BasNews reports that   Arab Iraqis also appear supportive of the move, with a Turkmen political leader expressing support for the “significant” measure, and a Yazidi leader stating, “Kurdish Yezidis support referendum and independence of Kurdistan Region. ” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",0
7280,Now We Can Finally Get to Work,"Posted on November 9, 2016 by DavidSwanson 
Dear Democrats, 
Are you finding yourselves suddenly a bit doubtful of the wisdom of drone wars? Presidential wars without Congress? Massive investment in new, smaller, “more usable” nuclear weapons? The expansion of bases across Africa and Asia? Are you disturbed by the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen? Can total surveillance and the persecution of whistleblowers hit a point where they’ve gone too far? Is the new Cold War with Russia looking less than ideal now? How about the militarization of U.S. police: is it time to consider alternatives to that? 
I hear you. I’m with you. Let’s build a movement together to end the madness of constantly overthrowing governments with bombs. Let’s propose nonviolent alternatives to a culture gone mad with war. Let’s end the mindset that creates war in the first place . 
We have opportunities as well as dangers. A President Trump is unpredictable. He wants to proliferate nuclear weapons, bomb people, kill people, stir up hatred of people, and increase yet further military spending. But he also said the new Cold War was a bad idea. He said he wanted to end NATO, not to mention NAFTA, as well as breaking the habit of overthrowing countries left and right. Trump seems to immediately back off such positions under the slightest pressure. Will he adhere to them under massive pressure from across the political spectrum? It’s worth a try . 
We have an opportunity to build a movement that includes a focus on and participation from refugees/immigrants. We have a chance to create opposition to racist wars and racism at home. We may just discover that what’s left of the U.S. labor movement is suddenly more open to opposing wars. Environmental groups may find a willingness to oppose the world’s top destroyer of the environment: the U.S. military. Civil liberties groups may at long last be willing to take on the militarism that creates the atrocities they oppose. We have to work for such a broader movement. We have to build on the trend of protesting the national anthem and make it a trend of actively resisting the greatest purveyor of violence on earth. 
I know you’re feeling a little beat down at the moment. You shouldn’t. You had a winning candidate in Bernie Sanders. Your party cheated him out of the nomination. All that stuff you tell yourselves about encouraging demographic trends and the better positions of young people is all true. You just looked for love in all the wrong places. Running an unpopular candidate in a broken election system is not the way to change the world. Even a working election system would not be the central means by which to improve anything. There’s no getting back the mountains of money and energy invested in this election. But activism is an unlimited resource. Directing your energies now in more strategic directions can inspire others who in turn can re-inspire you. 

Dear Republicans, 
Your outsider is threatening insiderness. He’s got the same tribe of DC corporate lobbyists planning his nominations that Hillary Clinton had lined up for hers. Can we resist that trend? Can we insist that the wars be ended? Can those moments of off-the-cuff honesty about dinosaurs like NATO be turned into actual action? Donald Trump took a lot of heat for proposing to be fair to Palestinians as well as Israelis, and he backed off fast. Can we encourage him to stand behind that initial inclination? 
Can we stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership and end NAFTA as well? We heard a million speeches about how bad NAFTA is. How about actually ending it? Can we stop the looming war supplemental spending bill? Can we put a swift halt to efforts in Congress to repeal the right to sue Saudi Arabia and other nations for their wars and lesser acts of terrorism? 
How about all that well deserved disgust with the corporate media? Can we actually break up that cartel and allow opportunities for media entrepreneurs? 

Dear United States, 
Donald Trump admitted we had a broken election system and for a while pretended that he would operate outside of it by funding his own campaign. It’s time to actually fix it. It’s time to end the system of legalized bribery, fund elections, make registration automatic, make election day a holiday, end gerrymandering, eliminate the electoral college, create the right to vote, create the public hand-counting of paper ballots at every polling place, and create ranked choice voting as Maine just did. 
Voter suppression efforts in this year’s elections should be prosecuted in each state. And any indications of fraud in vote counting by machines should be investigated. We should take the opportunity created by all the McCarthyist nonsense allegations of Russian interference to get rid of unverifiable voting. 
There are also areas in which localities and states, as well as international organizations and alliances, must now step up to take the lead. First and foremost is investing in a serious effort to avoid climate catastrophe. Second is addressing inequality that has surpassed the Middle Ages: both taxing the overclass and upholding the underclass must be pursued creatively. Mass incarceration and militarized police are problems that states can solve. 
But we can advance a positive agenda across the board by understanding this election in the way that much of the world will understand it: as a vote against endless war. Let’s end the wars, end the weapons dealing, close the bases, and cut the $1 trillion a year going into the military. Hell, why not demand that a businessman president for the first time ever audit the Pentagon and find out what it’s spending money on? 

Dear World, 
We apologize for having elected President Trump as well as for nearly electing President Clinton. Many of you believe we defeated the representative of the enlightenment in favor of the sexist racist buffoon. This may be a good thing. Or at least it may be preferable to your eight-year-long delusion that President Obama was a man of peace and justice. 
I hate to break it to you, but the United States government has been intent on dominating the rest of you since the day it was formed. If electing an obnoxious president helps you understand that, so much the better. Stop joining in U.S. “humanitarian wars” please. They never were humanitarian, and if you can recognize that now, so much the better. The new guy openly wants to “steal their oil.” So did the last several presidents, although none of them said so. Are we awake now? 
Shut down the U.S. bases in your country. They represent your subservience to Donald Trump. Close them. 
Want to save the earth’s climate? Build a nonviolent movement that resists destructive agendas coming out of the United States. 
Want to uphold the rule of law, diplomacy, aid, decency, and humanitarianism? Stop making exceptions for U.S. crimes. Tell the International Criminal Court to indict a non-African. Prosecute the crime and crimes of war in your own courts. Stop cooperating in the surrounding and threatening of Russia, China, and Iran. Clinton wanted to send weapons to Ukraine and bomb Syria. Make sure Trump doesn’t. Make peace in Ukraine and Syria before January. 
It’s time that we all began treating the institution of war as the unacceptable vestige of barbarism that it can appear when given an openly racist, sexist, bigoted face. We have the ability to use nonviolent tools to direct the world where we want it to go. We have to stop believing the two big lies: that we are generally powerless, and that our only power lies in elections. Let’s finally get active. Let’s start by ending war making .

""I want everybody to pay attention here. This is dangerous,"" Obama said at a Hillary for America event in Miami Gardens, Florida. ""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them."" Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Florida's early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trump's ""dark, pessimistic fear-mongering."" ""Our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people,"" Obama said. On Wednesday night's debate Trump, answered, ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked whether he would concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense."" Trump also doubled down on Thursday in Ohio saying he will accept the results of next month's election as long as wins. Obama also used the opportunity while in Florida to weigh in on the close Senate race in Florida between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy. ""Even Marco Rubio says there's no rigging of the vote,"" Obama said, ""Which I'd like to give credit for, except he's refuting the dangerous, unprecedented claims of a candidate he says he's still going to vote for!"" Earlier this week, Obama released a new ad for the Democrat in the Sunshine State, the same week it was announced the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was puling money for ads for Murphy.",0
7284,Anthropologists admit they still snigger when studying homo erectus,"October 31, 2016 
At a conference on the evolution of early humans, it has been announced that everyone still sniggers, many audibly, when they see “Homo Erectus” in books or, in particular, when projected during a presentation. 
A leading evolutionary anthropologist explained that; “Ever since Dubois discovered Homo Erectus fossils in the late 19th century, scientists have been trying to suppress laughter. When a paper entitled ‘Genital variation in Homo Erectus’ was presented by Doctor Seymour Cox of the University of Cockfosters the room just…I’m sorry, can you give me a couple of minutes?”   31st, 2016 by apepper   apepper   News In Brief 0",0
7285,Our New Country: Women And Minorities Hardest Hit,"Our New Country: Women And Minorities Hardest Hit Ann Coulter, VDARE, October 26, 2016 
Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn’t help that white voters can’t agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they’ll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats–the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else–the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
Look to Mexico for your future–or any Third World country. Or to Univision’s Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) 
Explaining Latino culture’s acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that “the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. . . . Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.” 
One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an “open mind” about child rape because “it’s a cultural thing.” 
{snip} 
, our media already have a totally “open mind” about incest and child rape–and murder!–when it’s committed by immigrants. 
{snip} 
Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too–provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
{snip} 
Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. 
Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans–or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. {snip} 
Our country will be Zimbabwe, but–if all goes according to the Democrats’ plan–they’ll get to be Mugabe! 
That’s Hillary’s dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran’s parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: “Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.”",0
7286,"Italian Inmates Sip, Smell and Taste Their Way to Rehabilitation - The New York Times","LECCE, Italy  —   One of his first students was a young man he had arrested four years earlier. Others have been convicted of armed robbery, drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia. The classrooms are frugally equipped, behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars, although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls. But none of that deterred Marco Albanese, a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five, from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage. Mr. Albanese, 43, is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers, or wine stewards. The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills, as well as to help them develop a bond with the region, which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes. The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students, who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon. It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese. “I could see their human aspect, once they were out of their context,” Mr. Albanese, who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class. “And I didn’t have to keep the same distance, now that I was their ‘professor. ’” He added, “They also deserve a second chance, and it’s important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life. ” In eight lessons, the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes, learn how to taste, choose and serve local wines. “We hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory, so that they can later choose to work here, already having the right skill set,” said Rita Russo, the director of Lecce Penitentiary, which is the largest in the region of Apulia. Inmates can also study for their high school diplomas, cultivate tomatoes, take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors. Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine, explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy. On a school table, covered with a khaki tablecloth, stood wine glasses, ready for use. Three bottles of chardonnay, a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby. Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners, who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars. For a finale, he offered a   tip. “Do remember, even if you had Trump over for dinner, the pope would still be served first. The clergy does come first, even before heads of state,” he said, to raucous laughter. The prisoners, whose identity is being protected by the prison, were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article. Roberto Giannone, who works for the local sommelier association, then demonstrated how to open a bottle, neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts, inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork. “Once the cork is out,” he said, “use a napkin to show it to your customers. It’s an easy way to be polite and avoid objections. ” Since the 1970s, the Italian penal system has focused on   for inmates. However, a lack of funds for rehabilitation, as well as chronic overcrowding, means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day. That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs, including a restaurant inside a   prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates. But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy. “Of course, sommelier courses can’t be considered a treatment,” said Georgia Zara, the head of a program at the University of Turin that offers a master’s degree in criminological and forensic psychology. “But they do educate inmates and create social interaction, which is very important. ” The classes also offer a “bridge between the jail context and the world outside, so it’s a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism,” Ms. Zara said. Gianvito Rizzo, 53, is the chief executive at the Feudi di Guagnano, a local vintner that provides wine, like negroamaro, for the classes. He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison. Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances, some inmates in Italy are allowed to work outside prisons. “I see wine in a democratic way,” Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently. “The countryside is the opposite to a cell. You are free. You smell nature, and learn to care for it. I think it’d be good also for inmates to try it out. ” Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master’s degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago, he had been “fixated” on doing something for his native region of Salento, in Apulia, on the heel of the Italian boot. He settled on going into the wine business, which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers. He now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers, added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf. He calls this collaborative effort his “first social experiment. ” When Mr. Rizzo heard about the penitentiary’s activities for prisoners, he proposed the sommelier classes to Ms. Russo. While it is unclear if any of the students will ever become professional sommeliers, the exposure to the world of wine provided by the classes has been very welcome. “I don’t even drink, but I’ve learned to sip it, smell it and taste it,” said one inmate, who is serving a   sentence and who was granted an exception to speak anonymously. “You can think it’s a small thing, but it means the world to us. ”",0
7287,Undermining America: Did Obama Just Encourage Illegals to Vote?,"November 8, 2016 Undermining America: Did Obama Just Encourage Illegals to Vote? 
In perhaps the most tortured presidential answer since Bill Clinton parsed the word “is,” Barack Obama offered a response in a Friday interview that many say gives illegal aliens a green light to vote. Worse still, there may be reason to suspect he was fed the question in advance and gave a premeditated, Machiavellian answer. 
While talking to actress and rapper Gina Rodriguez on the Latin-oriented YouTube channel MiTu, Obama was asked, “Many of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented, um, citizens — and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country — are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?” Here was Obama’s answer (video below): 
Not true. And the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself — and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, et cetera. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for.",0
7288,“Bill Clinton Is A Rapist” Protester Makes Hillary Lose Her Mind,"We Are Change 
Political strategist Roger Stone and Alex Jones of Infowars have made it well known to the Clinton campaign that “Bill Clinton is a rapist” – by sending an army of their followers to heckle the Clintons with well-known accusations that Bill raped Juanita Broaddrick and others while Hillary covered it up.
It took a wild turn yesterday when Hillary exposed herself and her history of anger management issues that several former Secret Service agents assigned to Hillary and White House staffers have detailed.
Hillary Clinton’s temper flared Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a protester interrupted her.
“Bill Clinton is a rapist!” the protester shouted as the audience began to boo him.
Clinton’s attitude then changed like a flick of a switch and she became angry exposing that legendary behavior that Secret Service and White House staffers have alleged for years.
“You know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive vision from people who support Donald Trump,” she screamed into the mic before the crowds uproar drowned her out.
“We are not going backwards, we are going forwards!” she yelled, pointing at the protester.
“So how do we do that? For the next seven days, we focus on what is important. Don’t get distracted. Don’t get diverted. Focus on the country and the world we want to help create,” she continued.
The latest greatest craze has taken over Clinton’s campaign rallies for the past month since Infowars announced it’s contest and even though people are no longer being paid for their “services,” people continue to protest Hillary’s rallies calling Bill Clinton a rapist.
Earlier in October in Detroit, another protester a black man was wearing a Bill Clinton is a rapist t-shirt when Clinton confronted him turned around, and gave a gesture with her left hand extended and called for “someone” to stage an “intervention” on the protester. 
While at another rally in October, violent “Democrats” who support Hillary Clinton beat up another Bill Clinton is a rapist protester . Bill Clinton is a rapist protesters even disrupted Obama’s North Carolina Greensboro rally for Hillary Clinton. Here’s the best of the Bill Clinton is a rapist protesters prior to October 9th.
Wikileaks has even proven that the Clinton campaign was worried about Bill Clinton being a rapist and they were worried that a comparison would be made between Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton . Dozens of women suspected to be hundreds are alleged to have been raped by Bill Clinton. The latest rape revelation is an ex Arkansas reporter Leslie Millwee claims she was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton three separate times.

7290,FBI still does not have warrant to review new Clinton emails,"Yahoo News FBI Director James Comey wrote his bombshell letter to Congress on Friday about newly discovered emails that were potentially “pertinent” to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server before agents were able to review any of the material because the bureau had not yet gotten a search warrant to read them, three government officials who have been briefed on the probe told Yahoo News. 
When Comey wrote the letter, “he had no idea what was in the content of the emails,” one of the officials said, referring to recently discovered emails that were found on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sending illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl. 
As of Saturday night, the FBI had still not gotten approval from the Justice Department for a warrant that would allow them to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails, and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. 
“We do not have a warrant,” a senior law enforcement official said. “Discussions are underway [between the FBI and the Justice Department] as to the best way to move forward.” 
That Comey and other senior FBI officials were unaware of what was in the emails — and whether they contained any material the FBI had not already obtained — is important because the campaign of Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have suggested that the FBI director would not have written his letter unless he had been made aware of significant new emails that might justify reopening the investigation into the Clinton server. 
But a message that Comey wrote to all FBI agents Friday seeking to explain his decision to write the controversial letter strongly hinted that investigators did not not yet have legal authority establishing “probable cause” to review the content of Abedin’s emails on Weiner’s electronic devices. 
In that message, Comey told agents that he had only been briefed on Thursday about the matter and that the “recommendation” of investigators was “with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case.” 
Comey approved the recommendation to seek judicial access to the material that day, he wrote. 
“Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them,” he told agents. Comey’s letter to Congress has brought the FBI director under withering criticism. Top Justice Department officials were described by a government source as “apoplectic” over the letter. Senior officials “strongly discouraged” Comey from sending it, telling FBI officials last week it would violate longstanding department policy against taking actions in the days before an election that might influence the outcome, a U.S official familiar with the matter told Yahoo News. “He was acting independently of the guidance given to him,” said the U.S. official. 
Comey insisted in his message to agents that he felt he had “an obligation” to inform Congress about the new material because he had previously testified that the bureau’s investigation into the Clinton email server was completed. He said it would be “misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” He added, “Given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression.” 
The decision to send the letter “wasn’t easy,” said the senior law enforcement official. Comey and top FBI officials debated what course to take once they learned about the discovery on Weiner’s laptop –– said to include thousands of Abedin’s emails. In the end, the official said, Comey feared that if he chose to move forward and seek access to the emails and didn’t immediately alert Congress, the FBI’s efforts would leak to the media and the director would be accused of concealing information. 
“This was the least bad choice,” the senior official said. 
But Comey’s letter to Congress — suggesting that the FBI might now revisit the Clinton email probe — may have been even more misleading, some critics charged Saturday. 
“This letter is troubling because it is vaguely worded and leaves so many questions unanswered,” Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and three other Democrats on the panel wrote Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch. 
“It is not clear whether the emails identified by the FBI are even in the custody of the FBI, whether any of the emails have already been reviewed, whether Secretary Clinton sent or received them, or whether they even have any significance to the FBI’s previous investigation,” the senators wrote. A Yahoo News review of Abedin’s interview with FBI agents last April — when the Clinton email probe was in full swing — shows that the longtime Clinton aide hinted that there might be relevant material on her husband’s personal devices. But agents do not appear to have followed up on the clues. 
Abedin, who served as Clinton’s deputy chief of staff and held a top-secret security clearance, disclosed she had access to four email accounts while working at the State Department. 
These accounts, Abedin said, included an official State Department email account, but also an account on Clinton’s private email server that Abedin used to communicate with Clinton and her top aides, as well as a personal Yahoo account. She used both the Clinton email account and the Yahoo account to “routinely” forward State Department emails and documents so she could more easily print them, she said. In addition, she told the agents, she had a separate email account that she had previously used “to support her husband’s political activities.” 
Abedin’s interview — conducted by agents at the FBI’s Washington field office last April 5 — was the first tip-off that the longtime Clinton aide might have circulated official State Department material among her multiple accounts. At one point, agents even confronted Abedin on one apparently sensitive email about U.S. policy towards Pakistan that had been forwarded to her State Department account from an aide to the late Richard Holbrooke, then a special State Department envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Abedin had forwarded the email to her Yahoo account in order to print it, but told agents she was “unaware of the classification of the document and stated that she did not make judgments on the classification of material she received. Instead, she relied on the sender to make that assessment and to properly make and transmit the document.” There is no indication from the eight-page FBI report on the interview, however, that the agents ever pressed her on what has now turned into an explosive issue in the final days of the 2016 campaign: Did Weiner have access to any classified government documents on his laptop and iPhone — devices that, he apparently used to exchange sexually charged messages with women he met online, including in one alleged case, an underage teenager in North Carolina? 
The fact that FBI agents failed to do so shows that the original probe into the Clinton email server was “not thorough” and was “fatally flawed,” said Joseph DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney and independent counsel who has been a strong critic of Comey and the FBI probe. “The first thing they should have done was gotten a sworn affidavit about all her accounts and devices,” he said, adding that agents should have immediately followed up to obtain the devices, including Weiner’s. 
But it is still far from clear which State Department emails might be on the devices that Weiner had access to. In a separate civil lawsuit brought by a conservative group, Judicial Watch, Abedin gave testimony in June that appeared to differ in some respects from what she told the FBI. Asked in that case about her email accounts, Abedin told Judicial Watch lawyers that she rarely used the personal Yahoo account, and that when she did, she only used it to forward State Department “press clips” so she could print them.",0

7292,"Comment on Senator NUKES Clinton Foundation, Calls it “Largest Money Laundering…Operation in the World” by T. Mohr","Home / Be The Change / Government Corruption / Senator NUKES Clinton Foundation, Calls it “Largest Money Laundering…Operation in the World” Senator NUKES Clinton Foundation, Calls it “Largest Money Laundering…Operation in the World” Jack Burns November 2, 2016 3 Comments 
Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) lambasted the Clintons and their foundation, equating the former first family to corrupt money launderers. Cotton, a Harvard Law School graduate, and former paratrooper with the 101 st Airborne division of the U.S. Army knows a thing or two about the law regarding classified information and corruption. And, he has some harsh criticism for both the Clinton Foundation and the former secretary of state herself, Hillary Clinton. 
Cotton was a guest on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show, The Hugh Hewitt Show Tuesday. The talk show host asked Cotton about FBI Director James Comey’s re-opening of the investigation into Clinton’s email scandal after potential classified information was found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner. Weiner, estranged husband of Huma Abedin, was being investigated for sexting a 15-year-old North Carolina girl when the discovery was made. In all, a reported 650,000 emails were found supposedly belonging to Abedin and may have contained classified emails sent and received by former secretary of state Clinton. 
Cotton said, “650,000 emails is a lot of emails. But then again, when you use modern searching techniques, you might be able to winnow it pretty quickly.” But he’s cautiously optimistic that the FBI can do the winnowing down quite quickly saying, “You would think that even if it’s in the thousands, or tens of thousands, the FBI has enough agents that they could review them pretty quickly. A lot of these agents are pretty familiar with the subject material, having investigated the Clinton email server to begin with. Some of them, apparently, have been investigating the Clinton Foundation now for months.” 
The senator from Arkansas stressed the seriousness of the discovery by saying, “what Director Comey has said he found in the emails from Hillary Clinton’s server and devices, which is that she was extremely careless with the handling of classified information, now so much so that classified information of the United States government may be found on the computer of a man under investigation for underage sex abuse.” 
As The Free Thought Project reported, speculation exists as to whether or not the discovery was an intentional attempt by Weiner to cut a deal with federal prosecutors to avoid a longer prison sentence if he’s convicted of felonious sexting a minor. 
Cotton scoffed at the Democrats’ blaming Comey for re-opening the investigation. He pointed the finger squarely at Clinton saying, “Hillary Clinton only has one person to blame for all of this. She is the one that set up that private server. She is the one that used it for classified information. She’s the one that violated U.S. government security in handling materials. She’s the one that always thinks she can get away with it. This is not an FBI or a Director Comey problem. This is a Hillary Clinton problem, and this is why so many Americans view her as untrustworthy and dishonest.” 
Later in the interview with Hewitt, Cotton turned his attention to the Clinton Foundation and called it a massive money laundering front. He said, “We now know there were no fewer than four FBI investigations into the Clintons and their close associates — the Foundation, the emails, Abedin and Weiner and Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia.” 
Going further he stated, “And I suspect that that was a very high-ranking Department of Justice political appointee who was carrying water for the Clinton machine and wanted to shut down an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, which increasingly looks like one of the largest money laundering and influence peddling operations in the world.” 
“This is why if Hillary Clinton wins this election and they don’t shut down the Clinton Foundation and come clean with all of its past activities, then there’s no telling the kind of corruption that you might see out of the Clinton White House,” the outspoken senator from Arkansas declared. 
Even if classified information is found on Weiner’s computer, the case against Clinton is likely dead in its tracks and is just a ploy to win back the trust of the American people toward the FBI. As The Free Thought Project reported Tuesday, The Justice Department’s Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik is believed to be John Podesta’s best friend. 
Podesta is, of course, Clinton’s campaign manager. So, it’s highly unlikely Clinton will ever be indicted. But thanks to Wikileaks, Podesta may now also become the target of an investigation after it was revealed this week that he ordered Clinton’s emails be “dump(ed)” as soon as the news broke she was using an unauthorized private email server based out of her home. Dumping emails, while a subpoena for those emails was being issued, could result in obstruction of justice charges against Podesta. But wait, that’s right — his best friend would have to be the one to bring charges against him. 
So what you apparently have is a corrupt campaign manager, a corrupt candidate, a corrupt investigator, a corrupt FBI (who refuses to prosecute the former first lady for mishandling classified information), a corrupt Justice Department, and a corrupt president, whose cabinet and staffers reportedly “ALL” use private email to conduct official business and skirt around the Federal Records Act. No wonder this country is facing such massive problems; broken educational system, unjust wars, massive deficits, out of control spending, and police brutality, to name a few. Its leaders are gangsters. Share",0
7293,"Donald Trump Criticizes Muslim Family of Slain U.S. Soldier, Drawing Ire - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump belittled the parents of a slain Muslim soldier who had strongly denounced Mr. Trump during the Democratic National Convention, saying that the soldier’s father had delivered the entire speech because his mother was not “allowed” to speak. Mr. Trump’s comments, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that will air on Sunday, drew quick and widespread condemnation and amplified calls for Republican leaders to distance themselves from their presidential nominee. With his implication that the soldier’s mother had not spoken because of female subservience expected in some traditional strains of Islam, his comments also inflamed his hostilities with American Muslims. Khizr Khan, the soldier’s father, lashed out at Mr. Trump in an interview on Saturday, saying his wife had not spoken at the convention because it was too painful for her to talk about her son’s death. Mr. Trump, he said, “is devoid of feeling the pain of a mother who has sacrificed her son. ” Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a rival of Mr. Trump’s in the Republican primaries who has refused to endorse him, castigated him on Twitter. “There’s only one way to talk about Gold Star parents: with honor and respect,” he wrote, using the term for surviving family members of those who died in war. And Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, said he “was not a normal presidential candidate. ” “Someone who attacks everybody has something missing,” she told a crowd at a campaign stop in Youngstown, Ohio. “I don’t know what it is. I’m not going to get into that. ” Mr. Khan’s speech at the convention in Philadelphia was one of the most powerful given there. It was effectively the Democratic response to comments Mr. Trump has made implying many American Muslims have terrorist sympathies or stay silent when they know ones who do. Mr. Trump has called to ban Muslim immigration as a way to combat terrorism. At the convention, Mr. Khan spoke about how his    son, Humayun Khan, an Army captain, died in a car bombing in 2004 in Iraq as he tried to save other troops. He criticized Mr. Trump, saying he “consistently smears the character of Muslims,” and pointedly challenged what sacrifices Mr. Trump had made. Holding a   copy of the Constitution, he asked if Mr. Trump had read it. Mr. Khan’s wife stood silently by his side. Mr. Trump told Mr. Stephanopoulos that Mr. Khan seemed like a “nice guy” and that he wished him “the best of luck. ” But, he added, “If you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably  —   maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say, you tell me. ” Mr. Trump also told Maureen Dowd of The New York Times on Friday night, “I’d like to hear his wife say something. ” In a statement late Saturday, Mr. Trump called Captain Khan a “hero,” and reiterated his belief that the United States should bar Muslims from entering the country. “While I feel deeply for the loss of his son,” he added, “Mr. Khan, who has never met me, has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution, (which is false) and say many other inaccurate things. ” Even given Mr. Trump’s reputation for retaliating when attacked, his remarks about the Khans were startling. They called to mind one of his earliest counterpunches of the campaign, when he responded to criticism from Senator John McCain of Arizona, once a prisoner of war in Vietnam, by saying at a forum in Iowa, “I like people that weren’t captured. ” But Mr. McCain has a long history in the public eye. The Khans, before their convention appearance, had none. “Trump is totally void of any decency because he is unaware of how to talk to a Gold Star family and how to speak to a Gold Star mother,” Mr. Khan said on Saturday. Ms. Khan did speak on Friday to MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell, saying she “cannot even come in the room where his pictures are. ” When she saw her son’s photograph on the screen behind her on the stage in Philadelphia, she said, “I couldn’t take it. ” “I controlled myself at that time,” she said, while choking back tears. “It is very hard. ” In his interview with The Times, Mr. Khan said his wife had helped him craft his convention speech, and told him to remove certain attacks he had wanted to make against Mr. Trump. But on Saturday, he unmuzzled himself. “Unlike Donald Trump’s wife, I didn’t plagiarize my speech,” Mr. Khan said, referring to how several lines from a Michelle Obama speech found their way into Melania Trump’s address at the Republican National Convention. “I also wanted to talk about how he’s had three wives, and yet he talks about others’ ethics and their religion,” Mr. Khan said. “She said, ‘Don’t go to his level. We are paying tribute to our son. ’” Mr. Trump’s comments provoked another avalanche of criticism on social media, and again put Republican leaders in a difficult position, facing new demands that they repudiate their presidential nominee. Even before Mr. Trump’s remarks to ABC News, Mr. Khan had asked that Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, denounce Mr. Trump. On Saturday, neither directly addressed Mr. Trump’s new comments. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, referred to Mr. McConnell’s response last year that a ban on Muslims entering the United States would be unacceptable. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, delivered a similar response: “The speaker has made clear many times that he rejects this idea, and himself has talked about how Muslim Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. ” In the same ABC News interview, when Mr. Stephanopoulos said that Mr. Khan had pointed out that his family would not have been allowed into the United States under Mr. Trump’s proposed ban, the candidate replied, “He doesn’t know that. ” And when asked what he would say to the grieving father, Mr. Trump replied, “I’d say, ‘We’ve had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism. ’” Mr. Stephanopoulos also noted that Mr. Khan said that Mr. Trump had “sacrificed nothing,” and had lost no one. “I think I’ve made a lot of sacrifices,” Mr. Trump replied. “I’ve worked very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs. ” Some of the fiercest condemnations on Saturday came from Republicans who have argued  —   unsuccessfully to date  —   that Mr. Trump is unfit to be president. Tim Miller, a former communications director for Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, called Mr. Trump’s comments “inhuman. ” “Memo to Trump supporters,” Peter Wehner, a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter. “He’s a man of sadistic cruelty. With him there’s no bottom. Now go ahead  defend him. ” Reihan Salam, a conservative writer for National Review and a frequent Trump critic, said that Mr. Trump had an opportunity to declare remorse for the Khans while still holding to his own views as a candidate. “He might have asked why Humayun Khan had died in the first place  —   because of a war that many, if not most, Americans regard as a tragic blunder,” he said. “There was really no benefit for Trump in suggesting that Ghazala Khan had been muzzled,” he added, “because she could easily come out and say that she had been too   to speak, which she did. ” Ibrahim Hooper, the spokesman for the Council on   Relations, said on Saturday, “It’s really despicable that anyone, let alone a presidential candidate, would choose to dishonor the service of an American who gave his life for this nation. ” Ms. Khan, he said, “was obviously there to support her husband, who was offering what many people believe was the most impactful speech of the entire convention. ” As is often the case, Mr. Trump, who has had no campaign events this weekend, managed with a few words to overshadow Mrs. Clinton, who was making several stops in Ohio and Pennsylvania with her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. In the ABC News interview, Mr. Trump also hedged over whether he would participate in the three scheduled debates with Mrs. Clinton. He insinuated that she had worked to schedule two during football games so viewership would be lower, and said that the National Football League had sent him a letter complaining about the timing. The debates were scheduled in September of last year by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. And while Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for the National Football League, said the league was not thrilled about the scheduling, “we did not send a letter to Trump. ”",0
7294,Trump’s Trade War May Have Already Begun - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   America’s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends. They have heard the mantra “America First” from the new president, divining a Trump doctrine: global cooperation last. Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump’s denigration of the European Union and his apparent esteem for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world. Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. Many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself  —   ironies notwithstanding  —   as a champion for global engagement. “We’ve always said that America is our best friend,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup  —   comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency  —   said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. “If that’s no longer the case, if that’s what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends. ” “China is a very strong candidate for that,” he added. “The Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn’t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends. ” On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. “The two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,” a German government spokesman later said in a written statement. The swift reassessment of trade relations  —   a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II  —   only amplifies the potential for a   of the broader geopolitical framework. Mr. Trump has already criticized NATO as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more, calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades. He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, the   island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. In shutting American borders to people from predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values. Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail. But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the   Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China’s growing influence. Then, on Thursday, his administration appeared to embrace a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Word of the tax emerged as President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to Washington to protest the promised wall  —   resonating as the potential first salvo in a trade war. “I’m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,” said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “One would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that’s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly. ” The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the   magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had “a very good call” with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico “has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,” he said. “I’m not going to let that happen. ” Within the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen. Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7, 000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Juárez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries. Mr. Trump’s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell’s work force. “They hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,” he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But in the end, he said, business will carry on. “In 31 years, I’ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,” he said. “We’ve been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way. ” Most experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump’s trade posture. Given that nearly   of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage. The three countries are intertwined in the global supply chain. China makes components that go into auto parts manufactured in the United States. Those parts are delivered to factories in Mexico that produce finished vehicles sold to Americans. Calling such vehicles Mexican imports misses that much of the value is produced in the United States, employing American labor. “The idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a   or early   conception of trade,” said Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. “You don’t even know who you’re going to hurt with these kind of things. You’re probably going to destroy American jobs in the end. ” Mr. Trump owes his office in no small measure to factory workers who have come to view global trade as a mortal threat to their livelihoods. But their sentiments are grounded not in ideology, but in a desire for jobs at decent wages. If Mr. Trump impedes imports, he could put some of these voters out of work. Beyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump’s refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments. In emphasizing “America First,” Mr. Trump has generated a widespread sense that the country is surrendering its global leadership position. Britain’s abandonment of the European Union has enhanced the view that a period of international integration has devolved to a new era in which nationalist concerns are paramount. On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe. “Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union’s bureaucracy. “Getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. ” With both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision. China is working to assume the mantle. President Xi Jinping of China last week used an address in Davos, to submit his nation’s bid as a reliable champion of expanded trade. China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on   enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi’s speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike. At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi’s address, a   private equity fund manager, André   stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era. “We heard a Chinese president becoming the leader of the free world,” he said.",0
7295,Environmentalists Target Bankers Behind Pipeline - The New York Times,"In early August, just as protesters from across the country descended on North Dakota to rally against an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, some of the world’s biggest banks signed off on a $2. 5 billion loan to help complete the sprawling project. Now, those banks  —   which include Citigroup and Wells Fargo of the United States, TD Bank of Canada and Mizuho of Japan  —   have come under fire for their role in bankrolling the pipeline. In an open letter on Monday, 26 environmental groups urged those banks to halt further loan payments to the project, which the Sioux say threatens their sacred lands and water supply. In campaigning to reduce the world’s carbon emissions, environmentalists have increasingly focused on the financiers behind the fossil fuel industry  —   highlighting their role in financing coal, oil and gas projects. It is an expansion of traditional protest efforts, and it has met with some early success. Environmental groups have also criticized the Dakota Access pipeline as outdated infrastructure with no place in a world racing to stave off the worst effects of climate change. The   pipeline is expected to carry nearly half a million barrels of crude oil daily out of the Bakken fields of North Dakota, according to the company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners. Late last month, hundreds of police in riot gear used pepper spray and rubber bullets to evict protesters from land owned by Energy Transfer. Over 100 people were arrested in the sweep. President Obama said last week that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternate route for the pipeline. “Banks have a choice to either finance the transition to renewable energy, or to finance pipelines and power plants that will lock us into fossil fuels for the next 40 years,” said Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, a   advocacy organization that led the campaign. “If we’re serious about fighting climate change, we can’t continue to finance fossil fuel infrastructure of any kind. ” The letter from BankTrack and other environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, was addressed to the Equator Principles Association, a consortium of global banks committed to responsible environmental and social practices. Thirteen of the 17 banks that participated in the latest loan to the Dakota pipeline project, including all five of the lead banks, are members. The group was holding its annual meeting in London on Monday and Tuesday. The letter came as climate negotiators gathered in Marrakesh, Morocco, to work on the details of executing the Paris climate accord. On the agenda are drafting rules on how to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions, as well as securing financial aid to help poor countries deal with climate change. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat nominee in the race for the United States presidency, has said she will back the climate policies of President Obama, including continued support of the Paris agreement. Her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, has called global warming a hoax, and has said he would “cancel” the Paris deal if he were elected. In their battles with banks, environmentalists have scored some early victories. After a concerted effort by   campaigners, several global banks, including Barclays, ING and Deutsche Bank, stepped back over the last two years from projects that involve mountaintop removal mining, a practice experts say is particularly damaging to the environment. Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would no longer finance new   power plants in the United States or other wealthy nations, a retreat that followed similar announcements by Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. The banks’ move away from coal, however, appeared motivated as much by the plunging profitability of coal as by concerns over climate change. Experts also question the profitability of the Dakota pipeline, at a time of slumping oil prices. “A lot of infrastructure investment, particularly pipelines, is built around strong   projections that go out decades,” said Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a financial think tank that focuses on energy and climate change. “If the scenarios around demand for oil is wrong, it’s likely that people are building costly infrastructure on a false promise  —   that the oil is going to be needed in 30 to 40 years. ” The loan to Energy Transfer and its partners Sunoco Logistics Partners and Phillips 66 was led by Citigroup, Mizuho, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and TD Bank, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Citigroup said that it had already raised concerns over the project with Energy Transfer and advocated engagement with the Sioux tribe. It was closely following the outcomes of the federal government’s efforts to engage local communities in a possible review of the project, the bank said in a statement. A Wells Fargo spokesman, Alan Elias, declined to comment. Judith Schmidt, a spokeswoman for TD bank, declined to comment on the letter specifically. Mizuho and the Bank of Tokyo could not immediately be reached for comment.",0
7296,Georgetown Professors Instruct Students on How to ’Resist’ Trump Presidency - Breitbart,"An   event at Georgetown University that took place on Saturday featured professors and activists discussing how the left can best “resist” Donald Trump during his presidency. [The event, which was entitled, “Resisting, Organizing, and Building in the Age of Trump,” featured professors and activists who are concerned about America’s future under   Donald Trump.  The description from the event’s Facebook page claims that the event was a discussion on how the left can ensure the freedom and dignity of all individuals during a Trump presidency. The stakes of this political moment couldn’t be higher. We need to collectively think through how we can best respond, resist, organize, and build a future that guarantees the freedom and dignity of all during the next four years of Trump’s presidency and beyond. On January 14th, Georgetown doctoral and law students will hold a   at Georgetown University bringing together DC   and academics from across disciplines to discuss the nature of the relationship of Trumpism to racism, bigotry, and oppression in all its multifaceted forms and the urgent question of how the left should move forward. “The Georgetown administration is not your friend,” argued campus employee Josh Armstead of UNITE Here Local 23, which represents hotel, gaming, food service, and airport industry workers. Armstead claimed that Georgetown’s administration benefits from “prison labor. ”  The discussion segments frequently mentioned topics of privilege, systematic oppression, and stereotyping. George Washington University Philosophy Professor Vanessa Wills defined oppression as an “exclusion from full personhood or society based on identity. ” Jessica Lee, a program director at the Center for Social Justice at Georgetown, suggested that   students need to check their privilege. She said that students need to understand their privilege so that they know when it is appropriate for them to speak up. Others complained about the electoral college system, suggesting that Donald Trump will be an illegitimate president. Georgetown History Professor Joseph McCartin claimed that America is “facing a crisis of democracy. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about social justice and libertarian issues for Breitbart News.

7297,Sports Court Upholds Ban on Russian Track and Field Athletes - The New York Times,"An appeals court on Thursday upheld the ban on Russia’s track and field team from the Rio Olympics, empowering sports organizations to discipline other Russian teams after revelations of a   doping scheme. The International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field’s global governing body, had barred Russia’s team from competing at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro next month because of an elaborate cheating plot, which investigators confirmed this week with forensic evidence and computer records. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, the final arbiter on global sports disputes, to which Russia had appealed, said that the penalty was legally sound. With just over two weeks until the opening ceremony in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had deferred the decision of whether to take aggressive measures to individual sports federations like the I. A. A. F. After detailed proof of   cheating was produced this week in a report by the World   Agency, Olympic officials said they would “explore legal options,” but they also indicated that they would await the arbitration court’s decision before taking action. Thursday’s ruling, affirming the track and field organization’s authority over a nation’s Olympic participation, enables the I. O. C. to pass responsibility for the Russian doping crisis to the 28 individual sports federations that participate in the Summer Games. Olympic officials are set to convene on the matter Sunday. Among the options ahead: Olympic officials could call on the other individual sports federations  —   such as those in gymnastics and weight lifting  —   to follow the I. A. A. F.’s lead and engage in a    review of Russian athletes registered to compete in Rio. Or a blanket ban of the Russian Federation could be adopted. In response to Thursday’s decision, Sebastian Coe, head of the track and field organization, said that while he was “thankful” the ban had been upheld, he was not celebrating. “I didn’t come into this sport to stop athletes from competing,” he said in a statement. The appeals court said that because of the urgent nature of the case, it was issuing only its verdict, which was unanimous. Its full decision, including the grounds for the verdict, will be issued as soon as possible, the court said. “In my view, certainly, this decision absolutely violates the rights of clean athletes, honest athletes, and sets a collective responsibility precedent,” Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s sports minister, said at a news conference in Moscow. In instituting its ban, the I. A. A. F. invited Russian athletes living outside the country who had been regularly tested for drugs to petition to compete individually officials said they had offered that option in part to protect against court challenges. So far, two Russian track and field athletes have been cleared to compete in Rio: Darya Klishina, a long jumper, and Yuliya Stepanova, a   runner, both of whom live in the United States. The I. A. A. F. said that the exempted athletes would not compete in Rio under the Russian flag but rather as unaffiliated athletes. Russia won 18 medals in track and field, including eight golds, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Whether the country’s medal aspirations in other sports in Rio are squashed, too, could soon be determined by other sports federations. Those federations, however, have little expertise in adjudicating doping cases, and in the political world of sports, some have strong ties to Russia. Last week, the president of the international swimming federation, Julio C. Maglione of Uruguay, traveled to Moscow to meet with Mr. Mutko. Four days later, as antidoping officials indicated that they were preparing to request that the I. O. C. ban Russia’s entire Olympic team, the swimming federation released a statement saying it was “concerned by the premature calls” to keep Russia out of the Games. Sports officials and antidoping authorities alike have agitated for strong action from the I. O. C. in recent days, pointing out that the Olympic organization had in its power a drastic option that would seem to be beyond legal challenge: banning the whole Russian delegation from the Games. “It’s really important for the I. O. C. to defend its integrity and make a strong statement now by suspending the Russian National Olympic Committee,” said Max Cobb, president of the United States Biathlon Association. Mr. Cobb added that he thought the evidence presented this week condemned not only the Russian sports ministry but also the Olympic committee. Yuri Nagornykh, Russia’s deputy minister of sport, who was identified by investigators as a main coordinator of the scheme, is also an executive board member of the Russian Olympic organization. On Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said he had provisionally suspended Mr. Nagornykh and other implicated officials. For the I. O. C. to wait until the arbitration decision was announced on Thursday, Mr. Cobb said, was “unnecessary stalling. ” More than a dozen national antidoping organizations  —   including those in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway  —   echoed that sentiment Wednesday, sending a letter to the I. O. C. that argued for denying all Russian athletes entry in the Olympics, according to the correspondence, which was obtained by The New York Times. “This is a responsibility that cannot and should not be delegated by the I. O. C. ,” the letter said. Anything less than a full ban, the officials wrote, “is not a reasonable and proportionate measure to protect the value of the Olympic promise given the circumstances caused by the   doping program that corrupted the Olympic Games. ” The allegations of cheating have extended to the last two Olympic Games, in London in 2012 and in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. Others, however  —   including the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations  —   have spoken up for “individual justice” rather than broad bans, expressing subtle support for Russia, along with a desire to see specific violators punished. Track and field officials and antidoping authorities have spent the year monitoring   efforts in Russia. They reported that, as recently as last month, Russian athletes continued to evade testing with the help of sports officials. Such conduct extended across disciplines, inquiries commissioned by WADA found. According to Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer who led the most recent inquiry and wrote this week’s report, Russia’s antidoping lab covered up drug violations affecting “virtually all sports” since at least 2011. Mr. McLaren is a longtime global sports arbitrator who decided several   cases that probably figured into the deliberations that led to Thursday’s decision, made by three arbitrators, from Britain, Italy and the United States. The arbitration court, which has its headquarters in a chateau in Lausanne, Switzerland, has for decades had supreme authority in international sports disputes its decisions can be overruled by the Swiss Federal Tribunal on the basis of a procedural error only. The court’s independence and monopolistic authority have been challenged over the years, with athletes, who are required to sign arbitration agreements, arguing that the forum favors the interests of sports organizations. The court was created by sports federations and the I. O. C. and it receives financing from them. The president of the court’s parent organization, the International Council of Arbitration for Sport, which appoints arbitrators to the court, is John D. Coates of Australia, an I. O. C. executive board member who participated in the committee’s urgent meeting on Tuesday to discuss possible courses of action the I. O. C. might take against Russia. Before evidence made public this week corroborated a  ’s account of Russia’s elaborate Olympic cheating scheme, Thomas Bach, the president of the I. O. C. had said that if the allegations proved true, they would present a “shocking new dimension in doping” and an “unprecedented level of criminality,” for which he would have zero tolerance.",0
