1102,"LIVE WIRE Dutch Elections: High Turnout Expected, Controversy Over Turkish Mosque Polling Centre","The count is underway for the 2017 Dutch general elections, with 388 voting areas to declare. [The election is seen as one of the most important in recent Dutch history as   migration candidate Geert Wilders hopes to build on the   momentum of the Brexit and Trump campaigns.   The story so far: At 6:30 am CET, the people of the Netherlands officially began to cast ballots in the national election which is expected to have a much larger turnout than in previous years. But election day has not been without controversy. The Netherlands votes today in what could be a historic election as   migration candidate Geert Wilders and his   Party for Freedom (PVV) look to make record gains in the Dutch parliament. Polls opened at 6:30 am local time and already Wilders, Prime Minister Rutte, and several other politicians have cast their vote. While the voting has been mostly without incident, there has been one controversial moment during election day. Reports came out that a polling station within a Turkish Islamic cultural centre in Amsterdam had hung up Turkish flags and was broadcasting Turkish radio as members of the public went to cast their vote. According to Dutch newspaper Telegraaf, the municipal authorities were made aware of the incident and went to the centre to make sure the flags and other items including leaflets for Diyanet, the Turkish government agency in charge of religion, were removed from the polling area.  “Campaign expressions are not allowed in the polling station. We have sent someone there to correct it,” a spokesman from the municipality told the paper. The controversy comes only days after Turkey and the Netherlands engaged in a large diplomatic row after the Netherlands banned two Turkish ministers from campaigning for a referendum to allow President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to abolish the office of prime minister. #ikstem Stemmen in een Turkse moskee onder Turkse vlaggen, met de Turkse radio op de achtergrond en Diyanet folders op de tafels verspreid. pic. twitter.   —   Elise Steilberg (@EliseSteilberg) March 15, 2017,  Wilders said ahead of the voting this morning: “I feel very optimistic. We want to take out country back. ” After casting his vote at around 9:30 am local time, Wilders remarked: “Whatever the outcome of the election today the genie will not go back into the bottle and this patriotic revolution, whether today or tomorrow, will take place. ” Turnout for the election is expected to be over 80 per cent, and potentially as high as 85 per cent. This would easily surpass 2012’s national election in which  74. 6 per cent of eligible voters participated.  The increased demand has led to reports that some districts have even run out of ballot papers. Netherlands: Turnout today to surpass 80% maybe even 85% (2012: 74. 6%). Media reports some station have run out of ballots. #DutchElection pic. twitter.   —   Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) March 15, 2017,  Some areas have even reported turnouts of up to 100 per cent. Netherlands: Turnout in some polling stations hits 100% e. g. Campus Wageningen University. #DutchElection #tweedekamerverkiezingen,  —   Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) March 15, 2017,  This election sees one of the largest numbers of parties participating ever in Dutch national elections with 28 different parties on the ballot with 15 potentially getting seats in the parliament. The main rivalry has, however, come down to the party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the PVV of Geert Wilders. The two party leaders engaged in a debate on Monday evening with Wilders slamming Rutte, calling him a “prime minister for foreigners”. He called on the Dutch to vote for his party which looks to combat Islamisation by closing all mosques in the country and banning the Quran.",0
1103,Why shaving means freedom to Omar,"October 29, 2016 
To most men, it is a simple daily routine that they barely think of. Spraying fresh white foam over their face and taking it off with a 28-blade razor – how utterly ordinary. 
But for Omar, an intelligent, fit, and attractive 22-year-old young man, shaving off his beard is a remarkable act of freedom. Because Omar has been living under one of the most oppressive regimes the world has ever seen. At last, that regime is on the verge of being broken and Hoxton will soon be free of the Hipster State. 
As the forces of reason, justice and sanity close in on Hoxton, Dalston and trendy Whitechapel, Omar is one of the first young people to benefit. 
“It has been hell,” he said. “The hipsters began moving in during the 80s on a wave of Acid Jazz and beer with lemons in the neck of the bottle. Of course, I was not even born then. But by the time I was, Hoxton was drowning in hipsters with their artisan small furniture manufacturers, silk-screened candle warehouses and eventually, internet start-ups.” 
Omar was terrified of the fashion police, who beat up one of his friends for wearing the wrong shade of burgundy retro Farahs. So like everyone else in the area, he grew a beard. Omar was only nine at the time: he has suffered 13 years of facial hair, Adidas Stan Smith trainers and feigning an interest in stunt kites. “It has been hell,” he said. 
But the first signs of liberation arrived with a girl bravely walking through the streets without a tattoo. She was dragged away and quickly inked with an image of the logo from Moog synthesisers. But soon more followed her, bravely flaunting their unadorned skins. Known as “cleans”, they were at the vanguard of the forces of sanity. Then Greggs opened a branch in Hoxton High Street and more normal people arrived to eat its hand-finished non-craft pies. The final straw was a pub which didn’t have a trendy name and did not brew its own beer. Faced with the uncowered march of normality, hipsterism began to capitulate. 
While there is still a bearded rump of diehards, they are being rounded up and shot or made to become drones at Amazon’s HQ, and trendy East London is on the way to becoming an ordinary part of the world once more. Immacagain",0
1104,BOMBSHELL: Leaked Emails Expose How Muslims Got In Obama’s Administration,"BOMBSHELL: Leaked Emails Expose How Muslims Got In Obama’s Administration Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This 
Since the mainstream media won’t do their job, people everywhere are making it a point to go through the WikiLeaks emails to uncover the truth that the political elite are trying to hide. Upon perusal of the emails leaked yesterday in dump number 19, an interesting discussion surfaced, exposing how Muslims got in Obama’s administration, and it’s so unbelievable, you have to read it for yourself. 
Under the subject line, “ Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates, ” we get some juicy insight into how these candidates got into the Obama administration. However, the first thing that should stand out like a sore thumb is the date of this email. October 18, 2008, was about 3 weeks before Obama was elected. Muslims were chosen to be in the Obama administration weeks before his “election.” 
The date indicates that Gayle Smith and John Podesta were staffing the Obama administration with Muslims weeks before Barack Obama was actually elected. This is not mainstream information, but Mad World News noticed that Obama was “transitioning” to the White House long before the election even took place. Unfortunately, that is not the worst part of this email. 
The fact that Muslims were selected for the Obama administration before the American public voted for him is not a good sign, but it doesn’t look like Obama chose these appointments either. He’s not included in the conversation about who will be in his cabinet, leading skeptics to believe that this is all a setup. The date on this is September of 2008, well before Obama was elected. Note the highlighted areas where Christians are specifically excluded. 
The even more terrifying aspect of this email is highlighted. “I excluded those with some Arab American background who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian.” Those who selected Obama before the election handpicked Muslims for his Administration knowing he’d be “elected.” Not only that, they specifically excluded Christians. 
This particular email does not list a reason why Christians were excluded and Muslims were chosen specifically because of their religion, but with several more days of WikiLeaks Podesta email dumps, we may get some answers. But, that’s still not all. The email also indicated that a list for Muslim DOJ and judges would come soon. 
Later, in the email right before signing off, Preeta Bansal , an Indian-American lawyer who ended up in the Obama administration as the General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor to the federal Office of Management and Budget from 2009 until 2011, says the Muslim list for the DOJ (Department of Justice) will be on its way soon. Not long after, the list of Muslim Judges and US attorneys to appoint will follow. 
Now, we know how the Obama administration was packed with Muslims, but we still aren’t sure why. Maybe they were hoping to avoid discrimination — or perhaps the reason is more sinister. Perhaps the infiltration of the US government with Muslims is a preplanned way to slowly allow the religion to permeate the West. Although that seems far fetched, this email is absolutely horrifying and nothing should shock us anymore after reading these leaked emails.",0
1105,Are Native Americans Part of the Ten Lost Tribes of the Jewish People?,"Are Native Americans Part of the Ten Lost Tribes of the Jewish People? Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
“Therefore was the name of it called Bavel; because Hashem did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did Hashem scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.” Genesis 11:9 (The Israel Bible™) 
When Europeans first glimpsed Native Americans more than 400 years ago, many were convinced they had discovered the Lost Tribes of Israel. At closer look, the connections are astounding. This hidden association has taken on greater importance recently as the two nations face similar threats, and perhaps even a common Messianic vision quest. 
Unmistakable traces of Jewish prayer echo in the voice of Joseph Riverwind , the Amahura (war chief) of the Northern Arawak Nation, the indigenous peoples of South America and Caribbean, as he sings, “Shema, shema, nayena, popaska hoya yah”. He translated this ancient Native American song for Breaking Israel News : 
“Listen, listen, people, as you gather together, we will dance before the creator.” This is strongly reminiscent of the Jewish

1106,BLM Rapper & Bill’s Alleged Son Have Nasty Surprise For Hillary,"BLM Rapper & Bill’s Alleged Son Have Nasty Surprise For Hillary Posted on October 31, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This 
It looks like when it rains, it pours, and Hillary Clinton is now facing a big problem with Black Lives Matter. It all stems from an alleged affair Bill Clinton had with a black Arkansas prostitute, which produced a son. Now, after years of trying to find out the truth about his biological father, the rumored son’s cause is being taken up by a black rapper, and they have a really bad surprise for Hillary. Rapper “Freenauts” wears “Hillary for Prison” t-shirt while performing rap song “Justice For Danney Williams” 
The BLM rapper “Freenauts,” wearing a “Hillary for Prison” t-shirt, put out a video, performing his rap song “Justice for Danney Williams,” referring to Bill Clinton’s alleged lovechild. The video has just over 100,000 views, but now that it is the last week before the election, Donald Trump supporters, as well as Black Lives Matter supporters, are posting it all over social media. 
The plight of Arkansas resident Danney Williams has been around for years, and in the past, Hillary’s henchmen put out disinformation to the press to make it seem as if Williams claims had been proven false. 
In fact, Danney Williams has never had a DNA test, and many in the media are now realizing that not only does Williams resemble Clinton but his story rings true. Up until Bill Clinton became president, Williams recalls with great detail the Christmas presents Arkansas troopers would bring to his house from then-Governor Bill Clinton. Growing up, Williams was told by his mother and even his teachers that he was Bill Clinton’s son. Rapper “Freenauts” artwork for his song “Justice For Danney Williams” (left), Bill Clinton & Danney Williams (right) 
With Hillary taking a hit this week, she can’t afford to lose any of her support from minorities, especially the African-American community. Unfortunately for her, it looks like that may happen after WND made this announcement from Williams: 
Danney Williams, the man from Little Rock, Arkansas, who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black illegitimate son of former President Bill Clinton, will hold a press conference Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to make an announcement his supporters characterize as a “bombshell that will rock Hillary’s campaign.” 
On October 19, WND reported that lawyers representing Williams, in the hours before the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas, announced their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
It looks like Hillary may be in for a drop in support by African-Americans after Williams describes her as the mean woman who chased his mother away from the Governor’s mansion when he was only a few years old. It may be a day of reckoning for Hillary as everything that can go wrong is all happening at once, and we couldn’t be happier. May Hillary get everything she deserves and then some.",0
1107,Kevin Durant to Join the Golden State Warriors - The New York Times,"The biggest question of the N. B. A.   was answered Monday when Kevin Durant, one of the best players ever to hit unrestricted free agency in any sport, agreed to join the Golden State Warriors. Durant’s decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Warriors, who won an N. B.  73 games in the regular season, lets the rich get richer. Although Durant nearly led the Thunder to a stunning upset of the Warriors in the Western Conference finals this spring, the Warriors ultimately prevailed before losing to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the N. B. A. finals. Now the Warriors, regrouping, have added the    Durant, creating a virtual Dream Team out of a starting unit that also includes the   Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The Warriors now become the overwhelming favorites to win next season’s N. B. A. championship, which would be their second in three years. While Golden State forward Andre Iguodala joked about finding out the news after logging on to the internet in the middle of a flight, Green was the first prominent member of the Warriors to officially greet Durant online. “Welcome to THE FAMILY @KDTrey5 let’s just do what we are setting out to do!! #Blockoutthenoise,” Green said on Twitter. Durant made his announcement on The Players’ Tribune website. While the terms of the deal have not been formally announced, a person briefed on the negotiations said it was a   deal worth $54. 3 million, with the second year being a player option. The structure of the deal would allow Durant to opt out after next season and take advantage of the escalating salary cap to maximize his earnings. “The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player  —   as that has always steered me in the right direction,” Durant said in the posting. “But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors. ” The reaction to Durant’s decision was swift, with some on social media outlets predictably awarding Golden State the   title, and others scorning Durant for leaving Oklahoma City and seeking an easier route to his first championship in the Bay Area. In that respect, Durant was receiving the same criticism LeBron James endured when he left Cleveland, where he initially failed to win a title, to form a Big Three in Miami with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. That threesome did win two titles, including one in which it beat Durant’s Thunder, and James ultimately returned to Cleveland to win a third. But James’s roots are in Ohio, and there were compelling reasons for him to eventually go home. The notion that Durant, who is from the Washington, D. C. area, might someday return to Oklahoma City seems a lot more  . Durant has been among the league’s premier scoring threats and best   players since being taken by the Seattle SuperSonics with the No. 2 pick in the 2007 draft. The Sonics moved to Oklahoma City in his second season, and Durant won a scoring championship in his third  —   his first of four such titles in five seasons. He won the league Most Valuable Player Award in  . Durant’s talents run the gamut. Listed as a    small forward, he is most likely closer to 7 feet, and he is capable of playing anything from shooting guard to power forward on offense, while being both quick enough and strong enough to keep up with players ranging from point guards to power forwards on defense. For the Warriors, Durant will fill a specific need as a player who is far more adept at getting to the basket than anyone on their current roster, a flaw exposed by both the Thunder and the Cavaliers in the recent playoffs, where perimeter defense and a great deal of physical contact seemed to shut down the team’s strategy that involved living and dying at the   line. The threat Durant brings, of someone who can just as easily penetrate as he can knock down outside shots, would very likely free things up for Thompson and Curry, who have rarely needed much help in that regard but could, almost terrifyingly, become even more effective. The reshaping of the roster to accommodate Durant’s salary began immediately, as multiple news outlets reported that Golden State was working on a deal to send Andrew Bogut, and his $11 million salary, to the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas also has reportedly agreed to terms with Harrison Barnes, a restricted free agent, if the Warriors renounce his rights, as expected. The two deals would seemingly allow the Warriors to keep Iguodala, their most valuable bench player. Giving up Bogut, and potentially losing Festus Ezeli as a free agent, would rob the Warriors of both their centers, but there are multiple media reports that Zaza Pachulia, a   veteran, has agreed with Golden State on a modest   deal for $2. 9 million. That would be a remarkable bargain in a   environment in which Timofey Mozgov, who is not nearly as accomplished as Pachulia, will be making an expected $16 million a year. Once the dust settles, the Warriors may be forced to part ways with other veteran free agents like Leandro Barbosa and Marreese Speights, though many capable veterans, like Pachulia, will most likely be willing to take steep discounts to chase a title with Durant and Curry. With depth having been a key part of the Warriors’    approach, all of these potential moves could create new challenges for Coach Steve Kerr. There will also be an adjustment period for Durant, who has never played in a system with as much ball movement and is unaccustomed to the   approach, in which Golden State’s players have often been asked to sacrifice personal statistics for the good of the group. Still, for Durant to sign with a team already loaded with stars is likely an indication that he is willing to adjust in order to find the ultimate team success that has eluded him thus far. Like so many things about the N. B. A. the scramble to sign the league’s most elite free agents has become something of a   phenomenon in recent years, with players like Durant accepting suitors like so much eligible royalty. Durant chose to conduct his talks with various teams in the Hamptons, a lavish Long Island summer retreat known more for its celebrity culture than for its basketball and about as far removed from Oklahoma City as possible. And his deliberations, which lasted only a few days, still seemed like an eternity, given the nature of the N. B. A.   period, which is nothing if not frenzied. Teams were permitted to begin contacting players at 12:01 a. m. July 1, and many deals were struck before most people woke up the next morning. But Durant had the luxury of setting his own timetable because he was, by far, the biggest catch. Teams tried various ways to impress him. The Boston Celtics were reported to have arrived in the Hamptons with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as part of their entourage. The Warriors’ delegation to the Hamptons was reported to have included Curry, Thompson and Green. The Thunder, of course, tried to persuade Durant to stay. For years, he had been paired with Russell Westbrook, another   talent, in one of the most potent   punches the game has seen. But the team failed to fully capitalize on its talent, making just one appearance in the N. B. A. finals. In three other seasons, the Thunder bowed out in the Western Conference finals. It is the last of those three that will linger painfully in Oklahoma City, especially now that Durant is gone. The Thunder had a     lead against the Warriors but could not find a way to a fourth victory, even when they led for most of Game 6 in their arena. Had they managed to vanquish the Warriors, the Thunder might have found themselves favored against the Cavaliers in the finals. Instead, having lost, Durant and his Thunder teammates faced hard questions about their collective futures, with several years left in Durant’s prime, but with his 30s inevitably approaching. Facing all that, Durant decided to try something new rather than continue to try to make things work with the Thunder.",0
1108,Экологи: Число позвоночных на планете с 1970 года уменьшилось более чем в два раза,"0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
По данным исследователей, наибольший урон был нанесен пресноводным позвоночным. Их общая численность за указанные 42 года сократилась на 81%. Согласно подсчетам ученых, популяции наземных позвоночных животных за это же время снизились на 38%, морских — на 36%. Специалисты учитывали в своих изысканиях данные о 3 тысячах 706 видах млекопитающих, птиц, рыб, амфибий и рептилий. 
Исследователи пришли к выводу, что ""самой распространенной угрозой"" позвоночным является ""потеря или ухудшение среды обитания"". 
""Ученые на протяжении десятилетий предупреждали, что действия человека подталкивают живые существа к массовому вымиранию. Свидетельства, излагаемые в докладе, подкрепляют этот прогноз"", — сообщает генеральный директор Всемирного фонда дикой природы Марко Ламбертини. 
Эксперты, работающие над составлением исследования, предсказывает, что в случае сохранения наблюдающихся тенденций в сфере жизнедеятельности человека и его воздействия на природу популяции животных на Земле сократятся к концу этого десятилетия на 67%. 
Ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что ежегодно на нашей планете от заболеваний, вызванных загрязнением окружающей среды умирают не менее 5,5 млн человек, причем половина из них — жители Индии и Китая. К такому выводу пришли в результате своих исследований ученые американской компании Health Effects Institutes в Бостоне (США). 
Сейчас уровень загрязнения воздуха в Дели и в Пекине составляет в некоторые дни до 300 микрограмм на кубометр воздуха, что в 8-10 раз превышает лимит, при котором легкие и сердце работают в норме. 
При этом Северная Америка, Западная Европа и Япония за последние 50 лет достигли огромного прогресса в борьбе с загрязнением воздуха, создавая более чистое топливо и двигатели, а также сокращая потребление угля, отмечается в исследовании. Основными источниками загрязнения, согласно данным исследования, являются выбросы с электростанций, заводов, автомобильные выхлопы, продукты горения угля и дров — образующиеся от этого мелкие частицы долго висят в воздухе, не оседая на почву, и представляют большую угрозу для здоровья человека. 
""Загрязнение воздуха занимает четвертое место в списке основных причин смертности в мире, поэтому снижение уровня загрязнения — это чрезвычайно эффективное средство для улучшения здоровья людей, и мы знаем, что нужно делать"", — так прокомментировал итоги американского исследования преподаватель факультета общественного здравоохранения университета Ванкувера (Канада) Майкл Бранер. 
Напомним, в столице Китая объявление наивысшего, ""красного"", уровня экологической опасности — не такой уж редкий случай. Пекин признан одним из самых грязных городов мира, в атмосфере которого зафиксирована самая высокая концентрация диоксида азота и других вредных веществ. Основная причина — большое количество автомобилей на улицах города, а также выброс химикатов на заводах соседних Хэбэя и Хэнаня. Это является причиной очень высокой смертности пекинцев.

1109,Indian Call Centers Become Major Centers for Defrauding Americans - Breitbart,"A disturbing trend has emerged in India where call centers have cropped up for the sole purpose of scamming Americans out of money, The New York Times reports. [The scheme is simple: impersonate an Internal Revenue Service employee, threaten Americans with penalties, and demand immediate payment for back taxes.  The United States has been tracking this scheme from India since 2013, a period of time where Americans lost $100 million to scammers, with many of the victims being recent immigrants, according to a New York Times article from October. Suhel Daud, an F. B. I. agent who serves as assistant legal attaché at the embassy in New Delhi, said India is now seen as a major center for cyberfraud. Daud said several factors have contributed to this rise in cyberfraud cases: an increase in young,   job seekers, a   culture,   technology, and ingenuity. Some of these young,   job seekers include boys like Pawan Poojary and Jayesh Dubey, both college   who got jobs at a call center in a suburb outside of Mumbai making about 16, 000 rupees ($230) “but the bonuses were double or triple that, based on sales. ” “At that time, in my mind is that I want money,” Poojary, 18, said. “That’s it. I want money. That’s why. ” But Poojary felt guilty when a woman on the line “begged him to give her a little time” before sending the money, and his supervisor told him to push harder, so he called the IRS in the U. S. to report information about a crime. Poojary was connected to Betsy Broder, the Federal Trade Commission’s counsel for international consumer protection. “He was determined,” she said. “The number of times he called me was overwhelming. I would guess that is why he was reaching out to me, because he wanted some form of law enforcement to take it down. ” Eventually, the call center, known as the Mira Road scam, “named for the building’s neighborhood,” got raided by local police. Police arrested 70 senior employees and interviewed and released 630 of the call center workers. Five days later, another call center in Ahmedabad had been raided that had defrauded thousands of Americans. The U. S. Justice Department “released an indictment tracing 1. 8 million calls” to five call centers in Ahmedabad. Since the raids, calls have “dropped 95 percent, according to the Better Business Bureau. ” It is unknown who exactly brought down both operations, but other scams out to defraud Americans have continued. As Poojary and Dubey looked for another job, they got several lucrative offers from other scamming companies looking to defraud Americans, a sign that the call centers looking to scam Americans in India have no signs of slowing.",0
1110,Congress: Attorney General Lynch ‘Pleads Fifth’ on Secret Iran ‘Ransom’ Payments,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Pamela Geller 
This criminal gang must be thrown out of power on November 8. “Congress: Attorney General Lynch ‘Pleads Fifth’ on Secret Iran ‘Ransom’ Payments,” by Adam Kredo, Washington Free Beacon , October 28, 2016: 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon . 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch’s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. 
The response from the attorney general’s office is “unacceptable” and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to “essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,” Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon . 
The inquiry launched by the lawmakers is just one of several concurrent ongoing congressional probes aimed at unearthing a full accounting of the administration’s secret negotiations with Iran. 
“It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people’s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,” the lawmakers wrote. “Your staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.” 
“As the United States’ chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,” they stated. “The actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.” 
The lawmakers included a copy of their previous 13 questions and are requesting that Lynch provide answers by Nov. 4. 
When asked about Lynch’s efforts to avoid answering questions about the cash payment, Pompeo told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration has blocked Congress at every turn as lawmakers attempt to investigate the payments to Iran. 
“Who knew that simple questions regarding Attorney General Lynch’s approval of billions of dollars in payments to Iran could be so controversial that she would refuse to answer them?” Pompeo said. “This has become the Obama administration’s coping mechanism for anything related to the Islamic Republic of Iran—hide information, obfuscate details, and deny answers to Congress and the American people.” 
“They know this isn’t a sustainable strategy, however, and I trust they will start to take their professional, and moral, obligations seriously,” the lawmaker added….

1111,BRICS Countries to Invest $500 Million in Russian Gold Deposit - Kira Egorova,"Taming the corporate media beast BRICS Countries to Invest $500 Million in Russian Gold Deposit 
A new agreement to restart exploration and extraction at a mine in Siberia marks a milestone in the development of economic ties among the BRICS nations. Originally appeared at RBTH 
A consortium made up of the Chinese state-owned mining firm China National Gold Corporation, India’s SUN Mining Group and the Russian Far East Development Fund, as well as funds from South Africa and Brazil is prepared to invest up to $500 million in the development of the Klyuchevskoye gold field in the Transbaikal region (over 4,000 miles east of Moscow). The agreement was signed during the most recent BRICS summit, which that took place in the Indian resort of Goa on Oct. 15-16. According to plans for the site, Klyuchevskoye will become operational three years after investment becomes available and will yield some 6.5 tons of gold per year. 
This is the first mining deal in the history of BRICS that involves all five member states, which makes it particularly significant, says Wiktor Bielski, global head of commodities research at VTB Capital. Bielski adds that the agreement paves the way for bigger projects in the future that can benefit a wide range of BRICS investors. 
Benefits for the partners 
The Klyuchevskoye gold deposit was explored a long time ago, however, the bulk of the gold was not extracted because of the costly development process that was halted some 20 years back, according to Alexei Kalachev, an expert analyst with FINAM investment firm in Moscow. The China National Gold Corporation, however, has the relevant technological experience to extract and process the gold, Kalachev said. 
The deposit is currently owned by India’s SUN Gold, Ltd., part of the SUN Mining Group, which has not begun to develop it. In August 2016, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service said that the China National Gold Group intended to buy 70 percent in the deposit from SUN Gold. According to Kalachev, the idea of a consortium may have evolved from an attempt to speed up the deal at the highest levels. 
The Klyuchevskoye gold deposit is not especially rich; at its stated production volumes and reserves, it will have a life cycle of 11-12 years, while the average life cycle of gold mines worldwide is 15-16 years, says Artem Kalinin, a portfolio manager at Leon Family Office. Additionally, the cost of production at Klyuchevskoye is being forecast at the average global level. “That said, the Chinese are used to operating in this mode: the country’s steel and coal industries have very weak production costs, but they have so far been feeling quite alright thanks to cheap financing and state support,” Kalinin said. 
Russian gold mining companies are currently not taking part in developing Klyuchevskoye, but according to Kalinin, Russia stands to gain regardless of who develops the site. “The Russians will get an opportunity to borrow new technologies and to get an infrastructure that the Chinese will build,” he said. 
Alexei Kalachev notes that other obvious upsides for Russia include a rise in tax revenues, new jobs and an inflow of foreign investment. 
What’s in it for China? 
Despite the fact that China is the world’s leader in gold mining and one of the world’s largest consumers of the precious metal, its resource base is rather weak, says Kalinin. The CIS countries host the majority of the world’s gold reserves — 28 percent. Another 20 percent of the reserves are located in North America while Asian reserves make up just 11 percent. 
Oleg Remyga, head of China studies at the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, notes that China’s gold production is falling — it was down 0.4 percent in 2015 — while consumption is rising — up + 3.7 percent in 2015. “Hence, the clear ambition of Chinese companies to enter international markets,” Remyga explained. 
According to Remyga, the China National Gold Group’s investment in the Klyuchevskoye deposit is part of this bigger drive for resources. Chinese companies have already purchased shares in Canada’s Pinnacle Mines, Ltd. as well as 50 percent of shares in a deposit in Papua New Guinea owned by Barrick Gold Corp. “I am convinced that it is just the beginning of acquisitions of Russian gold-mining assets by Chinese companies, such as Zijin Mining, China Gold, Zhaojin Mining Industry, and Shandong Gold,” Remyga said, adding that negotiations with them have been going on already for five years.",0
1112,"Los Angeles Times Editorial Loses It over Trump: ’Narcissist,’ ’Demagogue’ - Breitbart","The Los Angeles Times  —   which did its best, it admits, to ensure that President Donald Trump would not be elected  —   has printed a strident, and nearly hysterical, editorial in which it calls the Trump presidency a “train wreck. ”[Among other things, the Times states:  It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a “catastrophe. ” Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck.   …     In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of   steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all.   …     What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind   so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation  —   these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his   outsider campaign indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous. The editorial comes just days after Trump’s “unimaginable power” proved unable to force through a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. There were few, if any, Times editorials criticizing President Barack Obama’s narcissism and expansion of executive powers (after promising to curtail the same). Read the whole editorial here.

1113,"In a Swirl of ‘Untruths’ and ‘Falsehoods,’ Calling a Lie a Lie - The New York Times","Words matter. And from the moment he became president, Donald J. Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication. Words about the dishonest media, the end of Obamacare, the construction of that border wall with Mexico  —   this is an abbreviated list, and he hasn’t even completed his first week in office. Amid the verbal deluge, President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy. Not to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president’s assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally. But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it. This will be a recurring challenge, given President Trump’s habit of speaking in   hyperbole and his tendency to deride any    report as “fake news. ” The words needed to be exactly right. “And the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth,” said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. “They’re ‘baseless,’ they’re ‘bogus,’ they’re ‘lies,’ they’re ‘untruths. ’” Rarely are these words, each with its own nuance, applied directly to something said by a president, though others have also dissembled (like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern). “This is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country,” said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “We have an administration that seems to be asserting a right to its own facts and doesn’t seem to be able to produce evidence to back those claims. ” Still, carefully chosen words can capture that. “A whole vocabulary has come bubbling up that would not have been used five years ago,” Mr. Nunberg said in an interview. “People are going to have to sit down and decide: Are we going to want to go over the moral consequences of telling an untruth? The mere fact of it being untrue? Or the fact that it’s bogus, baseless or groundless?” Some news organizations used words like “falsely” or “wrongly”  —   adverbs that tend to weaken the impact  —   in framing what the president said. Some used “with no evidence,” or “won’t provide any proof,” or “unverified claims,” or “repeats debunked claim. ” The New York Times, though, ultimately chose more muscular terminology, opting to use the word “lie” in the headline. After initially using the word “falsely,” it switched to “lie” online and then settled on “Meeting With Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie” for Tuesday’s print edition. People noticed, and debated its use. That is because, from the childhood schoolyard to the grave, this is a word neither used nor taken lightly. It stands apart from most other terms in the linguistic ballpark of untruths, including “falsehood,” which Chuck Todd, the host of “Meet the Press,” recently used to counter the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway’s Orwellian phrase, “alternative facts. ” To say that someone has “lied,” an active verb, or has told a “lie,” a more passive, distancing noun, is to say that the person intended to deceive. In addition, Mr. Nunberg said, “a certain moral opprobrium attaches to it, a reprehensibility of motive. ” The question of intent has informed National Public Radio’s approach to covering Mr. Trump’s many disputable claims: that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, for example, or that the news media had made up a feud between him and the country’s intelligence agencies, despite his own tweets likening those agencies to Nazi Germany. On NPR’s “Morning Edition” on Wednesday, Mary Louise Kelly explained that she had looked up the definition of “lie” in the Oxford English Dictionary. “A false statement made with intent to deceive,” Ms. Kelly said. “Intent being the key word there. Without the ability to peer into Donald Trump’s head, I can’t tell you what his intent was. I can tell you what he said and how that squares, or doesn’t, with facts. ” Michael Oreskes, NPR’s senior president for news, supported the decision. In an article on the NPR website, Mr. Oreskes said that “the minute you start branding things with a word like ‘lie,’ you push people away from you. ” The inherent risk, he suggested, was that news organizations would be seen as taking sides. Editors at The Times also consulted dictionaries. And they had some prior experience with the matter, having approved the use of the L word once before in reference to Mr. Trump. In September, when he grandly announced the findings of a yearslong   investigation into what nearly everyone else never doubted  —   “President Obama was born in the United States, period”  —   The Times published a Page 1 article with the headline “Trump Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent. ” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said that he learned of Mr. Trump’s latest comments in a text message from an editor on Monday night. After consulting with other top editors, he decided that the use of “lie” was warranted. For Mr. Baquet, the question of intent was resolved, given that Mr. Trump had made the same assertion two months earlier through his preferred mode of communication, the tweet: “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ” (Nota bene: The tweet actually contains what might be considered two untruths  —   or falsehoods, or erroneous assertions, or bogus claims  —   since Mr. Trump’s victory was no landslide, but among the closer elections in American history.) Mr. Baquet said he fully understood the gravity of using the word “lie,” whether in reference to an average citizen or to the president of the United States. He emphasized that it should be used sparingly, partly because the term carries such negative connotations, and partly so that it does not lose potency. “On the other hand, we should be letting people know in no uncertain terms that it’s untrue,” Mr. Baquet said, referring to the president’s assertion of a   epidemic. “He repeated it without a single grain of evidence, and it’s a very powerful statement about the electoral system. ” Mr. Baquet said that emails from readers seemed split on the appropriateness of the word’s use. Meanwhile, Mr. Benton, of the Nieman Journalism Lab, applauded its use as a noun in the Times headline (“Trump Repeats an Election Lie”) in this construction, he said, “the lie can exist as a reality distinct from the speaker’s intention. ” Over all, the tension between the Trump administration and much of the mainstream media is  —   what’s the word? Troubling, according to Sara Brady, a   specialist based in Florida. She says that a complete breakdown of the already fractious relationship affects everyone. “The media run the risk of being disrespectful to the president of the United States,” she said. “But the problem is: If he doesn’t get called out in some way, we as Americans are never going to know what’s true and what’s not. ” In other words: Words matter.",0
1114,"Hillary Clinton Leads Donald Trump in New Hampshire and Florida, Polls Show - The New York Times","Three months before the November election, voters in New Hampshire, long one of the purple swing states in presidential elections, clearly favor Hillary Clinton over Donald J. Trump, according to a new poll. And another poll shows Mrs. Clinton holding a narrower lead in Florida. New Hampshire voters who either prefer or lean toward Mrs. Clinton outnumber those who prefer or lean toward Mr. Trump by 47 percent to 32 percent, according to the poll, conducted for WBUR, an NPR station in Boston, by the MassInc Polling Group. Gary Johnson, a Libertarian, was favored by 8 percent. Mrs. Clinton’s standing represents a remarkable turnaround for a candidate who lost New Hampshire’s Democratic primary in February. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont clobbered her, 60 percent to 38 percent. But against Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton does much better. While 48 percent say she is fit to be president, only 31 percent say that of Mr. Trump. Nationally, according to a new Fox News poll, Mrs. Clinton holds a   lead over Mr. Trump. Still, even in New Hampshire, it is not all smooth sailing for her: 46 percent of voters there say Mrs. Clinton is not fit to be president, and 29 percent think she should be sent to prison for her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. But 56 percent of New Hampshire voters say she came out of her convention a stronger candidate, and only 39 percent said the same of Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, 63 percent say Mr. Trump is not fit to be president. The survey, of 609 likely voters, was conducted from July 29 to Aug. 1 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Mrs. Clinton is also leading at this juncture in Florida, a major swing state that would be crucial to any Trump strategy for winning nationwide. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump in Florida by six percentage points, 48 percent to 42 percent, according to a poll released Thursday by Suffolk University in Boston. In a   race, her lead narrows to 43 percent over 39 percent for Mr. Trump Mr. Johnson wins 4 percent of the vote, and Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, wins 3 percent.",0

1117,"A Toddler, a Loose Gun in a Car, and a Mother Dies - The New York Times","No one can know for sure what was in the mind of the person who fired the shot that killed a woman as she drove through Milwaukee on Tuesday. The shooter was 2 years old. The woman who died on State Highway 175 was Patrice Price, 26, the Milwaukee County sheriff’s office said Wednesday, and the gun was in the hands of her own toddler. The weapon, which investigators found on the floor of the back seat, was a .  pistol used by Ms. Price’s boyfriend, a security guard. His gun belt and tactical vest were also in the car, the sheriff’s office said. The local news media reported that the blue Dodge sedan Ms. Price was driving belonged to the boyfriend. The sheriff’s office, which would not name the boyfriend, said in a statement that the    who was not in a car seat, “retrieved a firearm that slid out from under the driver’s seat and shot through the seat, striking the driver. ” Ms. Price managed to stop the car, but by the time rescue personnel reached her, she was not breathing. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The sheriff’s office did not say whether anyone would face criminal charges. In tales of gun violence, accidents involving curious children and weapons seem especially tragic, but they are not especially unusual. Most often, they involve guns left unsecured by the child’s parents. In the seven days that ended Tuesday, in addition to the death of Ms. Price, a    in Georgia, a    in Louisiana, a    in Missouri and a    in Indiana fatally shot themselves a    in Texas shot and wounded a family member a    in California killed a    friend in a shooting that officials called accidental a    in Texas accidentally shot and wounded a    friend and a    in Indiana accidentally shot and wounded herself.

1118,Asian-American Actors Are Fighting for Visibility. They Will Not Be Ignored. - The New York Times,"When Constance Wu landed the part of Jessica Huang, the   matriarch on the ABC sitcom “Fresh Off the Boat,” she didn’t realize just how significant the role would turn out to be. As she developed her part, Ms. Wu heard the same dismal fact repeated over and over again: It had been 20 years since a show featuring a predominantly   cast had aired on television. ABC’s previous offering, the 1994 Margaret Cho vehicle “  Girl,” was canceled after one season. “I wasn’t really conscious of it until I booked the role,” Ms. Wu said. “I was focused on the task at hand, which was paying my rent. ” The show, which was just renewed for a third season, has granted Ms. Wu a steady job and a new perspective. “It changed me,” Ms. Wu said. After doing a lot of research, she shifted her focus “from   to   interests. ” In the past year, Ms. Wu and a number of other   actors have emerged as fierce advocates for their own visibility  —   and frank critics of their industry. The issue has crystallized in a word  —   “whitewashing”  —   that calls out Hollywood for taking Asian roles and stories and filling them with white actors. On Facebook, Ms. Wu ticked off a list of recent films guilty of the practice and said, “I could go on, and that’s a crying shame, y’all. ” On Twitter, she bit back against Hollywood producers who believe their “lead must be white” and advised the creators of   content to “CARE MORE. ” Another tip: “An easy way to avoid tokenism? Have more than one” character of color, she tweeted in March. “Not so hard. ” [ Read reader responses to this article ] It’s never been easy for an   actor to get work in Hollywood, let alone take a stand against the people who run the place. But the recent expansion of   roles on television has paradoxically ushered in a new generation of actors with just enough star power and job security to speak more freely about Hollywood’s larger failures. And their heightened profile, along with an imaginative,    social media army, has managed to push the issue of   representation  —   long relegated to the back burner  —   into the current heated debate about Hollywood’s monotone vision of the world. “The harsh reality of being an actor is that it’s hard to make a living, and that puts actors of color in a very difficult position,” said Daniel Dae Kim, who stars in “Hawaii  ” on CBS and is currently appearing in “The King and I” on Broadway. Mr. Kim has wielded his Twitter account to point to dire statistics and boost   creators. Last year, he posted a cheeky tribute to “the only Asian face” he could find in the entire “Lord of the Rings” series, a woman who “appears for a glorious three seconds. ” Other actors lending their voices include Kumail Nanjiani of “Silicon Valley,”   Wen of “Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. ” and Aziz Ansari, who in his show, “Master of None,” plays an   actor trying to make his mark. They join longtime actors and activists like BD Wong of “Gotham” Margaret Cho, who has taken her tart comedic commentary to Twitter and George Takei, who has leveraged his “Star Trek” fame into a social media juggernaut. “There’s an   stereotypical notion that   people don’t speak up,” Mr. Wong said. But “we’re really getting into people’s faces about it. ” This past year has proved to be a particularly fraught period for   representation in movies. Last May, Sony released “Aloha,” a film set in Hawaii that was packed with white actors, including the     Emma Stone as a     Hawaiian fighter pilot named Allison Ng. In September, it was revealed that in the planned adaptation of the Japanese manga series Death Note, the hero, a boy with dark powers named Light Yagami, would be renamed simply Light and played by the white actor Nat Wolff. In “The Martian,” released in October, the white actress Mackenzie Davis stepped into the role of the NASA employee Mindy Park, who was conceived in the novel as  . The list goes on. In December, set photographs from the coming “Absolutely Fabulous” film showed the Scottish actress Janette Tough dressed as an    Asian character. Last month, Marvel Studios released a trailer for “Doctor Strange,” in which a character that had originated in comic books as a Tibetan monk was reimagined as a Celtic mystic played by Tilda Swinton. And in the   American film adaptation of the manga series Ghost in the Shell, scheduled for next year, the lead character, Major Motoko Kusanagi, will be called Major and played by Scarlett Johansson in a black bob. Studios say that their films are diverse. “Like other Marvel films, several characters in ‘Doctor Strange’ are significant departures from the source material, not limited by race, gender or ethnicity,” the Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said in a statement. Ms. Swinton will play a character that was originally male, and Chiwetel Ejiofor a character that was originally white. Paramount and DreamWorks, the studios behind “Ghost in the Shell,” said that the film reflects “a diverse array of cultures and countries. ” But many   actors aren’t convinced. “It’s all so plainly outlandish,” Mr. Takei said. “It’s getting to the point where it’s almost laughable. ” The Academy Awards telecast in February added insult to injury. The show dwelled on the diversity complaints aired through #OscarsSoWhite, yet blithely mocked   with punch lines that banked on Asian stereotypes. The host, Chris Rock, brought three   children onstage to serve as a sight gag in a joke made at their expense. “I have never seen the   community get so organized so quickly,” said Janet Yang, a producer who serves as a liaison between Hollywood and Chinese studios. She added, “It was the final straw. ” Within days, Ms. Yang and 24 other Academy members, including the actress Sandra Oh, the director Ang Lee and Mr. Takei, signed a letter to the academy taking it to task for the telecast’s offensive jokes. The academy’s terse reply only stoked the flames. Mr. Takei called it “a bland, corporate response. ” Online, even more   actors and activists have spoken out with raw, unapologetic anger. Ms. Wen castigated “Ghost in the Shell,” tweeting about “whitewashing” and throwing in a dismissive emoji. Mr. Takei went off on “Doctor Strange” on his Facebook page: “Hollywood has been casting white actors in Asian roles for decades now, and we can’t keep pretending there isn’t something deeper at work here. ” Mr. Nanjiani jumped on Twitter to call out the red carpet photographer who told him, “Smile, you’re in America now. ” (“I know when someone is racist, the fault is theirs and not yours,” he wrote. “But, in the moment, it makes you feel flattened, reduced and bullied. ”) And Ms. Cho helped start a hashtag campaign, #whitewashedOUT. “It’s intense,” Ms. Cho posted at the height of the action. “It’s that we have been invisible for so long we don’t even know what we can do. ” Meanwhile, television shows  —   competing for fresh content and audiences as the number of scripted series has increased dramatically in recent years  —   have helped expand the boundaries of what was once thought possible.   increasingly play leads and love interests and star in multiple family sitcoms. Following “Fresh Off the Boat,” ABC debuted the sitcom “Dr. Ken,” featuring an   family led by the show’s creator, Ken Jeong, plus the drama “Quantico” starring the Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra. On CW’s “Crazy ” Rachel Bloom, as the title character, pines after the hunky Vincent Rodriguez III, who is  . They join such   as Mindy Kaling, creator and star of “The Mindy Project,” and Lucy Liu, who plays a reimagined Dr. Watson in “Elementary. ” These shows help, but the issue is pervasive, including on TV. “The mainstream Hollywood thinking still seems to be that movies and stories about straight white people are universal, and that anyone else is more niche,” Mr. Ansari wrote in an email. “It’s just not true. I’ve been watching characters with     problems since I was a small Indian boy. ” In films, a few roles have transcended stereotypes: Mr. Takei in the first “Star Trek” installments, Ms. Liu in the “Charlie’s Angels” features, and John Cho and Kal Penn in the stoner hit “Harold  Kumar Go to White Castle” and its sequels. And more are in development: a film adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s novel “Crazy Rich Asians” is underway, and the   actress Kelly Marie Tran will play a major role in the next “Star Wars” installment. But mostly,   are invisible. Though they make up 5. 4 percent of the United States population, more than half of film, television and streaming properties feature zero named or speaking Asian characters, a February report from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California found. Only 1. 4 percent of lead characters in a sample of studio films released in 2014 were Asian. For   actors, the dearth of opportunities compounds itself. “An Asian person who is competing against white people, for an audience of white people, has to train for that opportunity like it’s the Olympics,” Ms. Wu said. “An incredibly talented Asian actor might be considered for a leading role maybe once or twice in a lifetime. That’s a highly pressured situation. ” So some are stepping behind the camera. In addition to actors creating their own shows, like Ms. Kaling, Mr. Jeong and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Kim of “Hawaii  ” has started his own production company, 3AD, “to help tell the stories of the underrepresented,” he said.   and other minority actors, he added, are “tired of waiting to be hired for the roles Hollywood creates for us. ” Audiences, too, are catching up. “There was a time when this conversation was completely foreign to people,” Mr. Wong said. Now young participants “are already fully versed in the issues and able to discuss them with great passion. ” Ellen Oh, a writer for young adults who devised the #whitewashedOUT hashtag, credited a generational shift. “For a long time, Asians have been defined by the immigrant experience, but now   and     are finding their own voices,” Ms. Oh said. They’re also employing a new vocabulary. “The term ‘whitewashing’ is new, and it’s extremely useful,” Mr. Wong said. In contrast to “yellowface,” which protested the practice of white actors using makeup and prosthetics to play Asians, “whitewashing” gives voice to the   of prominent roles. And the Internet has allowed people to imagine a parallel universe where   dominate the screen. Earlier this month, disappointed fans of the “Ghost in the Shell” franchise took a publicity still of Ms. Johansson in the lead role and Photoshopped in the face of Rinko Kikuchi, the Japanese star of “Pacific Rim. ” Recently the hashtag #StarringJohnCho went viral, reimagining the   star as the lead of   and action flicks. Though Mr. Cho has followed up the “Harold and Kumar” films with a role in the “Star Trek” franchise, he hasn’t been afforded the luminous leads offered to white actors with similar starts, like Seth Rogen after “Knocked Up” or Chris Pratt  “Guardians of the Galaxy. ” “As I was Photoshopping John Cho’s face on top of Tom Cruise’s in the ‘Mission Impossible’ poster, my friends and I started chuckling a little bit, like, ‘How crazy would that be? ’” said William Yu, the    who created the hashtag. “Then I caught myself. Why should it be crazy?” The campaign was followed by #StarringConstanceWu, which Photoshopped the actress into posters for films starring Emily Blunt, Drew Barrymore and, ahem, Emma Stone. The activist outpouring is “a tidal wave,” said Keith Chow, the founder of The Nerds of Color, a website of geek culture criticism that has served as home base for several online campaigns. It has swept up some members of white Hollywood in its wake. Ms. Stone has acknowledged that her “Aloha” role made her the “butt of many jokes. ” And this month, the director of “Doctor Strange,” Scott Derrickson, tweeted, “Raw   from   over Hollywood whitewashing, stereotyping  erasure of Asians in cinema. I am listening and learning. ” Whether that translates into change onscreen is an open question. “Everyone seems to be becoming slowly aware of how overwhelmingly white everything is,” Mr. Ansari said. “It’s almost like the whole system is slowly being shamed into diversity, but it’s moving at a snail’s pace. ” He added: “Just look at the movie posters you see. It’s all white people. ”",0

Dear Abused: Get out of that relationship—now. But before you leave, coat that pendejo ’s toilet paper with habanero powder, so he gets the burn in the culo he deserves. 
How do Mexicans feel about environmental issues? Specifically, a population explosion that will cause eventual food shortages? I am told that procreation is a very macho thing for the Mexican male. You have even mentioned in the past that men do not perform oral sex on women because it’s not important when having children. How does that way of thinking weigh in with regard to the future of the planet? 
El Blanco Pedro 
Dear Pedro Gabacho:Malthus called—he wants his crackpot theory back. Besides, the gabacho love of suburbia proved far more toxic to the environment than any 12-child Mexican mom ever did, so vete a la chingada con your faux environmental concern. 
OPEN LETTER TO OUR NEW PRESIDENT: Gentle cabrones: as I write this, the Mexican still doesn’t have a feel for whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump (or neither?) will be the next president of the United States (The Mexican has to file his columna a week before actual publication— viva dead-tree journalism). In the interest of not looking more pendejo than usual, I will write three open letters to ensure I get the results right. Enjoy! 
TO PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON: Congrats on beating that pendejo Trump—you’re now the greatest female savior of Mexicans since the original Santa Sabina, the legendary curandera for which the goth-Mex band was named. But that’s not enough. Do not inherit the title of Deporter-in-Chief from Obama. Realize that the only reason you won is because raza overwhelmingly voted for you—and we want results besides appointments of token vendidos (although do give a cool gig to Congressman Xavier Becerra, a truly down Chicano). Don’t pay attention to all the Know Nothings who insist on enforcement before amnesty. There’s millions of Mexicans who have lived their entire lives in limbo, and it’s your job to save them. And if you do that? We’ll create a new altar to you at Tepeyac. 
TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Congrats on beating that pendeja Killary—you’re now the greatest unifier of Mexicans since Porfirio Diaz. Don’t even try to deport 12 million people, or build that nasty, small-handed wall. Back in the day, raza mostly stood meekly as everyone from Presidents Hoover to Roosevelt to Eisenhower to Obama enacted mass deportations—but those were honorable men. You’re not. We will protest, we will resist, we will struggle, we will take over elected offices the way Irish took over Boston. You hear me, President Pendejo ? We ain’t no sleeping giant—we woke, and we’re ready to make your one-term more pitiful than Enrique Peña Nieto. Oh, and #fucktrump. 
TO NO RESULTS YET : No mames, America.

1120,Inside Donald Trump’s Last Stand: An Anxious Nominee Seeks Assurance - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump is not sleeping much these days. Aboard his   jumbo jet, the Republican nominee does not like to rest or be alone with his thoughts, insisting that aides stay up and keep talking to him. He prefers the soothing, whispery voice of his   . He requires constant assurance that his candidacy is on track. “Look at that crowd!” he exclaimed a few days ago as he flew across Florida, turning to his young press secretary as a TV tuned to Fox News showed images of what he claimed were thousands of people waiting for him on the ground below. And he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention. As he stood next to the breakfast buffet at his golf club in Doral, Fla. eyeing a tray of pork sausages, he sought to convey restraint when approached by a reporter for The New York Times. “I’m on message,” Mr. Trump asserted, with effort. “I’m not playing around. In fact, I’m a little nervous standing here talking to you even for just a minute. ” But moments later, his resolve had collapsed. He allowed the same reporter onto his plane for a flight from Miami to Jacksonville, Fla. In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s candidacy is a jarring split screen: the choreographed show of calm and confidence orchestrated by his staff, and the neediness and vulnerability of a   candidate now uncertain of victory. On the surface, there is the semblance of stability that is robbing Hillary Clinton of her most potent weapon: Mr. Trump’s   eruptions, which have repeatedly undermined his candidacy. Underneath that veneer, turbulence still reigns, making it difficult for him to overcome all of the obstacles blocking his path to the White House. The contrasts pervade his campaign. Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away the Twitter account that he used to colorfully  —   and often counterproductively  —   savage his rivals. But offline, Mr. Trump still privately muses about all the ways he will punish his enemies after Election Day, including a threat to fund a “super PAC” with vengeance as its core mission. His polished older daughter, Ivanka, sat for a commercial intended to appeal to suburban women who have recoiled from her father’s incendiary language. But she discouraged the campaign from promoting the ad in news releases, fearing that her   association with the campaign would damage the businesses that bear her name. Mr. Trump’s campaign is no longer making headlines with embarrassing staff  . But that has left him with a band of squabbling and unfireable advisers, with confusing roles and an inability to sign off on basic tasks. A plan to encourage early voting in Florida went unapproved for weeks. The result is chaotic. Advisers cut loose from the campaign months ago, like Corey Lewandowski, still talk to the candidate frequently, offering advice that sometimes clashes with that of the current leadership team. Mr. Trump, who does not use a computer, rails against the campaign’s expenditure of tens of millions on digital ads, skeptical that spots he never sees could have any effect. Not even staff members who volunteer to be dismissed are let go. The senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, offered to resign after he was spotted at a Las Vegas strip club the night before the final presidential debate. The offer was rejected. This inside account of the Trump campaign’s final stretch is based on interviews with dozens of aides, operatives, supporters and advisers, many of whom were granted anonymity to describe moments and conversations that were intended to be confidential.  Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, said the campaign was on course and gaining ground. She firmly rejected suggestions that advisers were clashing, and said voters were responding to Mr. Trump’s message. Ms. Hicks denied that Ms. Trump had misgivings about promoting the ad in which she appeared. “That’s simply not true,” Ms. Hicks said. “Ivanka is totally supportive. ” The closing phase of Mr. Trump’s campaign has been punctuated by swaying poll numbers and dizzying mood swings. It started on Oct. 7 with the release of a recording in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about forcibly kissing women and grabbing their genitals. Many Republicans decided that Mr. Trump’s already shaky campaign was over. Some despondent young staff members at the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill, who usually work late into the night in the final stretches of a campaign, took to leaving their desks early, in time for happy hour at bars. They complained that Mr. Trump had not just lost the election but was dragging down House and Senate candidates, dooming the entire party. Mr. Trump’s aides were just as thrown by the tape. But they saw a chance to salvage his candidacy  —   on a Civil War battlefield. His aides outlined 15 bullet points for him to deliver during an Oct. 22 speech in Gettysburg, Pa. to focus voters on a new theme of cleaning up government, even as several women came forward to accuse him of groping them just as he had described in the recording. But Mr. Trump grew frustrated with the instructions. By the time he was done revising the proposed speech, only about a   of the original suggestions remained. And over the firm objections of his top advisers, he insisted on using the occasion to issue a remarkable threat: that he would sue all of the women who had gone public with the accusations. As the advisers begged him to reconsider  —   it would make him seem small, they warned, and undermine a pivotal speech  —   Mr. Trump was adamant. There had to be a severe penalty for those who dared to attack him, he said. He could not just sit back and let these women “come at me,” he told one of them. The speech was roundly criticized and seemed strikingly out of place on such sacred and historic ground. “The Grievanceburg Address,” one journalist deemed it. Mr. Trump fell into despair, and the gloom already enveloping the Republican political class started to infect his campaign. On Oct. 23, he learned that an ABC News poll showed him trailing Mrs. Clinton by 12 points. He lashed out, becoming so agitated that his aides planned to confront the network about its calculations and accuse ABC of bias, according to internal emails. “Do they think Republicans and Trump supporters are not going to vote?” one of Mr. Trump’s pollsters, John McLaughlin, wrote to the group. “Or is this an intentional effort to suppress Trump turnout?” They pressed the network on its methods, but other polls delivered similarly grim news. Then came an astonishing development. On Oct. 28, the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, announced that his agency would review newly discovered emails potentially pertinent to its investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s private server. On an afternoon flight to New Hampshire, Mr. Trump and his aides saw the news splash across the giant   television on his plane. Mr. Trump was unsure how to respond. “What do you think this means?” he asked the small circle traveling with him  —   Stephen K. Bannon, his campaign’s chief executive Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser and Mr. Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, who lives in New Hampshire. To the assembled men sitting in white leather seats, the answer was simple: It could turn the election around. But they insisted that to truly exploit it, Mr. Trump needed to do something he had been incapable of in the past: strictly follow instructions, let a story unfold on its own and resist the urge to endlessly bludgeon his rival. They headed to a fleet of cars that whisked them to the Radisson Hotel in downtown Manchester, where a crowd of thousands was waiting for the candidate to take the stage. But his aides needed time to sketch out what Mr. Trump should say  —   and not say. They sent Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, onstage with a mission: stall. As the aides agonized over which words to feed into the teleprompter, they become so engrossed that a hot light set up next to the machine caused Mr. Bannon’s Kuhl hiking pants to begin smoldering. “I think my pant leg is on fire,” he said after noticing the acrid smell. At the rally, Mr. Trump did as he was told, quickly praising the F. B. I. and warning that Mrs. Clinton could not be permitted to “take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. ” Then, improbably, he moved on. For the next week, his staff deployed a series of creative tricks to protect its boss from his most   impulses. Several advisers warned him that he risked becoming like a wild animal chasing its prey so zealously that it raced over a cliff  —   a reminder that he could pursue his grievances and his eagerness to fling insults, but that the cost would be a plunge into an electoral abyss. Taking away Twitter turned out to be an essential move by his press team, which deprived him of a previously unfiltered channel for his aggressions. On Thursday, as his plane idled on the tarmac in Miami, Mr. Trump spotted Air Force One outside his window. As he glowered at the larger plane, he told Ms. Hicks, his spokeswoman, to jot down a proposed tweet about President Obama, who was campaigning nearby for Mrs. Clinton. “Why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs and fixing Obamacare?” Mr. Trump said. “Get back to work. ” After some light editing  —   Ms. Hicks added “for the American people” at the end  —   she published it. Mr. Bannon, his rumpled campaign chief and a calming presence to the candidate, tried a different approach: appealing to Mr. Trump’s ego and competitive side by suggesting that the Clintons were looking to rattle him. “They want to get inside your head,” Mr. Bannon told him. “It’s a trap. ” Of course, it was not easy to keep Mr. Trump focused. He chafed at his advisers’ request that he use a seemingly canned line in a speech  —   a call to curb government corruption by “draining the swamp” in Washington. But he finally gave in when he saw the crowd reaction, explaining that even Frank Sinatra disliked one of his biggest songs, “My Way. ” Mr. Trump still clings to certain prerogatives, such as personally approving every commercial before it reaches a TV screen. During a recent   flight, Mr. Trump painstakingly reviewed a new batch of ads on an aide’s laptop and seized on the smallest details. He objected to a short clip in one ad that showed him emerging from a hug with a female supporter, worrying that it made him seem dismissive rather than warm. “It looks like I’m repelling away,” Mr. Trump complained. The ad was fixed. Over all, though, he seemed pleased by the results, as polls started to tighten and his news media coverage changed. Aboard his plane on Thursday, he seemed struck by an unfamiliar trend: News stories emphasized the intended message of his campaign rallies, not his improvised rants or stray tweets. “All my quotes are coming from my speeches,” he said. “And that’s a good thing. ” Of course, a few days of good behavior cannot erase 16 months of erratic conduct, and aides acknowledge that their efforts to steer a straight course may falter. And they know that his chances of winning the election are iffy: Perhaps their best hope, the F. B. I. inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s email server, fizzled on Sunday with no charges or revelations. But they maintain that there is unseen money and muscle behind Mr. Trump’s political operation  —   and a level of sophistication that outsiders, and people who have run traditional campaigns, cannot fully appreciate. At times, however, that is hard to detect. Over a cheeseburger, fried calamari and an “Ivanka Salad” at the Trump Grill in the basement of Trump Tower last week, several aides flipped open a laptop and loaded the popular website 270towin. com, which allows users to create their own winning electoral maps. For 10 minutes, they clicked through the country, putting   states won by Mr. Obama four years ago, like New Mexico and Colorado, into Mr. Trump’s column. Their analysis seemed more atmospheric than scientific. “You can go to Pennsylvania,” the campaign’s digital director, Brad Parscale, said, referring to a state that polls show favors Mrs. Clinton. “You can almost slice the excitement with a knife. You can feel it in the air there. ” And even as   returns indicated a surge for Mrs. Clinton, they tried to reassure themselves, over and over, that nobody finishes stronger than Mr. Trump, comparing the wisdom of his political judgments to Babe Ruth pointing his bat to the stands to predict where he would hit a home run. Back on his plane, heading into the campaign’s final weekend, Mr. Trump reclined in his leather chair and refused to entertain any suggestions that his unorthodox, unpredictable and now uncertain campaign for the presidency would end in defeat. “I’m going to win,” he said.",0
1121,Park Service Names 24 Diverse National Landmarks - The New York Times,"The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City, Chicano Park in San Diego, a Native American burial ground in Kansas and the site of the 1970 shootings at Kent State University are among 24 newly designated National Historic Landmarks. The list of new landmarks, announced on Wednesday, comes as the National Park Service, the division of the Department of the Interior that administers the landmarks program, has finished celebrating its 100th anniversary. It reflects an effort to tell what a news release called “a more inclusive and diverse story of America’s history. ” “These 24 new designations depict different threads of the American story that have been told through activism, architecture, music and religious observance,” Sally Jewell, the secretary of the Interior, said in a statement. “Their designation ensures that future generations have the ability to learn from the past. ” The sites, which join a list of more than 2, 500 existing national historic landmarks, may reflect America’s past, but they also might be read as carrying some pointed political lessons for the future. They include the homes of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers the   lawyer and women’s rights activist Pauli Murray and the   Tejano statesman José Antonio Navarro, who is cited for “his commitments to both American ideals and to the rights of Texan  ” in the period before and after Texas became part of the United States. The Navarro home is just one of several new landmarks relating to the history of   activism, including Chicano Park in San Diego, site of some ultimately successful 1970 community protests. Other citations speak to the sometimes deadly legacies of government action. The citation for Wyandotte National Burying Ground in Kansas City, Kan. describes it as “tangible evidence of the consequences of federal American Indian removal policy to a tribal population and its identity. ” The citation for the Kent State site, where the Ohio National Guard shot and killed four students and wounded nine other people during a protest against the Vietnam War, refers to subsequent rulings by the Supreme Court that “the executive branch of government does not enjoy absolute immunity for its actions. ” A number of the sites are recognized for what may seem to be more straightforward significance as architecture or engineering, like the Neutra Studio and Residences in Los Angeles (associated with the modernist Richard Neutra) and the   Organ, at a Methodist camp in Round Lake, N. Y. The instrument is cited as “an example of the technical and mechanical achievements in the   War American   industry. ” But even the designations for some seemingly straightforward sites might be seen as resonant with contemporary politics. The New York State Barge Canal, begun in 1905, is called “an embodiment of a Progressive Era emphasis on public works,” which was “built explicitly to counter the growing monopoly of railroad corporations. ” Kevin Young, the director of the Schomburg Center, a division of the New York Public Library in Harlem, said in an email that he was “especially pleased” that the announcement had noted the center’s social mission of promoting “intellectual freedom and social equality. ” He also noted the reference to the   roots of its namesake, the   immigrant bibliophile Arturo Schomburg. “Our focus on the entire African Diaspora has been important ever since our start 92 years ago,” said Mr. Young, who took over leadership at the center in December. “I am looking forward personally to exploring the   connection, both in our collections and lively programming. ”",0
1122,Weiner Rising in White House: Ally of Disgraced Ex-Congressman Hired - Breitbart,"Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump enlisted the services of Risa Heller, a New York City public relations figure known for her work with Democrats  —   including former Rep. Anthony Weiner ( ) Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) and Gov. David Paterson ( )  —   when they came to Washington to take up their official posts in the Trump White House, according to a report in Buzzfeed. [The revelation came amid reports that a New York City set with a history of friendly ties to the Democratic party is gaining traction in President Donald Trump’s White House, much to the chagrin of conservative commentators.  Members of the Kushner family itself donated large sums to Democratic causes until a few years ago, and Jared has reportedly been accused of being “a Democrat” by more nationalist and populist factions within the White House. Another   member of this   is the Director of Trump’s National Economic Council, registered Democrat and former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn. Asked by Buzzfeed about her choice, Ivanka responded in a statement, “Risa is incredibly talented, driven and passionate. She is a formidable advocate and respected by all as a trustworthy and honest broker of facts. ” Her husband Jared echoed her sentiments. “She’s the best fighter in the business, is universally respected, and most importantly has always told me what she really thinks, good or bad,” he said. Heller began her career in Schumer’s press office before expanding her horizons in and beyond the political field. She served as communications director for David Paterson as the New York governor who replaced   Gov. Eliot Spitzer and then found himself in crises of his own. In addition to allegations of witness tampering by his appointees, Heller managed Paterson’s image through the emergence of the sex and drug scandals that ultimately sunk his reelection hopes. Anthony Weiner, perpetrator of perhaps politics’   most embarrassing litany of   also sought Heller’s help as he tried to weather the media storm of the century that surrounded his multiple “sexting” scandals. Now banished from the political realm, Weiner sung Heller’s praises. “If I had taken her advice at critical junctures even 5% of the time, I would have been infinitely better off,” he told Buzzfeed. “This may sound ironic coming from me, but she never advocates for not telling the truth. I repeatedly didn’t take that kind of advice where I should have. ” For her own part, Buzzfeed reports Heller continued to argue Weiner was a “good person,” even as the worst details of his improprieties were emblazoned on front pages around the world. Jared and Ivanka, until recently, haunted the same New York circles in which these Democratic politicians are hounded by the city’s notorious tabloid press. Kushner himself has used Ms. Heller, sending her to handle the New York Times earlier this year when that paper raised questions about a deal of his in China. Anthony Weiner, for one, seemed to think she was a natural pick to help Jared and his wife in DC. “It doesn’t surprise me that people like the Kushners would gravitate toward her,” he told Buzzfeed. At the beginning of April, paparazzi supplied the Daily Mail with photos of Ms. Heller heading into Jared and Ivanka’s new home in Washington, DC. Some think Heller is an odd choice to bring so close to Ivanka’s father’s Republican administration. At least one of her own former Democrat colleagues in New York expressed horror at the move. “I think there’s a big difference between representing business interests and essentially helping to advance an agenda that is completely antithetical to everything that Democrats stand for,” the Democratic operative told Buzzfeed. Heller was reportedly dismayed to be the subject of a Buzzfeed article, but offered a defense of her decision to work for the Kushners: “I fight tirelessly for my clients, period. That’s what I am in business to do. I am proud of what I do and who I do it for. ” Heller is not the first publicity figure the Kushners have brought in from sources Republicans traditionally might not consider. Jared hired   Josh Raffel right out of Hollywood earlier this month.",0
1123,"“If Trump Loses, I’m Grabbing My Musket”: Former Congressman Ready to Go Full Revolution","This election remains more heated than any other in modern history – and for many, it has become a call to arms, even if only metaphorically.
Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies – Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example – and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote – the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence.
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ‘pick up a musket’ if Trump loses the election.
On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump.
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket.
You in?
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 

Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election.
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms – racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent.
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement.
via CNN :
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
[…] Walsh … did respond to CNN’s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: “What exactly does that mean?”
“It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,” he responded to Tapper. 
@jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back.
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 

After a firestorm on social media, Walsh doubled down, stating on Twitter:
I’m serious. I don’t think a musket would do much good these days, but it’s time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 

His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS – just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about.
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses – acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America.
Could Hillary’s reported election victory – or Donald Trump’s defeat – signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or “rigged”? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election.
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest.
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment’s “selection” for president:
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny.
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after.
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election
Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre.
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) – Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed.
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) – Possible new acronym or term for “Martial Law”. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario.
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end.
How far will things go?
And will things ever be reset without a new American Revolution?

1124,Decoding North Korea’s Claim of a Successful Nuclear Test - The New York Times,"The Korean Central News Agency, the official news service of North Korea, on Friday published a statement issued by the nation’s nuclear weapons institute. Following is the complete text of the statement, with key passages highlighted, accompanied by context and analysis by the correspondents of The New York Times: The use of the phrase “nuclear warhead” rather than “nuclear device” is noteworthy, suggesting a specific, miniaturized design that can be mounted on a missile. D. P. R. K. refers to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s official name, and the Workers’ Party of Korea is the ruling party, led by Kim  . The Hwasong artillery units are believed to be involved in the development of intercontinental missiles, but Hwasong also refers to a class of   North Korean missiles, their version of a Scud missile. The Hwasong units have been conducting a series of missile tests in recent months, raising regional fears that the North can already mount a nuclear weapon on a missile capable of striking its neighbors, South Korea and Japan. The North recently tested a missile that may be able to reach American bases in the Pacific and has been working on one that can reach the continental United States. But experts say it could take five years for the North to develop the technology needed, including a warhead capable of surviving the stress of   the atmosphere. The reference to standardization may be intended to suggest progress in the North’s manufacturing process after five tests as well as the possibility that it is ready to produce warheads for deployment. That impression is reinforced by the North’s assertion that it can produce warheads “at will and as many as it wants,” which is also a reminder that it has an expanding supply of fuel for nuclear weapons. The North expelled international inspectors and restarted its Yongbyon nuclear reactor in 2013 after the United States suspended talks. It appears to have resumed reprocessing spent fuel from the reactor this year to extract more plutonium, according to the United Nations. By citing “various fissile materials,” the North may be signaling that it has a second source of nuclear material besides the plutonium from Yongbyon reactor  —   a program to produce highly enriched uranium that it disclosed to a visiting American nuclear physicist in 2010. North Korea is believed to have material for at least a dozen, and perhaps as many as 20, nuclear weapons, but it is unclear how many it has actually built. Experts say that number depends in large part on how much highly enriched uranium it has produced. In case you missed it the first time, the statement makes a second reference here to mounting nuclear warheads on missiles. The statement reminds the world that sanctions imposed against North Korea over the past decade have neither prevented it from financing and procuring materials needed to make advances in its nuclear program, nor caused enough pain for it to abandon the effort. The North has demanded that the United States recognize it as a nuclear power, but Washington has insisted that it agree to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula before talks resume.",0
1125,Bill Belichick On Witness List to Testify in Aaron Hernandez Double Murder Case - Breitbart,"New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick could be called to testify in the double murder trial of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez. [Prosecutors filed charges against Hernandez for the 2012 murders of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. Jury selection for the trial is already under way, the Boston Globe reports.  But, along with jury selection, the prosecution has filed a list of some 120 potential civilian witnesses, including coach Belichick. There is no indication just what prosecutors intend to ask the coach. Hernandez’s former University of Florida teammate, Dolphins center Mike Pouncey, is also on the witnesses list, according to SportingNews. com. The player pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder in this current case. Hernandez, who played for the Patriots between 2010 and 2012, has already been convicted of murder in a separate case. In 2015 the former NFL tight end was convicted of the   murder of Odin Lloyd. He was sentenced to life without parole.

1126,L.A. Mayor Silent on City’s Rising Violent Crime - Breitbart,"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s campaign traded barbs with mayoral challenger (and fellow Democrat) Mitchell Schwartz last week over the city’s    rising violent crime rate. [During a Northridge East Neighborhood Council candidate forum, Schwartz accused Garcetti of concealing rising crime statistics by not holding an annual news conference on them at the end of the year, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb slammed Schwartz’s “conspiracy theory” as he tried to explain away the lack of news conference as a scheduling matter. He went on to claim that L. A. crime is at “historic lows” and blamed the state for failures associated with prison sentence reductions under 2014’s Proposition 47.  Violent crime in Los Angeles was up 10 percent in 2016 from 2015, according to the Daily News, which noted that the crime statistics were quietly rolled out on the police department’s website. In prior years the statistics were announced jointly and very publicly by the mayor and chief of police. Schwartz has been campaigning on his goal to add 2, 500 police officers to the city’s police department, according to the report. Another mayoral challenger, Paul Amori, piled on the criticism of Garcetti, saying that “crime is up massively” under Garcetti’s watch, though he didn’t blame Garcetti alone. This week, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer highlighted San Diego’s    decrease in violent crime while noting in a statement that violent crime in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio and Dallas had higher rates. In January, Garcetti spent several days fundraising in Chicago, Washington D. C and New York for his   bid. Earlier the same month, former Vice President Joe Biden appeared at a fundraiser for Garcetti in Beverly Hills. In early February, Garcetti took time to appear on MSNBC, stating that if Los Angeles police were enforcing immigration law, they couldn’t be out solving crimes. Garcetti has repeatedly criticized President Donald Trump’s plans to enforce immigration law and warnings that sanctuary cities face losing federal dollars. Aides to Garcetti said that on March 3 Garcetti and Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck will roll out a “public safety initiative. ” Garcetti has also been the target of protests by Black Lives Matter activists, who President Trump and other critics have blamed for making the tasks facing police in inner cities more difficult.

1127,"Theresa May, New British Prime Minister, Gives Boris Johnson a Key Post - The New York Times","LONDON  —   After a startlingly swift transfer of power that made her Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May took charge of a new government on Wednesday, vowing to honor the referendum to leave the European Union and naming Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who had been widely considered politically dead, as foreign minister. Mr. Johnson had been at the forefront of the   Leave campaign, but after its triumph abruptly pulled out of the contest to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, who left office earlier Wednesday. Speaking as she arrived at the prime minister’s office at 10 Downing Street, Ms. May, 59, who had served for six years as home secretary, sought to position herself firmly in the tradition of “one nation” Conservatism, stressing her commitment to helping the underprivileged and pledging to fight “burning injustice. ” She also promised to preside over an economy that benefits everyone. “As we leave the European Union we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not just for a privileged few but for every one of us,” Ms. May said, as her husband, Philip, stood nearby. Another notable appointment was that of David Davis, a former minister for Europe and a longstanding Euroskeptic, to lead a new department responsible for exiting the European Union. Liam Fox, a former defense secretary, will take charge of international trade. Ms. May has effectively handed Mr. Johnson, Mr. Davis and Mr. Fox the responsibility for successfully carrying out the withdrawal  —   known as Brexit  —   which they repeatedly promised would yield new opportunities. Putting crucial international portfolios firmly in the hands of Brexit supporters was perhaps an astute move for Ms. May, who had argued, tepidly, for Britain to remain in the European Union. Not only do the appointments appear to reflect a desire to unite her party around the outcome of the June 23 vote, they may also be calculated to head off any suggestion from   that she might not follow the will of the voters. Even so, Mr. Johnson’s elevation to such a prestigious post represents a remarkable change of fortunes in a career that has had its share of them. He played a key role in the extraordinary national dramas of the last few months, abandoning Mr. Cameron, who desperately tried to keep Britain in the European Union, and cheerfully becoming the public face of the Brexit campaign. Yet when Mr. Cameron announced his resignation after the referendum, Mr. Johnson’s hopes of succeeding him as Conservative Party leader were undermined by another Brexit supporter, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, who threw aside his support for Mr. Johnson and announced his own candidacy. Mr. Gove argued that Mr. Johnson was not up to the job. Ms. May herself recently mocked Mr. Johnson’s negotiating skills over London’s purchase of used German water cannons when he was mayor. She blocked the use of the cannons, citing fears that they could cause serious injuries. Among other appointments, Ms. May promoted Amber Rudd, former energy secretary, to home secretary. That ensures that one of the biggest political offices  —   and Ms. May’s old job  —   remains in the hands of a woman. The new prime minister chose Philip Hammond, who had been foreign secretary, as chancellor of the Exchequer, replacing George Osborne, a close Cameron ally. Ms. May moved into 10 Downing Street after a day of political ritual that saw Mr. Cameron address lawmakers for the last time as prime minister, before tendering his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II. Only on Monday did Ms. May learn that she would become prime minister, when the last remaining contender to lead the governing Conservative Party, Andrea Leadsom, quit the race. Ms. May takes over at a time of acute political turmoil and economic uncertainty and is the 13th prime minister to serve this queen  —   the first was Winston Churchill. Ms. May’s task is more formidable than that of most of her predecessors. She must chart a course that unites her Conservative Party and takes Britain out of the European Union, while limiting the effect of withdrawal on an economy already heading for a downturn and bruised by a slump in the value of its currency. The Brexit referendum divided the nation, with the majority of voters in a number of less affluent areas opting to quit the bloc, while most of those in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland took the opposite view. On Monday, Ms. May outlined some of the economic changes she hopes to make, speaking about taming excessive executive pay, and arguing that big multinational companies must pay their fair share in taxes. Just an hour or so before Ms. May spoke outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, Mr. Cameron stood in the same spot, flanked by his wife, Samantha, and their three children, paying tribute to his family and his key staff members who had supported him. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years, and to serve as the leader of my party for almost 11 years,” Mr. Cameron said. “My only wish is continued success for this great country that I love so very much. ” Mr. Cameron cited the nation’s economic recovery as his top legacy. “With the deficit cut by   two and a half million more people in work and one million more businesses, there can be no doubt that our economy is immeasurably stronger,” he said. He also cited among his accomplishments the legalization of   marriage, in 2013 changes to the education system and reduced wait times for operations in Britain’s National Health Service. “I’m delighted that for the second time in British history, the new prime minister will be a woman, and once again a Conservative,” Mr. Cameron said. “I believe Theresa will provide strong and stable leadership in fulfilling the Conservative manifesto on which we were elected, and I wish her well in negotiating the best possible terms for Britain’s exit from the European Union. ” Hours earlier, in his final parliamentary duty, Mr. Cameron took part for the last time in prime minister’s questions, the weekly ritual in which lawmakers interrogate the leader in often combative exchanges. On Wednesday, the discussion was more respectful  —   and lighthearted  —   than usual, as Mr. Cameron’s political adversaries and allies paid tribute to him. “I’m told that there are lots of leadership roles out there at the moment: there’s the England football team, there’s ‘Top Gear,’ there’s even across the big pond the role that needs filling,” Danny Kinahan, a lawmaker from Northern Ireland, told Mr. Cameron jokingly, referring to England’s soccer team, a wildly popular BBC television show  —   and the United States presidential election.",0

The preservationist architect on the project, who resigned last year over differences, said, “He does not deserve this building. ” _____ 4. Apple announced a range of updates and improvements across its full line at its annual product showcase, but the big focus was the new iPhone 7. Its lack of a headphone jack means the device can be   (oh be joyful) the company can sell wireless earbuds (ouch, $160) and the future looks a lot less like a tangle of wires. Our tech columnist sees a telling lack of dazzle. _____ 5. The Paralympic Games opened in Rio. Some 4, 300 athletes representing 161 nations and a team representing the world’s refugees will compete over the next 10 days. Shortfalls in ticket sales and sponsorships forced cuts in the number of workers, transportation options and sports venues, but not the number of events (live streaming on TeamUSA. org). _____ 6.

New details emerged of Edward Snowden’s path after he fled the U. S. in 2013 with details of how the National Security Agency’s vast program of surveillance had swept in millions of Americans. Four men and women, all asylum seekers and clients of one of Mr. Snowden’s Hong Kong lawyers, spoke of harboring him in cramped apartments in poor districts. One said she didn’t know who he was until she bought him a paper. “Oh my God, unbelievable,” she recalled saying to herself. “The most wanted man in the world is in my house. ” _____ 10.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/usa-has-killed-more-than-20-million.html Recently, the world commemorated another anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, which changed the world as we knew it, and has since, cast a terroristic haze over the planet. The War on Terror was engaged; the premise was a globally united citizen, freedom was under attack, “God Bless America.” Admitting, in the famous Bush speech , to rally the world to a new war, he stated this:“The Americans have known wars, but for the past 136 years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941 [ Pearl Harbour ].”It is with this quote that I bring the attention to the countless deaths over not 136 years, but only those since World War II, that the United States of America can be partially held culpable. Proxy wars, particularly, hold some of the highest numbers; there is barely a nation where the U.S. has not permeated its military might through borders. Yes, wars are messy and incredibly complex. But it is important to recognize, that although Russia, China, North Korea and all the other nations accused of bloodshed are guilty in their own rights, the United States must share a large part of the responsibility. One study, compiled by James A. Lucas , explains with hard evidence, 37 nations deeply affected by U.S. involvement. However, anyone with a history book can see for themselves that the self-proclaimed freedom fighter – the U.S. – is not all that it seems. Afghanistan and Russia Most are familiar with the ‘Mujahadeen’ name. It conjures up Russians, war, and the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan. What a lot don’t know is how the proxy war came about, or that Afghanistan – a secular nation at the time – was friendly with its Russian neighbors. So what happened? In 1998, Zbigniew Brzezinski admitted to a CIA-instigated battle which saw 12,000 deaths in Afghanistan directly attributed to the United States. The Carter administration, at the time, had agreed to provide “secret aid” to rebels wanting to overthrow the pro-Soviet regime. Well aware that providing this aid would create a Soviet military intervention, the act was signed off. “Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it?” 6 billion dollars later and a 10-year war, over a million were reported dead. The other interventions less talked about… There are smaller nations, less notable in the history books, but equally devastated by the overthrows, coups and interventions that took place, courtesy of the United States. Angola’s civil war lasted 26 years, with a reported 300,000 to 750,000 dead , depending on the literature you read. It was reported that Henry Kissinger [top architect of the New World Order ] had claimed that the US had to intervene in Angola because “the Soviet Union was already providing military aid to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in the form of Cuban troops.” It was, years later, discovered that he lied and that the Soviet Union was very reluctant to become involved in Angola, in the first place. Chad saw around 40,000 killed and over 200,000 tortured after the CIA assisted Hissen Habre into power in 1982. Then there is the famous CIA intervention with Chile’s elections and Salvador Allende , who became elected president. On Sept. 11, 1973, Allende either killed himself or was assassinated. General Augusto Pinochet rose to power in 1974 – much to Henry Kissinger’s approval, and thousands were murdered, tortured or simply disappeared. In the 1960s the Dominican Republic witnessed 3,000 deaths after a CIA coup overthrew Juan Bosch. When the citizens tried to reelect the man, the U.S. invaded with 22,000 military. Chilean President Salvador Allende, flanked by body guards during the coup on 11 September 1973. Later that day, Allende was reported dead. But you haven’t mentioned… The Korean War? The “ U.S. dropped 650,000 tons of bombs , including 43,000 napalm bombs.” Fatalities stand anywhere between a few hundred thousand to 4.5 million for the Koreans and Chinese, depending on the literature you read. The Vietnam War? If you include Laos, where an estimated 200,000 died from U.S. bombs, it bumps up the already 5.1 million deaths estimated by the Vietnam government – but just a little bit. Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge ? Millions were slaughtered after the U.S. left the country in tatters, providing a vacuum of power for Pol Pot’s psychopathic tendencies. Or we could focus on the pivotal role the U.S. played in placing General Suharto as leader of Indonesia after the East Timor atrocities of 1975, leaving over a quarter of the population dead. That was Gerald Ford and Kissinger’s handy work, providing Suharto with American arms. In 1991 it happened again, with East Timorese protesters in Dili gunned down by Suharto’s military. Notably, we can’t forget the Iraq Wars, post sanctions: “excessive deaths among children” under 5 stand at 227,000 with a real estimate closer to 350,000 , according to some statisticians. Let me say that again: A quarter million children under 5, dead. In Conclusion As one goes through statistics like these, it becomes increasingly difficult to remain impartial. Did the past wars create the build up to the 9/11 tragedy? I don’t say it lightly; the victims of that time, and all the innocent civilians caught up in America’s wrath since Bush’s War on Terror commenced, have suffered greatly. Everyone since, is suffering. Stepping into civil wars, instigating coups, disrupting functional regimes, baiting nations into proxy wars… how did 9/11 not happen sooner? Crimea , Turkey , Syria , North Korea and China… the world edges towards the precipice. By Anon Watcher Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

1130,Police Officers Face Backlash After What They Did To Hillary In Photo,"Share This A photo of Hillary Clinton with some police officers popped up on social media over the weekend, but people were divided in their reaction to it. The post on the Facebook page for the Medford Police Patrolmen’s Association caused controversy and backlash online over the content and what the was seen being done to crooked Hillary. The post showed Medford Police officers at the Fall Festival in Haines Square on Saturday. The photo was done in fun and captioned, “Look who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today…” This image is an accurate depiction of what we all would like to see: Hillary in handcuffs. As you can plainly see, the photos show police officers with a woman in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed. It appears that they are arresting someone, who wore a mask in the likeness of Hillary Clinton. Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman’s Facebook page 
In a second photo, the police officers posed with a person in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, “Making America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!” Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman’s Facebook page 
Since a fair amount of overly sensitive pansies made a big deal about the posts, Harry MacGilvray, president of the Medford Police Patrolmen’s Association, decided to apologize for making the post. 
“These were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way,” MacGilvray said in a statement. “I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.” 
The posts have been removed to avoid hurting the feelings of overly-sensitive liberals. While most of us see the humor in these images and understand how insane it was to apologize for the posts that were clearly done in jest, liberals don’t see things this way. 
They go out of their way, looking to be offended. If the police posed with a handcuffed Trump, it’s pretty obvious that there would have been no outrage, because conservatives aren’t easily offended by free speech. However, a liberals sole purpose seems to be finding things to be offended over, and they have done it again.",0
1131,Shakespeare to remain authentically boring,"October 26, 2016 
The Board of Shakespeare’s Globe have reassured audiences of their mission to produce shows of ‘mind-numbing tweeness’, purposely designed to send your average GCSE Literature student into a spiral of self-harm. Renewing their commitment to Shakespearean traditions, all staff will be expected to adhere to a life expectancy of 40, rats as pets, and a blanket ban on all actors who menstruate. 
Having sacked artistic director Emma Rice for being more modern than ‘an iPhone9 in a holographic dress’, the Board will be looking for someone more in keeping with the Renaissance Period – like an Apothecary with typhoid. Any candidate must come with a ruff, a small goatee and a pathological distrust of the Spanish navy. 
One scholar explained: ‘The fear is, that by making Shakespeare contemporary and relevant, you might actually make Shakespeare contemporary and relevant. And the last thing we want are ordinary people comprehending theatre or even, God forbid, enjoying it. Just look what happened to the beast with two backs, once the plebs discovered ‘The Joy of Sex’. 
Mrs Rice had come under considerable criticism for using lighting and sound in ‘The Globe’, while removing popular features – such as the bear-baiting pit and the ‘Potato Museum of Wonder’. Upon hearing that she planned to replace lute players with Spotify, one board member demanded: ‘Burn her, she’s a witch!’ Share this story...

1132,Georgia Candidate Jon Ossoff’s Film Firm Financed by Facebook Fact Check Funder,"Democrat Jon Ossoff, the candidate who fell short of the   mark needed to capture a House seat in an Atlanta district that has long been a Republican stronghold, serves as the CEO of an investigative film company that has received backing from the   Omidyar Network. [The Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, has partnered with George Soros’s Open Society on numerous projects and has given grants to third parties using the   Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to   causes in the U. S.  The Omidyar Network is also a prominent donor to the International   Network, the project of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies that is helping Facebook to determine whether a certain story is “disputed. ” Poynter’s IFCN is also funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundations, as well as by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for Democracy. In March, the Omidyar Network also provided the   League (ADL) whose chief has baselessly smeared Breitbart News with claims of   associations, with a   seed donation to build a Silicon Valley command center purportedly aimed at combating online hate. Ossoff serves as managing director and CEO of the   Insight TWI (The World Investigates) which describes itself as producing “  documentary films and television programmes, specializing in fresh, daring factual content and   journalism. ” Continues a company description: “Insight’s   Peabody, and BAFTA   team has decades of experience working safely in   environments and a focus on immersive storytelling that makes the important interesting. ” The company’s leaders produced “Blood on the Stone,” a documentary that accompanied the DVD for the   “Blood Diamond” movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Insight TWI collaborated with with Al Jazeera English to produce an “Africa Investigates” series. In 2014, the Omidyar Network provided Ossoff’s Insight TWI with a $350, 000 investment, listing Ossoff specifically on the award announcement posted on Omidyar’s website. Regarding the Facebook   project, the   International   Network recently drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook announced it will work with “  fact checking organizations” that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the “fact checking organizations” determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, “there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. ” Omidyar also provided the seed capital for the ADL’s new Silicon Valley command center reportedly aimed at combatting online hate. According to the ADL’s press release announcing the Omidyar grant, the ADL will work with tech sector leaders to look into   options for reducing “online harassment,” including “artificial intelligence, big data,   reality, and other technologies. ” Ossoff, a former aide to Rep. Hank Johnson ( ) was widely touted by major progressive groups for his attempt to win a House race in Atlanta’s conservative suburbs. The Democratic Party excitement surrounding Ossoff’s bid led the Drudge Report to label him the “Dem Trump slayer” in a banner headline. Drudge later mockingly crossed out the words “Dem Trump slayer” as Ossoff’s chances for victory seemed to have faded. The Washington Post reported on the latest results of Ossoff’s bid: Unofficial returns showed that Ossoff had earned less than 50 percent of the vote, the threshold needed to declare an outright victory. Instead, with 48. 3 percent, Ossoff was headed to a runoff against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and the top GOP   in a special election to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. In a statement early Wednesday, Ossoff acknowledged that he had fallen short: “This is already a remarkable victory,” he said. “We defied the odds, shattered expectations, and now are ready to fight on and win in June. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

1133,"US charges 61 over India-based scam involving 15,000 victims","Society The US is charging dozens of people with participation in a major Indian-based fraud. 
The US Justice Department has charged 61 people and entities with involvement in a major India-based scam that targeted thousands of Americans. 
The scheme involved Indian call centers, where some workers called American citizens and convinced them to pay their non-existent debts by impersonating Internal Revenue Service (IRS), immigration and other federal officials, the Justice Department said in a statement on Thursday. 
Some victims were even offered short-term loans or grants on condition of providing good-faith deposits or payment of a processing fee. 
The scammers had stolen more than $300 million from at least 15,000 unsuspecting citizens, the department noted. 
The victims’ money was laundered by an American network of criminals who used debit cards or wire transfers under fake identities, the indictment said. 
Federal officials arrested 20 people across America on Thursday. Additionally, 32 individuals and five call centers in India were charged with connection to the case. 
US Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in a press briefing that Washington was looking forward extraditing the suspects from India to face jail terms. 
“It's really important for the scammers in India to know that the United States is looking at this, is watching them and they could, if they engage in that activity, be extradited to the United Sates and could sit in jail ... for several years,” she said. 
In a bill of indictment for the scammers, the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas had pointed to scare tactics employed by the operators of call centers in Ahmedabad, in the Indian state of Gujarat. 
They “threatened potential victims with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay taxes or penalties to the government,” it read. 
The extent of the scam was so vast that major federal organizations such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Treasury, Homeland Security, US Secret Service and police had to help with the investigation, according to the Justice Department. Loading ...",0
1134,"In Effort to Defeat ISIS, U.S. and Iran Impede One Another - The New York Times","BAGHDAD  —   Iraqi forces, backed by American airstrikes and advised by American officers, have been making strides in Anbar Province, slowly taking back territory from the Islamic State. But in Falluja, a city in   Anbar that has been in the hands of the Islamic State longer than any other in Iraq or Syria, civilians are starving as the Iraqi Army and militias lay siege to the city. And elsewhere in the province, Shiite militias supported by Iran are carrying out kidnappings and murders and restricting the movement of Sunni Arab civilians, according to American and Iraqi officials. For seasoned observers of the American military involvement in Iraq  —   going back more than 25 years to the start of the Persian Gulf war  —   it is all part of a depressingly familiar pattern: battlefield gains that do not bring stability in their wake. “Unfortunately, as has been a trademark of American involvement with Iraq at least since 2003 (and arguably since 1991) military success is not being matched with the commensurate   efforts that will ultimately determine whether battlefield successes are translated into lasting achievements,” Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a longtime Iraq analyst, wrote recently in an online column. A growing number of critics are warning that   military victories need to be backed up with political reconciliation between Sunni and Shiite Arabs, something Iran is working against, and with determined efforts to rebuild cities so that civilians can return. In Anbar, they note, the situation is bleak: Shiite militias have worsened sectarian animosities, and hundreds of thousands of civilians have been unable to return home. More broadly, analysts and officials say, it has become clear that though the United States and Iran both want to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq, they have been unable to work together to promote unity in the country  —   even after a deal was reached last year over Iran’s nuclear program, which many hoped would allow them to cooperate more closely. Nowhere is this dynamic more pronounced than in Anbar, a vast desert area of western Iraq that for years has been a homeland for the Islamic State and its forerunner, Al Qaeda in Iraq, and where hundreds of American soldiers and Marines were killed after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. As the United States supports the Iraqi Army and some local tribal fighters in battling the Islamic State, Iran has quietly pursued its objectives in the province, officials say. It wants to secure a land route to Syria and its allies, the government of President Bashar   and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite movement, and to protect Baghdad and the   south of Iraq. The situation in Anbar has grown increasingly muddled as the Obama administration has stepped up its military support to Iraq, announcing that it will deploy Apache helicopters and position more troops closer to the front lines. It has touted victories in Anbar as an important step toward liberating the country from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and as a prelude to a campaign, possibly this year, to retake Mosul, Iraq’s   city. But Iran’s proxies are undercutting efforts to unite the civilian population, a necessity if Iraq is to eventually extinguish extremism. In the siege of Falluja, a Sunni city, the Shiite militias have prevented civilians from leaving Islamic State territory while resisting calls to allow humanitarian aid to reach the city. Sunni Arab civilians in the province are increasingly reporting kidnappings and murders by the militias, accounts that American and Iraqi officials say are credible. In some cases, after civilians have disappeared, their families have received ransom demands. Abu Abdulrahman, a resident of Amiriyat   a city in Anbar under the control of the government, said three of his cousins vanished last year after being stopped at a militia checkpoint. “We haven’t heard anything about them since then,” he said, although a man approached the family and demanded a ransom of $8, 000, which was paid. “He disappeared with the money,” he said. Conditions are so dire in Falluja for the tens of thousands of civilians trapped there that dozens of people have starved to death, civilians and activists say. Food prices have skyrocketed, with a bag of flour that would cost $15 in Baghdad going for $750, Human Rights Watch has reported. The rights group recently warned that if aid does not reach Falluja, “the results for civilians could be calamitous. ” “We are profoundly worried about Falluja,” Lise Grande, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said in a recent statement. “There are reports of widespread food shortages and lack of medicines. We don’t have access to the city, but we have to assume based on what we are hearing that people are in terrible trouble. ” Hadi   a prominent Iraqi official who leads the Badr Organization, a longstanding militia backed by Iran, said in an interview this year as the siege of Falluja began that it was a military necessity to “surround the city, to cut off supply lines. ” When asked about the demand from the United Nations and other groups to find a way to send food in, he said, using another acronym for the Islamic State, “to give food to who  —   to Daesh?” Inside Falluja, some civilians who say they initially supported the Islamic State as preferable to the government in Baghdad now say they would welcome liberation. But they say they are caught between the Islamic State, which has become more brutal toward civilians as the siege has dragged on, and the government and militias. “The situation inside Falluja is difficult because of the siege imposed by the security forces outside Falluja, and from the inside by ISIS, who won’t let us get out of the city,” said Ahmed Mohammed, a Falluja resident reached by telephone.

But this apparently was apparently the first thing on Wilson’s unhinged mind when he woke up. Wilson, though, seems to be doing a bit of projecting since he once politicized, out of all things, a rape threat against his daughter to try to score political points against Breitbart News. John Nolte wrote at the time that “in all the years I’ve been on social media, I have never seen anyone  —   not even the lowest Leftist  —   use a threat of rape against their own child as a political talking point or debating point against a political opponent. ” After he politicized the rape threat against his daughter, Wilson was immediately asked if he had gone to law enforcement and whether law enforcement officials asked him not to publicize the rape threat on social media. During the 2016 election cycle, Wilson, who constantly bemoans what he deems is crass behavior by anyone who is not a fellow “Never Trumper,” went on national television and said the donor class needed to “put a bullet in Donald Trump. ” “They’re still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump,” Wilson told MSNBC’s   audience. “And that’s a fact. ” Wilson also likened Ann Coulter to a prostitute and asked Coulter if Trump paid her “more for anal. ”",0
1136,Western Intelligence Agencies are Running al-Qaeda Camps in North Africa,"We Are Change 
Intelligence agencies are running al-Qaeda camps in North Africa?— UN consultant (EXCLUSIVE) New evidence points to a Western cover-up of Algerian state sponsorship of Islamist jihadists, to protect oil and gas interests By Nafeez Ahmed 
An unpublished report by a government advisor and UN consultant, obtained exclusively by INSURGE intelligence , accuses Western and Algerian security services of complicity in al-Qaeda terrorist activity across North Africa.
The academic report focuses on damning evidence that a devastating al-Qaeda terrorist attack on the Tigantourine gas plant near In Amenas, Algeria, was orchestrated by Algeria’s secret services, with the knowledge of US, French and British intelligence.
A draft copy of the report, due to be published later this month, has been seen exclusively by INSURGE intelligence . 
Escalating instability in North Africa is being blamed on the re-emergence of an offshoot of al-Qaeda?—?al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Despite French military efforts, the group is re-consolidated in northern Mali, and has orchestrated terror strikes from Burkino Faso to the Ivory Coast.
Yet the new draft report by a UN consultant, prepared by the International State Crime Initiative (ISCI) at Queen Mary University of London, uncovers remarkable evidence that the Phoenix-like return of AQIM is thanks to the unwavering covert support the terror group receives from one of the West’s staunch allies in the ‘war on terror’: Algeria.

Terror ties The as-yet unpublished report highlights evidence of such support from the In Amenas attack between 16 and 20 January 2013, which resulted in the deaths of 39 foreign nationals, including three Americans, six Britons, five Norwegians, and one French.
The Tigantourine gas plant is operated jointly by BP, Norway’s Statoil and the Algerian state-owned Sonatrach, producing 12% of Algeria’s natural gas.
Algeria’s In Amenas gas plant (Reuters) The attack was the single largest terrorist killing of ‘Westerners’ since the London bombings of 7 July 2005.
The Queen Mary University of London report is authored by social anthropologist Professor Jeremy Keenan of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.
Keenan, who has authored over 200 peer-reviewed scholarly articles and six books on the Sahara-Sahel region, is an advisor on regional security issues to NATO, the US State Department, the EU, the UN, the British Foreign Office, and international oil companies.
The report reveals startling evidence that the attack was secretly organised by the DRS, Algeria’s notorious secret intelligence service. The idea was to convince Algeria’s Western allies to continue supporting the regime’s domestic and regional counter-terrorism programmes, amidst growing international scepticism about their success.
Algeria’s DRS maintained intimate ties with the terrorists behind the In Amenas attack, many of whom have been longstanding agents of the Algerian security services, the report says.
US, British and French intelligence services are aware of these connections, but are covering them up to protect their considerable oil and gas interests in the country.
Among the report’s most alarming revelations is that over the last decade, Algeria’s DRS has run a secret al-Qaeda training camp in the Tamouret region, with the knowledge of Western government security agencies.
Al-Qaeda camp?—?run by Algeria’s secret state Over several years, Prof Keenan obtained direct eyewitness evidence from locals about the secret al-Qaeda camp in Tamouret, including from an AQIM member who trained there.
Its purpose is to recruit, indoctrinate and train marginalised youth from across North Africa into committing atrocities in Algerian communities?—?after which they would usually be executed.
Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) fighters in a propaganda video filmed in the Sahara (Wikipedia Commons) According to Keenan’s eyewitness sources, the camp was visited almost daily “by high-ranking army and DRS officers… including General Rachid ‘Attafi’ Lallali, the head of the DRS’ External Security Directorate (DDSE).”
The camp was also directly supplied with arms and ammunition from Algerian army depots.
Detailed information on the identities of camp recruits, including DNA data, was routinely shared with Western intelligence agencies according to sources familiar with the camp.
Trainee terrorists at Tamouret were schooled in sniping and throat-slitting. The camp was provided with a continual supply of prisoners?—?mostly criminals and dissenting soldiers?—?purely for the purpose of being killed during training.
Over a seven month period, one eyewitness said, about 180 murders had taken place at the camp during such routine practice sessions.
In Amenas?—?a DRS operation Keenan’s report for the International State Crime Initiative points to disturbing evidence of Algerian intelligence services’ direct sponsorship of al-Qaeda terror.
On 27 August 2015, senior DRS commander General “Hassan” Abdelkader Aït Ouarabi was arrested by Algerian authorities. The arrest was based on allegations from three terrorists captured at the In Amenas gas facility, who claimed they had received arms from General Hassan.
On the same day as Gen Hassan’s arrest, the US Director of National Intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, flew into Algiers for high-level government meetings.
The FBI had also been given access to the three terrorists making these allegations before July 2013.
Corroborating this information, the report refers to the testimony of former DRS captain, H. Haroune, and a former captain and instructor in the Special Forces under DRS command at the time, A. Chouchan. The two former DRS operatives have claimed that “General Mediène [then DRS chief] ordered the attack on In Amenas (presumably planned to be a hostage-taking mission that the army would resolve as it did at Gharis in 2003).”
What did BP know? Astonishingly, the report reveals that before the attack, BP and Statoil had a three year contract with a transport services company, BAAT SARL, owned by Mohamed Ghadir, the brother of al-Qaeda terrorist Abdelhamid Abou Zaïd?—?the head of AQIM in the Sahara, and chief of the DRS-run AQIM training camp at Tamouret.
At the London inquest last year, BP was never questioned about this contract, despite it involving a company tied to the very al-Qaeda group that attacked the gas plant.
In the years preceding the attack, Keenan himself?—?in his capacity as a security consultant?—?repeatedly warned BP that the facility would be attacked by Islamist terrorists with the covert support of the Algerian government.
Keenan suggests that BP’s inexplicable lack of concern about the matter was because the firm had been given security assurances from Algerian or Western authorities that AQIM would not attack the plant.
BP did not respond to request for comment. 
Gary Rose, an emergency response advisor who worked at the In Amenas facility, said that BP’s onsite security “was incredibly poor and relied totally on the untested and unknown capabilities of the Algerian military.” Rose narrowly avoided the attack having left the site two days earlier.
Rose, who gave evidence at the London Inquest, was especially damning about BP’s approach. The firm “did nowhere near enough to protect the facility, even with the most basic and credible scenarios in their own emergency response plans…
“The risk assessment process was flawed, inadequate and done from a view of process safety not human safety. Physical security was constantly breached by the local staff and was out of direct expatriate control, the physical barriers and warning/protection systems were wholly inadequate. I know exactly what systems we did and did not have, and management on site were aware of all the failings too. After the fall of Libya there should have been a massive review of security, but instead we handed over more control to poorly trained Algerian security guards. We were all aware of bandits and arms trafficking in the desert regions but were just relying on the Algerian military to manage this, maybe by force or maybe by negotiation?” 
According to Rose, the most appropriate way of dealing with the risk would have required abandoning the site to conduct a full review and reinforcement.
But shutting down and abandoning the facility, or any other such facilities, “was never an option due to the huge amount of revenue and European reliance on external hydrocarbons: it’s economy over safety and that’s how the petroleum industry works.”
Complicity in Algeria’s reign of terror The draft report by Queen Mary University’s ISCI refers to recent revelations from Habib Souaïdia, a former Algerian army officer.
According to Souaïdia:
“… he had been informed by many of his former colleagues [in the Algerian Special Forces] that the leaders of some of the jihadist groups sowing terror in Tunisia ‘take their orders from Algiers.’” 
In 2015, Tunisia experienced two major terrorist attacks, in which a total of 61 civilians were killed by gunmen with ties to Algeria.
Souaïdia reported that mobile phones and SIM cards of AQIM jihadists killed in Tunisia’s Mount Chaambi border area, obtained by the Tunisian army, “revealed their communications with DRS officials in Algiers, including their phone numbers and even their nicknames.”
In late 2013, the information about the SIM cards was handed over to US intelligence, which demanded Algeria’s army chiefs put a stop to the support for jihadists in Tunisia. But, Keenan says, a related US concern was to prevent information on the DRS’ dealings with terrorists falling into the public domain:
“The reason for that was because US intelligence services and the DRS had been working together as close allies in the so-called war on terror since 2002 and would inevitably, and quite correctly, be seen as having been complicit in whatever ‘false-flag’ and other such questionable operations had been conducted by the DRS since 2002.” 
The AQIM-backed insurgency in Mali was also being supported by Algeria’s intelligence services. A Nigerian military officer told Keenan that AQIM forces in Mali were being supplied food and fuel by the DRS.
Throughout the DRS’ sponsorship of regional al-Qaeda terrorist activity, the US, Britain and France have worked closely with the very same DRS on regional ‘counter-terrorism’?—?despite being privy to damning intelligence on Algeria’s double-game.
Algerian soldiers The Clinton files Direct confirmation of high-level US knowledge of the Algerian regime’s relationship with the terrorists behind the In Amenas attack came from emails leaked from Hillary Clinton’s private server, published by Wikileaks in March 2016.
An email dated 17 January 2013 to Clinton from her aide Sidney Blumenthal, noted that the alleged leader of the In Amenas attack, AQIM terrorist Mokhtar Belmokhtar [MBM], had a secret agreement with Algerian intelligence. Under the agreement, Belmokhtar would pursue al-Qaeda destabilisation operations in Mali and the Western Sahara:
“According to sources with access to the Algerian DGSE [the DRS], the Bouteflika government reached a highly secret understanding with Belmokhtar after the kidnapping in April 2012 of the Algerian consul in Gao (Mali). Under this agreement Belmokhtar concentrated his operations in Mali, and occasionally, with the encouragement of the Algerian DGSE, attack Moroccan interests in Western Sahara, where the Algerians have territorial claims.” 
Mokhtar Belmokhtar was also, according to Keenan’s eyewitness sources, in charge of logistics for the al-Qaeda training camp in Tamouret, which he visited every two weeks.
Hillary Clinton A further email dated 19 January 2013 from Blumenthal to Clinton reported that French intelligence had learnt from a source “with access to the highest levels of the Algerian army” that:
“… officers of the Algerian DGSE [DRS] are looking to secretly meet Belmokhtar or one of his lieutenants in northern Mauritania in the immediate future. They have been ordered to find out why Belmokhtar violated their two-year-old secret agreement and launched attacks inside Algeria.” 
There is no evidence that such a meeting actually took place, suggesting that the DRS was not really interested in finding the answer.
In any case, Clinton forwarded Blumenthal’s email to Robert Russo, her assistant in the US Department of State?—?which means the US government was aware of the agreement between AQIM’s Belmokhtar and Algerian intelligence.
Keenan points out that these emails must be placed in context with the evidence that the DRS itself had sponsored the In Amenas attack in the first place:
“We therefore had a situation in which the presidency, the army high command and, most likely, western oil companies, knew there was a secret agreement with MBM not to attack installations within Algeria. The DRS, which would have been the agency that made the deal with MBM, would have assured the presidency and army command that such an agreement had been made. What neither the presidency, army nor foreign oil companies knew, although they may have suspected, was that they had effectively been double-crossed by the DRS.” 
In either case, it seems that the State Department was aware that Algerian intelligence was sponsoring Islamist terror across North Africa.
When asked what the State Department did with the information it had received via Hillary Clinton, a spokesperson, Pooja Jhunjhunwala said:
“As a matter of policy, the Department of State does not comment on materials, including classified documents, which may have been leaked.” 
However, when asked about the State Department’s position on public record evidence of Algerian intelligence support to jihadists supplied by Prof Keenan?—?who has previously consulted on regional security issues for the State Department?—?she simply declined to comment.
Cover-up? Much of this information was passed on by Keenan to the London Inquest into the attack on the Tigantourine gas plant. Yet the Inquest, which delivered its verdict in February 2015, excluded this evidence from the proceedings. Keenan himself was blocked from giving evidence at the Inquest.
The Addendum to the Queen Mary University report includes the full text of a letter dated 30 April 2015 sent by Prof Keenan to Detective Constable William Wixey of the SO15 Counter Terrorism Command, summarising his available evidence.
Keenan’s letter offered to provide access to multiple witnesses, two of whom would be non-Algerian citizens, who would expose the leader of the In Amenas attack as an “agent” of Algeria’s secret intelligence service.
On 13 May, DC Wixey replied to Keenan’s letter to explain that the Coroner’s office was “of the view that they do not wish to take this matter further at this stage.”
The Metropolitan Police failed to respond to a request for comment on the decision to block Keenan’s evidence from the Inquest.
In addition to blocking Keenan’s evidence, the British government used Public Interest Immunity?—?the withdrawal of information on grounds of ‘national security’?—?to suppress the disclosure of key documents at the Inquest on what the government knew, and when.
The use of Public Interest Immunity was “very suspicious,” London Inquest witness Gary Rose said:
“Now we are not able to know what is being withheld and there is little that can be done about that.” 
In his report for Queen Mary University, Prof Keenan concludes that the government had sought not only to cover up “its own incompetency with regard to the FCO”, but also to avoid questions about the government’s “possible complicity in [Algerian] state crimes.”
The government’s goal was to withhold any information alluding to British intelligence collusion with the DRS, including evidence that MI6 had been “complicit in activity that could be construed as criminal.”
In the absence of a further inquiry, there seems little prospect that the questions Keenan raises will be answered by officialdom. Yet his forthcoming report goes some way toward uncovering the real reasons that the threat of terrorism is escalating in North Africa.

1137,Trump Tells Planned Parenthood Its Funding Can Stay if Abortion Goes - The New York Times,"The White House, concerned about the possible political repercussions of the Republican effort to defund Planned Parenthood, has proposed preserving federal payments to the group if it discontinues providing abortions. The proposal, which was never made formally, has been rejected as an impossibility by officials at Planned Parenthood, which receives about $500 million annually in federal funding. That money helps pay for women’s health services the organization provides, not for abortion services. “Let’s be clear: Federal funds already do not pay for abortions,” Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said on Monday. “Offering money to Planned Parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept. Providing critical health care services for millions of American women is nonnegotiable. ” But the outreach to allies of Planned Parenthood is a glimpse of the internal struggle inside a White House torn between trying to satisfy the conservative base that elected President Trump and responding to the views of his daughter Ivanka Trump, who urged her father to tread carefully on the Planned Parenthood issue during the Republican primary contest. Ms. Trump has no formal role in the administration, but as an informal adviser she has made women’s issues a focus. She has had a mixed record of success in the administration’s early days, but during the campaign, she was able to nudge Mr. Trump toward a nuanced view of Planned Parenthood’s work. Mr. Trump confirmed the discussions in a statement on Monday to The New York Times. “As I said throughout the campaign, I am   and I am deeply committed to investing in women’s health and plan to significantly increase federal funding in support of nonabortion services such as cancer screenings,” he said. “Polling shows the majority of Americans oppose public funding for abortion, even those who identify as  . There is an opportunity for organizations to continue the important work they do in support of women’s health, while not providing abortion services. ” Indeed, Mr. Trump made similar statements as a candidate, putting him at odds with other Republicans in a primary race characterized by conservative views. In private discussions with people close to Planned Parenthood, White House officials have suggested that there could even be an increase in federal earmarks if the work related to abortion ends. At various points during the campaign, Mr. Trump spoke favorably of the work of Planned Parenthood, even while saying he would support withdrawing its funding if abortions continued. “Millions and millions of women  —   cervical cancer, breast cancer  —   are helped by Planned Parenthood,” he said in February 2016 at a debate hosted by CNN. “I would defund it because I’m   but millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood. ” Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which supports   candidates, said Mr. Trump was living up to his campaign promise. “We’re not used to that in politics,” she said. She added that she had no problem with the deal because her issue with Planned Parenthood is with its abortion work. Until 2011, when he announced he opposed abortion rights, Mr. Trump had supported legal measures allowing abortions. Congressional Republicans have said they will soon move legislation to strip all federal funds from Planned Parenthood, and a provision for doing that was included in the House Republican bill to replace the Affordable Care Act released on Monday night. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, suggested that Mr. Trump had authorized the proposal because he wanted to be able to claim that he had made an offer to Planned Parenthood and that officials with the group were not being reasonable. “The Trump administration needs to stop playing political games that would put access to the full range of safe reproductive care at risk, or they will get the fight of their lives,” Ms. Gillibrand said. Diane Max, a major donor to Planned Parenthood, called the offer “an absurd play” and said Mr. Trump had been “sympathetic to a woman’s right to choose until it was politically unpopular” for him.",0

1139,Comment on Hillary Clinton’s Gun Control Agenda Exposed in WikiLeaks Emails by braindiseasecalledliberalism,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by The Daily Sheeple 
There is no doubt about it. Hillary Clinton is after your guns. 
Brian Fallon, national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote in an email dated October 4, 2015 that Clinton intends to stop the “gun show loophole”, meaning all private gun sales, by executive order : 
Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability . 
Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold. When a lawsuit brought against these manufacturers was found to be frivolous, Clinton made a big fuss about it on Twitter: It's incomprehensible that our laws would protect gun makers over Sandy Hook families. We need to fix this. https://t.co/96uBe92wPi 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 15, 2016 
In September 1993 during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Hillary Clinton was asked by Senator Bill Bradley if she supported a 25% sales tax on handguns and automatic weapons. She was very clear in her support of taxing guns: 
“I’m all for that. I just don’t know what else we’re going to do to try to figure out how to get some handle on this violence,” said Clinton. “I’m speaking personally, but I feel very strongly about that.” 
In another email exchange dated January 14, 2016, Clinton wrote about using racial division to further her gun control agenda by selectively ignoring occurrences of gun violence that were not racially motivated. For this reason, according to the email, the Clinton campaign did not include the story of Jordan Davis in an essay on gun violence: 
This is great. My edits are attached. The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably – this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence. Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was NOT racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis. 
In another email from March 17, we see an exchange about how to attack Donald Trump and a press call with Arizona locals about gun control. When asked about an anti-gun op-ed article by the Clinton Campaign, Chairman John Podesta wrote that he fears blowback from Clinton’s supporters:

1140,Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?,"The Economic Collapse – by Michael Snyder 
Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails “did not come from her private server”, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the “emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry”, and according to some reports there may be “potentially thousands” of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Let’s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN … 
After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent” to the email probe. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote the chairmen. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton’s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton’s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered … 
We don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are… 
Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election. 
One thing is, it’s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her… 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason… 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be “fair” until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November… 
An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",0
1141,"As Donald Trump Incites Feuds, Other G.O.P. Candidates Flee His Shadow - The New York Times","After a disastrous week of feuds and plummeting poll numbers, Republican leaders have concluded that Donald J. Trump is a threat to the party’s fortunes and have begun discussing how soon their endangered candidates should explicitly distance themselves from the presidential nominee. For Republicans in close races, top strategists say, the issue is no longer in doubt. One House Republican has already started airing an ad vowing to stand up to Mr. Trump if he is elected president, and others are expected to press similar themes in the weeks ahead. In the world of Republican “super PACs,” strategists are going even farther: discussing advertisements that would treat Mr. Trump’s defeat as a given and urge voters to send Republicans to Congress as a check on a Hillary Clinton White House. The discussions were described by officials familiar with the deliberations, several of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential planning. For now, some of the party’s most vulnerable incumbents are simply hoping to avoid what they see as the taint of association with their  . Two members of Congress locked in competitive races made themselves scarce when Mr. Trump arrived in their states on Friday. The two, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Representative David Young of Iowa, held events elsewhere. Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, in a conference call with reporters the same day, was less subtle. “Donald Trump is in a category unto himself,” Mr. Toomey said, predicting that his state’s voters “will make a completely separate decision” between the top of the ticket and the Senate campaign this year. That is increasingly the hope of nearly every Republican leader across the country. Mr. Trump’s plunge in polls this week, along with his dual attacks on the family of a fallen American soldier and the leadership of his own party, has convinced veteran Republican strategists that most of their candidates must navigate around the presidential nominee. Plans for ads that distance congressional candidates from the top of the ticket have accelerated. “You will see them by early to   now,” even before the first debate on Sept. 26, predicted Scott Reed, the senior political strategist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. At a recent conference of Republican donors, Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, warned that even the party’s substantial majority in that chamber might be in jeopardy. “The conclusion has become that the guy is incorrigible,” said Thomas M. Davis III, a former House member from Virginia who is still close to many of the party’s leaders. “He’s going to leave our candidates with no choice but to go their own separate way. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but on Friday night he tried to calm angry Republicans by endorsing, belatedly, the   of Mr. Ryan and Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Mr. Trump had been feuding with them after they criticized his ridicule of the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq. Captain Khan’s parents had denounced Mr. Trump during the Democratic National Convention. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, had urged Mr. Trump to stand behind Mr. Ryan and the senators for the sake of party unity. Some leading Republicans have expressed hope that Mr. Trump can at least stabilize his campaign by Labor Day, when many voters begin paying attention to congressional races. But with such an erratic and belligerent candidate leading their ticket, many in the party have long seen a     strategy as inevitable. David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a group that advocates small government, said the organization was studying how to get Republican voters who may dislike Mr. Trump to turn out for the party’s   candidates. Mr. McIntosh said the Club for Growth intended to convince voters that they would need a “strong voice in the Senate and House,” regardless of their feelings about the presidential race. “You hope Trump does well so that the base Republican vote comes out and is strong,” Mr. McIntosh said. “But you also have to plan for if he doesn’t do well. ” At the moment, that seems likely. Mrs. Clinton opened a large lead last week in national polls, with a handful showing her leading by double digits. Perhaps more significantly, new surveys indicate that she has staked out leads in states Mr. Trump most likely needs to win the White House, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan, and that she is also close or edging ahead in   states such as Georgia, where at least one poll has her ahead. Mrs. Clinton’s advantage may ebb. The surveys were taken soon after the Democratic National Convention and during Mr. Trump’s   week. But Republicans are planning for the worst. Also under consideration is the possibility of a huge ad campaign to promote an agenda of conventional Republican positions, along the lines of economic proposals outlined by Mr. Ryan. The point of such a campaign, one strategist said, would be to provide voters with a different, nonthreatening view of Republicans, so that the party is not wholly defined by Mr. Trump’s    pronouncements. What stops Republicans from disavowing Mr. Trump en masse is that they fear alienating his voters, who may be crucial to the party’s efforts to retain its congressional majorities. In an era in which fewer voters split their tickets, it is important to Republican leaders that Mr. Trump at least run competitively with Mrs. Clinton to avert a   wipeout. “Do we run the risk of depressing our base by repudiating the guy, or do we run the risk of being tarred and feathered by independents for not repudiating him?” asked Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster working on many of this year’s races. “We’re damned if we do and damned if we don’t. ” Republicans currently have a precarious hold on the Senate Democrats would need just four more seats to gain control if Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency, giving the chamber’s tiebreaker vote to her running mate, Tim Kaine. Republicans enjoy a more substantial majority in the House, where Democrats must capture 30 more seats to take control. But Mr. Trump’s difficulties have become so acute that there is rising concern that Republicans could lose enough House seats to loosen Mr. Ryan’s grip and, in subsequent elections, threaten his majority. Speaking in private to a group of donors last week at a political conference in Colorado sponsored by the industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, Mr. Ryan expressed concerns that the House was increasingly at risk, according to a Republican who was present for the conversation. Mr. Ryan implored the donors not to assume that the House was impregnable and not to entirely focus their efforts on retaining the Senate. Among the party’s biggest contributors, there is a growing sense of alarm about defending control of Congress, now that Mr. Trump has proved resistant to correcting course in the general election. Republican donors had hoped that Mr. Trump would shed his practice, from the primary season, of seizing attention with incendiary remarks. Jay Bergman, an Illinois oil executive and major Republican donor, said Mr. Trump’s clash with the parents of a slain soldier had been a sharp reality check. Mr. Bergman said he had previously viewed Mr. Trump as a “loose cannon like a fox”  —   calculating his inflammatory comments to drive his message. That view was harder to sustain after Mr. Trump’s latest eruption, he said. With the presidential race looking so uncertain, Mr. Bergman said he was more focused on protecting the Senate. He said that donors at the   conference had received a bracing presentation about just how difficult the political map was for Republican senators. So far, Mr. Trump has faced disavowal from a modest array of congressional Republicans, nearly all of them dependent on the votes of moderate, suburban voters. In the past week, the campaign of Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado, who represents suburban Denver, began airing a television ad in which he pledges to stand up to Mr. Trump if he becomes president. Other Republicans are expected to follow suit as early as this month. But even that approach may be insufficient. House Republican officials were furious at Mr. Coffman for not being prepared to answer predictable   questions about whether he still supported Mr. Trump. Democrats responded with an advertisement showing photos of Mr. Coffman and Mr. Trump side by side and urging voters to reject them both. Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the chairman of the House Democratic campaign arm, said his party was aiming to ensure that Republicans would be tarnished by Mr. Trump, even if they distanced themselves from him. “A denouncement of Trump at this point is too little, too late,” Mr. Luján warned. There is precedent for Republicans to ease away from a presidential nominee who appears unable to win. Late in the 1996 campaign, the party ran television ads explicitly urging voters to elect a Republican Senate as a check on President Bill Clinton’s power, even as its challenger, Bob Dole, fought to overcome Mr. Clinton’s lead. Former Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who was the majority leader at the time, said such   measures had been necessary and effective  —   and may be once again. “There are a lot of people saying we want to save the majority in the House and defend the Senate,” Mr. Lott said. “What I would say is: Clinton may be president, and we’re certainly going to need the Senate. And by the way, if Trump is president, he’s certainly going to need the Senate, too. ”",0
1142,"Germany: Students Forced to Chant ‘Allahu Akbar,’ Punished for Refusing Trip to Mosque","From The Daily Express : 
PUPILS at a primary school were forced to chant “Allahu Akhbar” and “there is no God but Allah”, an appalled father has claimed. 
The father of the pupil at the girl’s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. 
He claimed she had been “forced” by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. 
The handout read: “Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.” 
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in “ethics” at the Bavarian school. 
What are they going to teach, the ethics of conquest and slavery? 
Here’s another story from yesterday in RT : 
Parents of a German teenager may face a trial and fine for “truancy” after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his “indoctrination” by Islamic radicals. 
The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. 
In a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teen’s father argued that his son would be “indoctrinated” in the mosque. He went on to say that “for years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.” 
A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of €300 ($328), referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy. 
— Alexandra Witt (@AlexiaStellar) October 23, 2016 
When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. 
The parents’ lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son’s “bodily safety.” 
Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that “nobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.” 
…School principal Renate Fritzsche … told NDR that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity. 
“We also have Muslim children with us and Muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions,” she said, adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for Muslim children as well. “It is not the responsibility of the parents to say: ‘My child will attend such or such class,’” Fritzsche asserted.

1145,Trump National Security Adviser Called Russian Envoy Day Before Sanctions Were Imposed - The New York Times,"■ The national security adviser appointed by   Donald J. Trump called a Russian envoy the day before sanctions were imposed on Russia for meddling in the election. ■ The “conscience of the House”  —   the civil rights hero John Lewis  —   does not believe Mr. Trump will be a legitimate president. Not a good start. ■ The great potty coverup on The Mall: does the   not want “Don’s Johns” visible on Inauguration Day? ■ And readers get a chance to say what they would ask Mr. Trump’s E. P. A. pick, Scott Pruitt. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who will be Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, spoke with Sergei I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, the day before President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for election hacking, to arrange a phone call between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Trump once he becomes president, a Trump spokesman said Friday. Mr. Flynn’s secret call did not violate the law, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said. But under the circumstances, it is bound to raise eyebrows. “The call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and the   after he was sworn in, and they exchanged logistical information,” Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s spokesman, told reporters on a conference call on Friday. “That was it, plain and simple. ” Several news organizations reported on Thursday on the calls between the two men. David Ignatius of The Washington Post suggested it could have violated the Logan Act, a    law that bars American citizens from negotiating without authorization with foreign governments that have a dispute with the United States. Mr. Spicer said General Flynn had initially reached out to Mr. Kislyak via text message on Christmas Day to wish him a happy holiday and to say that he looked forward to working with him in the coming administration. The ambassador sent a text back returning the sentiment, he added. The Russian envoy followed up on Dec. 28 with another text that asked if he could call General Flynn, and the two spoke, Mr. Spicer said. The call, which came the day before Mr. Obama announced penalties for Russia, including the expulsion from the United States of 35 Russian diplomats, never touched on the sanctions, Mr. Spicer said. It was bad enough that a new Gallup poll on Friday morning found that only 44 percent of Americans approve of the way Mr. Trump has handled his transition  —   compared with 83 percent who approved of President Obama’s transition and 61 percent who approved of George W. Bush’s. That followed a Quinnipiac University poll this week that put Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 37 percent. But now, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a hero of the civil rights movement, is flat out saying he doesn’t see Mr. Trump “as a legitimate president. ” Elected Democrats are not only boasting of skipping the inauguration but are pledging to join the massive protest march that will follow on Jan. 21. Needless to say, this is not a good way to start a presidency. They are calling it the potty   of the 2017 inauguration. The Associated Press reported on Friday that workers preparing the Capitol grounds and National Mall for the inauguration of Mr. Trump have altered the portable toilets being set up to accommodate attendees, apparently to spare the ego of the  . The toilets are provided by the equipment rental company Don’s Johns. But on Friday, a Capitol employee was photographed covering the company’s logo with blue masking tape, and later, dozens of the   appeared to have been altered that way. The company’s chief executive said he had no idea why his logo had been covered, telling the AP “we’re proud to have our name on the units. ” It appears, however, that a certain somebody else is not. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised that with his   skills, we’d be winning so much, we’d get tired of winning. Marillyn Hewson, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, which makes the   fighter jet, delivered the latest victory: the cost will come down, as Mr. Trump has demanded. After meeting with the   she told reporters at Trump Tower, “I’m glad I had the opportunity to tell him that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft, and moreover it’s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States. ” She added: This is a bit of corporate spin for the incoming commander in chief’s benefit. Shortly before the election in November, the Pentagon had imposed a price cut on the last group of   because Lockheed wouldn’t budge. Then the Defense Department began negotiating the price for the next lot, and Lockheed understood that if it tried to fight another price cut, the Pentagon would have imposed it again. Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma, who spent years suing the Environmental Protection Agency to thwart its regulations, especially those that combat climate change, will appear before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Wednesday for a hearing to confirm him as head of the agency. The hearing promises to be among the most contentious of all the confirmation grillings, so The New York Times is reaching out to readers: What should senators ask Mr. Pruitt? The election was more than two months ago, the Electoral College ballots have been certified and the inauguration is a week away, but the   has not gone beyond campaign mode when it comes to Hillary Clinton. After the decision by the Justice Department inspector general to investigate James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, over his actions in the final days of the campaign, Mr. Trump went on a tirade. The leap to “guilty as hell” was a big one. The investigation will center on why Mr. Comey sent a public letter to Congress in the last days of the campaign announcing that the F. B. I. was reopening the Clinton emails investigation after discovering other messages on the laptop of Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. Days later, Mr. Comey announced that the computer held no incriminating evidence. On Twitter on Friday morning, Mr. Trump again brought up the unsubstantiated, explosive dossier that a retired British intelligence agent compiled from information that he said Russia possesses. Mr. Trump likes to dismiss the “failing New York Times,” but he clearly reads it closely. The Times published a lengthy history of the dossier in question that traces it to Republican and Democratic operatives who helped bankroll it to stop Mr. Trump’s election. Left unsaid are the respectable credentials of the British spy, Christopher Steele, or the fact that he is now in hiding, fearing retribution. By now, Mr. Trump’s   concert has become a kind of reality show unto itself, marked by rumors of stars, leaks to the press, and occasional promises of an unforgettable show on the eve of the  ’s swearing in. The final details are in and the affair looks to be  —   well, you decide. The concert is actually two. The first portion of the evening, “Voices of the People,” will feature performances by small groups from across the country. Think more D. C. Fire Department Emerald Society Pipes and Drums and Webelos Troop 177 than Beyoncé. The   have been reserved for the second part, which will be televised across the country and feature remarks by Mr. Trump himself. This part of the evening, “Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration,” looks to be heavy on country music  —   Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood, and a group calling itself the Frontmen of Country  —   with some 1980s Broadway (Jennifer Holliday) rock (3 Doors Down) and a D. J. (RaviDrums) mixed in. Jon Voight, the    actor who narrated a video for Mr. Trump during the campaign, will serve as M. C. And a fireworks show by Grucci will close out the evening. And in case you were wondering, a news release announcing the details boasted that the show “is produced and directed by Emmy Award winners and nominees. ” That would include Mark Burnett, the acclaimed reality television producer who worked with Mr. Trump on “The Apprentice” and has helped plan the inaugural festivities. One of Mr. Trump’s most provocative and persistent antagonists, Cher, is leading a new boycott of the   that aims to hit him where he will most certainly feel it: his Nielsen ratings. Under the Twitter hashtag “TURNHIMOFF,” Cher began Thursday night circulating her plea for people who oppose Mr. Trump to turn off their televisions when his inaugural festivities begin next Friday. “Ratings are what he understands,” the singer and actress said in a phone interview. Cher’s Twitter feed became one of the most animated and popular sources of   sentiment during the election. And the ferocity that she  —   a    megacelebrity with nearly 3. 2 million Twitter followers  —   used to go after Mr. Trump seemed to perfectly capture what a surreal turn American politics took in 2016. Senior national security officials for President Obama are hosting their counterparts on   Trump’s team on Friday for a   exercise at the White House intended to practice the response to a major domestic or international emergency. The session, similar to one that George W. Bush’s staff held in the restricted Situation Room for Mr. Obama’s team just days before he was inaugurated in 2009, aims to familiarize the incoming president’s team with the protocols and practices the federal government uses in a crisis. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said it would simulate what happens during “major domestic incidents,” including natural disasters. In the exercise in 2009, top Bush administration officials walked Mr. Obama’s aides through what would happen in the event of an attack involving a series of explosions detonating in a number of American cities simultaneously. Maybe the new White House will conclude what “WarGames,” that 1980s movie, said about fighting a nuclear war: “The only winning move is not to play. ” Mr. Trump’s foray onto social media Friday morning wasn’t all anger and spittle. He praised his cabinet picks’ performances before the Senate  —   which have gone well, on the whole  —   and the progress Congress is making toward gutting the Affordable Care Act. And: The House is likely to give final approval on Friday to parliamentary language that would allow Congress to eviscerate President Obama’s signature domestic achievement with a simple Senate majority this spring, and without fear of a Democratic filibuster. What comes next is uncertain, and of grave concern to the 20 million Americans now covered by the health law and the millions more protected by its prohibitions on discrimination for   medical conditions and lifetime coverage caps. From the department of mixed messages: The House speaker said on Thursday that the United States would not send out a large force to remove thousands of unauthorized immigrants any time soon. “It’s not happening,” Mr. Ryan said during a CNN town   meeting in Washington, where a woman whose parents brought her to the United States at age 11  —   a category of people often referred to as “dreamers”  —   asked him, “Do you think that I should be deported?” Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Trump’s promise of a deportation force would not come to fruition. “I can see that you love your daughter and you’re a nice person who has a great future ahead of you,” he said, “and I hope your future’s here. ” When the moderator, Jake Tapper, reminded Mr. Ryan of the  ’s campaign promise to create a “deportation force,” Mr. Ryan said, “I know, I know. ” He continued, “But I’m here to tell you, in Congress, it’s not happening. ” Mr. Ryan has long supported an immigration plan that would mix new border security measures with protections for some unauthorized immigrants, but he has had little luck getting other Republican members of the House to join him.",0

The Democratic operatives exposed by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas claimed in a hidden camera video that they were also behind the video of the 47% comment that cost Mitt Romney the election — not a random bartender as previously believed.

— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 27, 2016 

At a private fundraiser in 2012, Romney made the mistake of stating that 47% of Americans are freeloaders — which was reported to have been caught on camera by a random bartender who was working the event. 
“There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it,” Romeny had stated. “That that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.” 
In the newly released Veritas footage however, Scott Foval, the former field director of Americans United for Change, admits that they were actually behind the video which was released by David Corn of Mother Jones.

Foval explains that his group has been doing “insertions” to interrupt fundraisers and rallies as far back as 2000 and 2004, against George W. Bush — and that they were responsible for the one that ended Romney’s campaign. 
“They do it all over the country, yeah. And then I don’t know if you remember, well from, they are the ones who negotiated to get that lawyer in Florida who recorded the 47% video,” Foval states. 
“Wait, I thought that was a bartender,” the undercover reporter asks. 
“It was actually a lawyer at the event,” Foval explains. “It was not a bartender.” 
“The lawyer took his phone and had the bartender walk around with it and set it up,” Foval continues. “It was a whole coordinated operation to get the phone in because they had taken away all the cell phones from all the staff and so what they did was they set it up in the room.” 
Foval continued to explain that the organization has a team of approximately 25 people who conduct these operations. 
In previous video releases from Veritas, Foval reveals how his organization had been working to incite violence at Trump rallies, using a tactic called “bird-dogging.” 
The hidden camera videos have also revealed their step-by-step voter fraud strategy. 
Earlier in the day, the organization released their fourth undercover video, where Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners claimed that he was on daily calls with the Clinton campaign, and accepts a potentially-illegal foreign donation. 
“The more money that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get,” Project Veritas said in their release . 
O’Keefe has filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission against both Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee based upon the shocking revelations that his team has uncovered. 
During a rally in Gettysburg on Saturday, Trump promised that he would also be suing the DNC for inciting violence at his rallies, based on what he saw in the Project Veritas videos.

1147,"Laid-Off Americans, Required to Zip Lips on Way Out, Grow Bolder - The New York Times","LIBERTYVILLE, Ill.  —   American corporations are under new scrutiny from federal lawmakers after   episodes in which the companies laid off American workers and gave the jobs to foreigners on temporary visas. But while corporate executives have been outspoken in defending their labor practices before Congress and the public, the American workers who lost jobs to global outsourcing companies have been largely silent. Until recently. Now some of the workers who were displaced are starting to speak out, despite severance agreements prohibiting them from criticizing their former employers. Marco Peña was among about 150 technology workers who were laid off in April by Abbott Laboratories, a global health care conglomerate with headquarters here. They handed in their badges and computer passwords, and turned over their work to a company based in India. But Mr. Peña, who had worked at Abbott for 12 years, said he had decided not to sign the agreement that was given to all departing employees, which included a nondisparagement clause. Mr. Peña said his choice cost him at least $10, 000 in severance pay. But on an April evening after he walked out of Abbott’s   campus here for the last time, he spent a few hours in a local bar at a gathering organized by technology worker advocates, speaking his mind about a job he had loved and lost. “I just didn’t feel right about signing,” Mr. Peña said. “The clauses were pretty blanket. I felt like they were eroding my rights. ” Leading members of Congress from both major parties have questioned the nondisparagement agreements, which are commonly used by corporations but can prohibit ousted workers from raising complaints about what they see as a misuse of temporary visas. Lawmakers, including Richard Durbin of Illinois, the    Senate Democrat, and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, have proposed revisions to visa laws to include measures allowing former employees to contest their layoffs. “I have heard from workers who are fearful of retaliation,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “They are told they can say whatever they want, except they can’t say anything negative about being fired. ” Lawyers said the paragraph Mr. Peña and other workers object to in their separation agreements is routine in final contracts with employees who are paid severance as they leave, whether they were laid off or resigned voluntarily. “It’s a very, very common practice,” said Sheena R. Hamilton, an employment lawyer at Dowd Bennett in St. Louis who represents companies in workplace cases. “I’ve never recommended a settlement that didn’t have a clause like that. ” But former Abbott employees said the provisions had stopped them from speaking openly with elected officials or appearing at congressional hearings. “It is very frustrating that you can’t share your story with the public,” said one former Abbott manager, who had worked for the company for 13 years, rising to an important supervisory position. He had prepared a   manual for his foreign replacements showing how to perform every detail of his work. With a disabled child who requires medical care, he said he had to take his severance and its nondisparagement clause, since it extended his medical benefits. So he asked to remain anonymous. “I’ve been laid off before, I can understand that,” he said. “But these visas were meant to fill in gaps for resources that are hard to find. This time the company actually asked me to transfer my knowledge to somebody else. That changes the equation. ” According to federal rules, temporary visas known as   are for foreigners with “a body of specialized knowledge” not readily available in the labor market. The visas should be granted only when they will not undercut the wages or “adversely affect the working conditions” of Americans. But in the past five years, through loopholes in the rules, tens of thousands of American workers have been replaced by foreigners on   and other temporary visas, according to Prof. Hal Salzman, a labor force expert at Rutgers University. In March, two Americans who had been laid off in 2014 by a New England power company, Eversource Energy, spoke at a news conference in Hartford even though they had signed nondisparagement agreements. Craig Diangelo, 63, and Judy Konopka, 56, said most of the 220 people facing dismissal had been required as part of their severance to train Indian immigrants with   and other visas. In a protest, departing employees posted American flags outside their cubicles. As they left, they took the flags down. Mr. Diangelo took a photograph of the flags in his final days at the utility. At the time, he and Ms. Konopka spoke with reporters, including from The New York Times, but they did not want to be quoted, even without their names. In January, Senator Blumenthal spotted the photograph in an article in Computerworld, a tech industry publication, and was dismayed to learn of the layoffs so long after they happened. In a letter to the company, the senator questioned whether the dismissals were “accomplished through apparent abuses” of visas, and he demanded assurances that former employees would not be sued if they spoke with government officials. In a forceful reply, the Eversource general counsel, Gregory B. Butler, said the company had not violated any laws, and its nondisparagement provisions were a “standard form release” that did not restrict former employees from discussing their layoffs “with you or anyone else. ” Mr. Diangelo said he was not so sure the company would refrain from legal action if he spoke to the news media. But, he said, “I finally got to the point where I am tired of hiding in the shadows. ” Two years later, his work with a local tech contracting company pays $45, 000 a year less than his Eversource salary. Many of his former   are also struggling, Mr. Diangelo said, but stay quiet to avoid provoking the company. At Abbott, executives announced in February that technology jobs would be taken over by the Indian company Wipro. Senator Durbin, who is from Illinois, criticized the layoffs and said Abbott’s nondisparagement clause was “overly broad. ” According to a copy of the agreement, that clause read, in part: “You agree to make every effort to maintain and protect the reputation of Abbott and its products and agents. ” A spokesman for Abbott, Scott Stoffel, said the changes were part of its efforts to “remain globally competitive and a strong U. S. employer. ” He said the company would retain “the vast majority” of its tech jobs in the United States. Nondisparagement clauses like Abbott’s are “very common” in severance agreements, he said. Mr. Peña said he could afford to turn down his severance payment because he is single and has no children. “I was the only one with the ability to put my foot down,” he said. He received consistently positive work reviews, and a merit raise weeks before his layoff, he said. With no indication that poor performance was a factor, he believed it was a measure to cut costs. “Anything that had to deal with technology and resolving problems, that was my satisfaction, my passion,” Mr. Peña said. “But these days that has no bearing on the decision making of the executives in the higher positions. ” Abbott tried to reduce the role of foreigners in the layoffs. Only about 20 percent of the workers brought in by Wipro would be foreigners on   visas, Mr. Stoffel said, while the rest would be American workers. Mr. Peña said he had been told at first that he would train his Wipro replacements. But after Senator Durbin’s rebuke, Wipro workers were trained only by employees who would be remaining with Abbott, he said. He and 13 other former Abbott employees filed federal claims saying they faced discrimination because of their ages and American citizenship, said Sara Blackwell, a lawyer representing them. Those claims are confidential. Ms. Blackwell organized the tavern meeting where Abbott workers were invited to mourn their jobs. Of the small group that came, only Mr. Peña spoke up. On April 20, about two dozen employees of EmblemHealth, a health insurer, protested outside its offices in Manhattan after the company announced that it would transfer about 200 tech jobs to Cognizant, another technology outsourcing company. Even though they were in the street holding signs, the employees declined to have their names used in news reports.",0
1148,Gay man finds it in himself to tolerate religious person,"Gay man finds it in himself to tolerate religious person 01-11-16 A GAY man has met a Christian who appears civilised and could even be described as nice. Tom Booker met church-goer Wayne Hayes when he started working in his office, and has expressed his surprise that he ‘really couldn’t tell’. Booker said: “We often end up in the kitchen at the same time to make a cup of tea, so we started exchanging pleasantries and worked up to longer conversations. “He was always nice enough and talked about his family and allotment and stuff, so I presumed he was just a normal person. However, a few weeks later he mentioned something about believing in God. “I was really shocked, but he seemed very cool about it. I asked if he thought it was just a phase and he said no, he’d been feeling this way since he was about nine. “I wanted to ask him what Christians actually do in church, but I got worried that he might think I’m secretly into it and try to recruit me. He hasn’t mentioned it since. “It’s almost as if it’s a perfectly acceptable way to live your life, which has really given me pause for thought. “Just because you expect someone to be a massively judgemental dickhead, it doesn’t mean they will be.”

1149,Williams Sisters Could Be in Step for Semifinal Showdown at U.S. Open - The New York Times,"If the Williams sisters are to face off in Arthur Ashe Stadium once again, it will be in the semifinals. In their long and storied careers, Serena and Venus Williams have played each other at the United States Open in the fourth round, the quarterfinals (twice) and the final (twice) but never in the tournament’s penultimate round.   Serena Williams, a   United States Open champion who is hoping to pass Steffi Graf’s Open era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, was dealt a challenging path in Friday’s draw for the United States Open, which is set to begin Monday. She faces the 2014 semifinalist Ekaterina Makarova in the first round, then may meet the former No. 1 Ana Ivanovic in the third round, and the current No. 5 Simona Halep in the quarterfinals. Venus Williams, who at No. 6 has her highest ranking in more than five years, landed in the quarter of the draw with No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska. Williams, 36, reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last month and won a silver medal in mixed doubles at the Rio Olympics. The surprise singles gold medalist Mónica Puig of Puerto Rico gained a   seeding, at No. 32, when Sloane Stephens withdrew Friday morning. In the third round, she could meet No. 3 Garbiñe Muguruza, whom she thrashed,     at the Olympics. No. 8 Madison Keys and No. 28 CoCo Vandeweghe are also in Muguruza’s quarter, and they could face each other in the third round. Roberta Vinci, last year’s surprise finalist, is in the bottom quarter with No. 2 Angelique Kerber, who could overtake Serena Williams for the No. 1 ranking if Williams fails to reach the semifinals. Petra Kvitova, a   Wimbledon champion, could face Kerber in the fourth round. Novak Djokovic, the men’s top seed and defending champion, has a difficult draw of his own, along with a left wrist injury he has been struggling with since the Olympics. He will open against Jerzy Janowicz, a 2013 Wimbledon semifinalist with a booming serve. Djokovic could face another big server, No. 20 John Isner, in the fourth round, and has a possible quarterfinal matchup against   Marin Cilic, the recent Cincinnati champion and 2014 United States Open winner. No. 4 Rafael Nadal and No. 5 Milos Raonic loom as possible semifinal opponents. Two of the most promising American teenagers were placed in Djokovic’s quarter, pitted against more established countrymen. Taylor Fritz, 18, will face No. 26 Jack Sock, whom he lost to in five tumultuous sets in the first round of the Australian Open. Frances Tiafoe, 18, opens against Isner. No. 14 Nick Kyrgios could face another young Australian, No. 17 Bernard Tomic, in the third round, and possibly Stan Wawrinka, whom Kyrgios had a   with at a tournament last year, in the fourth round. Wawrinka, who has supplanted the injured Roger Federer at No. 3, has his own early hurdle in the first round against Fernando Verdasco, who upset Nadal in the first round of this year’s Australian Open. The standout in Wawrinka’s quarter, however, is Juan Martín del Potro, who needed a wild card to enter the main draw despite his resurgent form and a silver medal in Rio. Del Potro could face the   American man, Steve Johnson, in the second round. Andy Murray, the Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medalist, has No. 6 Kei Nishikori as the highest seed in his quarter. While the bracket is set for the 254 main draw matches, there have already been 224 qualifying matches. The most improbable qualifier is   Christian Harrison, 22, a   American junior who has missed years with myriad injuries and surgeries. He defeated Steven Diez of Canada,       to reach his first Grand Slam main draw. He joins his older brother, Ryan, who also reached the main draw through qualifying. As Christian walked off the court, he was handed a cellphone. Ryan, who was in the midst of playing a World TeamTennis final in Forest Hills, was on the line. “Love you, dude,” Christian said. CiCi Bellis, who was a fan favorite at the 2014 United States Open when she advanced to the second round as a    made the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time since, with a     (5)   victory over Alison Van Uytvanck on Friday.",0
1150,Art Underground: A First Look at the Second Avenue Subway - The New York Times,"When a city has been waiting for a badly needed new subway line since 1929, public art is probably far down the list of expectations, well behind accommodations like a) working trains, b) lights and c) some means of entrance and egress. But when commuters descend into the new Second Avenue subway’s four stations, at 96th, 86th, 72nd and 63rd Streets, now set for a New Year’s Day opening  —   or perhaps a little later if things don’t go as planned  —   they will find one of the most ambitious contemporary art projects that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has ever undertaken. The agency’s art department, M. T. A. Arts  Design, founded and first funded in 1985, is rarely  —   in a salmagundi system 112 years old  —   presented with a   blank canvas. But lately, with the opening of the superstation at Fulton Street downtown and the extension of the No. 7 line to a new terminus on West 34th Street, the subway’s art thinkers have been able to participate almost from the beginning in incorporating installations in tile work by leading artists into stations’ designs. If the effort doesn’t always result in stations that look like artworks themselves, as some of the best stations in Europe and Asia do, it has nonetheless put the aesthetic front and center again in a way that evokes the ambition of the city’s first subway stations in 1904, with their mosaics, faience and   skylights. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has taken an unusually personal role in the Second Avenue subway’s final push toward opening, casts the art in historical terms, as a clarion call for government to once again be a builder of inspiring public amenities and infrastructure. “At some point government adopted an attitude that its job was to build things that were functional but unattractive and unappealing,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement to The New York Times. “But that’s not how it has always been, and it’s not how it should be. With every public works project, I believe there is an opportunity to elevate the everyday, to build a public space where community can gather and where culture and shared civic values are celebrated. ” At a news conference on Monday at the Museum of Modern Art, he recalled an era of infrastructure development under Nelson A. Rockefeller and Robert Moses. “This is just the beginning of a new period of rebirth,” he said. What follows is the first subterranean tour by a reporter of the new subway’s art, created at a cost to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of $4. 5 million, out of an overall budget of $4. 45 billion. Four artists were chosen beginning in 2009, from a pool of more than 300   applicants, to treat the stations as their very own and make them into individual installations. Sarah Sze, who represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 2013 and who draws from the great   tradition of recycling that stretches from Kurt Schwitters through Robert Rauschenberg and Isa Genzken, decided to use the   porcelain tiles that cover the walls throughout the new stations, rather than mosaic. For “Blueprint for a Landscape,” accomplished with the help of tile masters in Spain who applied color and line to the plain porcelain, she transformed the station into what looks like a   immersive drawing that unfolds down the escalators and through the concourse. Fragmented images of scaffolding, birds, chairs and leaves, digitally collaged, seem as if caught in a great whoosh caused by a hurtling train. And on the concourse, in a nod to Katsushika Hokusai’s   depiction of travelers battling a gust, Ms. Sze (pronounced Zee) has used blue and white in an almost minimalist fashion to adorn the walls with images of blowing paper  —   dense at the station’s north end and sparser moving south, as a directional aid. “I wanted to use tile as if it were one large piece of paper,” Ms. Sze said. In a sense, she said, her piece is about “the   pace we’re all moving at now,” but her imagery pushes back poetically against the overload. “There’s a lot of information,” she said of her installation, “but it has a kind of rhythm to it that you can navigate. ” The participation of the renowned painter and photographer Chuck Close in the new stations was a kind of coup, widely reported when he was chosen in 2012. He has created 12   (almost nine feet high) densely intricate mosaic portraits that play at least two roles. One is as a poignant rendezvous of some of the New York artists who have formed Mr. Close’s wide circle  —   Philip Glass, in a   image of a   young composer, who will watch protectively over commuters as they descend an escalator Lou Reed and Cindy Sherman, along with the painter Cecily Brown, the artist Kara Walker (above) and the painter Alex Katz, who is going strong at 89. The second effect, complemented by the inclusion of younger subjects, including the artists Zhang Huan, Sienna Shields and Pozsi B. Kolor, is a collective portrait of a proudly polyglot city and subway ridership. Mr. Close has placed two   (one seen above) in the station the squiggly individual tiles that make up the hairs of his gray beard are alone worth missing a train to inspect at close range. “The richness of the city is all the various cultures coming together,” Mr. Close said when he began conceiving the suite of portraits, “and the richness of my art will be to simultaneously let people in on how many ways there are to build an image. ” Vik Muniz, the Brazilian artist, has worked between New York and Rio de Janeiro his entire career and said he has “known the subway sometimes better than I wanted to. ” He has become highly regarded for pieces based on materials antithetical to permanence and, seemingly, to seriousness: chocolate, spaghetti sauce, thread, trash. “Perfect Strangers,” a series of three dozen   portraits that seem to be waiting for a train along the concourse and entrances to the station, is based on staged photographs of people Mr. Muniz knows, many of them playing slightly   characters he cooked up, like a   police officer holding a Popsicle. “I wanted them to be normal people,” he said. “I know lots of normal people. I kept thinking: Who would make the perfect stranger?” Of course, some of the subjects don’t quite qualify as normal or strangers, because they’re well known: the restaurateur Daniel Boulud, holding a bag with a fish tail sticking out the designer, actor and    Waris Ahluwalia. Mr. Muniz himself makes an appearance, in a   scene of him tripping, spilling papers from his briefcase. And he convinced his    son, Gaspar, to dress up in a tiger suit, like a Times Square mascot on lunch break. “In the subway you really don’t end up remembering anything but the people,” Mr. Muniz said. “You remember the characters, and you make up stories about them. ” Jean Shin, perhaps the least known of the artists chosen, often makes pieces from castoff objects that she accumulates and puts together until they achieve a kind of melancholy monumentality and civic weight. For her installation, “Elevated,” she dived into the past  —   specifically the past that was supposed to bequeath New York the Second Avenue subway generations ago, and that led her to the idea of illustrating the demolition of the Second Avenue and Third Avenue elevated lines in the 1940s and 1950s. She dug through archives at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn and at the   Historical Society and used photographs she found to create what feel like deeply resonant   dioramas in mosaic and glass, based on images of everyday riders and pedestrians from the 1920s through the 1940s, along with geometric shots of elevated girders being dismantled. “We’re such a youth culture,” said Ms. Shin, who works in New York. “I think it’s nice to have people of the past among us. ” She added: “I was also imagining New Yorkers way back then feeling, ‘Hey, we’re finally going to get the Second Avenue subway! ’”",0
1151,Michael Moore Owes Me $4.99,"  28, 2016 | Reviews   Michael Moore in New York City's Union Square Barnes & Noble to discuss his book Here Comes Trouble , September 13, 2011 ( David Shankbone / CC BY 3.0 ) Michael Moore’s “Trumpland” is a textbook illustration of how the mindset of voting for “the lesser evil” just results in self-delusion—and ever more evil. 
M ichael Moore has made some terrific movies in the past, and Where to Invade Next may be the best of them, but I expected Trumpland to be (1) about Trump, (2) funny, (3) honest, (4) at least relatively free of jokes glorifying mass murder. I was wrong on all counts and would like my $4.99 back, Michael. 
Moore’s new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton is—except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and he’s dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. 
This film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the “Elect her and then hold her accountable” stuff. He says we have a responsibility to “support her” and “get behind her,” and that if after two years—yes, TWO YEARS—she hasn’t lived up to a platform he’s fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). 
Moore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars you’ve put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon which Hillary Clinton reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictions—the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. 
Standing before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that “coziness” consists of, and he claims that she’s more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. 
What? It wasn’t one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. It’s all the other wars before and since. She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. She is eager to antagonize Russia. She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. She supported President Bill Clinton’s wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a “No Fly” zone. She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. 
That’s just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? 
Moore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. “I hope she did,” screams Moore. “That’s who I want as Commander in Chief!” Hee hee hee. 
Then Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least “universal” healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clinton’s focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that it’s the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didn’t create “universal” healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. 
Moore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clinton’s progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. 
Mostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates “that glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass.” Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Moore’s inclusive comments throughout his performance: “We’re all Americans, right?” 
Moore’s fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the government—executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). 
But when he runs for president, Moore says, he’ll give everybody free drugs. 
I’ll tell you the Clinton ad I’d like to see. She’s standing over a stove holding an egg. “This is your brain,” she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. “This is your brain on partisanship.”

1153,N.C. Trooper Investigated in Fatal Shooting of Deaf Motorist - The New York Times,"The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is conducting a criminal inquiry into the fatal shooting of a deaf motorist by a state trooper last week. The death has raised questions about the use of deadly force by police officers and about how they interact with the disabled. The motorist, Daniel K. Harris, 29, was shot and killed by the trooper, Jermaine Saunders, just after 6 p. m. last Thursday after Mr. Harris failed to pull over during a traffic stop near Charlotte, Sgt. Michael Baker, a spokesman for the state’s highway patrol, said in a statement. “After a brief pursuit,” Sergeant Baker said, “the driver exited his vehicle, and an encounter took place between the driver and the trooper, causing a shot to be fired. The driver succumbed to his injuries at the scene. ” The authorities declined to provide any further information about the nature of the encounter between Mr. Harris, who was white, and Trooper Saunders, who is black, or to say whether the trooper believed his life was in danger before he opened fire. Investigators have not commented on what role Mr. Harris’s disability may have played, but his brother said he believed his death was the product of a police department that does not know how to interact with those who are deaf or hard of hearing. “Being shot by the police is just not acceptable,” the victim’s brother, Sam Harris, who is also deaf, said through an interpreter during a video interview with Reuters. “If the officer had known that he was deaf, it would have ended differently, and he would still be around with family, and life would be going on. He’d be happy. ” But on Tuesday, Frank L. Perry, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, urged the public to “refrain from making assumptions or drawing conclusions prior to the internal and independent reviews. ” “Any loss of life regardless of the circumstances is truly a tragic and sad event for all involved,” he said in a statement. “While the Highway Patrol, the State Bureau of Investigation and the district attorney’s office conduct their respective reviews, we are keeping all those affected by this tragedy in our thoughts and prayers. ” Jay Ruderman, the president of the Ruderman Family Foundation, which works for the rights of people with disabilities, said police departments needed to train officers to respond to the needs of the disabled. “People with disabilities will be safer the more the police are properly trained in this regard, and it needs to happen now before more tragedies occur,” Mr. Ruderman said in a statement. “Whether a person is deaf, autistic or has a chronic health problem, these disabilities are often not understood by police officers when encountering them on the streets. ” Investigators from the bureau of investigation interviewed Trooper Saunders on Tuesday night and planned to meet with Mecklenburg County’s district attorney, R. Andrew Murray, in the coming days, said Shannon O’Toole, a spokesman for the bureau. He said Trooper Saunders had been placed on administrative leave. The agency investigates 90 to 95 percent of the   shootings in the state, Mr. O’Toole said, and when it “is requested to conduct an   shooting investigation, we do so, with the intent that each and every case is going to trial. ” The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that since 2008 Mr. Harris had been charged with traffic offenses and other misdemeanors, including petty theft, in Connecticut, Florida and Colorado. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to speeding in Florida and also pleaded guilty to interfering with or resisting the police in Connecticut, The A. P. said.",0
1154,Families and Fellow Officers Honor Victims of Dallas Sniper - The New York Times,"DALLAS  —   From a young age, Brent Thompson pushed the bounds of life so hard that he almost always found a way to get hurt. There was that time as a youngster when he nearly broke his neck playing in a hammock. Or when he wrecked his brother’s Mustang after begging him for the keys. Or the time he broke his arm during motorcycle training for the Police Department. It was his fearlessness and desire to serve his country that led Mr. Thompson to join the Marines and, after returning from deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq, to become a police officer, his longtime pastor, Rick Lamb, said Wednesday. So it came as no surprise to people close to Mr. Thompson, 43, that when gunfire started ringing out during a protest here last Thursday, he was one of the officers running toward the shooting. This time, however, Mr. Thompson suffered the ultimate injury. He and four other officers were killed when a black Army veteran upset over killings by the police across the country opened fire, targeting white officers, the authorities said. The grim process of moving forward from one of America’s deadliest mass shootings of police officers began on Wednesday when Mr. Thompson, who worked for the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police, and Sr. Cpl. Lorne Ahrens of the Dallas Police Department were given their final   during funerals that were by turns emotional and quippy. A private service was held Wednesday for another Dallas officer, Sgt. Michael J. Smith, and a public memorial is planned on Thursday. Services for the fourth victim, Officer Michael Krol, will be Friday, and the funeral for the fifth victim, Officer Patrick Zamarripa, will be Saturday. Even as mourners, including hundreds of officers who came here from across the country, took tentative steps forward, they acknowledged the cathartic backdrop against which Wednesday’s services took place: in a country rived by a debate over race and policing, upended by vast protests and nationwide soul searching. “Though I’m heartbroken and hurt, I’m going to put on my badge and my uniform and return to the street along with all of my brothers and sisters in blue,” Mr. Thompson’s wife, Emily, who is also a police officer, said with a shaky but steely voice. “To the coward that tried to break me and my brothers and sisters, know your hate made us stronger. ” The couple had married about two weeks before the shooting. Only about 12 hours before Mr. Thompson was shot, his wife had filed their marriage license with government authorities, Mr. Lamb said. About 8:15 that night, the couple spoke on the phone. “My shift’s over in 45 minutes, and then I’ll be home,” Mr. Thompson told his wife, according to Mr. Lamb. “He told her he loved her, and that’s the last time that he ever spoke to her. ” Mr. Thompson leaves behind six children from a previous marriage. He was a music enthusiast who occasionally played guitar and would send his children songs with his cellphone to see if they could recognize the tune. The funeral reflected the nuances of the conversation on race and policing that has enveloped the country. The service was held in the Potter’s House, the West Dallas megachurch where T. D. Jakes is the pastor. A noticeably diverse cast of officers filled the seats. Among them was Emily Thompson’s patrol partner, a black man, who stood next to her as she read her words of remembrance about her husband. As Brenda Lee, who is black and works for the Transit Police, sang “I Can Only Imagine,” her voice resonated with a gospel flair. Several people stood, some raising their arms in worship, when she hit the long notes. And among the final speakers was the chief of the Transit Police, James D. Spiller, who is black. It was a diverse showing in remembrance of a white man from a small town 55 miles south of Dallas. “Brent respected and loved all people, regardless of what color they were, where they came from,” Mr. Lamb said. But the reality was that Wednesday’s services were taking place beneath a cloud of national racial tension, and about 30 miles away from Mr. Thompson’s funeral, F. B. I. agents in camouflage and tactical gear were providing security outside Mr. Ahrens’s service in Plano. Friends and colleagues of Mr. Ahrens, 48, recalled his seemingly quixotic journey from his native Los Angeles to Dallas. He drove here with nothing but his dog and a few possessions stuffed into his Toyota. He slept on the floor of his apartment early in his police training because he had no bed. When a woman named Katrina first approached him, he was too shy to speak. She later became his wife, and they went on to have two children. “Your dad was doing what he was supposed to do,” the Rev. Rick Owen, senior pastor of Mr. Ahrens’s church, Pathway Church in Burleson, Tex. told the fallen officer’s    daughter and    son during the service. The Dallas mayor and police chief sat in attendance as Mr. Ahrens was remembered as a lover of guns and heavy metal music who did not know his own strength. He once bent a police car door on accident during training. “When you were on the radio screaming for help, you could count on Lorne to be the first to be there,” Sr. Cpl. Debbie Taylor said. The funerals drew officers from places as   as South Carolina and Indiana. “At times like this, we feel like we stand alone,” said Rick Keys, a lieutenant with the North Charleston, S. C. Police Department, who drove 15 hours with three of his colleagues to attend Mr. Thompson’s funeral. “It means a lot to the families to see the officers come from so far. ” Robert Parker, the assistant chief of police in Watauga, a city about 30 miles west of Dallas, said he hoped that this could be an opportunity for police departments and the communities they serve to come together. “We have a long way to go before we get where we need to be,” he said after Mr. Thompson’s funeral. “One of the things that I’ve talked to my wife about, and many others, is everybody on all sides of this, whether it’s Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, everyone needs to sit back and gain all the truth and the facts of each case before they pass judgment. If we do that and then we have an open dialogue and sit down and look at each other’s points of view, maybe we can go through this without further violence. ” After Mr. Thompson’s funeral, hundreds of officers lined up outside, saluting his coffin as an honor guard fired off a gun salute. The department then did what is known as a last call. A radio dispatcher, over a loudspeaker, called for Mr. Thompson, by his name and badge number, three times. When he did not answer, she said a final goodbye. “We will miss you, Brent,” she said. “You will never be forgotten. ”",0
1155,Exclusive — Sarah Palin on Paul Ryan’s ‘RINO-Care’: ‘Socialized Medicine’ President Trump Will ‘Step In and Fix It’,"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and the first major GOP figure to endorse President Donald Trump, is calling out House Speaker Paul Ryan for what she says is “ . ”[Ryan introduced what he calls the “American Health Care Act,” a bill that does not repeal Obamacare but only amends it. For the last several days, senior Republicans ranging from members of the House Freedom Caucus to other House Republicans to Sens. Tom Cotton ( ) Rand Paul ( ) Mike Lee ( ) and more have raised serious concerns with the bill. Some call it Obamacare 2. 0, others call it Obamacare Lite or   and now Palin —  in her first interview on the topic, coming on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend —  calls it “ . ”  “I do want to speak about this, but I am tempted to say not another word from our fearless leaders about this new form of Obamacare that I’m going to call   —  not another word from them until we are definitively told that there is no provision whatsoever allowing Congress to exempt itself whatsoever with this law,” Palin said. “As with anything else mandated by Congress, every single dotted I and crossed T better apply to them, too, and not just the people who they are lording this thing over because remember this is   health care, the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable, unsustainable, unwanted, unconstitutional continuation of   medicine, and even in this new   proposal, there is still an aspect of socialism. That’s the whole premise here. ” Palin expressed serious concern with the fact that Ryan’s healthcare bill does not eliminate Obamacare’s individual mandate. It just shifts the mandate —  which requires all Americans to purchase a health insurance plan even if they do not want one. Under Obamacare, those who do not comply, pay a tax to the federal government. Under Ryan’s plan, those who not comply, pay a fee to the insurance companies. “This 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector, which will mean politicians are allowed again to pick the winners and losers, and it makes you wonder who’s lobbying hardest for aspects of this new bill because obviously there are special interests involved. Otherwise, certain private sector segments of our economy wouldn’t be rewarded as they will be with this fee, instead of going to the IRS going to private companies,” Palin said. “It would be really helpful if every single one of these politicians would do like the NASCAR drivers do —  and it’s been said before —  but let them wear their sponsors plastered all over their   suits when they show up so we know what side they’re on and who they’re actually doing their bidding for. ” At this time, House GOP leadership officials are refusing to answer which lobbyists specifically were involved in writing the bill and which lobbyists wrote which parts of the legislation. Palin told Breitbart News that it’s a “great question” for leadership officials that they should answer because the public deserves to know. “That’s a great question. That’s a great question,” Palin said when informed of the fact that House GOP leaders have refused to answer which lobbyists were involved in writing the legislation. “The people want to know with this   we know that it helps Big pharma and big lobbyists who need big government to stay in business. We want to and have the right to know who’s actually putting pen to paper and writing this because we know the politicians don’t write the laws. ” Palin also praised Cotton and Paul and Rep. Dave Brat ( ) among others, who are standing up and pushing back on this rush from leadership on this bill. She says that they are “right” in pushing to make sure the process is not rushed in the way that Ryan has been rushing it through the House so far. In fact, this past week, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees stayed in session all night to ram the bill down to the next stages, rather than taking input from the American people and slowly deliberating the process of healthcare reform. “Cotton is right. Dr. Rand Paul is right. Dave Brat is right. Some of these public servants are right in saying, ‘Let’s do it right this time’ because, remember, the rush job under Obamacare gave us what we’re having to deal with today, which is the devastating system that is again lorded over us,” Palin said. “They passed it with their   process of theirs. It’s very important that the people are allowed to see what’s in the bill before its first draft so we know what their thinking is, so we know what the difference is between Obamacare and  . ” “But we can’t lose sight of the entire premise between the whole   and the    arguments,” she continued. “It’s so wrong because it’s still so unconstitutional. It’s still taxation without representation. It still picks winners and losers because some corporations get to opt out of the requirements that hit everyone else. It still infringes on states’ rights, and it still weaponizes the IRS against Americans who just simply seek freedom and choices and sensibility in their families’ health care. The IRS will be taxing aspects of this without representation because we have no choice. We’re shackled to politicians’ whims and special interests’ bullying interests, which does violate the Constitution, and it actually allows government to have a lien on our health. ” “People need to know it’s the foundation, it’s the premise,” Palin said. “I don’t know why we’re still even giving an inch on aspects of socialized medicine via this new   proposal. Is that okay with conservatives, with Republicans in office? They say they want the patient first. They say they want freedom. They say they want a free market to drive the insurance system that we have in America. But no, government is still in control. Government actually has a lien on our health because they lord over us penalties if we want to opt out of a big government mandate. ” When asked what she would say to Ryan if he were on Breitbart News Saturday with her this weekend —  Ryan has refused to come on the program to discuss these matters and will not answer Breitbart News’s questions about the bill  —  Palin said she has lots for Ryan to explain here. But she also noted that Republicans   agree that Obamacare is awful and needs to be repealed. “There is much that we agree on,” Palin said. “Thank the Lord, we all agree that Obamacare is devastating   of our economy. That’s what health care encompasses. Once the government took it over —  it obviously is unaffordable, unsustainable and unwanted. So, from the   thank the Lord we all have that in common, and we want to do away with Obamacare. I would ask Paul Ryan’s forgiveness if I come across sounding like I’m just whining and complaining about a problem without proposing a solution. Like Teddy Roosevelt said, that is the definition of whining. So I want to propose solutions, and I want Paul Ryan to listen to the people who are suggesting that, okay, if government is going to be this involved in our healthcare system and choices, then allow the states to take this over. Get it out of big government’s hands. The most responsive level of government is that which is closest to the people. If you’re not going to allow individuals to have the freedoms and the autonomy and the choices provided in their health care, at least let it be a states’ rights issue. So that’s one. ” “And then let’s talk about the tort reform that I still don’t see in the new proposal,” Palin continued. “I’d like Paul Ryan to address that more clearly. I’d like him to really talk about how he proposes to tackle the waste and the fraud in the healthcare system. I’d really like him to talk about the interstate commerce allowance now because we know that that has caused a lack of competition, and I really want him to address just that good old American freedom of choice. How can he convince the American people that this isn’t just still big government in bed with big pharma and big Wall Street and sticking it to the people with all its globaloney that was part of Obamacare. How is this   any different?” Palin concluded the interview by noting that she has the utmost confidence that President Trump will move to scrap Ryan’s bill and fix this whole process before this gets out of hand. “He will step in and fix it,” Palin said. “I have great faith that President Trump is one who will fulfill campaign promises. He already has a track record of doing so well in these first months, I’m just really proud to have been part of the constituency that wanted him in there and worked hard to get him in there. So, yeah, I’m sure that President Trump is going to do the right thing and listen to all sides, of course, but understand, especially, that as a businessman, he’s going to understand whether this makes sense in his vision of how to grow businesses and how to get government off our back and back on our side. How will we create a smaller, smarter government with a proposal like this that basically allows for the continuation of a growth of government? That’s what any aspect of Obamacare or   does. So asking President Trump specifically about how running a business, not a Wall Street business, but    main street business, how does   help their business get to grow and drive and survive in this economy?” LISTEN TO FORMER ALASKA GOV.

Saudi Arabia has threatened to cancel the scheduled OPEC oil freeze by raising output over row with Iran. OPEC sources: Saudi Arabia threatened to raise oil output steeply to bring prices down if Iran refuses to limit its supply. According to four OPEC sources: Clash occurred at last weeks experts meeting designed to work out details before official Nov. 30 gathering. OPEC source: ""The Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11 million barrels per day and even 12 million bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting.” OPEC Source: The Saudi threat followed objections by Iran, which said it was unwilling to freeze its output. OPEC Source: Saudi threat to raise output came as a surprise even to Riyadh's Gulf OPEC allies. Non-Iranian OPEC Source: ""We felt as if they (the Saudis) wanted the meeting to fail.” Saudi Arabia has increased output since 2014 to record highs of around 10.5 million-10.7 million barrels per day. In September: OPEC agreed at a meeting in Algeria on modest preliminary oil output cuts in the first such deal since 2008. Iran has reported its output at 3.85 million bpd in Sep., and said they will only cap output at 12.7 percent of OPEC's total ceiling - or 4.2 million bpd. Ali Kardor, managing director of NIOC: ""Working in oil industry is like operating at war fronts and we have to preserve our trenches by raising our production capacity as much as we can.” Kardor: “The next OPEC meeting is near and we will never cease to recapture our quota in the organization.” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo: I am ”optimistic"" a final agreement will be reached. OPEC delegate: ""People can look at it from different angles. The fact that discussions are still going on is a positive one. They are going to work on it, close to the ministers’ meeting.” 
(DUBAI/LONDON) Old disputes between Saudi Arabia and rival Iran resurfaced at a meeting of OPEC experts last week, with Riyadh threatening to raise oil output steeply to bring prices down if Tehran refuses to limit its supply, OPEC sources say. 
Clashes between the two OPEC heavyweights, which are fighting proxy wars in Syria and Yemen, have become frequent in recent years. 
Tensions subsided, however, in recent months after Saudi Arabia agreed to support a global oil supply limiting pact, thus raising the prospect that OPEC would take steps to boost oil prices. 
But a meeting of OPEC experts last week, designed to work out details of cuts for the next OPEC ministerial gathering on Nov. 30, saw Saudis and Iranian clashing again, according to four OPEC sources who were present at the meeting and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
""The Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11 million barrels per day and even 12 million bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,"" one OPEC source who attended the meeting told Reuters. 
OPEC headquarters declined to comment on discussions during the closed-door meetings last week. Saudi and Iranian OPEC delegates also declined official comments.",0
1157,Report: Seattle Probably Won’t Sign Colin Kaepernick,"Spike Lee has some explaining to do. [Three days after the leftist filmmaker, and avowed Kaepernick supporter, took to Instagram to thank Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll for signing Colin Kaepernick, a report has emerged that the Seahawks in fact have no intention of signing Colin Kaepernick.  According to Pro Football Talk, “Pat Kirwan of SiriusXM NFL Radio said today that he doesn’t expect the Seahawks to sign Kaepernick. That’s particularly noteworthy because Kirwan has a long and close relationship with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, dating to their time together when Carroll was defensive coordinator and then head coach of the Jets from 1990 to 1994. Kirwan didn’t say Carroll was the source of his belief that Kaepernick won’t be a Seahawk, but it seems unlikely that Kirwan would have bad information about the team his old friend coaches. ” Seattle, much like San Francisco, is one of the biggest liberal outposts on the left coast. Considering the activism of players like Doug Baldwin, and the fact that Pete Carroll himself is a   truther and an Iraq war critic to boot, if Seattle ever truly had interest in Kaepernick it’s unlikely that interest would have evaporated over Kaepernick’s politics or because of a perceived backlash over his politics. What’s more likely is that Kaepernick and the Seahawks couldn’t agree on financial terms. Seattle doesn’t have a ton of cap space and Kaepernick probably doesn’t want to play for the veteran minimum, especially considering that he could likely find himself in a much more powerful financial bargaining position later, should a team lose a starter and all of a sudden become desperate for a starting quarterback.

1158,Top Trump Aide Steve Bannon: Virulent Anti-Semite or Ardent Zionist?,"STEVE BANNON Donald’s Trump’s Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor 
“As a Jew who has worked for years with Steve Bannon, I can tell you he is not an anti-Semite or a white nationalist. He doesn’t have an anti-Semitic bone in his body.” — David Horowitz, Jewish founder of the David Horowitz Freedom Center and editor of FrontPage Magazine . 
When president-elect Donald Trump named Steve Bannon, the controversial media figure behind the alt-right website Breitbart News Network, as his “senior strategist” — major Jewish groups raised the alarm. 
The Anti-Defamation League condemned the move, saying Bannon’s website was home to racists and fostered hatred against Jews. But to his Jewish defenders — which include Breitbart’s CEO and senior editors for the site — he is an ally and proud Zionist. 
“I can say, without hesitation, that Steve is a friend of the Jewish people and a defender of Israel, as well as being a passionate American patriot and a great leader,” Joel Pollak, an Orthodox Jew and a senior editor for Breitbart News, wrote on Monday. 
Indeed, Breitbart’s origin story has its roots in Israel, according to Larry Solov, Breitbart’s CEO and president, another close Jewish colleague of Bannon. 
In a November 2015 post on Breitbart News, Solov describes the conception of the news site in 2007. It happened, Solov writes, during a trip to Israel with Andrew Breitbart, the Jewish founder and namesake of the website. 
The site was born to defend the Jewish state. 
“One thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel,” Solov wrote. “We were sick of the anti-Israel bias of the mainstream media.” 
Solov and Breitbart were “blown away by the spirit, tenacity and resourcefulness of the Israeli people on that trip,” Solov wrote. 
Breitbart died in 2012 and Bannon became editor of the site. 
Under Bannon’s leadership, the site became one of the best known platforms and gateways for the alt-right, a diverse group that traffics in white nationalism and racism. Richard Spencer , a founder of the political movement who advocates for the creation of a “white ethno-state,” called Breitbart a “gateway” to alt-right ideas and writers. 
During Trump’s campaign, the site became particularly enamored with the Republican candidate and lampooned and attacked his opponents. 
For Ben Shapiro, a former writer at Breitbart News, Bannon betrayed the original vision of the site’s founder. 
“Andrew Breitbart despised racism,” Shapiro wrote on Monday. “With Bannon embracing Trump, all that changed. Now Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website … pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.” 
But even as the site may have appealed to anti-Semites, it retained its Zionist bona fides under Bannon. 
In 2015, Bannon launched a Jerusalem branch of Breitbart News, which covers events in Israel. It is edited by Israel-based American reporter Aaron Klein, another Bannon advocate. Klein, a Yeshiva University graduate, is also a columnist for the Jewish Press, a weekly newspaper with a conservative bent. 
Klein recently called the anti-Trump protests across the country a product of “professional agitators” who are seeking the “downfall of the U.S. capitalist system.” 
The activist Pamela Geller, known for her anti-Islamic campaigning, also counts herself among Bannon’s Jewish allies. On Twitter, Geller defended Bannon recently, dismissing those who were characterizing Bannon as an anti-Semite. 
“He partnered [with] Breitbart — a Jew,” she wrote. “He partnered [with] Larry Solov (after Breitbart died) a Jew. He worked [with] me — a Jew.” Then she added: #Zionist. 
David Horowitz, founder of the conservative think tank David Horowitz Freedom Center also came to Bannon’s defense, saying Bannon does not have an “anti-Semitic bone in his body.” 
“As a Jew who has worked for years with Steve Bannon,” Horowitz wrote in an email to the Forward, “I can tell you he is not an anti-Semite or a white nationalist.” LD : For further proof that Steve Bannon is not going to do anything to challenge Jewish power in America or stand up to Israel, see this thought-provoking article in the Occidental Observer : Anti-Semitism as Political Assassination: The Smearing of Steve Bannon. I really do feel at this stage, though of course I could be wrong, that diehard anti-Semites and ardent White Nationalists are most unlikely to see any of their dreams come true in the foreseeable future. That’s what makes anti-Semites and White nationalists the angriest people on earth: their dreams are constantly being shattered as they see the Jews becoming more powerful and tyrannical at their expense.

1161,"Rep. Pete Roskam: Post Ryancare, Congress Must Still Fix Obamacare’s Flaws - Breitbart","Illnois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam told Chicago’s   that he supported the American Health Care Act crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) as a necessary fix of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. [“It was an improvement as to where we are now,” he said told the station.  There is a restlessness among the people in his district about Obamacare and what will be done with it, he said. The congressman said during the   battle over the Ryancare bill, he heard from constituents who have been hurt by Obamacare and people helped by Obamacare. In the final bill, Roskam said he received assurances in writing that Illinois would not lose Medicaid protections. He said he was comfortable with concessions given to the House Freedom Caucus, including modifying the Essential Health Benefits  —   those items required for all policies  —   so that the EHB’s were determined the states. “My view was that on balance, this bill was a step forward,” he said. “Friday was a big disappointment because the bill got pulled, because there was not a lot of support for it so moving forward, there was this notion that this was the healthcare debate,      and I don’t believe that is true for a second,” he said. One of the reasons the bill did not pass was that the speaker crafted the bill to meet the requirements of the Senate’s rules governing budget bills, he said. “It is so complicated and so difficult to understand that nobody even hardly understands what you are talking about,” Roskam said. “The better move in the past would have been to pass out of the House —  even though it’s not going to move in the Senate —  the actual proposal —  what is it you are for? Not with limitations, what are the aspirations?” Roskam said he is convinced that in the coming weeks, there will be a serious move to reengage the House Republicans about reforming national healthcare policy. “We can’t stay here,” he said. The next move should be to go back to the two things every American agreed about when President Barack Obama first started the Obamacare debate, he said. First, health care is too expensive and many of the cost drivers are not making us any healthier, he said. Second, it bothered everyone that Americans with   conditions did not have access to insurance coverage. “If the Obama administration had focused on those two core things, we would be having a very different conversation about health care today,” he said.",0
1162,Christmas Revelers Leave 16 Tons of Trash on Australian Beach - The New York Times,"SYDNEY, Australia  —   Christmas and New Year in Australia typically involve barbecues, beaches and beer. But a Christmas Day celebration that drew more than 10, 000 people has led to a suspension of that tradition on Coogee Beach in the Sydney suburb of Randwick, where officials estimate that revelers left behind more than 16 tons of garbage. The City Council banned alcohol on the beach for the rest of the Australian summer. “I’m a local, and in all my time here I’ve never seen anything like it,” Tony Waller, president of the Coogee Surf Life Saving Club, told Channel 7, adding that the club used four oxygen cylinders and 15 resuscitation masks to treat drunken partygoers. “By late evening, it got so bad that we let the shark alarm off three times to try to get the swimmers out of the water, we had such grave concerns for them,” Mr. Waller said. “They were all intoxicated. ” Three people were arrested over “antisocial behavior,” according to the police. There has long been tension between the residents who live near Sydney’s beaches and the tourists, many of them foreign, who hold   and   parties fueled by alcohol and drugs and leave behind piles of trash that greet early morning joggers and swimmers. “I’ve seen sex on Bondi Beach on Christmas afternoon,” Mark Cotter, president of the North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, said in an interview, referring to a beach north of Coogee. “People are often off their heads, drunk and sunburned. ” At Bondi Beach, the local council has also banned alcohol consumption. But many residents say that beer, along with cannabis and other drugs, is openly consumed on a grassy area where turntables and D. J. s entertain crowds. “The grassy knoll at north Bondi is the place to be seen on Saturdays and Sundays as it attracts buff bodies and bikinis,” Zak Mann, a   Bondi resident, said in an interview. “It’s cheaper to drink on the street than in the swanky, upmarket bars. ” The police and rangers employed by local councils have the authority to confiscate unopened alcohol and pour out alcohol being consumed on Bondi Beach, said Tony Kay, who oversees the council for Waverley, a Sydney suburb. The police in Sydney often simply warn those found in possession of up to 15 grams of cannabis leaf, enough for 15 to 25 joints. The City Council in Randwick said that it had previously restricted alcohol consumption at Coogee Beach and its surrounding parks during certain hours of the day in an effort to stop bad behavior. “However, the poor and inappropriate behavior of a few on Christmas Day have forced the council to introduce a total alcohol ban for the area for summer,” it said. “The public outrage to the devastation of the parks and beach itself on Christmas Day has been quite phenomenal. ”",0
1163,North Carolina’s Partisan Rift Widens in Fight Over Governor’s Powers - The New York Times,"RALEIGH, N. C.  —   There have been four years of civil disobedience,   boycotts over bathroom access, and legal battles over voting laws and gerrymanders. The election for governor, fraught with Republican challenges, took a month to settle. But if anyone here thought that the Democrat Roy Cooper’s victory in that race would open a new era of cooperation and calm in this bitterly divided state, all they had to do was listen on Thursday to the bellowing voice of Evan Hughes, a lettuce farmer from Durham. Around noon, Mr. Hughes, 35, was in front of North Carolina’s legislative offices with a child in his arms, berating the executive director of the state Republican Party for the group’s gambit to strip Mr. Cooper of many of his powers as governor before he even takes office. “We’re talking about changing the rules at the last minute,” Mr. Hughes said. “The people of North Carolina are sick and tired of the G. O. P. ’s antics  —     antics. It is embarrassing to the people of North Carolina. ” Dallas Woodhouse, the Republican official, had initially tried to engage Mr. Hughes. But he eventually fled into the building, where lawmakers from his party introduced a flurry of bills during a surprise special session this week to undermine Mr. Cooper by stripping him of his ability to make key appointments to state and local boards and mandating, for the first time, legislative approval of his cabinet. The legislative session generated reminders of one in March that led to the divisive “bathroom bill” that limited gay and transgender rights. It further cemented the perception of North Carolina as a place that has gone from a symbol of pragmatic New South moderation to one in a perpetual state of political civil war. The law passed in March, known as House Bill 2, is seen as playing a role in Mr. Cooper’s defeat of Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican. The General Assembly went into a special session to pass the bill, and Mr. McCrory signed it the same night. It resulted in boycotts by sports leagues and musicians. “We don’t want another disaster like House Bill 2,” Mr. Cooper said at a news conference on Thursday. “This is exactly why we had problems with House Bill 2 because they wanted to do it in secret. ” The new legislation moved quickly through committees and floor votes on Thursday, where Republicans hold large majorities in both chambers. In separate incidents, both the State Senate and House galleries were closed and cleared of protesters after outbursts interrupted proceedings. Senators passed one of the major bills, which removes partisan control of the state and county election boards from the governor. Currently, the boards, which set hours and polling places and adjudicate ballot disputes, have a majority from the governor’s party. Under the new law, the boards will have bipartisan memberships, but a Republican will lead the state board during election years and a Democrat in nonelection years. The House passed another key bill, enhancing the power of the state superintendent of education, who is a newly elected Republican, and mandating Senate approval of Mr. Cooper’s cabinet appointments, a significant shackling of the governor’s authority. Both the   and   bills were scheduled to be taken up by the other chamber on Friday. The special session stunned North Carolinians of both the right and the left who had been hoping for a cooling off from the state’s recent years of hyperpartisanship. “We didn’t think it would be   from before Day 1,” said Rick Henderson, editor of Carolina Journal, a publication of the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank in Raleigh. Mr. Cooper, who, while a member of the legislature, once helped replace a   Speaker of the House with a conservative Democrat, has been a relatively nonconfrontational attorney general of his state, Mr. Henderson said. But the   angrily attacked Republicans on Thursday. “They will see me in court,” he warned. It is not clear if Democrats have any legal recourse. Few states are quite as bitterly divided as this one, but there are hints here, too, of what may be in store for a nation that is just as divided and bruised after the presidential election. On Thursday afternoon, the chants of liberal protesters filled the area outside of the Senate viewing gallery. “Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!” they chanted. The police led a number of protesters, who had refused to leave the House gallery, away in plastic wrist ties. “Thank you we love you!” the protesters cheered as they were escorted out. The group, which numbered in the hundreds, chanted and sang. Mr. Cooper termed the moves by the General Assembly as not so much a power grab, but an attempt to reach deep into his administration to extend conservative priorities on taxes, education and the environment. The   said Republicans seeking leverage over his administration were hoping to add to their policy wish list, channeling taxpayer dollars into   vouchers and weakening environmental protections. Republicans, who for more than a century were held in a hammerlock by Democrats in charge of the state’s legislature, defended the moves under the principle that turnabout is fair play. They cited how Democrats stripped power from a Republican lieutenant governor in the 1980s. “They completely defenestrated the lieutenant governor’s office,” Mr. Henderson said. “So this is not an unprecedented move at all. ” Mr. Cooper rejected the comparison. “That is just not true,” he said. “What is happening now is unprecedented. ” Even as North Carolina unhitched from its conservative Southern heritage in the past decade and became a battleground state  —   President Obama won here in 2008  —   Republicans were taking over state government. In 2010, they won a majority in the legislature for the first time in a century, carrying districts that had been drawn by Democrats to favor Democrats. When Mr. McCrory won the governor’s mansion two years later, the unified control of the party in Raleigh unleashed an avalanche of conservative legislation, from abortion restrictions to tax cuts favoring the wealthy to, most notably, a   2013 bill that made it more difficult to register and vote in the state. This year, a federal court threw out that law after finding it was passed “with almost surgical precision” to diminish the influence of   voters. In August, a federal appeals court found that district maps drawn by Republicans for the 2012 General Assembly elections included more than two dozen districts that were racial gerrymanders, and the court ordered lawmakers to redraw the maps next year. Another court ruling last month required the state to use the new maps for elections to the House and Senate in the fall of 2017. If the ruling survives appeals, it would mean next year’s full session of the General Assembly would be held in an election year and be even more highly politicized than usual. The showdown between Mr. Cooper and lawmakers this week may be only an appetizer.",0

Build the filter by pouring a mixture of egg whites and ground hen bones into a filter mold, and leave it at your parents’ house over a long weekend to set. Step 4: Get your rolling paper by stripping a few inches of skin off the Paper Wretch with a hot carrot peeler. It may take a few tries to get a good swath! Step 5: To break up the weed, place it on an active fault line in a bowl full of gravel. Step 6: Once a major tectonic event has ground your weed, pound it into a paste using a book about a curious incident. Step 7: Wrap your index finger in paper and feed the weed paste into your port. A chilly sensation means your body has accepted the paste and will pass it on. A prickling sensation means your body has rejected the paste and will hopefully pee it out someday. Step 8: Seal the joint by licking your papered-up finger like a naughty little thing. You’re filthy, aren’t you? Step 9: Remove finger, twist paper, and voilà! The perfect joint for any mouth. Step 10: Dunk the joint in the tub so you aren’t tempted to smoke it and become insane. Start over at step one! 
Don’t get discouraged if you don’t get it right on the first try. Like all things in life, practice makes perfect!",0
1165,"The Epicenter of the Moral Universe is Our Common Humanity, Not Religion","shorty BY REV. WILLIAM ALBERTS T he common humanity everyone shares should be the epicenter of the moral universe. Not religion. Our religious founders and saints have different beginnings and beliefs, but all of us share similar birth stories, and at the moment of birth we are most alike. We have different faith traditions, but the same universal need to be loved and to love. We speak different languages, but laugh alike. We don’t look alike, but our facial expressions tell the same story – of surprise and pleasure, frustration and anger, joy and sadness. We sing different anthems — with the same pride. We may regard each other as foreigners, yet we love and grieve the same. Anywhere in the world, when people are oppressed, their innate human response is to struggle for justice. Everyone bleeds human. Thus the common humanity all people share is the frame of reference for the moral universe. And our common humanity is powerfully expressed in most religions’ shared belief in The Golden Rule: “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.” (Matthew 7: 12) But, to everyone’s endangerment, political and faith leaders alike are redefining and thus shrinking the moral universe to accommodate their self-interests. Their selective morality is especially seen in today’s presidential campaign. For many white evangelical Christians, morality takes a back seat to belief. Jesus is recorded as teaching, “I was a stranger and you welcomed me.” (Matthew 25: 36), and “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matthew 22: 39). Yet a high majority of evangelicals and their leaders have had no problem supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, despite his denigration of women, Mexicans, Muslims, immigrants, black persons and even a disabled reporter. In fact, a number of evangelical Christian leaders have formed a Faith Advisory Council to help guide Trump’s presidential campaign, and evangelical ministers are repeatedly photographed surrounding him and laying their hands on him in prayer. It is about their religious beliefs, not his immoral behavior. Numerous white evangelical Christian leaders have an unwavering faith in Donald Trump. Recently, a video showed an “aroused” Trump boasting about being a compulsive sexual predator, who is “automatically attracted to beautiful . . . I just start kissing them . . . It’s like a magnet . . . I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star . . . you can do anything” to them, including, “grab them by the pussy.” (“US election: Full transcript of Donald Trump’s obscene videotape”, BBC News , Oct. 8, 2016) Ironically, in the second presidential debate, shortly before the video surfaced, Donald Trump told Hillary Clinton that, as president, he would have a special prosecutor investigate her misuse of emails when Secretary of State, and said to her, “You’d be in jail.” Actually, Trump’s self-reported sexual assaults on women indicate he should be prosecuted, and jailed if found guilty – and, when released, be registered as a sex offender – for the protection of unsuspecting women. While the leaked videotape has led some white evangelical Christian supporters to distance themselves from Donald Trump’s campaign, many others still support him, believing that he will “make America great again” — to their Biblical liking . Typical is Ralph Reed, leader of Trump’s religious advisory board and founder and chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. The father of two daughters, Reed was reported as being “disappointed by” Trump’s “ ‘Inappropriate’ comments.” But Reed said, “I think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their [evangelical voters] hierarchy of their concerns.” He stated that, “people of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, grow the economy, appoint conservative judges and oppose the Iran nuclear deal.” (“ ‘Still the best candidate’: Some evangelicals still back Trump despite lewd video,” By Sarah Pulliam Bailey, The Washington Post , Oct. 8, 2016) For Ralph Reed and many other evangelical Christian leaders and their flocks, it is the authority of their selective Biblical beliefs. The Bible says, “So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1: 27) Therefore, these evangelical leaders believe that unborn American children are more worthy of protection than already born Muslim children and adults – who are protected, by “the Iran nuclear deal,” from another falsely-based, Iraqi-type, pre-emptive U.S. invasion. The aim of evangelical Christian leaders is not just to protect the unborn, but to proselytize those already born, especially Muslims. Thus a reported “87 percent of all white evangelical Christians in the United States supported” the George W. Bush Administration’s illegal pre-emptive invasion of defenseless Iraq — certain evangelical leaders even “claiming that the American invasion of Iraq would create exciting new prospects for proselytizing Muslims.” (“Wayward Christian Soldiers, By Charles Marsh, The New York Times , Jan. 20, 2006) In the wake of that devastating criminal war, certain evangelical groups, like Muslim-hating Rev. Franklin Graham and his Samaritan’s Purse organization, flocked to Iraq to join the “humanitarian effort,” with the motivation to harvest for Jesus the Muslims fortunate enough to survive the slaughter. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations said of this obscenely immoral reality: “Franklin Graham obviously thinks it is a war against Islam. . . . This is a guy who gave the invocation at President Bush’s inauguration and believes Islam is a wicked faith. And,“ Hooper questioned, “he’s going into Iraq in the wake of an invading army and convert people to Christianity? Nothing good is coming from that.” (“Group to Aid, Proselytize in Postwar Iraq,” By Deborah Caldwell, ABC News , March 27, 2003) Nothing good came out of that worst war crime of the 21 st century. It merely provided another tragic example of the fact that “American exceptionalism” and belief that Jesus is “the savior of the world” are two sides of the same imperialistic coin. For many evangelical Christians, it is about belief, not behavior. It is about Psalm 139: “For you created my innermost being: you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” (verses 13, 14) It is about, “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18: 25) And Jesus is reported as saying to Pharisees, “Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female. . . . For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?” (Matthew 19: 4, 5) Abortion, homosexuality and same-sex marriage are all an “abomination.” It is one’s birth that counts, Not the circumstances surrounding pregnancy and birth. Nor the individual’s “innermost being” after birth. Especially not one’s “ innermost being” leading one to “leave father and mother and be joined” in love to one’s same-sex partner. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence is a classic example of the Biblically-shrunken moral universe of many evangelical Christians. In his debate with Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, Pence said, “For me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief . . . where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you and so . . . I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.” (“The most important exchanges of the vice presidential debate, annotated,” LA Times , Oct. 4, 2016) “The sanctity of life” before a child is born. As governor of Indiana, Mike Pence signed a “Religious Freedom Restoration Act” that, as reported, “would have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers, for example, by citing their religious beliefs.” That legislation cost Indiana dearly in lost revenue from the boycott of celebrities and conventions that cancelled their planned appearances and meetings in the state. Documented is Pence’s consistent opposition to “marriage equality,” his opposition to “protecting LGBT employees,” and his refusal to support “LGBT-inclusive hate-crimes legislation.” (”Donald Trump Clearly Didn’t ‘Ask the Gays’ About Mike Pence,” By Advocate.com Editors/Authors, advocate.com , July 15, 2016) For Pence, “the sanctity of life” ends at birth. It is about belief in the inerrancy of The Bible – which then becomes the epicenter of the moral universe for word-for-word- Bible -believing Christians. Here one finds certainty and authority, which allow one to seek to convert other persons to one’s true beliefs, rather than engage with them, and the truths they live by, as equals. Thus for such Bible -believing Christians, it is not about loving your neighbor as yourself as Jesus taught, but wanting your neighbor to be like yourself. The Bible allows them to act out their need to gain power over and control other persons – and allay their own innermost anxieties and doubts. The Bible is often used by people to avoid understanding why they behave as they do. Forgiveness covers a multitude of sins, and while liberating one from conscious guilt, may provide little self-insight into one’s behavior. Unquestioning belief in “the “Word of God” allows those with anti-introspective tendencies to dismiss scientifically-based psychological knowledge of human development and behavior that contradicts the Source of their authority. This belief allows them to dumb down their God to accommodate their cultural conditioning and rationalizations. Again, the words of Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence are revealing. After Donald Trump gave a brief automatic apology for his sexually abusive behavior toward women in that videotape, Pence used words of faith to make Trump’s compulsive criminal behavior disappear. “ ‘We all fall short of the glory of God,’ “ Pence said, “and praised Trump for his ‘humility’ in asking forgiveness.” Pence continued, “It takes a big man to know when he is wrong and to admit it and to have the humility to apologize and be transparent and be vulnerable with people. . . . Donald Trump last night showed that he is a big man.” (“Pence: Trump showed ‘humility’ with apology,” By Jessie Hellmann, TheHill , Oct. 10, 2016) In a New Hampshire campaign speech, which was greatly lauded by mainstream media, Michelle Obama said entirely different words regarding Donald Trump’s lewd video boasts about sexually assaulting women. While effectively denouncing Trump’s self-professed criminal behavior toward women, she took the occasion to declare that the epicenter of the moral universe is America and that Hillary Clinton possesses the moral compass. “Shaken to my core” by Trump’s “lewd comments,” Mrs. Obama emphasized that, “the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.” Then, referring to Trump, she said, “We have a candidate for President of the United States who . . . last week . . . [was] actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. . . . The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman.” (“Read Michelle Obama’s Speech Condemning Donald Trump’s Comments About Women,” By Katie Reilly, motto.time.com , Oct. 13, 2016) Michelle Obama then pivoted to Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy, saying, “I believe with all my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president . . . who truly cares about us and our children.“ Thus, she said, “If we let Hillary’s opponent win this election . . . we won’t be just setting a bad example for our kids, but for our entire world. Because, “she added, “ for so long America has been a model for countries across the globe, pushing them to educate their girls, insisting they give more rights to their women.” She called America “the greatest nation on earth,” and also stated, “We have the power to show our children that America’s greatness comes from recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all our people.” ( Ibid ) “The measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.” How about: the measure of any society is also how it treats the women and girls in other societies ? That measure goes to the heart of The Golden Rule and the epicenter of the moral universe. And with that inclusiveness as the measure, Hillary Clinton fails miserably. If “the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls,” Iraq was measuring up comparably well. Under Saddam Hussein’s rule, Iraq’s education system was reported to be “top notch and female literacy rates were the highest in the region.” In fact, “education was a major priority for Saddam Hussein’s regime, so much so that in 1982 Iraq received . . . the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) award for eradicating illiteracy.” Furthermore, “Women were integral to Iraq’s economy and held high positions in both the private and public sectors, thanks in large part to labor and employment laws that guaranteed equal pay, six months fully paid maternity leave and protection from sexual harassment . . . conditions enjoyed by working women in Iraq rival[ing] those of working women in the United States.” (“Was Life for Iraqi Women Better Under Saddam?,” By Rania Khalek, muftah.org , March 19, 2013) Also reported, “Iraq had one of the best national health care systems in the Middle East. . . . and the Iraqi people enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the Middle East.” (“Living Conditions in Iraq: A Criminal Tragedy,” by Ghali Hassan, globalresearch.ca , June 3, 2005) Then came the devastating U.S.-controlled UN economic sanctions that resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 Iraqi children under five years of age. Following those murderous sanctions, the George W. Bush administration, with the support of then Senator Hillary Clinton, launched an illegal, falsely-based pre-emptive was against defenseless Iraq. That unnecessary criminal war killed over a million Iraqi civilians, left some two million Iraqi women widowed, and an estimated five million girls and boys orphaned. (“Was life for Iraqi Women Better Under Saddam?,” Ibid) And loved ones are grieving for almost 5,000 American troops killed and over 100,000 wounded in body and mind. In response to this carnage, Hillary Clinton said her vote for the invasion of Iraq was a “mistake” – as she announced her candidacy for president in the 2016 campaign. And with her candidacy, she cites her “lifelong commitment to fighting for children and families,” saying, “I’ve spent my life fighting for children, families and our country and I’m not stopping now.” (“Documentary Style Ad Features Hillary Clinton’s Lifelong Record Fighting for Children and Families, hillaryclinton.com ) With her presidential campaign supported by American Iraq war hawks, nothing may stop her from continuing to destroy “children and families” in other societies. (See, “Neocon War Hawks Want Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump. No Surprise – They’ve Always Backed Her,” By Branko Marcetic, inthesetimes.com , March 23, 2016) It is the same story with Libya. If “the measure of a society is how it treats its women and girls,” Libya excelled. According to Harvard researcher Dr. Garikai Chengu, “Gaddafi’s Libya was Africa’s most prosperous democracy.” Concerning women, Chengu writes “The United Nations Human Rights Council praised Mr. Gaddafi profusely [for] women’s rights.” They included “the right to education, hold jobs, divorce, hold property” and “equal pay for equal work.” Plus, “Libyan working mothers enjoyed a range of benefits including cash bonuses for children, free day care, free health care centers and retirement at 55.” Education was a human right and it was free for all Libyans. And “health care was a human right.” (“Gaddafi’s Libya was Africa’s Most Prosperous Democracy,” Foreign Policy Journal , Jan. 12, 2013) Dr. Chengu states that “prior to Colonel Gaddafi, King Idris let Standard Oil essentially write Libya’s petroleum laws. Mr. Gaddafi put an end to all of that.” He deposited the “money from oil proceeds . . . directly into every Libyan citizen’s bank account.” Chengu muses: “One wonders if Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum will continue this practice under the new democratic Libya?” He also asks: “With regard to health care, education and economic justice, is America in any position to export democracy to Libya or should America have taken a leaf out of Libya’s book?” He then adds this commentary: “Therefore, isn’t it ironic that America supposedly bombarded Libya to spread democracy, but increasingly education in America is becoming a privilege, not a right, and ultimately a debt sentence.” ( Ibid ) Col. Gaddafi himself looked at the invasion and plunder of Iraq, and saw the handwriting on America’s imperialistic wall. He wrote, “They want to do to Libya what they did to Iraq and what they are itching to do to Iran. They want to take back the oil that was nationalized by these countries’ revolutions.” And, “They want to re-establish military bases that were shut down by the revolutions and to install client regimes that will subordinate the country’s wealth and labor to imperialistic corporate interests. All else is lies and deception.” (“Facts about Libya under Gaddafi that you probably did not know about!,” By mystory2323, ireport.cnn.com , Nov. 21, 2012) The rights and prosperity enjoyed by woman and girls – and everyone else – in Libya was enough to threaten any capitalistic society. Col. Gaddafi had to go. And, as reported, Hillary Clinton played a key role in his overthrow and death. In his article, “Benghazi Won’t Stick to Hillary Clinton, But the Disastrous Libyan Intervention Should,” foreign policy journalist Joel Gillin writes that, as Secretary of State, she helped to convince President Obama that a “humanitarian intervention” — in the form of military force was needed ”to stop the imminent slaughter of civilians in Benghazi” – the intervention opposed by Robert Gates, then Secretary of Defense, “and other top national security officials.” Gillin states that “no solid evidence existed to back up Clinton’s statements of the impending bloodbath in Benghazi.” ( New Republic, May 27, 2015) (See also, “Even Critics understate how catastrophically bad the Hillary Clinton-led NATO bombing of Libya was,” By Ben Norton, salon.com , Mar. 2, 2016) In his article, “Who said Gaddafi had to go?,” Hugh Roberts, professor of North African History, wrote that the decision “was to declare Gaddafi guilty in advance of a massacre of defenseless civilians and instigate a process of destroying his regime and him (and his family) by way of punishment of a crime he was yet to commit, and actually unlikely to commit, and to persist with this process despite his repeated offers to suspend military action.” Ironically, Roberts states, it was the U.S.-led NATO forces that committed a “blood bath” against the Libyan people, not Muammar Gaddafi. Possibly 25,000 Libyans were killed, “many thousands injured and hundreds of thousands . . . displaced.” ( London Review of Books , Nov. 17, 2011) How many of those victims were women and girls? Afterwards, Secretary of State Clinton appeared on television, and in response to the news of the toppling of Col. Gaddafi’s government and his brutal death, she laughed and chuckled, “We came, we saw, and he died!” (“See Flashback 2011: Hillary Clinton Laughs About Killing Muammar Gaddafi: ‘We Came, We Saw, He Died!’,” realclearpolitics.com , Posted June 19, 2015) That shocking television scene provides insight into her circumscribed morality. “The measure of a society is how it treats its women and girls.” Tell that to the Palestinian people. Hillary Clinton repeatedly says that “women’s rights are human rights.” But in her mind, that does not apply to Palestinian women and girls. In an article, “Hillary Clinton Is No Feminist: Just Look at Her Stance on Palestine,” Nadia Elia, Diaspora Palestinian writer and political commentator, quotes “a young Palestinian student, Layali Awwad,” who, in a letter to Clinton, wrote, “When you choose to speak about my homeland, not once do you mention Israel’s human rights violations against Palestinian women and children.” Elia continues, “In 2014, Clinton again expressed full support for Israel as it was engaging in a massive military assault on Gaza,” whereas “even the mainstream US media, while otherwise supportive of Israel, repeatedly commented on the disproportionate number of women and children killed by Israeli fire.” And when a journalist asked Clinton “about the bombing of a UN school where homeless civilians had taken shelter, she began with her formulaic ‘Israel has the right to defend itself’ reply.” Elia states that, “fifteen people were killed in that bombing and more than 100 injured, but to her ‘women and children’ were merely a complication.” ( commondreams.com , Aug. 8, 2016) To Hillary Clinton, “the measure of how a society treats its women and children” does not apply to how the occupying Israeli power treats Palestinian women and children. Nada Elia sums up Clinton’s moral blind spot this way: “We can go back to every instance of Israel violating international law and the human rights of Palestinians and Clinton will invariably be on the side of the oppressor, the illegal occupier, the racist regime. This is not what feminism is about.” Elia then says, “Feminism is not only concerned with women and children, but also seeks to eliminate various systems of structural violence. And,” she states, “while the examples above are from Palestine, we can look elsewhere, around the globe to see how detrimental her hawkish political interventions have proven, from Pakistan to Libya, Honduras and beyond.” ( Ibid ) There is also the Clinton campaign’s demonizing of President Putin, and linking him as favoring Donald Trump’s candidacy. And the campaign’s attempt to deflect the revelation of Hillary Clinton’s dishonesty, revealed in her emails, leaked by WikiLeaks: by alleging, without documented proof, that the emails were hacked by the Russians to influence the U.S. election on behalf of Trump’s campaign. Echoes of McCarthyism and the “Communist scare?” Never mind that the emails reveal a two-faced Clinton, telling bankers in private, who paid her around $225,000 for a speech, that they can count on her, and saying to voters in public what she believes they want to hear. Donald Trump’s crime is his compulsion to sexually assault individual women. If he obtains the power of the presidency, his delusions of grandeur, paranoia, distortion of reality and impulsiveness would be boundlessly destructive. Hillary Clinton’s crime is her compulsion to militarily assault whole countries. As president, she would continue America’s imperialistic global war on terrorism, with countless more women and girls at risk. In 2005, the United Methodist News Service reported that a delegation of five United Methodist Bishops paid a “pastoral visit” to President George W. Bush at the White House. They “presented Bush, a fellow United Methodist, with a Bible signed by the Council of Bishops, and they shared a moment of prayer with him.” Their “pastoral visit” also included “telling the president . . . they shared his commitment to building a better world.” (“United Methodist bishops meet with president, open door to future,” by Tim Tanton, archives.gcah.org , May 3, 2005) Bush continued his devastating criminal war against Iraq. Later, United Methodist leaders built him a monument (The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum) on the campus of Southern Methodist University. If Hillary Clinton, a United Methodist, is elected president, beware of a delegation of proud United Methodist Bishops, with Bible in hand, visiting her at the White House. For many United Methodist leaders, the epicenter of the universe is power, not morality. The election is rigged, but not in the way Donald Trump repeatedly charges. It is rigged by the Democratic and Republican parties, and the corporate media, to limit our choices to their two immoral presidential candidates. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton is worthy of one’s vote. The moral universe encircles all women and girls, and all men and boys – everywhere .

1166,Trump wins mock election of young people,"Print 
If you listen to all the false media hype, you would believe that Hillary Clinton has a huge lead over Donald Trump among young voters, but that may not be the case…. 
Willmar Senior High School in Willmar, Minnesota held a mock election among their students this past Tuesday during the lunch hour. The election was part of a statewide program designed to get young people more engaged in the election-voting process. Throughout the state of Minnesota, around 282 high schools are participating in the mock election program. 
[…] 
In Tuesday’s vote, around 40% of the Willmar’s 1,200 students took time during their lunch hour to cast their ballots. A total of 514 ballots were cast of which 207 were for Trump and 179 for Clinton. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 41 votes and Legal Marijuana Now party candidate Dan Vacek received 17 votes. A number of ballots had write-in names and other candidates received less than 10 votes.",0
1167,Trump Suggests Using Bedrock China Policy as Bargaining Chip - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump, defending his recent phone call with Taiwan’s president, asserted in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the United States was not bound by the One China policy, the   diplomatic understanding that underpins America’s relationship with its biggest rival. Mr. Trump, speaking on Fox News, said he understood the principle of a single China that includes Taiwan, but declared, “I don’t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade. ” “I mean, look,” he continued, “we’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don’t tax them with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea. ” Mr. Trump is not the first incoming Republican president to question the One China policy, but his suggestion that it could be used as a chip to correct Chinese behavior sets him apart, several Asia experts said. While Mr. Trump has been praised by some Republicans for taking a new look at China policy, his stance could risk a backlash by Beijing, the analysts said. Not since 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon and Mao Zedong enshrined the One China principle in the Shanghai Communiqué, has an American president or   so publicly and explicitly questioned the agreement, which resulted in the United States’ ending its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in 1979. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the government had “serious concern” about Mr. Trump’s remarks, renewing a debate that erupted nine days ago when he took a congratulatory phone call from President Tsai   of Taiwan. At first, Mr. Trump played down the implications of the call, saying he was just being polite. Later, his aides said he was well aware of the diplomatic repercussions of speaking to Taiwan’s leader. Lobbyists for Taiwan, including the law firm of former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, spent months laying the groundwork for the call. On Friday, China’s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has designated as his national security adviser, according to a person told about the meeting. It was not clear what the men had discussed. Some Republican foreign policy experts  —   including John R. Bolton, who is believed to be a   for the post of deputy secretary of state  —   have praised Mr. Trump for shaking up a   diplomatic agreement. As a candidate, Ronald Reagan criticized the decision to abrogate recognition of Taiwan after his election, he invited a delegation from Taiwan to attend his inauguration, antagonizing Beijing. In 1982, as president, Reagan pushed for the   Six Assurances, one of which was a reaffirmation that the United States did not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, he abided by the terms of the 1979 joint communiqué that established relations between the United States and China. But Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the policy could be wielded as a chip in a broader negotiation with China has implications not just for Washington’s relationship with Beijing, several experts on Asia said, but also for America’s support for Taiwan. “By putting One China up for grabs, Trump will suck all the oxygen out of the U. S.  relationship, and it risks eventually trading away U. S. support for Taiwan for another U. S. interest,” said Evan Medeiros, a former senior director for Asia at the National Security Council. “There are good reasons why eight presidents since 1972 have relied on the One China policy,” he added. “This is one area where the Trump team would do well to heed the lessons of history instead of bucking them in the uncertain hope of getting something. ” Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Medeiros’s predecessor in the Obama administration, said the One China policy had “always been seen as a foundation of the relationship. ” “Now Trump apparently sees it as part of a broader set of new transactions,” he said. “Mixing trade with an issue seen by Beijing as involving sovereignty is likely to produce an angry Chinese backlash and worsen both issues. ” An editorial on Monday in The Global Times, a Chinese   tabloid, said that Mr. Trump was “like a child in his ignorance of foreign policy. ” “The One China policy cannot be bought and sold,” the editorial said. “Trump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price. ” Mr. Trump, however, did not appear worried about inflaming Beijing. He repeated in the Fox News interview many of the criticisms he has made about China, emphasizing what he said was its unwillingness to help curb the nuclear ambitions of its neighbor North Korea  —   an issue that foreign policy experts believe could confront Mr. Trump as the first geopolitical crisis of his presidency. The   said he would not tolerate having the Chinese government dictate whether he could take a call from the president of Taiwan. He reiterated that he had not placed the call, and described it as “a very short call saying, ‘Congratulations, sir, on the victory. ’” The Chinese government, which once viewed Mr. Trump favorably as an alternative to the hawkish Hillary Clinton, has struggled to respond to Mr. Trump’s unorthodox approach. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, initially played down the significance of the phone call, calling it a “petty action by the Taiwan side” that he said would not upset the longstanding policy of One China. But as Mr. Trump has repeated his campaign criticisms of China  —   and as his statements about Taiwan have rippled throughout the region  —   Beijing has noticeably hardened its tone. It warned him last week, in a   editorial in the overseas edition of People’s Daily, that “creating troubles for the  . S. relationship is creating troubles for the U. S. itself. ” In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. Trump, the editorial said that pushing China on Taiwan “would greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again. ”",0

Multiple sources have indicated that the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, will seek to initiate an investigation in the coming weeks, likely after the U.S. presidential election but before the end of the year. U.S. officials visited The Hague recently to discuss the potential investigation and to express concerns about its scope. 
A formal investigation of U.S. activities would be the first in the history of the ICC, to which the U.S. is not a party. But because Afghanistan is a member, an investigation is “certainly possible,” Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies told Common Dreams. “Afghanistan joined the ICC in 2003, so all actions after that time are subject to ICC jurisdiction,” Bennis said. 
  
“But then you get to the question of political will,” Bennis added. 
The ICC has famously failed to investigate powerful Western nations while prosecuting African dictators, a disparity so glaring that several African countries recently quit the court, condemning it as the “International Caucasian Court.” 
“Is the prosecutor concerned enough about the accusations of discrimination levied against the ICC that she’s willing to go after U.S. clients and U.S. officials?” Bennis asked. 
Rights advocates hope that Bensouda may be willing to take aim at powerful nations. The prosecutor was behind the preliminary ICC report published last year, “Report on Preliminary Examination Activities,” which suggested that the U.S. was “responsible for ‘physical and psychological’ violence and torture that ‘debased the basic human dignity’ of those detained” in Afghanistan, as Common Dreams reported . 
Indeed, photos released by the Pentagon earlier this year demonstrated the brutal abuse of detainees at the hands of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 
Bensouda may also probe the deadly bombing by U.S. forces of a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital in Kunduz, Foreign Policy reports. MSF has characterized the airstrike as a war crime, and rights groups have harshly criticized the Pentagon for its light punishment of those responsible for the attack. 
Despite the looming investigation, Foreign Policy observes that prosecution of U.S. forces for war crimes is still a long way away and may not happen: 
[Prosecution] would require significantly more evidence than the prosecutor’s office currently possesses. The ICC normally does not interview witnesses, take testimony, or gather forensic evidence during its preliminary examinations, and that work would be just the beginning. 
In order to charge Americans with war crimes, Bensouda would likely also have to demonstrate a link between the conflict in Afghanistan and U.S. detention policies, which may not be easy; the United States reportedly brought several detainees to Afghanistan from other parts of the world. Perhaps most controversial, the prosecutor’s office would have to determine that the United States has failed to address allegations of torture through its own domestic prosecutions, investigations, and reviews. 
Moreover, any indictments related to Afghanistan would be months if not years away. Because no ICC member has referred the situation to the court, Bensouda will need the approval of a three-judge panel before launching an investigation. ICC judges have approved all three previous investigative requests from the prosecutor (in Kenya, Cote d’Ivoire, and Georgia), but their review can take several months, and the judges might request additional information before authorizing an investigation. 
“Still, the readiness of the prosecutor’s office to open an investigation represents a sharp setback for President Barack Obama’s administration, which has sought several times to discourage an investigation in Afghanistan and even to avoid ICC mention of possible U.S. crimes,” Foreign Policy notes. 
And once an investigation is underway, Bennis noted, the ICC prosecutor will be faced with “the question of how far up the chain of command do you go.” 
“Do you start and stop with the soldier who tortured and abused detainees? This is what happened with Abu Ghraib,” Bennis explained. “Individual soldiers were slapped on the wrist. Their commanders who set the standards that said it was okay to humiliate and sexually abuse people, to tie them up naked in a dog collar and take pictures of it—the commander establishes the tone of what their work entailed, but that was never considered.” 
Bennis observed: “One of the questions that will have to be dealt with by the prosecutor if she decides to go forward is: do you go all the way up? Do you go after George W. Bush for using torture as a part of U.S. strategy? TAGS:",0
1169,"In a Champion’s Corner, a Real Coach Who Inspired One on ‘The Wire’ - The New York Times","BALTIMORE  —   The FedEx package containing the junior lightweight championship belt, intended for Gervonta Davis, arrived at the gym too early in the day. Davis often trains late into the night, running the streets of Baltimore, and sleeps until midday. So it was his coach Calvin Ford  —   he sleeps much less, sometimes just an hour a night  —   who found the   note when he got to Upton Boxing Center, a gym in one of the city’s most blighted neighborhoods. Ford, along with Kenny Ellis, another of Davis’s coaches, runs the training sessions at Upton five nights a week, showing young people the angles of the trade and keeping them off the same streets that Davis makes his training ground. The coaches have been involved with fighting, in one way or another, for most of their lives. Ellis, 49, is a bearded former amateur boxer who has coached at Upton since 2005. And Ford, 52, was once a violent lieutenant in the   drug organization, which controlled parts of West Baltimore in the 1980s. “If I had to shoot you, I’d shoot you,” Ford said. “If I had to stab you, I’d stab you. If I had to beat you up with my hands, I’d beat you up with my hands. ” In 1988, Ford was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy. He served 10 years in a federal prison, where he learned to box. He started coaching after he was released, eventually cultivating a national amateur champion. That attracted the attention of Ed Burns, a police detective who had investigated Ford  —   and who became one of the creators of the HBO series “The Wire. ” He used Ford as a model for the character known as Cutty, an   who opened a gym after realizing that the streets he returned to had grown harder than he could handle. Today, Ford is a   man who wears track suits and reading glasses secured by a bejeweled chain, a jarringly endearing detail for someone who teaches others how to inflict pain efficiently. And he is a father figure to dozens of children who have been coming to him for nearly two decades for lessons that reach far beyond a   round. Davis, his first world champion, and the youngest living professional titleholder, has been called the future of boxing by no less an authority than Floyd Mayweather Jr. When Davis, 22, entered the gym a few hours later to find a heavily taped cardboard box on the reception desk, it was Ford who handed him the scissors. Inside was a   belt with a large gold logo of the International Boxing Federation, earned with a   knockout of José Pedraza, who was heavily favored, in Brooklyn on Jan. 14. “Strap me up,” Davis said through a stifled grin. Ford, wearing a beanie with #STRAPSEASON printed on the front, put the belt on the      Davis. The new champion posed for a picture under banners that included Angelo Ward, who trained here before he was shot to death in 2012, and a scowling version of Davis’s younger self, draped in belts and medals a decade ago. Now, with a new belt over his shoulder, Davis glowed. “I might walk up and down the avenue,” he said, gesturing to the street outside. Last year, 318 people were killed in Baltimore, the   homicide total for the city on record 2015 was worse. So far this year, the city is averaging nearly a murder a day. Ford and Ellis know children who were  —   and still are  —   linked to those troubling statistics. Children, forced to fend for themselves after the killing of a parent, slipping into the current of incarceration. Young men with no prospects other than the easiest one available  —   the economy of addiction. Davis, whose mother struggled with drug abuse during his youth and whose father spent time in prison for selling drugs, is one of the fortunate ones. Others have not been so lucky. “Kids fall out of school because they saw the kid that they hang with get gunned down in the street,” Ellis said. After witnessing a murder, “you got to go to school the next day!” he added. “How can you do a test? How can you pass?” The kids who come through the gym’s doors at least have a chance to learn how to cope with the hopelessness outside, where, Ellis said, violence claims “a body every day. ” “Sometimes you hear gunshots, you look around the gym, like, ‘We got some in here that ain’t getting shot,’” he said. Upton is not far from where Freddie Gray was arrested in 2015, leading to the ride in a police van that left him with a spinal cord injury that killed him a week later. The drugstore that was looted and burned during the riots after his funeral is six blocks away. The neighborhood has the largest percentage of returning criminal offenders in the state, said Nick Mosby, a former mayoral candidate and City Council member who is now a state legislator. “Any barometer of success of a community, unfortunately in that ZIP code, will typically tilt towards a very unhealthy community,” said Mosby, whose wife, Marilyn, was the state’s attorney who prosecuted the Baltimore police officers charged in Gray’s death. (None were convicted.) “Poverty level, education level, unemployment rate, health disparities, you name it. ” Mosby said the children here were facing adult issues. “At the age of 7, 8, 9, 10, they’re taking care of themselves, they’re taking care of younger siblings, they’re going out, figuring out what they’re going to eat every day. ” Upton, where it costs $65 a year to train, is a refuge. The city funds the gym, though for many years Ford helped out of his own pocket  —   including paying for trips to    competitions. “You don’t know how many cars I ran through,” Ford said, laughing. Such sacrifice has helped generate good will in the community. Upton stands apart. “You notice when you walked up on the corners, you ain’t see nobody standin’ on my corners,” Ford said. “They ain’t gonna have that nonsense around us. That show you that the people  —   city, street people  —   cares about what we are doing. ” Even with Davis’s success, and the national attention it has brought to Upton, the loss of previous fighters  —   those who the coaches said decided to “go left” and give in to the streets  —   weighs heavy. Ray Davis, a fighter Ellis trained as a teenager, is in jail after ending up on his own when his father was shot at a corner store. Ronald Gibbs, a    nationally ranked amateur, was stabbed in the heart in 2012 in a dispute defending his sister. That same year, Ward, the fighter under whose banner Gervonta Davis had his picture taken, was shot nine times. He was two fights into his professional career. “Every day, his friends would come here and wait for him to finish training so they could run the streets,” Ellis said of Ward. “I said, ‘Man, you can’t have one foot in the streets and one foot in the gym. It’s not gonna work. ’” The day that Ward was killed, Ellis said, he was in his car when he received the text. “And where he got killed was like three minutes from where I was driving, so I drove around there. And they had the yellow tape around him. ” After locking his belt in its case, Gervonta (pronounced   ) Davis drove a few blocks northwest and stood in front of the home he once shared with his mother and grandmother, a bitter wind tunnel of a block dotted with abandoned rowhouses. Garbage spilled into an alley framed by a rowhouse with no roof. An open Bible lay on a stoop, its pages fluttering. Davis pointed out a cactus a few doors down. He used to touch it every day as he walked to and from the elementary school at the end of the block, a child’s personal challenge to himself ahead of a career of stinging hands. When he was 7, Davis and one of his older brothers moved in with his grandmother, after bouncing between a group home and their uncle’s house. Being new to West Baltimore, the boys were quickly forced to defend themselves. Davis’s mother, Kenya Brown, said school officials who had contacted her about his frequent fighting had told her that he was “a menace to society,” but she insisted he was not an instigator. After her brother took Davis to Upton, and he took to the sport, “people really started trying him more,” she said. “He was   always been short,” said Brown, 43. “He had to get staples because somebody hit him in the head. ” At his gym, Ford has a policy: If one of his fighters disrespects a teacher or starts a fight at school, the fighter has to spar with everyone in the gym that night. For Davis, it was less a stick and more a carrot. “He loved it,” Ford said. “I used to have to bring guys from different cities come down here that was bigger than him, just to punish him, and then he was beatin’ them up. ” Davis’s father, Garrin, said Upton allowed his son to avoid the lure of the streets that ensnared so many others. But it took work. “He made a lot of sacrifices,” said Garrin Davis, who got clean after his last stint in prison. “A lot of the friends that he had, because he made the choice to come here, he didn’t end up where they at. ” Gervonta Davis’s defensive instincts in the ring, and his calm demeanor, hew to the style of Mayweather, who has taken on the dual role of being Davis’s promoter and mentor. He is undefeated in 17 professional fights. All but one of his victories was by knockout. His success presents new challenges: the thorny world of professional boxing, and the rigors of grooming and marketing himself to be a    star. And then there are the myriad voices in his ear. Between rounds at the Pedraza fight in January, Davis had information coming at him from the coaches in his corner and from Mayweather, who was vociferously dispensing advice from ringside. “I’ve been navigating him for years,” Ford said, ”so he’s always gonna hear my voice. But Floyd’s been to that land I haven’t been to. So he have to listen to him. ” With those challenges, however, comes opportunity. Davis’s aptitude for boxing is inexorably linked to his troubled background: There is not much in the ring that can hurt him more than the tentacles of his city’s drug trade already have. And that gives him an authenticity that rings true for his community. “His whole stance, his whole posture, his whole demeanor is Baltimore,” said Mosby, who has taken Davis to schools and juvenile prisons for outreach talks. “And these kids recognize that. Young folks will get behind an individual like Gervonta, more so than any policy that we’re able to create, more so than any other public service announcement, any other potential opportunity. ” When Davis won his title in Brooklyn in January, Ford and Mosby said, a surprisingly large contingent seemed to have made the trip to support him. “You couldn’t have told me we weren’t in Baltimore,” Mosby said. The enthusiasm from the city for one of its own is not lost on Davis. He and Ford want his next fight to be in Baltimore it would the first title bout here for a world champion from the city. Davis has chosen to remain in Baltimore, rather than uproot himself to Las Vegas to be in Mayweather’s immediate circle. By staying, he believes, he can honor the people who helped raise him  —   Ford and Ellis. “More than myself, they deserve the belt,” Davis said. “They go through a lot. You got to look at it. The people before me, the boxers that they lost. People that they put their blood, sweat and tears into. And the fighters that ‘go left,’ it’s not right for Calvin and Kenny. ”",0

Select Page After terrorizing America with Zika scaremongering, Washington Post now admits Zika virus doesn’t cause brain deformities after all 
Posted by Madeline | Oct 26, 2016 | 2016 , Daily Blog | 0 | Thanks Nancy!
Natural News 
(NaturalNews) The entire leftist media is not merely dishonest and corrupt, their science writers are unbelievably stupid and ill-informed about nearly everything in the natural world. Today, after months of printing fear-inducing “Zika terrorism” stories that scared America half to death while convincing the government to funnel billions of dollars into Zika vaccine research for Big Pharma, the Washington Post now admits it had no idea what it was talking about . 
But rather than admitting its own science writers were scientifically illiterate propagandists pushing quack narratives as news, the paper now blames other scientists for the gross error by publishing a headline that’s once again dishonest and deceptive: “Scientists are bewildered by Zika’s path across Latin America,” it proclaims. 
Bewildered about “Zika’s path?” The story headline should actually read, “Zika HOAX revealed… it doesn’t cause brain damage after all.” (Read it at this link .) Washington Post has been shamelessly pushing the Zika HOAX for months… with no apology to readers 
In the story, writers Dom Phillips and Nick Miroff essentially reveal that what the Washington Post has been writing about the Zika virus has been based entirely in government propaganda and pandemic lies pushed by the CDC, which of course has close ties to the criminal vaccine industry: 
Nearly nine months after Zika was declared a global health emergency, the virus has infected at least 650,000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including tens of thousands of expectant mothers. 
But to the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil. 
Yes, the Washington Post now says the scientists are “bewildered” that their apocalyptic scare stories that caused female athletes to skip out on the Rio Olympics and scared tens of millions of Americans into poisoning themselves with DEET (a neurotoxic chemical) turned out to be total hogwash. DEET, by the way, combines with carbamate class pesticides to cause neurological dysfunction in humans , which coincidentally increases the number of people who watch CNN or read the Washington Post. 
For the record, no one who reads Natural News is surprised by this revelations that has left mainstream scientists “bewildered.” It’s not bewildering to me. I called Zika a total hoax from day one, pointing out that the brain deformities were caused by larvacide chemicals dumped into the water supply , not by Zika. See some of my stories that clearly spelled all this out months before the Washington Post had any clue what they were writing about: 
March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY! Obama wants to funnel $1.8 billion for vaccine research and more 
I even published a mini-documentary revealing the published science that shows how DEET insecticide causes brain damage in humans. You can watch it at this link or view the video below: 
If anyone from the Washington Post bothered to read Natural News and learn about real science, they would have learned that Zika has infected tens of millions of people throughout South America for decades , with absolutely no measurable increase in neurological deformations. (But facts be damned, the WashPost had a panic to push!) Nation after nation records tens of thousands of infections with ZERO birth defects… 
Despite the factual reality of the situation, the state-controlled propagandists writing for rags like the Washington Post — a bogus newspaper that has lost all credibility in the minds of intelligent people — continued to pummel home their kooky science theories that claimed much of the U.S. South would be overrun by brain damaging mosquitoes, turning Southerners into shrunken-brained mutants while pregnant women fled northward to survive the airborne insect onslaught. 
Instead, nothing happened . No explosion in shrunken-headed babies. No wave of birth defects across Florida, even as city officials desperately bombarded their own cities with brain-damaging insecticides. No national emergency declared by Obama to bring back DDT and eradicate baby-murdering mosquitoes by dousing our open streets with thick clouds of organophosphate neurotoxins. 
Instead, the rate of neurological birth defects in most countries approached zero. Via the Washington Post’s own graphic: (partial list) 
Venezuela: 60,791 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects Honduras: 31,933 Zika infections… ONE birth defect Guadalupe: 30,969 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects Puerto Rico: 29,084 Zika infections… TWO birth defects Mexico: 4,837 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects 
From the WashPost article: 
Brazilian officials were bracing for a flood of fetal deformities as Zika spread this year to other regions of the country, Marinho said. However, “we are not seeing a big increase.” 
Gee, really? 
The vast majority of the brain defects, it turns out, came from just one small region of Brazil. A total of 2,033 children are so far recorded with neurological defects there, even while most other countries throughout the region had ZERO birth defects (or near zero). 
So what gives? Zika mosquitoes apparently carry geopolitical maps so they can solely target Brazil 
You don’t have to be a genius to figure out that the stupid science theories of the mainstream media are total hokum and bunk . If Zika really did cause brain defects, it would have spread all across South America by now. It would have spread into Florida, California, Mississippi and Louisiana. It would have devastated the American South, Cuba, Haiti, Curacao and all the other island nations across the Caribbean. 
Yet the neurological defects were limited almost exclusively to Brazil. 
Somehow, if we believe the illiterate Washington Post science writers — who may in fact be the only brain damage victims of Zika in North America — mosquitoes carry MAPS to make sure they only activate their brain damage voodoo in Brazil . 
“…[A]lthough the outbreak has spread this year to more than 50 nations and territories across the Western Hemisphere, U.N. data shows just 142 cases of congenital birth defects linked to Zika so far outside Brazil,” says WashPost. 
Yes, my friends: GPA-carrying Zika mosquitoes are very careful to limit their pandemic voodoo to just one region of Brazil. By sheer coincidence, that’s the same region where larvacide chemicals were dumped into the public water supply. 
Apparently, there isn’t a single “official” scientist in the entire global government who has thought to test the water. Just freaking WOW… Let’s throw these morons out of power in every election, okay? They don’t deserve any positions of authority over anyone else. They’re all so incredibly stupid, they couldn’t survive at all unless they functioned as parasites on the taxpayers. They aren’t giving up hope just yet… science writers desperately hope for more brain damaged babies to prove them right 
Enthusiasm for more brain damaged babies runs high at the Washington Post, which explains why they are all in for Hillary Clinton, the candidate of choice for brain damaged adults . Writing with a sense of real enthusiasm, the Washington Post can’t wait for more brain damaged babies to appear: 
Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 26,800 cases of Zika. More than 7,000 pregnant women could be infected by the end of the year, according to the CDC. (Yippee?) 
And now, the loony tunes quack science of the Zika “scientists” goes apoplectic, grasping for silly metaphors to try to obscure the fact that they are all stupid beyond belief . Via the WashPost: 
“Now we’ve settled on Zika as the smoking gun, but we don’t know who pulled the trigger,” said Marques, speaking from Recife, where he is working with government researchers. 
Huh? Wha? The metaphor doesn’t even make any sense. 
Maybe the problem is too much fornicating. Seriously, this is now part of their idiotic theory: 
“Sexual habits and hygiene may also play a role,” he said, explaining that researchers are looking at whether sexual transmission can infect the uterus and placenta with the virus, potentially exposing the fetus to elevated risk. “We suspect the villain has an accomplice, but we don’t know who it is,” Marques said. 
Huh? Do they seriously think that people only have sex in Brazil but not other South American countries? Where does the Washington Post find these morons? I’m a real scientist saying all this 
As you read all this, remember that I have rapidly become one of the world’s leading research scientists on the quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts using mass spec instrumentation. I led the team that developed the most pioneering (and accurate) CBD mass spec analysis method in existence today. You can read about it at this link . I also routinely test water, food and environmental samples for heavy metals, pesticides and a multitude of chemical contaminants. When I say these Zika scientists are complete morons, that’s the educated opinion of an accomplished scientist correctly pointing out the lunacy of Zika scaremongering. 
I could have solved this entire problem in the first few days by analyzing and detecting brain-damaging larvacide chemicals in the public water supply in Eastern Brazil. The entire project would have taken just a few days and cost almost nothing. Instead, Obama handed $1.8 billion to the vaccine companies in the midst of the Zika panic pushed by laughable rags like the Washington Post. It’s all a racket, of course, just like their coverage of elections and political candidates. Everything you read at the Washington Post is a deception of one kind or another . The paper exists solely to promote the propaganda of the state so that the population can be manipulated and controlled. The Washington Post exists to terrorize the citizens with fascist propaganda parading as science 
As you’ve also learned by now, the corrupt leftist establishment of junk science, criminal politicians and idiotic journalists isn’t interested in legitimate scientific solutions . They all function as extensions of a fascist state that must routinely terrorize its citizens with pandemic boogeyman scare stories in order to demand absolute obedience to the vaccine mandates that actually do damage the brains of children. 
Thus, SCIENCE be damned. They’ve got an agenda to push, and it doesn’t matter to them whether that agenda is based on a single shred of real science. Zika is dangerous because they told you so, in exactly the same way they told you Hillary Clinton is totally honest, Obamacare would make health care more affordable, there’s no such thing as voter fraud in America, and GMOs and vaccines are really, really good for you. 
So you can put down the DEET and stop poisoning your skin like an obedient idiot. Yes, it was all a scam. Yes, the official “science” was totally rigged. Yes, the media lied to you yet again. Yes, the CDC is a criminal racket. Yes, all the health “officials” were completely full of s**t. And no, Zika is not going to cause your babies to be born with shrunken heads. VACCINES, on the other hand, will most definitely cause brain damage, as they still contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin the Washington Post ridiculously insists becomes magically neutralized when you inject it into the body of a child.

1171,David Bowie’s Seal of Approval Bolsters Art at Auction - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   One of the most influential musicians and style icons of his generation, David Bowie, who died in January, was less well known as an art collector. But as he told Michael Kimmelman, The New York Times critic, in 1998, “Art was, seriously, the only thing I’d ever wanted to own. ” On Thursday evening, Sotheby’s launched its   “ ” sale, an auction of some 350 works, or about 65 percent of his total collection, on behalf of Mr. Bowie’s estate. Buoyed by the huge amounts of publicity and public interest, the   sale of 47 lots tripled its low estimates raising 24. 3 million pounds, or $30. 3 million. The collection of “The Man Who Fell to Earth” created a string of 12 auction highs for artists as the allure of the David Bowie provenance pushed the values of Modern British art to a new level. Among the works with wide international appeal, a   Basquiat painting, “Air Power,” from the collection of Mr. Bowie  —   who played Andy Warhol in Julian Schnabel’s 1996 movie “Basquiat”  —   sold for £7. 1 million with fees, or about $8. 8 million, against a low estimate of £2. 5 million, or $3. 3 million. It sold in the room to a European collector who declined to give her name. The 1984 acrylic and oil stick composition, painted in shades of brown and red and featuring one of the artist’s trademark   masks, had been bought by the British musician in 1995 at Christie’s in London for $120, 122. Though at times the    room was subdued, and at times there was more posting of pictures on Instagram than bidding, competition on the telephones ensured some exceptional prices. After an early phase of acquiring Memphis Group furniture and design objects (about 100 lots will be offered by Sotheby’s on Friday) Mr. Bowie began systematically buying art only in 1993, in his   after a chance encounter with his first adviser, Kate Chertavian. But from that point on he became passionately acquisitive. The core of his collection is 20th century British art  —   so called Mod Brit such as Peter Lanyon and David Bomberg and Ivon Hitchens  —   which at times made his taste look like that of a retired English businessman rather than an   pop star. Yet his multifaceted creative life also made him an admirer of German Expressionist prints, Outsider Art, Marcel Duchamp, Damien Hirst and African contemporary. “Bowie was a true collector,” said Christina Shearman, a   art adviser based in New York, where Mr. Bowie lived during his final years. “His acquisitions were not commercially motivated he cared about the art, not the market. His was a deeply personal, eclectic collection, reflecting his British roots and his real passion for art. ” The collection took up all eight rooms of Sotheby’s   exhibition space and attracted 37, 608 visitors during the   exhibition  —   a record for any auction at Sotheby’s in London, according to the company’s press office. The art trade predicted that Frank Auerbach’s expressive and thickly impasted 1965 “Head of Gerda Boehm,” estimated at £300, 000 to £500, 000, would fly. The hammer finally fell at £3. 8 million, or $4. 7 million, to a telephone bidder. The price was a new auction high for the artist. “I want to sound like that looks,” Mr. Bowie had said of the painting in the 1998 interview with The New York Times. He had bought the work, whose   paint layer was still not completely dry, according to conservators, in 1995 at Christie’s for $87, 102. Another work with international appeal was Damien Hirst’s psychedelic 1995 spin canvas, “Beautiful, hallo,   painting,” which the artist had made in collaboration with the musician (who wore a brand new, quickly ruined suit). Measuring seven feet in diameter, this sold for £785, 000, or roughly $975, 000, against an estimate of £250, 000 to £350, 000. Mod Brit has in the past been a niche national market, but Sotheby’s ramped up the cataloging of Mr. Lanyon’s imposing 1961 black and white abstract, “Witness,” by calling it a “great American painting. ” Mr. Lanyon was born, lived, and died in Cornwall, in the far west of England, but the painting’s resemblance to contemporary works by   greats such as Robert Motherwell and Franz Kline helped it achieve £797, 000, just under $1 million, to another telephone bidder against an estimate of £250, 000 to £350, 000. The price was also an auction high for the artist, whose 1960s abstracts were influenced by glider flights. All the lots sold but total success was ensured by lowering reserve prices on works that failed to attract much presale interest. That included Francis Picabia’s enigmatic   painting of a seated mythological figure, “Mendica,” one of Mr. Bowie’s earlier art purchases, bought at auction in 1988. Estimated at £ £800, 000, it was knocked down for £401, 000, or about $500, 000, with fees. “You get a sense of his character,” said Josh Andraos, an art student, 20, at the packed Wednesday preview, summing up why so many people wanted to see the art that had been owned by Mr. Bowie. “It’s very British, but it varies. It all depends on what he’s thinking and feeling. This is the head of Bowie himself. ”",0
1172,63 Hours: From Chemical Attack to Trump’s Strike in Syria - The New York Times,"PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   The decision came Thursday afternoon on Air Force One on the way to Florida. President Trump assembled his National Security Council on his plane, some by secure video link, as the generals made the case that President Bashar   of Syria had to learn there was a price to pay. Mr. Trump was already shaken by photos his staff had shown him of children dying after the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attack  —   far more graphic than those the public had seen  —   so the president did not need a lot of convincing. “What happened in Syria is truly one of the egregious crimes, and it shouldn’t have happened,” he told reporters when he poked his head into the press cabin. “And it shouldn’t be allowed to happen. ” Two hours later at his    resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Trump gave the order to unleash 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Al Shayrat airfield in western Syria, where the chemical weapons attack originated. His generals had given him the option of delaying a day, but Mr. Trump chose not to wait. It had been only 63 hours from the chemical attack to the American strike. The bombs fall on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, in the   territory of Idlib Province. Video footage of the attack quickly surfaces, showing women and children gasping for breath and foaming at the mouth as they fight the effects of what officials later say is sarin gas, a brutal nerve agent. President Trump huddles at the White House with his military and national security advisers for what his aides now describe as an extensive briefing on the attack. The president had questions for his aides, including Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser. “He was very interested in understanding better the circumstances of the attack and who was responsible,” General McMaster later tells reporters. Mr. Trump has a series of meetings on health care, the environment and other topics, but aides say the images from Syria  —   especially those showing the suffering of small children and babies  —   weigh on him. The first public evidence of the president’s concern about the chemical attack comes from Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, who reads a statement condemning the Syrian government. He also places blame on President Barack Obama for not striking the Syrian regime in 2013. The attacks, Mr. Spicer says, are “not something that any civilized nation should sit back and accept or tolerate. ” But he does not demand that President Assad step down, and dismisses the idea as impractical: “We would look like, to some degree, rather silly not acknowledging the political realities that exist in Syria,” he says. At the White House, national security aides to Mr. Trump gather for a “restricted deputies committee meeting” to review options. The group  —   made up of the deputies to the president’s chief foreign policy advisers  —   begin vetting the options with the agencies that would have to carry them out. Members of the National Security Council arrive at the White House to review the work from the night before. Intelligence and military officials continue to investigate the attack, giving them confidence that Mr. Assad is responsible. “That confidence level has just continued to grow in the hours and days since the attack,” General McMaster later tells reporters. The evidence, he says, is increasingly associated with “the victims that are being treated and confirmation of the type of agent which was used, which is a nerve agent. ” Mr. Trump makes his first public remarks about Syria, telling a group of reporters in the Oval Office that the attacks are unspeakable. As his advisers continue working on details for a military strike, Mr. Trump remains uncharacteristically disciplined about his plans. Asked by a reporter whether he intends to take any action with regard to Syria, Mr. Trump says, “You will see. ” At a news conference in the White House Rose Garden after a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Mr. Trump says his horror at the images of “innocent children, innocent babies” choked by poison gas in the attack has led him to reassess his approach to Syria. “It’s very, very possible, and I will tell you it has already happened, that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,” Mr. Trump says, adding later: “It crossed a lot of lines for me. When you kill innocent children, innocent babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that was so lethal,” then that “crosses many lines, beyond a red line, many many lines. ” Without giving away his plans for possible military action  —   already under consideration at this point  —   Mr. Trump acknowledges that “I now have responsibility, and I will have that responsibility and carry it very proudly. ” Mr. Trump convenes a meeting of his National Security Council after lunch with the Jordanian king. For several hours in the Situation Room, the president’s top military and national security aides present him with three options for action in Syria. Aides say Mr. Trump was looking for something aggressive but “proportionate” that would be sufficient to send a signal  —   but not so large as to risk escalating the conflict. “The president asked us to focus on two options in particular, to mature those options, and he had a series of questions for us that we endeavored to answer,” General McMaster later tells reporters. Deliberations continue throughout the afternoon as military and intelligence officials focus in part on how they might use missiles to target the airfield used to launch the chemical weapons. After several hours, the president and his advisers agree to reconvene the next day. The president participates in an event honoring wounded veterans as he mulls his options. He tells the veterans assembled in the East Room that they are “real heroes” who have sacrificed for their country. “I call them America’s winners because they’re winners,” Mr. Trump says. Mr. Trump’s motorcade pulls out of the White House headed for Air Force One and then a summit meeting with President Xi Jinping of China at   . With the president on the plane are General McMaster Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff and Mr. Trump’s economic advisers. Flying through unusually turbulent weather on his way to Florida, Mr. Trump reconvenes the National Security Council, adding those on the ground via a secure video connection. His aides later describe Mr. Trump’s   as deliberate, although he is also driven by emotion at the sight of the atrocities  —   and with the power to do something about it. Mr. Trump makes up his mind to act, although aides declined to provide more details about the president’s thinking and the conversations on the plane. Mr. Spicer fields questions on the plane from reporters about the possibility of military action in Syria. “He is being presented with a lot of options,” Mr. Spicer says as Air Force One bounces wildly through pockets of rough air. “I would go back and echo the comments the president made in the Rose Garden. He is not one to telegraph those decisions until he is ready to make them. ” Mr. Trump is still on Air Force One when Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson lands in Florida to greet Mr. Xi, who has arrived a few moments earlier on his Air China plane. After the greeting, Mr. Tillerson briefs reporters at the airport about the coming meeting with Mr. Xi. Pressed by reporters on Syria, Mr. Tillerson says the United States must act. “It would seem there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,” Mr. Tillerson says of Mr. Assad, an abrupt turnaround from Mr. Spicer’s comments about 48 hours earlier. “We are considering an appropriate response for this chemical weapons attack. A serious matter requires a serious response. ” Air Force One lands in Palm Beach, and the president is whisked to    and heads into another meeting with the National Security Council. By this point, the military options have been winnowed to a Tomahawk cruise missile strike at Al Shayrat airfield. American intelligence has tracked the planes that carried out the attacks and determined that they were Syrian government warplanes that had departed from and returned to the base. “It was important during the president’s deliberations,” General McMaster says. Aides say Mr. Trump was determined to display some form of strength, but also was aware of the difficulties looming with Russia once the strikes became known. Before the meeting ends, Mr. Trump formally says the missile strikes are a “go. ’’ Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, who arrives at    just after 5 p. m. pose for pictures with their wives. Mr. Trump is seated hunched over on a couch in the middle of one photo. A reporter yells out, “Have you been presented with options on Syria?” Mr. Trump ignores the question as reporters are led out. The formal dinner with Mr. Xi begins. From a phone line in a small, nondescript room at the sprawling Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar  —   the United States’ air war command for the region  —   American commanders begin warning their Russian counterparts of an imminent strike at the airfield. They do this under a “deconfliction” agreement with Moscow to try to prevent an unintended confrontation between the two countries. But the Americans give the Russians the warning no more than 90 minutes before the strike, according to one American official. In other words, it is a notification rather than a consultation. The conversation is described as lengthy. The Russians do much of the talking. At 2:40 a. m. local time in Syria, two destroyers, the U. S. S. Porter and the U. S. S. Ross  —   already in position in the eastern Mediterranean  —   fire 59 Tomahawk missiles at the airfield. In Washington and at    the president’s advisers  —   Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Tillerson and General McMaster among them  —   begin notifying foreign leaders and members of Congress that the missile strikes have begun. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, gets a call from Mr. Pence. As Mr. McConnell later tells reporters, Mr. Pence “explained the rationale, how they were doing it, and I thought it made a lot of sense and would be a strike that would be noticed, not some kind of pinprick. ” The cruise missile strike targets aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, radars, an air defense system, ammunition bunkers and fuel storage sites. American planners have avoided targeting sites where they suspect chemical agents might be stored. Dinner wraps up at   . As the missiles are about to hit their targets, Mr. Trump pulls Mr. Xi away from the other guests and informs him of the strike. Aides describe it as a brief,    discussion. The Chinese delegation leaves    after the dinner ends. Mr. Trump assembles his national security team and other top advisers in a secure room at    after the strikes. A photograph of the meeting, distributed by Mr. Spicer on Friday, shows the president at a small table with General McMaster, Mr. Priebus, Mr. Bannon, Mr. Tillerson and Jared Kushner, the president’s    and adviser. Others, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross and Dina Powell, the deputy national security adviser for strategy, are also in the room. On a secure video screen, according to Mr. Spicer, are Mr. Pence Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Reporters are called in for a statement that Mr. Trump delivers to announce the strikes. The military action, he says, is in the “vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. ” The statement is organized so quickly that reporters are unable to broadcast it live. They record it to be aired soon after the rush also means the sound quality is poor. But the import of his words is clear. “We ask for God’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world,” Mr. Trump says. “We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who passed. And we hope as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will in the end prevail. ”",0

1174,Lott: Police Commit More Gun Crimes Than Concealed Carry Permit Holders,"Crime Prevention Research Center’s (CPRC) John Lott points out that police are convicted of gun crime at a higher rate than permit holders. [Lott’s assessment is not for the purpose of disparaging police. Instead, it is to show that concealed carry permit holders are among the most   citizens, and their armed presence on campus is a deterrent, rather than a cause for concern.  Writing in the Hill’s May 26 column, Lott highlights the left’s claims that concealed carry permit holders make college campuses less safe. He points out that the left has reacted to proposed campus carry legislation in state after state by warning that armed,   citizens on campus would make classrooms and universities more dangerous. But the danger has not materialized, even though campus carry has been in effect in some states for 14 years. For example, it has been the law in Colorado since 2003 and in Utah since 2004. It has become law in numerous other states since then, including Arkansas and Georgia this year. But where are the crimes? The Wild West shootouts? The bullets whistling through the air on campus carry campuses? These are no where to be found because concealed carry permit holders are generally not criminals. Lott explains that the left opposed   concealed carry when it began to sweep the country in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and they used the same arguments then that they use now when decrying arming   citizens for   on campus. They largely argue that only trained   should be armed on campus. They intimate that allowing students to be armed will only lead to a more dangerous campus setting. Lott counters, “Permits have been revoked for   violations at rates of thousandths of one percentage point. Civilian permit holders are less likely than police officers to be convicted of a firearms violation. ” He links to a CPRC study that shows that from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2007, the yearly rate of misdemeanors and felonies by   police officers was . 102 percent. The yearly rate for Texas’ concealed carry permit holders in the year 2015, the year campus carry was signed into law in that state, was . 0102 percent. Lott then shows that from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2007, the yearly rate for firearms violations was . 017 percent. The yearly rate for Texas’ concealed carry permit holders in 2015 was . 0024 percent.

1175,Research Traces Link Between Combat Blasts and PTSD - The New York Times,"They are among war’s invisible wounds: the emotional and cognitive problems that many troops experience years after combat explosions sent huge shock waves through their brains. Whereas the link between concussions and   stress disorder has become clearer in recent years, a specific connection between PTSD and blast waves has remained elusive. Now, a prominent neuropathologist who researches brain injuries among military personnel says his team has identified evidence of tissue damage caused by blasts alone, not by concussions or other injuries. The team’s study was published on Thursday in The Lancet Neurology. The discovery could eventually lead to better treatments and to improved head and body protection for troops exposed to   blasts, some experts said. Other researchers advised that these initial findings should be bolstered by more studies before veterans and their families read too much into them. “We talk about PTSD being a psychiatric problem  —   how people responded to the horror of warfare,” said Dr. Daniel P. Perl, the neuropathologist who led the study. “But at least in some cases, no  —   their brain has been damaged. ” “The real black box is to figure out who has this,” added Dr. Perl, who works at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. the medical school run by the Department of Defense. Even the tentative results provided some solace to Jennifer Collins, who was married to one of the five male military veterans whose damaged brains were examined in the study. Her husband, David, served 17 years in the Navy SEALs, enduring countless explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan. He retired in 2012, and steadily developed significant depression, sleeplessness and memory loss. He killed himself in March 2014. “This is proof that this man died in combat,” Ms. Collins said in a telephone interview, sobbing and struggling to find words. “It took several years to kill him, but he died in combat. This finding is further validation about what I know about my husband. ” It is unclear how many of the 2. 5 million United States service members deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were exposed to blasts. A 2008 report by the RAND Corporation suggested that the number could be about 500, 000. But some estimates suggest the problem could be greater: For example, a 2014 study of 34 living veterans from those conflicts found that a majority had experienced at least five blasts. Explosions from roadside bombs, grenades and other devices produce a wide spectrum of injuries. Beyond the shrapnel and other objects that impale the head and body, the   wind can blow troops off their feet, causing fatal head injuries and concussions on impact. Less understood is how the blast wave  —   the pulse of compressed air that shoots in all directions faster than the speed of sound and arrives before the wind  —   affects brain tissue after crashing through the helmet and skull. Blasts are also believed to compress the sternum and send shock waves through the body’s blood vessels and up into the brain. The researchers examined the brains of the five veterans who had been exposed to blasts, and compared samples with those of 16 other veterans and civilians with and without brain injuries from military service or other activities. Scar tissue in specific locations of the cerebral cortex, which regulates emotional and cognitive functioning, was found only in the   cases. All five of those men also suffered from the symptoms of PTSD, which, given the location of the scarring, suggests that a physical combat injury could have led to or exacerbated their psychological troubles, Dr. Perl said. Any such connection, now only speculative and needing further research, could lead to a better understanding of a link between combat and PTSD, said Dr. Ibolja Cernak, the chairwoman of military rehabilitation research at the University of Alberta. Dr. Cernak likened the   study published in The Lancet Neurology to the first reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy among professional football players, whose disease was linked to repetitive   brain trauma and helped explain some of their cognitive and emotional problems decades later. As with C. T. E. the damage connected to blasts does not appear on any magnetic resonance imaging test or brain scan and can be located only after death. “This could be for the military population what C. T. E. was for football players  —   enormous,” Dr. Cernak said of the research. Beyond treatment options, the findings raise the possibility that better head protection for active soldiers could ameliorate a blast wave’s damage. Dr. Ralph G. DePalma, a special operations officer in the office of research and development at the Department of Veterans Affairs, called that prospect “probably the most important aspect of this paper. ” “Looking at the mechanism of how the injury occurs and possible interventions immediately, that’s something that the Department of Defense is very interested in,” Dr. DePalma said. “We know that certain blast exposures, the angles at which the blast encounters the face and helmet matters. So you can look at protection. ” Some experts are concerned that as significant as identifying   damage in the brain can be, linking it to PTSD is premature. For example, Mr. Collins’s brain also showed signs of C. T. E. which has been found in previous autopsies of military veterans and could have contributed to his psychiatric condition. One of the other four subjects in the study had very small signs of C. T. E. but the other three showed none. “We have to be very certain  —   it’s about not jumping the gun, not jumping to conclusions about the significance of the changes we find in the brain in terms of a person’s prognosis or their symptoms,” said Dr. Ann McKee, the chief of neuropathology at the V. A. Boston Healthcare System. She and others at Boston University have identified C. T. E. in the brains of about 100 former N. F. L. players and some military veterans. “Until we really understand how those changes come about and what the changes really mean,” she added, “we won’t understand the clinical factors that lead to disability from these diseases. ” Dr. DePalma added that even if no treatments could be developed for years, soldiers should not assume that they would emerge from combat with damage from blast waves. Genetics are believed to influence whether a football player will develop C. T. E. so military combat may pose different risks to different people. “It’s not, ‘Oh my God, if I’m exposed to blasts I’m going to go crazy,’” Dr. DePalma said.",0
1177,BUSTED: Trump’s Decades-Old Claim He Donates To Charities Is Bulls**t (VIDEO),"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump likes to hold himself up as a paragon of charitable donations. But do his claims stand up to reality? Trump Charitable Donations? Almost Nothing 
The Washington Post published a piece this afternoon stating that they’ve been researching Trump’s claims for months and have come up nearly empty-handed. 
According to the Post : “After calling 420-plus charities with some connection to Trump, The Post found only one personal gift from Trump between 2008 and the spring of this year. That was a gift to the Police Athletic League of New York City , in 2009. It was worth less than $10,000.” 
The article goes on to mention Trump’s self-inflating talk and random appearances at charitable events with which he has no monetary connection. Many of those involved with the charities have felt swindled in one way or another by the Republican nominee over the years. 
It tells the story of a woman, employed by Trump, who asked him to help sponsor a gala for the Professional Women in Construction, where she was being honored. He didn’t, spent $100 on a single ticket, and then took over the microphone at the event for 15 minutes to make himself look like a big donor. 
There’s the story of the time when he was “principal for a day” at a poor school in the Bronx. He gave them a phony $1 million bill. He did manage to fork over $200 before taking off in his limo. 
Or the time when he decided to take the stage at an event to benefit children suffering from AIDS. He took the chair designated for someone who actually made a charitable donation (unlike Trump), and then posed for pictures as though he was a donor. The executive director of the charity, Gretchen Buchenholz, sent an email to the person whose chair Trump had commandeered, Steven Fisher, apologizing for Trump’s transgression: “I immediately said ‘no,’ but Rudy Giuliani said ‘yes’ and I felt I had to accede to him. I hope you can forgive me.” 
Steven Fisher’s chair happened to be right next to Giuliani’s, too. Go figure. Some Things Never Change 
The instances above are only a tiny handful of the stories laid out in the Post article. All the evidence together points to a man who talks a big game about all his various charitable donations, but who, in reality, is as miserly as Ebenezer Scrooge. 
Trump, however, continues to try to portray the image of generosity. 
An archived page for Trump’s corporate website ends his biography with these words: “He is the archetypal businessman — a deal maker without peer and an ardent philanthropist.” 
On October 20, 2016, Trump appeared as a featured speaker at the Al Smith charity dinner alongside his rival, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Despite all that we know now, despite all the questions that have been raised since he began his campaign about his charitable donations (or lack thereof), his biography in the program at the dinner contained those exact same words. 
Trump lives in a bubble. And that bubble needs to burst.

1178,Failed Kidnapping Kills Three in Mexican Border City,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   Authorities in this border city continue to probe a failed kidnapping that turned into a triple murder outside of a local junkyard. While local media have claimed that the murder was a gang hit, the victim’s relatives revealed that the case was something else. [Preliminary information points to the victims decorating a local business for a party in the Laguito Mexicano neighborhood when the shooting happened. The victims have been identified as    Jorge “Copetes” Rosales and his employees Aaron “N” and El Pepo. The murder scene is approximately six miles from this city’s downtown area.   According to the victim’s relatives, two vehicles with gunmen followed Rosales to his business where they tried to kidnap him in an apparent effort to collect a ransom. The victim tried to fight back while two of his employees rushed to his aid. The gunmen shot them and fled the area. Days after the murder, local residents reported that a second kidnapping attempt had taken place but the victims had managed to escape unharmed.  According to local residents, they have recently seen a spike in the number of kidnappings at the hands of organized crime members who are trying to supplement their incomes. As Breitbart Texas revealed, the area of Piedras Negras is famous for the kidnapping and murder of more than 300 between 2011 and 2013 in the state’s northern region. Most of the victims were incinerated inside a state prison. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

1179,CNBC: China’s Secret Plan to Crush the U.S. Space Program - Breitbart,"In a feature on Tuesday, CNBC explained how the Chinese government plans to overtake the US space program, as well as private companies such as SpaceX. [“China’s breakneck economic expansion may be flagging, but the country’s ambitions in space show no signs of slowing down,” wrote CNBC. “Alongside ongoing efforts to rival NASA by placing robotic landers, and eventually astronauts, on the moon and Mars, China’s government is increasingly looking to its burgeoning space sector to rival U. S. companies like Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which is targeting March 30 for the latest launch of its Falcon 9 rocket. ”  “The majority of China’s space ambitions remain focused on boosting Chinese prestige at home and abroad. But a push within Xi’s government to triple spending on space science as well as the emergence of a small but growing group of privately backed space   suggest that both Chinese industry and government see   economic benefits in their investments in space technologies,” they continued. “That increasing flow of capital toward both China’s   and private   tech companies could place increased pressure on NASA, and eventually on commercial space companies in the United States and Europe. ” CNBC went on to claim that the climate could change with President Trump’s shift of NASA priorities. “Budget disparities aside, many U. S.  analysts have expressed concern that NASA is reining in its ambitions as China expands its footprint in orbit and beyond,” CNBC concluded. “But that could change if President Trump decides to reenergize NASA and shift its priorities. Already he has expressed interest in trying to create a ‘Kennedy moment’ again. ” You can read the full article at CNBC.",0

Merkel previously blamed social media for anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right. 
“The algorithms must be made public, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like: what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others?"" said Merkel during a media conference in Berlin on Tuesday. 
“These algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information.” 
Google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a user’s liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a user’s own media interests. Read more Germany orders Facebook to stop collecting data on WhatsApp users 
These algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website, and comprise some of the most highly-protected trade secrets in the world, potentially worth billions. No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. 
Merkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating “bubbles” of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. 
""The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users,” warned Merkel. “This is a development that we need to pay careful attention to.” 
The internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels. German establishment raises ‘Sword of Damocles’ over social media 
This is not the first attack on social media by Merkel and her Grand Coalition government, and while the German politician advocates diversity of views, she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions that are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media. Read more AfD vows to become 3rd largest force in Germany as Merkel admits refugee crisis was ‘out of control’ 
Last month, Merkel accused AfD, the recently-established anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party, which receives overwhelmingly negative coverage in most newspapers, of “spreading their lies” through social media, as it achieves breakthroughs in regional elections around the country. 
A year ago, at the height of the refugee influx into the country, Merkel, who was first elected in 2005, was caught on a hot mic personally pressing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to clamp down on anti-migrant posts during a UN session in New York. 
A fortnight ago, the leader of Merkel’s parliamentary CDU faction, Volker Kauder, said that social media should be fined €50,000 for failing to remove “hate speech,” saying that a “Sword of Damocles” has to hang over social media. Kauder also called for warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites, to be given to those about to go on social media.

1183,Hong Kong Subway Fire Injures at Least 17 People - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   A   commute in Hong Kong turned to panic Friday evening when a man ignited an incendiary device in a crowded subway train, filling the car with flames and smoke and injuring at least 17 people. Photographs taken soon after passengers fled the burning subway car show a man, believed to have started the fire, standing on a platform as flames jumped from the tatters of his burning clothes. Other images show injured commuters, their faces wrapped in gauze, being treated by emergency workers. The police said the man, whom they identified only as a    with the surname Cheung, admitted starting the blaze and was charged with suspicion of arson. Violent crime is exceptionally rare in Hong Kong, home to one of the world’s largest subway systems. Annual ridership ranks just below that of New York, according to the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in Hong Kong. “The suspect was believed to be speaking nonsense,” said Kwok   a police district commander. “What he said didn’t make a lot of sense. ” The South China Morning Post reported that passengers heard the man say that he would “burn you to death” before lighting the device, and local television stations reported that he was carrying a document identifying him as a psychiatric patient. The police would not confirm those details, but fire officials said the blaze was caused by the ignition of a combustible material. “At this stage, we’re certain that there’s no evidence suggesting it was terrorism or an attack targeting the mass transit system,” Mr. Kwok said. Employees and commuters helped put out the flames after the train, traveling on the Tsuen Wan line, arrived at Tsim Sha Tsui station, where it was evacuated. Of the 17 people hospitalized, two were in critical condition, five were in serious condition, nine were in stable condition and one was released, according to the Hospital Authority. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Leung   expressed sympathy for the victims in a statement, and he asked the territory’s food and health secretary, Ko   to visit the hospitalized passengers. The last major arson attack on a subway train in Hong Kong occurred on Jan. 5, 2004, when a fire broke out as a train was arriving at the Admiralty station. Fourteen people were injured. That fire was set by a man using newspapers, a lighter and a bottle believed to contain gasoline.",0
1184,"As Predicted by Bill Belichick, NFL Touchback Rule Fails to Decrease Injuries - Breitbart","Against the advice of the man with perhaps the highest football IQ in the history of the NFL, the league changed its touchback rules last year, hoping the rule change would dramatically decrease injuries on kickoffs. [Well, it didn’t quite work out that way.  The NFL released the injury numbers from the first year of the touchback rule. And, according to Pro Football Talk, not much really changed, “  …    concussions on kickoffs declined slightly, from 20 in 2015 to 17 in 2016. But hamstring injuries on kickoffs increased from 11 to 13, ACL tears increased from one to four, and MCL tears increased from three to five. “On a conference call examining injury rates in the league, NFL officials said the data will be analyzed in more detail and presented to the Competition Committee, but they acknowledged that it looks more like “a natural fluctuation” than any change that could be attributed to the new touchback rule. ” Perhaps the league could have avoided all this had they listened to football genius Bill Belichick, who correctly stated that players still get concussed on kickoffs that result in touchbacks because the other ten players have no idea whether or not the return man will bring the ball out, and thus, still have to block. Not to mention that, according to Pro Football Talk, “touchbacks only increased by 2 percent in 2016. ” So not only did injuries not significantly decrease, the rule failed to even meaningfully increase the number of touchbacks. So, once again the NFL engages in a cosmetic and ineffectual rule change, which makes the game less exciting and has    chance of increasing player safety. Nor can the league say they had no warning the rule wouldn’t work, because Belichick already told them it wouldn’t work. If the Patriots win the Super Bowl next week, between this and Deflategate, it’s shaping up to be one awkward trophy presentation ceremony. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
1185,Hillary Literally Became the Definition of ‘Pathological Lying’ on Google Yesterday,"( ANTIMEDIA ) If you had happened to Google the term ‘pathological lying’ on Sunday evening, you would have been met with none other than the bright, smiling face of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Before Wikipedia administrators put a temporary lock on the entry early Monday morning, the top Google result for the term was a link to the Wiki article displaying Clinton’s photo, along with the following quote defining pathological lying:

“It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.” 
The revision history of the entry shows the picture of Clinton was originally added to the ‘pathological lying’ Wikipedia article on the morning of October 29th, but it wasn’t until the next night that the ever-vigilant internet community took notice and excitedly spread the word on Facebook and Twitter . Check out the Google Trends report for ‘pathological lying’ below:

Unsurprisingly, most reactions were supportive of the alteration to the Wikipedia article, once again showing the public’s general distrust of the presidential candidate. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last year asked voters to say the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Hillary Clinton. The most popular response was “liar,” followed by “dishonest” and “untrustworthy.” Maybe if the biggest names in journalism weren’t outright colluding with Hillary’s campaign , that poll would have been more widely reported. Maybe.
Due to the fact major media corporations are completely ignoring the corruption surrounding the Clinton campaign, it has been left to Wikileaks, independent media outlets, and the social media community to push this information into the public eye. Just a week away from the election, new evidence was discovered that prompted the FBI to announce they have reopened the criminal investigation into Hillary’s private email server.
With Republican nominee Donald Trump scheduled to appear in court to face rape allegations, there is a high possibility the next president of the United States will be facing criminal charges before they’re even inaugurated. If nothing else, this election cycle is proving that people want truth — and they’ll get creative to expose it.

1186,"Comment on St. Charles Borromeo, Patron Saint of Catechists and Seminarians by jose","Posted on November 4, 2013 by joandarc | 12 Comments 
“ If we wish to make any progress in the service of God, we must begin every day of our life with new eagerness. We must keep ourselves in the presence of God as much as possible and have no other view or end in all our actions but the divine honor. ” 
The profound and significant communication above is from St. Charles Borromeo, whose Feast Day we celebrate today, November 4th. Clearly, if we would simply use his life map as our every day goal, we would never be lost and we would always have joy, even in spite of suffering. 
St. Charles Borromeo lead the universal Church in the Counter-Reformation in the troubled but dynamic 16th century, and therefore, is associated with reform. He sought the correction of abuses and evil, addressing the excuses made for the destructive and false reformation which was spreading and creating confusion in Europe. Indeed and in fact, he is one of the great Counter-Reformers, along with Pope St. Pius V, St. Philip Neri and St. Ignatius Loyola. 
He was born on October 2, 1538 in a castle of Arona on Lake Maggiore, Italy, the second of two sons in a family of six. His father was Count Gilbert Borromeo and his mother was Margaret, a member of the Medici family. Even at the age of 12, he showed his serious and holy disposition, receiving the clerical tonsure, with another of his uncles resigning him to the Benedictine abbey of Sts. Gratinian and Felinus at Arona. At his young age, he reminded his father that the revenue, with the exception for what was spent on his necessary education for the service of the Church, was to be given to the poor and could not be applied to other more worldly uses. He learned Latin at Milan and thereafter attended the University of Pavia, and after the death of his parents, at the age of 22 he earned his doctor’s degree. 
In 1559, his uncle was chosen as Pope Pius IV, wherein Charles used all of his influence to reopen the Council of Trent in 1562, since it had been suspended in 1552. He accomplished this reopening under most difficult ecclesiastical and political climates. 
In 1563, Charles was ordained a priest and two months thereafter, was consecrated as a bishop. In this capacity, he drafted the Catechism of the Council of Trent and the reform of liturgical books and music. 
Milan failed to have an in-house bishop for some eighty years. Accordingly, Charles arrived in Milan in April of 1566 and vigorously worked for the reformation of this diocese. He sold property in the amount of thirty thousand crowns and applied the entire amount to distressed families. Charles allotted most of his income to charity, forbade himself all luxury and imposed severe penances upon himself. During the horrible plague and famine of 1576, he tired to feed sixty to seventy thousand people daily, borrowing large sums of money that required years to repay. Civil authorities fled at the height of the plague, abandoning the populace; but Charles stayed in the city where he ministered to the sick and the dying. Charles assembled the superiors of the religious communities, wherein a number of religious right away volunteered to help the stricken victims of the plague, wherein he lodged these clerics in his house. The hospital of St. Gregory looked deplorable, bringing Charles to tears, overflowing with dead, dying, sick and others suspected of being struck by the plague. St. Charles literally exhausted all his resources in relief. Indeed, houses for the sick were formed as well as temporary shelters, and lay people were organized for the clergy and a score of altars set up in the streets so that the sick could assist at public worship from their windows. He personally ministered to the dying, waited on the sick and helped those in need. The plague lasted from 1576 through 1578. 
Charles endured of all things, a speech impediment, a difficult handicap for his preaching. A friend of Charles, Achille Gagliardi, said, “I have often wondered how it was that, without any natural eloquence or anything attractive in his manner, he was able to work such changes in the hearts of his hearers. He spoke but little, gravely, and in a voice barely audible – but his words always had effect.” 
St. Charles proclaimed that children should be properly instructed in Christian doctrine and therefore, established the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine. These schools at that time numbered 740, with approximately 3,000 catechists and 40,000 pupils. And so, Charles originated “Sunday-schools.” 
No love was lost in the religious order called, “Humiliati”, being reduced to few members, but still maintaining many monasteries and great possessions. They allegedly submitted to the reform, but this was done only in form, not in substance. They tried to have the pope annul the new regulations, but those attempts were refused and they failed. So, they hatched a plot to assassinate Charles. One of the priests agreed to do so for the sum of forty gold pieces (much like Judas Iscariot if you ask me). On October 26, 1569, this priest, Jerome Donati Farina, put himself at the door of the chapel in the archbishop’s house while Charles was at evening prayers with his household. While an anthem was being sung, Charles being on his knees before the altar, this cowardly assassin discharged a gun at him, wherein Farina escaped during the confusion, but the bullet struck Charles’ clothes in the back raising a bruise. Thus, they failed to murder him. 
Nevertheless, Charles directed his energies to maintain a capable and virtuous clergy. On one occasion when an exemplary priest was sick and on death’s door, Archbishop Borromeo said, “Ah, you do not realize the worth of the life of one good priest .” Charles was indefatigable in parochial visitations 
Charles worked so hard and in 1584, his health became poor. On October 24th, while on a retreat, he became very ill. On October 29th, he started off for Milan, his diocese, wherein he arrived there on All Souls Day, November 2nd, having celebrated Mass for the last time on the previous day at his birth place, Arona. He went to bed, asking for the final sacrament of the sick, with his last words being, “Behold, I come.” He died on the 4th of November, only 46 years of age. 
Charles was formally canonized by Pope Paul V in 1610. 
Charles lived the instruction of Our Lord Jesus Christ: “…I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.” (Mt 25:35-36) St. Charles saw Jesus in his neighbor and he was always able to recognize “Jesus in Disguise.” Let us follow his example.

1187,The Biggest Secret: How Reptilian-Human Hybrids Run Our World,"“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” – Martin Luther King 

Controversy has become the mantra of the whirlwind that is David Icke ’s life over the past few decades. 

Since the early 90’s, he has challenged people’s parameters of reality suggesting that all is not what it seems in regards to how our world is run. 

David’s verdict is clear; the people that lie at the top of our power structures are hiding a sinister secret, one that would make anyone sound crazy if it were verbalized.


Since the dawn of civilized man, the ruling class have been controlled by extra-terrestrial/ dimensional beings, with an agenda which ultimately establishes the human race as mindless and robotic slaves to a system based on fear and control.

It is easy to see why this theory has attracted so much back-lash. 
“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” – Martin Luther King Controversy has become the mantra of the whirlwind that is David Icke’s life over the past few decades.

David’s verdict is clear; the people that lie at the top of our power structures are hiding a sinister secret, one that would make anyone sound crazy if it were verbalized. 

Since the dawn of civilized man, the ruling class have been controlled by extra-terrestrial/ dimensional beings, with an agenda which ultimately establishes the human race as mindless and robotic slaves to a system based on fear and control.

It is easy to see why this theory has attracted so much back-lash. 

Icke made an infamous appearance on a national television talk show in 1991 where he announced to the world that he was being channeled information which warned him of impending devastation by natural disasters. 

The ridicule which proceeded after the interview was said by Icke to be a nightmare for him and his family. He couldn’t walk down the street without being laughed at. 

Icke later states that the laughter had “set him free” in a sense, allowing him to move forward with his messages to the world without now having worry about what people thought about him. 

In the decade that followed Icke pumped out book after book, traveling the world giving long lectures on the nature of reality, testing people’s truth’s in regards to who is really running our world (4).

Today Icke leads a similar schedule, having just completed his 8 hour arena world tour which was sold out in multiple countries. 

During the extended lecture he touches upon topics such as the holographic universe, the pseudo moon matrix, and his most infamous theory regarding a reptilian hybrid race that is controlling our world. 

To begin to explain the complex theory, Icke discusses the current fear state of our world.
“The fear of what other people think is the state of perception that stops people [from] making a difference… you can only make a difference in a world of uniformity if you operate outside of that uniformity… we either take that on or we don’t, in which case nothing changes. “We are now at this place where we can go down one track and experience freedom like we’ve never even understood what freedom is. We go down the other one, the one that the control structure wants, then we’re headed for an Orwellian-fascist global state.” David Icke, The Lion Sleeps no More (3). Icke proposes that mankind has been manipulated to become “unconscious” through the use of programming by media and politics, the tyrannical control over our food, water, and air supply, the dumbing down of the masses by pharmaceutical drugs and alcohol, and the list goes on. 
“But the manipulation doesn’t stop there”, as Icke states about exploring the never ending depths of the rabbit hole. 
Quetzalcoatl – the Mesoamerican human-eating, reptilian deity 
The ruling class, the bankers, the royal family, the presidents and prime ministers , have created the illusion of being separate ruling bodies when in fact they have always been on the same “team” of sorts. 

There is a bloodline that has been strategically kept intact for ages. The Burkes Peerage and Baronetage, a comprehensive aristocratic genealogy resource, reveals that all 44 U.S. presidents have carried European royal bloodlines into office over the course of history. 

This includes Bill Clinton , the Bush family , Barack Obama, John Kerry, and so on and so forth (6). 
Portion of the global elite’s family tree 
If we truly live in a democratic system, how is it that every single person brought into office has been of French and European royal descent? What are the chances of this considering the U.S. fought for their independence of Europe in the 1700s? 

The Burkes Peerage makes a strong suggestion that elections are not really based on a public voting system, but rather they are based upon the highest percentage of royal genes.

To make things even more peculiar is the fact that Brad Pitt, Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, and Tom hanks (some of Hollywood’s biggest stars) also descend from this lineage. What could all of this imply?

Icke goes on to illuminate the theory of quantum physics, which states that our physical reality is a projection within our mind, and that at the most basic quantum level, the solidity of matter is false, existing as vibrations instead of atoms.

When the light from matter reflects into our eyes, the cells pick up the light (which travels as a wavelength measured from 390nm-700nm, the visible light spectrum) and transmutes the vibrations or wave-forms into an image within the brain. 

This is the same for sound; it is a vibration until it is decoded by the brain (Suddenly The Matrix plot doesn’t seem so far-fetched). 
The human brain can only see an extremely limited spectrum of energy, as we know there are a plethora of different forms of energy in our universe and thousands of different frequencies around us at any given moment that we cannot see, such as radio and radiation waves. 

Icke suggests that ET’s and other beings exist in our universe, but they operate at a frequency just above what the human mind is said to be able to detect(3). This could explain the strange sightings of UFO’s that seem to appear and disappear in an instant.

Could it be that the UFO’s or ET’s are advanced enough that they can raise or lower their frequency to come in and out of the visible light frequency spectrum? 

This is something that Icke says the ruling elite are aware of, knowledge that is used to manipulate mankind into thinking that our experience is limited to a 3D reality.

Icke says the reptilians control the globalists extra-dimensionally  through the manipulation of human DNA 
It is no secret today that the world is ruled by money and power. Corporations and banks have more power than the people do, and this is something that is beginning to become recognized by a large majority of the population. 

There is a world government which oversees the regulation of the entire planet and all of its systems, says Icke. This world government is called the Illuminati by many, although there are multiple names for the different levels of this organization. 

Behind the closed doors at the highest levels of government, secret societies rule with malevolence. The problem is that anyone who learns this information and speaks out publicly as a leading force against these secret societies is quickly silenced. 

John Kennedy’s assassination is a perfect example of this. In his famous last speech, not too long before he was shot, he touches upon the subject of the secret ruling class,
“The very word ‘secrecy’ is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and secret proceedings… “For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence – on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.

“It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations.” – John F Kennedy (8) 
In his arena tour, Icke discusses the disturbing events that take place behind closed doors at the annual meeting of the global leaders.
“They follow a religion that dates back to the beginning of civilization”, he states. The secret societies take part in and worship a pocket of consciousness, that most call Satanism, in which they perform esoteric rituals that entail ceremonial chanting, gratuitous sexual activities, and even blood sacrifice. 

Icke alludes to this in his seminar correlating the globalist cult to the chain of missing children and underground world of sex trafficking. 

The Catholic Church is a big player in this disturbing hidden world, Icke says. Earlier in 2013, Pope Benedict XVI became the first Pope to resign since the 1400s. 

Some argue that the real reason was due to Benedict being blackmailed for surfacing information about the Catholic Church’s ritual abuse of children and homosexuality within the Vatican (7).

Neil Brick, a victim of satanic ritual abuse, founded S.M.A.R.T (Stop Mind Control and Ritual Abuse Today) in 1995, an organization which aims to expose and put to an end to the ritual abuse of children by the Vatican and other secret power circles. 

Neil states that thousands of children are captured each year and are manipulated through mind control to perform grotesque acts involving sex and torture (5). 

Chrystine Oksana’s 1994 book, “Safe Passage to Healing”, expands on this topic:
“Ritual Abuse usually involves repeated abuse over an extended period of time. The physical abuse is severe, sometimes including torture and killing. The sexual abuse is usually painful, humiliating, intended as means of gaining dominance over the victim. “The psychological abuse is devastating and involves the use of ritual indoctrination. It includes mind control techniques which convey to the victim a profound terror of the cult members… most victims are in a state of terror, mind control and dissociation.” — Chrystine Oksana, Safe Passage to Healing Many have come forward with unsettling stories about their abuse by different power circles such as the Vatican or the secret men’s clubs like the one held annually at Bohemian Grove in California. 

This information may be difficult to process for most. Human beings are naturally compassionate for one and other; we don’t want to believe that these sorts of things happen, especially not by the hands of the people that we’ve “elected” to power. 

So what could be the true reason behind these real-life horror movie stories? Icke says that it goes far beyond the physical constraints of the visible light spectrum. 
WATCH THE VIDEO: 
Alex Jones’ secret footage of a Bohemian Grove Ritual 

“We are clearly massively missing the point. The vast majority who investigate this will not go any further…because a.) Their belief systems won’t let them and b.) They fear what other people will think about them. There is the level we see unfolding in the news, and then there is the other dimensional non-human level.

The rabbit hole goes deeper and deeper . 

“It is all about the control and programming of perception… at one level we see the dark-suits sitting at the big round table making the decisions, then at the next we have the secret societies, and then we go beyond the frequency of visible light… Satanism is a network that interacts with the beings that are controlling our vibrational state from a frequency above us.”

“Wolfgang and the Devil”, Michael Pacher, 1483 —  Note the reptilian form the devil takes on 
Icke says that these extra-dimensional beings that the globalists worship stem from the constellations Orion, Sirius, and Draco. Thousands of years ago, the reptilian beings intervened on planet Earth and began interbreeding with humans. 

Not physically, however, but rather through the manipulation of the human coding, or DNA. Icke states that it is no coincidence that humans have fundamental reptilian genetics within their brain. He refers to an excerpt from the Bible, which hints at the crossbreeding of men and “gods”,
“There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the songs of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bear children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.” – Genesis, 6:4 
Icke connects more biblical stories to the intervention of the reptilian race. He alludes to the “fall of man,” the story of how Adam and Eve became manipulated by the serpent. 

The reason, he goes on to say, that 95% of human DNA and a large majority of our brain goes unused is due to this intervention of the reptilian race, placing a limitation on our potential as conscious beings. 

These beings were more advanced in the technological sense, seeing our DNA as software which could be tainted with, creating a hybrid middle man to control the human population within the visible light spectrum. 

Half human and half reptilian, they were perceived as demi-gods at the time by the people . Icke explains that the Caduceus, the common medical symbol we see today, is based around this DNA manipulation. 

The Caduceus contains two serpents spiraling around a scepter that has wings, in the shape of the double-helix DNA strand. 

Because these hybrids at the time possessed knowledge that most didn’t, they were able to slip into positions of power, specifically in the ancient areas of Sumer, Babylon, and Mesopotamia. 

As these areas began to separate and colonize elsewhere, the reptilian bloodlines spread out, becoming the royal families of the world. 

This is said to be why the royal family maintains their genetics. Similarly, the ancient Chinese emperors believed they had the divine right to rule because they were connected to the “serpent gods”. 

Icke says there is a common theme between royalty and serpent worship around the world. This can be seen in early images of ancient cultures such as the Hindus, Cambodians, Greeks, Nordics, Africans, Native Americans, Koreans, and Australians to name a few (1).

Icke recounts in his seminar about his discussions with Credo Mutwa , a South-African based Zulu shaman, during which Mutwa tells of African legends about the Chitauri, the reptilian like “gods” who ascended from the heavens in monstrous vessels which burned through the atmosphere. 

These so called gods became the dictators of the people, taking away the potentiality and power of the human race (2, 3).
“One other thing that our people say is that the Chitauri prey upon us like vultures. They raise some of us. They fill some of us with great anger and great ambition. And they make these people they’ve raised into great warriors who make terrible war.

“But, in the end, the Chitauri do not allow these great leaders, these great war chiefs and kings, to die peacefully. “The warrior chief is used to make as much war as possible, to kill as many of his people and those he calls enemies, and then, in the end, the warrior chief dies a terrible death, with his blood being spilled by others.” (2), Credo Mutwa on the reptilian-hyrbid leaders. 
Over time these bloodlines created a sort of trans-national web of control, and as history progressed they rooted themselves deeper and deeper into the systems and structures that were developed by man. 

Today they make up the secret societies (Illuminati, etc.) which pull the strings in regards to the direction that society follows.

Read: New (Reptilian) World Order — Complete History of Reptilian Control 

They have created the ultimate prison, one without bars with the illusion of freedom keeping the masses from wanting to escape. They have created illusory lines separating countries to cause segregation among the people who are ignorant to the truth. 

They have created massive distractions with media, politics and entertainment, and they have dumbed down the general population through the poisoning of our food, air, and water supply (3).

So what is the ultimate goal of these hybrid bloodlines? Some argue it was originally for our planet’s supply of gold, which they need to stabilize the atmosphere of their own planet. Others suggest that it more has to do with tyranny. 

The New World Order (NWO) isn’t a new concept to most. In the early 90’s President Bush publicly announced that the NWO was the eventual goal for the United States. A NWO is not the peaceful state of freedom that these leaders try to present it as. 

The NWO is an Orwellian state based around absolute control in which the population is maintained under 500 000 million people. It takes away the power of the public, turning them into mindless robots who do the bidding of the fortunate ruling class; a more extreme case of the current state of the world. 

It is a one world government that calls all the shots. This is what the hybrids want; power and control. Whatever the intention is behind the control structures, it is obvious that it is not in harmony with the well-being of mankind or the planet.

Icke ends his seminar with a glimpse of hope for humanity, stating that its time for humanity to get up off of our knees and to take matters back into our own hands,

“What if vast numbers of people say ‘well we’re not doing it’? They’d have no power whatsoever. Their power comes in our acquiescence. What we need isn’t compliance, what we need is a global non-comply-dance. [They] cannot grant our freedom, nor can [they] take it away.” 

David Icke’s theories may be difficult to grasp for some, but what is undeniable is the fact that when you listen to his propositions, he makes a damn good argument with his case. In the end it is up to you to decide what truth you wish to believe. 

We encourage you to do your own research. This is a time of great change in the world. The people have begun to wake up, deciding for themselves what resonates as truth and what doesn’t. 

We live in an era of mass information sharing, thanks to advent of the internet. People are connecting from all over the world to share knowledge and create change on a massive scale. The most important thing for each of us to do during this time is to become informed as much as possible. 

Ultimately it is we who have the power to create what we want as a society. When we tune into our true potential, anything is possible.

Fear will not create this change; it will only feed the old systems which the ruling class have already established. Love will be the forerunner for the fast approaching new Earth.

1188,"BRINK OF WAR: UK sends TANKS, DRONES and 800 SOLDIERS to Russian border as tensions grow","By JOEY MILLAR 
The show of force comes just days after the Russian leader’s fleet passed near the British coast. 
British soldiers will travel to Estonia in what is one of the biggest build-ups of foreign firepower on Russia’s border since the Cold War. 
The move will take place next spring, with Denmark and France also taking part in the huge military exercise. 
The project was revealed by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, who said the UK’s forces will be “fully combat-capable”. 
He said: “That battalion will be defensive in nature, but it will be fully combat-capable. 
“This is about two things: reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence. 
“This is not simply a trip-wire. This is a serious military presence.” 
Cold War-style tensions between Moscow and Washington took a further dip this week after the US revealed plans to station marines in Norway – just a few hundred miles from the border with Russia. 
Officials in Norway and the US said they were considering a deal for extra equipment and training for the Scandinavian country.

1190,U.S. Strike on Syria Brings Fleeting Hope to Those Caught in Brutal Conflict - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   Six years of war in Syria have ravaged the life of Ebrahim Abbas, 27. Mr. Abbas, a computer technician, was detained for protesting against the Syrian government, besieged in his hometown and shot in the stomach, and watched his brother die in a shelling attack. He escaped, but his father, a diabetic, died later from a lack of medicine, and his mother was killed by a sniper. It was from his refuge in Turkey that Mr. Abbas heard about President Trump’s decision to launch 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base to punish President Bashar   for a chemical weapons attack. It felt good. “Watching a world power taking revenge for civilians against the Syrian regime gave me a surge of hope and made me a bit optimistic,” Mr. Abbas said. But the attack will not bring back all that he has lost nor help him return home soon. In a measure of how entrenched the war is, there were new airstrikes on Saturday on the town targeted in the   attack, with at least one person killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strike on the air base was the most direct, deliberate military intervention by the United States against Mr. Assad’s forces since the war began. Mr. Trump said he had launched the strike because he was moved by images of women and children choking on poison gas. “That was a horrible, horrible thing,” he told reporters after the chemical attack. “And I’ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn’t get any worse than that. ” But while the strike on Thursday appeared intended to limit the chances of retaliation, Mr. Trump has offered no proposals to end the war or to assuage the vast human suffering it has generated, sending fleeing Syrians across the globe. Yasmine Mashaan, a pharmacy technician from the town of Muhassan in eastern Syria who lost several brothers to the conflict, said the strike was unlikely to change much for her and her family. And she doubts Mr. Trump’s motivations. “It would be great if he continued this in the direction of saving more civilians or establishing a safe zone, but after his racist speeches and   policy, I think the strike is more for popularity,” said Ms. Mashaan, who is now in Germany after fleeing there with her family. “But judging by how fast he intervened in Syria and how powerful it was, then we might be going somewhere with it. ” The number affected by the conflict boggles the mind. What began as an uprising in 2011 escalated into a civil war as protesters took up arms to respond to the government’s repression and seek its ouster. Over time, countries like the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia backed the rebels, while Russia and Iran helped Mr. Assad. As chaos spread, extremist groups gained ground. Al Qaeda infiltrated the rebel movement, while the jihadists of the Islamic State seized territory that extended into Iraq. Now more than 400, 000 people have been killed, a figure roughly equal to the population of Tulsa, Okla. or Oakland, Calif. Many more have been maimed. Half of Syria’s prewar population of 22 million have fled their homes, a number close to the population of Belgium. Five million of those are registered refugees abroad, according to the United Nations. Most are in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, where 70 percent live on less than $3. 84 a day, less than the cost of some lattes at Starbucks. Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which does aid work in Syria, said he could not comment for or against the strike by the United States, but he said that “they do not solve any of my urgent priorities. ” For the humanitarian situation to improve, aid workers would need more border crossings for getting aid into the country, assurances that air and ground forces would not attack hospitals and better access to besieged and suffering communities, including nearly 400, 000 people within an hour’s drive of Damascus, the capital. “It is heartbreakingly frustrating to be a humanitarian worker and to have the resources and the supplies but not to be able to reach these people,” Mr. Egeland said. Within the conflict’s statistics are countless stories of torture, detention, forced conscription, families torn apart and normal lives downgraded rapidly or simply cut short. Even some Syrians who welcomed the strike questioned why, after all of the war’s brutality, it was the chemical attack this past week that had brought a show of force against Mr. Assad. “Of course chemicals are weapons of mass destruction,” said a doctor east of Damascus who treated victims of the first major chemical attack in Syria, in 2013. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared government reprisal. “But what about sieges? What about killing children? Isn’t it wrong for children to grow up without knowing Tom and Jerry? Without knowing chocolate?” President Barack Obama did not respond militarily to a chemical attack in 2013, despite having called the use of such weapons a “red line. ” Since then, the doctor has watched the world move on while the siege of his area has tightened, he said through Skype. He said he had learned to live with less electricity, less fuel, less clean water and less food. “We are living like ancient people, how they depended on themselves, how they used wood to make fires,” he said. “It is a hard life. ” He expected more from the United States and its allies after the 2013 attack, what he called “a position that was appropriate for the free world. ” But the result was an agreement, brokered by Russia, for Mr. Assad to give up his chemical weapons. “The solution to the crime was a deal to take away the weapon but leave the criminal,” the doctor said. The strike by the United States made him mildly optimistic that Mr. Trump would intervene more forcefully than Mr. Obama had. “Trump is a closed box that has started to open,” he said. “Soon we will see what’s inside. ” While conflict monitors said that Mr. Assad’s forces and their allies had caused the bulk of the war’s deaths with their advanced weapons, communities loyal to Mr. Assad have also paid a heavy price. Tens of thousands of Syrian soldiers have been killed, and religious minorities, secularists and others who view Mr. Assad as a symbol of a unified Syria have continued to fight out of fear that they would be eradicated if Islamist rebels take over the country. Others have had to face both the government and the jihadists. Ms. Mashaan, the pharmacy technician, said her family’s troubles began when she intervened to stop a security officer from beating her brother for protesting. The officer beat her instead, breaking her arm. As the uprising spread, Ms. Mashaan, 36, and her five brothers joined in. Soon, her brothers and husband were arrested and tortured, in some cases coming home with their fingernails removed, she said. Then they began to die. One was killed when security forces fired into a crowd of protesters, she said. Another was shot in their home by a sniper. Yet another disappeared. She later recognized his face in a trove of photos of bodies smuggled out of a prison near Damascus. As violence spread, Ms. Mashaan’s family fled to a refugee camp in the countryside, but it was soon taken over by a new force in the area: Islamic State jihadists. They killed her younger brother and took advantage of her medical training by forcing her to work in a clinic, she said. The family later fled to a refugee camp across the border in Turkey, where they lived until Ms. Mashaan’s husband and her last remaining brother joined the migration to Europe and paid smugglers to take them to Greece in rubber dinghies. They made their way to Germany, where she and her five children joined them last year. Living in Germany is hard, she said in a Facebook chat from her new home. Not speaking the language made it difficult to register the children, and many Germans refused to rent lodgings to her family because they were refugees, she said.",0
1191,Канада и ЕС подпишут соглашение о свободной торговле,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как сообщается в Twitter представительства Словакии в ЕС, ""(заседание комитета постоянных представителей ЕС закончилось с положительным результатом - пакет документов по CETA одобрен и достигнута договоренность по проведению письменной процедуры принятия Европейским советом до полуночи пятницы)"". Как пишет RT, в настоящее время страна председательствует в интеграционном объединении. 
Ранее сообщалось , что власти Бельгии и представители регионов и сообществ страны достигли договорённости по соглашению о свободной торговле между ЕС и Канадой, сняв тем самым последнее препятствие для подписания документа. 
Вашингтонский Центр стратегических и международных исследований совместно с болгарским Центром исследований демократии ранее опубликовали доклад ""Кремль. Руководство: Российское влияние в Восточной и Центральной Европе"". В документе отмечается, что экономическое присутствие России в Болгарии ""граничит с захватом государства"". 
Согласно докладу, Москва использует экономические рычаги воздействия, чтобы дискредитировать либерально-демократическую модель развития Болгарии. То же самое относится и к Венгрии, Латвии, Сербии и Словакии. ""В некоторых странах российское влияние насколько всепроникающее и эндемическое, что угрожает национальной безопасности, как и западной ориентации стран и евроатлантической стабильности"", - отмечают авторы доклада. 
Названы четыре болгарские партии, которые, так или иначе, являются ""проводниками российского империализма"". Особое внимание уделено партии""Атака"". ""Российское влияние привело к созданию странной политической коалиции между партиями БСП, ДПС и АБВ, которые работают над созданием пророссийской коалиции, пытаясь свергнуть сегодняшнее правительство"", - подчеркивают авторы доклада. 
""Для поддержки российского экономического господства и во избежание подробных проверок бизнеса, Кремль использует сложные и теневые сети, охватывающие государственных служащих и бизнес общность. Требования о непрозрачности сделок создало порочный круг увеличения российского экономического влияния и ухудшения болгарских стандартов управления. Подобная практика применяется в управлении госкомпаниями, крупными энергетическими проектами, при заключении договоров по итогам тендеров, одобрении слияния и приобретения и использования ""лазеек"" в корпоративном управлении для блокировки политических инициатив, противоречащих российским бизнес и стратегическим интересам"", - говорится в докладе. 
""Приобретая значительное влияние над болгарской экономикой, Россия использует свою доминирующую позицию в стратегических секторах для усиления существующих связей и создания новых коррумпированных бизнесменов и местных олигархов. Со своей стороны эти бизнесмены связаны с известными политиками, на которых имеют значительное влияние. Политики заключают сделки в пользу этих бизнесменов и усиливают их власть в коррупционных сетях страны и в государственных учреждениях"", - в таком духе выдержан доклад. 
В этом свете особо уместно порекомендовать следующую статью: ""НАТО уничтожает армию Болгарии"". Однако чрезмерное влияние НАТО и Брюсселя на Болгарию никак не отражено в докладе.

1192,"Uprooted by War, Threatened by Boko Haram and Desperate to Go Home - The New York Times","MAIDUGURI, Nigeria  —   Dozens of drivers lined up in   vehicles stuffed with mattresses, cooking pots and other belongings, clogging a road outside one of the most desperate and dangerous camps that serve as refuge from the war with Boko Haram. All were waiting for the Nigerian military to escort them back to the farms and the villages they had fled during the yearslong rampage by the insurgents here in this northeast corner of the nation. The military and the government have proclaimed that the countryside outside Maiduguri, the busy Borno State capital where Boko Haram was born, is mostly safe now. They’ve said it’s time for most of the nearly two million displaced people  —   many of them farmers and fishermen fighting to stave off hunger  —   to go home. But the soldiers were guiding the throngs of people into a future that was no more certain, and potentially just as dangerous, as the past they had fled. Maimta Modu, 62, had come to a   camp with other residents of his tiny village, and now they have to pay soldiers a fee to be escorted back periodically to check on their crops. If he returns on his own, he said in a reference to Boko Haram, “those boys will slaughter me. ” President Muhammadu Buhari has repeatedly declared the war with Boko Haram over. The military has chased the insurgents from hiding places in the forest. But the radical Islamist terrorist group is still waging deadly attacks across the countryside. And in some camps for displaced people, new arrivals fleeing the militants are moving in even as others are moving back home. Caught in the middle are people like Idi Hassan and his wife, who were in the convoy with six of their young children in his truck bed. The Hassans had been living for two years in the squalid camp in Maiduguri, relying on food handouts and eager to get back to their farm north of here, where they hoped to make a living. “The area has been liberated, and we’re going home,” Mr. Hassan said, sitting behind the wheel as his wife   their infant in the passenger’s seat. Yet insurgents still roam the northeast and frequently crisscross roads like the one that was taking Mr. Hassan and his family home. Just weeks ago, Boko Haram ambushed soldiers along this very highway, killing seven of them. The narrow road is also the same one that Boko Haram used in January to ferry nine suicide bombers who set upon the same camp in Maiduguri that the Hassan family was leaving. Besides the bombers, two other people were killed in the attack, described by the authorities as the most coordinated of recent bombings. Much of the world associates the militants with the kidnapping in April 2014 of more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, a small village in northeastern Nigeria. Many of them are still missing. “Most people simplify this crisis into one hashtag: Bring Back Our Girls,” said Sean Hoy, Ireland’s ambassador to Nigeria, who was in Maiduguri recently with other diplomats to assess the humanitarian crisis. But the aftermath of the ravaging by Boko Haram is far more complicated. Since the violence started here in 2009, nearly two million people in northeastern Nigeria have fled their homes in fear of Boko Haram, which has carried out a murderous spree against civilians and members of the military. Many people fled rural areas to Maiduguri, which has doubled in size as displaced Nigerians have crowded into relatives’ homes or settled into crumbling buildings, bus stations, schoolyards and the thousands of ramshackle thatched huts that dot the edges of the city. The Borno State government announced plans to close the camps in Maiduguri by the end of May, but said it would keep evaluating the situation. Now, one million uprooted people are making their way back home, according to the United Nations. Outside the city, military commanders say, all but small pockets of the countryside are now safe. “Ferocious attacks are a thing of the past,” said Maj. Gen. Leo Irabor, the Nigerian Army commander leading the operation against the militants. “We are only picking up the pieces. ” In late December, the military began reopening main highways that had been closed for years because of security worries. The state government has started rebuilding burned villages. The military push has allowed aid workers to fan out into new parts of the countryside to help people ravaged by famine or faminelike conditions. The United Nations has increased its efforts as well, working alongside the military and asking for $1 billion to help those affected by Boko Haram. Yet the security situation is far from stable. Maiduguri, where soldiers chased out the militants years ago, has been a frequent    target, set upon even by girl bombers, one as young as 7. One bomber in a recent attack had a baby strapped to her back. With the military on their trail, many Boko Haram fighters appear to have scattered throughout Borno State and its beige landscape dotted by tiny farming communities. The Nigerian Army orders residents to clear out as it hunts the militants, and  unarmed civilians are sometimes killed in the battles. Mr. Modu said soldiers had arrived in his village and given a   deadline for residents to move to a nearby town. The next day, insurgents ordered them to evacuate immediately. Residents then moved into a   camp. In   a relief convoy driving on one of the reopened roads ran over an improvised bomb, setting fire to a food truck, burning all its contents and injuring a driver and his assistants. In another area deemed safe by the military, insurgents gunned down 16 people gathering wood not far from their homes. When aid groups make some supply runs in helicopters across the safe areas, the pilots fly high enough to be out of missile range. Humanitarian groups say the military refuses to allow food supplies to build up in camps teeming with hungry people for fear that the militants will steal it. Soldiers have shut down phone networks and banned fuel sales in some areas where residents are trying to restore their lives. Diverging streams of displaced people moving in and out of the camps are making it hard for humanitarian groups to provide assistance. Those in the camps need food, and people going home need help reviving their farms. Both relief and development aid are needed. Some residents take risks. Muhammadu Sani was sewing a fishing net at a   camp in the countryside on a recent day. Eager to feed his seven children, he would head regularly to a fishing spot an hour away. But transporting fish is banned, in an attempt to starve the insurgents. So Mr. Sani stuffs his catch down his pants to smuggle it home. In some areas, waves of displaced Nigerians have begun crashing into one another. In a rural community called Monguno, hundreds of people from newly liberated areas have crammed into   homes abandoned when Boko Haram first invaded. Now, the original homeowners are finding that people as desperate as they had been are living inside. Bulama Abatcha and Modu Bintumi had to ask for help from a community official to work out an arrangement in which Mr. Abatcha could remain in the other man’s home rent free. Mr. Abatcha would take care of it until Mr. Bintumi was ready to leave a camp in Maiduguri, where he had fled two years ago. “If the owner comes any time soon,” Mr. Abatcha said, “I’ll definitely find another place and move. ” In other areas, the state government has forged ahead with   reconstruction, building concrete housing in villages that Boko Haram had reduced to ashes. But in places such as Benisheik, a community about an hour’s drive from Maiduguri that was leveled by the militants, spacious new concrete homes are vacant. They are adjacent to   huts made of wood frames and ragged sheets, where returning residents are camped out until they are allowed to move into the concrete structures. Gov. Kashim Shettima of Borno State said that to cut down on ownership fights, officials wanted to make sure that all the units were completed before allowing anyone in. Women will have first pick of the homes, he said, because they have been affected the most by a war in which their sons and husbands were routinely killed. Each will receive an irrigation kit, 25 chickens and two goats to help stimulate the local economy. “We recognize that human population is the number one defense against insurgents, and we know that communities can remain isolated for years and give strength to insurgents,” Mr. Shettima said. “But we will never compromise safety. ” In one of the new concrete structures, complete with drop ceilings, Halima Hajiya Ibrahim, an older woman, danced and raised her hands, ecstatically showing visitors what she said was her new home. No one had told her that it had yet to be officially assigned she was a squatter and was bound to be removed. Other residents who had returned to Benisheik said they were eager to move out of shelters that flood during the rainy season and offer no protection from the night chill. But many said they were still uneasy. Days earlier, a group of insurgents on motorbikes had crossed the road just outside town.",0
1193,‘Brexit’ Briefing: Boris Johnson Isn’t Running Jeremy Corbyn Seeks Labour Revolution - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   The Conservative Party (and by extension, Britain itself) is moving a step closer to a new leader. Members of the opposition Labour Party are wondering if their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will save them or plunge the party into irrelevancy. Here’s what’s happening in today’s Brexit news: • Among the Conservatives, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, has decided not to run to replace David Cameron as party leader (and therefore prime minister). That leaves the favorite as Home Secretary Theresa May, but Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has also thrown his hat in the ring. A leaked email showed Mr. Gove’s wife to be no fan of Mr. Johnson, and both candidates criticized him while announcing their candidacy. Plenty of others plan to run as well. • On the opposition side, Labour is not happy with its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who appears more concerned with remaking the party into a revolutionary socialist movement than achieving power. Members of Parliament, including Mr. Corbyn’s predecessor as party leader, want him to resign. He has refused. The party is also awaiting the release of an internal investigation into claims of  . • Where could it all lead? Steven Erlanger, the London bureau chief for The New York Times, says there could be an early general election in Britain. • The Bank of England may be forced to cut a key interest rate this summer as it grapples with economic uncertainty created by Brexit, Mark Carney, the central bank’s governor, said on Thursday. “It now seems plausible that uncertainty could remain elevated for some time, with a greater drag on activity than we had previously projected,” Mr. Carney said. He added that, in his view, “the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,” though he was careful to say he was not prescribing what other members of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee would eventually decide. “The charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,” he said. • A new runway at Heathrow Airport in London won’t be decided on until a new prime minister is in place, the BBC reports. The Financial Times has published a “business tracker” on how companies are responding to the vote. • A series of tweets by the Economist Intelligence Unit outlines the negative possibilities for the British economy. • In the markets, the pound was mostly flat in morning trading in London. British stocks, which had fallen sharply after the referendum result on Friday morning, closed above their   levels on Wednesday. The same goes for share prices in Continental Europe. • Internet search patterns indicate many people are still looking up what “Brexit” is and what it means to leave the European Union. Plenty is still unknown, but we have an article that explains the basics. • Tony Blair’s former chief of staff wrote in The Guardian that Britain’s withdrawal can still be reversed, but that it will take courage. An academic wrote on Medium that most English and Welsh lawmakers would have to go against the wishes of their constituents. • Is the European Union “democratic”? Campaigners who sought to leave the bloc said it was not, but my colleague Amanda Taub argues it is  —   it just doesn’t feel that way. Philip Stephens, looking at another European country that had an   portmanteau, worries in The Financial Times that Britain is behaving more like Greece. • Could Britain’s influence in Hong Kong wane? The Guardian’s Beijing correspondent asks if Britain’s fledgling “golden relationship” with China could be in jeopardy. And in China, a censorship notice has told editors not to “hype the story, speculate or comment” on the exit. There will be plenty more to come throughout the day.",0
1194,"“If Trump Loses, I’m Grabbing My Musket”: Former Congressman Ready to Go Full Revolution","Posted on October 28, 2016 by Mac Slavo 
This election remains more heated than any other in modern history – and for many, it has become a call to arms, even if only metaphorically. 
Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies – Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example – and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote – the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence. 
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ‘pick up a musket’ if Trump loses the election. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election. 
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms – racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent. 
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement. 
via CNN : 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
[…] 
Walsh … did respond to CNN’s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: “What exactly does that mean?” 
“It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,” he responded to Tapper. @jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back. 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
After a firestorm on social media, Walsh doubled down, stating on Twitter: I'm serious. I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud , dirty tricks and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS – just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about. 
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses – acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America. 
Could Hillary’s reported election victory – or Donald Trump’s defeat – signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or “rigged”? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election. 
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest. 
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment’s “selection” for president: 
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny. 
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. 
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre. 
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) – Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed. 
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) – Possible new acronym or term for “Martial Law”. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario. 
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military 
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end. 
How far will things go? 
And will things ever be reset without a new American Revolution?

1195,Samsung’s Response to Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Draws Criticism - The New York Times,"After Samsung Electronics halted production of its   smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, it posted a statement on its website telling owners of the phone to power it down immediately and contact the outlet they bought it from to obtain a refund or an exchange. But for people to see those words, they had to click a link at the top of Samsung’s home page with the    label “Updated Consumer Guidance for the Galaxy Note 7. ” As of Tuesday afternoon, the instructions had not been posted to Samsung’s Facebook page or the company’s Twitter account. For some who work in crisis management, it was a baffling and overly passive way for the South Korean electronics giant to deal with a prominent problem that has worsened in the last month. “That ought to be more visible  —   this is pretty serious,” Andrew Gilman, the chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group, said of the warning on Samsung’s home page. The brand has “to show they care and are concerned” through consistent communication on their home page, Twitter, Facebook and other social channels, he said. On Tuesday afternoon, the pinned tweet on the Samsung Mobile US Twitter account, dated Sept. 15, was still telling consumers they could exchange the old Note 7 for a new version of the phone. On the company’s Facebook page, the most recent post was from Oct. 4, when it shared a photo of a YouTube star using its new virtual reality camera. That post was quickly filling up with comments about how production of the Galaxy Note 7 had been stopped. “This is a phone that can literally catch fire and burn your house down with you in it,” said Dean Crutchfield, an independent brand consultant in New York. “I don’t think that’s being highlighted enough. ” Samsung has repeatedly stumbled in the last month as it sought to address reports that its Galaxy Note 7 phone had been overheating and catching fire because of a manufacturing flaw. The company recalled 2. 5 million phones last month and was initially praised, until it was learned that it had acted without required coordination with the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the United States. Samsung also erred by telling Hong Kong consumers around that time that models there would be unaffected, only to reverse course a day later. The brand, which has been offering refunds or replacement Note 7 devices to consumers in the last few weeks, now faces the unpleasant task of pulling the newer smartphones as well. All of this has grown into an international crisis for Samsung, which is not accustomed to dealing with such public scrutiny. Samsung is South Korea’s most important company, accounting for about 17 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. As a result, government regulators there are not as quick to call it to task as regulators in other countries. In response to questions on its outreach efforts, a spokeswoman for Samsung pointed to the advisory on its website and a statement that it would stop exchanges and sales of the phone. Adding a layer of complexity is the fact that many consumers interact with the Samsung brand through carriers like Verizon and ATampT or retail outlets like Best Buy. “What these carriers are battling with is making sure their brand image is not sullied by this,” Mr. Crutchfield said. “They want total responsibility reflected on Samsung. ” ATampT, for example, sent a text to consumers on Sept. 20 notifying them that new Note 7 phones would be available on Sept. 21 for exchanges. The carrier said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that “another customer communication is in progress” based on the latest news. “Over all, as a company, they have an enormous amount of products and customer loyalty to those products, and they have to bank on that leverage and work on it in the near and distant future in order to continue that,” Andrew Frank, the founder and president of KARV Communications, who has worked on recalls involving companies like Continental Tire, said of Samsung. Thus far, communication out of Samsung has been overly “bureaucratic,” Mr. Crutchfield said. He said he would put the company’s executives in front of consumers, noting “people want to see people. ” The public’s frustration was starting to show. One consumer tweeted to Sprint this week, saying “Hey @sprint, what if I don’t trust @SamsungMobile devices anymore?” The carrier responded, “Greetings, you still can trust Apple, HTC, LG or Alcatel. ”",0
1196,"Pushing Mexico to Pay for Border Wall Is ’Not Christian’, Says Pope","Once again, Pope Francis appears to be criticizing President Donald Trump and his plans to build a wall on the country’s southern border. While not naming Trump directly, the pontiff called for building bridges and not walls, adding that it was not Christian to ask someone else to pay for it. [The statements b Pope Francis were made during his weekly general audience where he called for Christians to build bridges instead of raising walls and to overcome evil with good, The Guardian reported.   In February 2016, various news outlets reported that Pope Francis had stated that Trump was not a Christian over his desire to build a border wall. At the time, Trump denounced the statements and their apparent effort to influence the election. According to the Daily Mail, the Pope’s spokesman then walked back the statements, claiming that it was not a personal attack but the Pope was simply referring to his beliefs about helping immigrants and building bridges instead of walls. At the time, the Pope’s spokesman said that the pontiff had spoken only based on what he had been told about Trump. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

1197,"NGOs should condemn terrorists in Syria, not Russia fighting them"," 38 UTC © Denis Balibouse / Reuters The NGOs that demanded Russia's removal from UN Human Rights Council lack impartiality as they ignore terrorist activities as well as violations by the US-led coalition in Syria, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Commissioner for Human Rights told RT. Targeting Russia was ""a gross misstep on the part of the human rights defenders,"" Konstantin Dolgov said. ""If they call themselves [human rights defenders] they have to be objective. Al least, they have to try to be impartial. How can they assess the human rights situation in Syria in this one-sided manner? Just to join the chorus of Western governments and politicians, groundlessly accusing Russia of bombing civilian targets in Syria, without providing any evidence of this,"" Dolgov added. The NGOs, which failed to provide any solid proof of Russia's alleged wrongdoings, ""completely ignore the bulk of the problem"" in Syria, the commissioner stressed. ""And the bulk of the problem is the activities of the terrorist organizations like Islamic State, [Jabhat] al-Nusra... which have been persistently killing dozens of thousands of civilians in Syria."" Dolgov wondered ""how can those NGOs ignore... numerous killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure by the coalition led by the US?"" when ""there are multiple examples"" of such violations. ""If you're against violations of human rights, you should be against violation everywhere and by everybody,"" he said. The commissioner pointed out that, on Wednesday, Amnesty International - which had not signed the petition - blamed the US for killing hundreds of civilians in Syria and refusing to investigate those incidents. The numbers of civilian victims provided by the group - around 300 - ""aren't complete,"" Dolgov said. ""I don't think that an accurate number. I don't think anybody there has an accurate number."" More than 80 international organizations - including Human Rights Watch, CARE International and Refugees International - have signed a petition for Russia to be thrown off the UN Human Rights Council. They claimed that Moscow was no longer fit to hold its position in the United Nations body, due to its military operation in Syria. It turned out that most of the organizations are part of the very same Syria Relief Network based in Turkey, however, casting potential doubts over their impartiality. The petition came ahead of the UN Human Rights Council election, scheduled to take place on Friday. The Foreign Ministry official opted not to predict the outcome of the vote, but said that Russia was ""definitely"" running to regain its seat on the council. ""We're running because we have a very strong record in the protection of international law; in the protection of international human rights law. We don't have right now, at this last moment before the election, to prove anything. Our policies are well known and we've been one of the most active and creative members of the UN Human Rights Council for many-many years now,"" Dolgov stressed. Moscow is aware that there some international players who want to block Russia's activities in the Human Rights Council, because ""we're not professing double standards. We are consistently against politicizing human rights. We have a lot of supporters,"" Dolgov added.",0
1198,Religion & Politics: A Bad Mix,"October Sky, Good Harbor Beach MA(image by Richard Turcotte) License DMCA Religion is what gives people hope in a world torn apart by religion - Jon Stewart Our Constitution granted each and every one of us the freedom to believe or not believe as we decide. That protection applies to all of us, and when one group has decreed by some spiritual osmosis that their version of the unverifiable and occasionally insane has been decreed as the new Law, then it is up to the rest of us to put that crazy back where it belongs: away from public influence. It's done enough damage as it is. Mankind offers a long history of reliance on others by religious believers with the former being no more intelligent or enlightened than the average man/woman on the street (often far less, if history--or current events--is our guide). Personal thought and introspection have accordingly been relinquished--then, and certainly now. Those presumably more enlightened individuals [bear with me] in turn define and explain their versions of truths, beliefs, and obligations--all in the context of a judging, to-be-feared-and-obeyed, person-like Entity. No small measure of self-interest factors in to their assessments. Keeping ardent followers sufficiently agitated about some loving Deity's wrath [an oxymoron on a grand scale!] allows those professing a direct phone line to the One and Only all the time and opportunity they need to preserve their political and economic advantages without so much as a peep from those loyal supplicants. Hell of a racket.... The current crop of Its spokespeople earn kudos for the ways in which they have fashioned very creative takes on what they claim to be The One and Only Word. Perhaps it's time that we all recognize and simply accept [assuming we accept any kind of theology to begin with] that one religious conviction is in fact no more rational--or irrational--than another. With so many contradictory beliefs, either there is some other unifying and overarching principle, or we will continue to sabotage ourselves and the future of generations to follow by fighting to assert we're right and everyone else is wrong. We own that choice. By its very nature the Source of our Universe is unfathomable. We simply do not have the means or capabilities to define with certainty that great mystery--try as we do. So instead, a great many among us have fashioned a notion that some human-like-but-slightly-better-and-bigger-person-like God/Allah/Whatever created all. Furthermore--apparently--only some know just what It wants from us. That is so convenient, isn't it! - Advertisement - That also frees up some thinking time on the part of those same loyal followers. Why think if someone else is willing to do all of that hard work for us, Right? Aside from that perk, this ceding of rational contemplation is a problem. Always has been. It will continue to be. For all of us, that must change. Acquiescence--or silence--each carry consequences. Were they limited to those followers disinclined to ponder their marching orders, we would certainly have at least one less set of concerns on our plates. If only.... Any honest reading of American history does not suggest a Christian nation that has had secularism forced on it in recent years by liberal forces, but the opposite. Ours is a country that has always been basically secular but has always had to contend with a loud-mouthed minority of theocrats who periodically succeed at using government to push religion until the forces of secularism beat them back again. It's obvious why conservative Christians would like to believe otherwise. Believing they're an oppressed group being denied their birthright is a lot more fun than accepting that they are an oppressive group trying to steal basic freedoms from everyone else. Ignorance, narrow-mindedness, self-serving behaviors, paranoia, fears, and the full range of irrational, fact-challenged nonsense do not manifest themselves inside a protective bubble. The more we collectively permit the subtle infiltration of curiously hypocritical mandates into policy-making, the more certain we can be that outcomes will benefit only very few. Basic math skills tell us that when only a few ""win,"" most lose. That's not a good place for us to be. - Advertisement - Adapted from a blog post of mine View Ratings | Rate It http://richardturcotte.com/

1199,Comment on Clinton Campaign Memo: “Let’s Troll Reddit” by Debbie Menon,"Abby Martin Exposes What Hillary Clinton Really Represents ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Clinton Campaign Memo: “Let’s Troll Reddit” By VNN on October 25, 2016 If Donald Trump Wins The Election, It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In U.S. Political History 
InvestmentWatch 
A confidential memo from a Democratic Super PAC details a Clinton campaign strategy of trolling sites such as Reddit in order to cause “digital disruption”. 
According to a Correct The Record memo, Clinton campaigners are being urged to disrupt and dominate the World Wide Web in order to stifle growing pro-Trump sentiment prevalent on sites such as Reddit . 
The memo reads: 
We are entering the final phase of the election and this is an all-hands-on-deck full-spectrum push for digital disruption and dominance. We are facing a decentralized leaderless emergent structure that can only be countered by our numbers with discipline and tactics. As such, these will be the scripts for Week 0 (through Week 3 to the vote) 
REDDIT 
Smart, but paranoid 
Reddit is an important clearinghouse for Trump-momentum and intellectual capital. We must maintain dominance on promotion/demotion of stories and isolation of Trump-positive threads. 
We are working to compromise moderators to improve our ability but will “operationalize” them in the final week of the campaign to try to make the board “go dark.” 
Reddit is more intellectually rigorous than the chans and has fewer low-social-capital (loser) members (including many far-right non-American posters). We should be careful not to trigger moderator red-lines. Proscribed disruption vectors.

1202,"U.S. Combat Missions May End, but Fighting Goes On - The New York Times","President Obama inherited two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, and has struggled to wind them down. American troops are still in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but their missions have changed and there are far fewer troops in combat than at the heights of those wars a decade ago. Didn’t Mr. Obama declare an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? Yes. Mr. Obama declared an end to the combat mission in Iraq in 2010, and the one in Afghanistan in 2014. But we still have thousands of troops in both countries. Why are the troops still there? Mr. Obama sent American forces back to Iraq in 2014 after the Islamic State seized wide stretches of territory there and was threatening to take Baghdad. In 2015, Mr. Obama, saying he continued to oppose the idea of an “endless war,” said he would keep thousands of troops in Afghanistan to continue to target remnants of Al Qaeda and to help Afghan forces defeat the Taliban. How many troops do we have in each country? The Pentagon will not say exactly. Military officials say there are roughly 5, 000 troops in Iraq and 11, 000 in Afghanistan. At the heights of those conflicts a decade ago, the United States had more than 150, 000 troops in Iraq and 100, 000 in Afghanistan. Wait, why don’t we know exactly how many troops are in each country? The Pentagon says that for “force protection” reasons it cannot say how many service members there are in the theater. Mr. Obama has set a cap of 4, 087 troops for Iraq and 9, 800 in Afghanistan. The Pentagon can exceed the caps because it uses an accounting system that exempts many groups from being counted, including troops that commanders plan on having in the country for less than four months. What is the mission of those troops?  Most of them are dedicated to what is called “train, advise and assist,” in Pentagon jargon. In layman’s terms, that means helping the Iraqis and Afghans beat back their enemies without actually sending Americans out to do a lot of the fighting, as the United States did a decade ago. The other mission is a counterterrorism one in which American troops and airmen take direct action against Islamic State and Qaeda militants. So what does that mean our troops are doing on a    basis? In both countries, Air Force jets conduct strikes on militants, safe houses, ammunition depots and training camps. On the ground, commandos launch raids to kill and capture militants military advisers train local commanders and soldiers, at times, fight alongside the local forces. Does that mean the troops are in combat? The White House does semantic cartwheels to say neither mission is combat. In 2014, when Mr. Obama first sent troops back into Iraq, he was unequivocal in his description of their mission. “I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” he said. “It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. ” The White House has stuck to the notion that the troops are not in combat. Pentagon officials roll their eyes at such denial, and senior officials  —   including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  —   have publicly called it combat. How has Mr. Obama changed the United States’ role in Iraq? At the end of 2011, Mr. Obama  —   who had campaigned on ending the war in Iraq  —   decided to pull out the 50, 000 troops we still had in the country and declared an end to our mission there. After the Islamic State took substantial territory in Iraq in 2014, Mr. Obama sent several hundred advisers back to Iraq to determine the strength of the Iraqi military and how the United States could help it combat the Islamic State. By the end of that year, he had increased the United States’ involvement, and roughly 1, 550 troops were in the country. In 2015, the number climbed to 3, 000, and this year Mr. Obama increased it to over 4, 000. When are the troops going to return home? Military commanders say more troops are likely to be sent into Iraq in support of Iraqi forces preparing to try to retake Mosul. The troops in Afghanistan were initially supposed to return home by 2017. But the Taliban have had a significant resurgence, and the troops are likely to remain there through next spring, if not longer. According to the website icasualties. org, six American service members have died in Iraq this year and three in Afghanistan. In the past decade and a half, 4, 501 Americans have died in Iraq and 2, 381 in Afghanistan.",0
1203,"Donald Trump Says Hillary Clinton Will Start WWIII With Russia, but Moscow Disagrees (Video)","Donald Trump Says Hillary Clinton Will Start WWIII With Russia, but Moscow Disagrees (Video)   Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
Donald Trump alleged on Tuesday that if elected, Hillary Clinton would start World War III with Russia over Syria. He wondered how Clinton would be able to negotiate with Putin, whom she has demonized, and said that her plan for a no-fly zone over Syria would bring her into military conflict with the Russian Aerospace Forces flying missions over that country. To be fair, as the BBC points out, the US generals do share Trumps concerns in this regard. 
Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee, “Right now, senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia.” 
Trump pointed out that Russia has a nuclear arsenal, making brinkmanship with it extremely risky. 
Trump is not reckoning, however, with Clinton’s extensive experience as Secretary of State, a job that is all about negotiation and horse trading and compromise. In fact, the position has pragmatism so baked into it that its incumbent often offends ideologues in Congress. It is no wonder that the office has not been a springboard to the presidency since the early decades of the republic. 
Superpowers don’t fight one another in the nuclear age. If Russia brandishes enough threats and weaponry, it will simply dissuade Clinton from her proposed no-fly zone. Ike Eisenhower back down over Hungary in 1956, and Johnson did nothing about the crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968. Russia is claiming Syria as a sphere of influence, and while the US is contesting that claim, it is unlikely to go mano a mano with Moscow over it. 
  
Superpowers fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan. So is it possible that Clinton will give Syrian rebels shoulder-held missile launchers to use against Russian fighter jets? Sure. Although one reason that hasn’t been done is that they could end up being used against the Israelis. In any case, that Clinton will engage in a proxy war with Russia over Syria with far more vigor than President Obama is fairly obvious. That it will spiral out of hand is actually fairly unlikely, though it can’t be ruled out. 
Interestingly, many high Russian officials and commentators in the Russian press, according to BBC Monitoring, do not agree with Mr. Trump, and indeed see Clinton as the pragmatist: 
“Moskovsky Komsomolets (popular Moscow daily) www.mk.ru –“The Russian leadership hopes that pragmatism will prevail in US foreign policy after the presidential election… And Hillary Clinton is the one whom the Kremlin sees in the role of this main foreign policy pragmatist… Trump would, of course, be a more convenient partner than Clinton but the Kremlin has realised: no matter what its wishes and preferences are, Trump will not become president…” 
The article continues that it is the Kremlin that is playing brinkmanship, not Clinton, saying that Moscow has deliberately made relations so tense that Clinton may be forced to back down rather than risk a hot war. Editorial writer Mikhail Rostovsky does admit that if Clinton instead ratchets up tensions, “things could get out of hand.” 
Russian journalists and officialdom seem largely to have written off Trump. Victoria Zhuravleva, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of International Relations and World Economy, wrote in Lyubov Glazunova that “the campaign for Trump is most likely to be over.” 
Stanislav Ivanov, “Carte blanche. Storming Mosul: what is next?”; bit.ly/2e5JL0b in Nezavisimaya Gazeta (centrist daily) www.ng.ru , says that Washington’s policy is to turn the Middle East into an arena of conflict between the Gulf monarchies and Iran. He expects the Mosul campaign to be prolonged, but for the Baghdad government to win in the end: “Under this scenario, Iraq and Syria may remain hostages to this confrontation for years to come and turn into a ground of permanent armed conflicts. The overseas puppet masters will try to take advantage of the existing ethnic and religious conflicts in the region.” 
The Russian press is also not concerned that Russia will be sanctioned over its air campaign against fundamentalist rebel forces in East Aleppo. 
So, rather than the chicken little hysteria of Trump about a world war and nuclear exchanges, many in the Kremlin see him as less pragmatic than Clinton and are expecting to work with her. They have already discounted the possibility of a Trump presidency, and so are readying themselves for a Clinton administration. The Russians met with Clinton a lot when she was Secretary of State and so know her well. They think she will blink rather than take US-Russian relations to the boiling point, and they admit that the Kremlin as the one playing brinksmanship. Trump can’t even get support for his wild charges from the the Kremlin itself, which sounds positively even-handed and practical in comparison. TAGS:",0

1205,‘A Dog’s Purpose’ Premiere Is Canceled Amid Outrage Over Video of Distressed German Shepherd - The New York Times,"The red carpet premiere for the film “A Dog’s Purpose” scheduled for Saturday has been canceled amid calls for a boycott after a video surfaced on Wednesday showing a German shepherd being forced into rushing waters during filming. In the video, obtained by TMZ, the dog appears to be fighting to stay out of the   stream as a man in a green suit wrestles to put the animal in. The footage then cuts to a scene of the dog submerged as people swim toward it. A voice can be heard yelling  : “Cut it! Cut it!” The source of the video, recorded in 2015, was not immediately clear, but the filmmakers have not disputed its authenticity. The identity of the man in the video was also not immediately revealed. Amblin Entertainment, the film’s producer, and Universal Pictures, its distributor, said in a joint statement on Thursday night that it was in the “best interest” to cancel the premiere and press junket set for Saturday in Los Angeles. The statement said Amblin’s review into the video was continuing. The movie, starring Dennis Quaid, will open in theaters nationwide on Jan. 27 as scheduled. “Amblin and Universal do not want anything to overshadow this film that celebrates the relationship between animals and humans,” the statement said, adding: “Since the emergence of the footage, Amblin has engaged with many associated with the production of the film, including safety personnel, trainers and stunt coordinators as part of their   review. While we are all disheartened by the appearance of an animal in distress, everyone has assured us that Hercules the German shepherd was not harmed throughout the filmmaking. ” In a statement on Wednesday, Amblin and Universal said Hercules was “happy and healthy. ” “There were several days of rehearsal of the water scenes to ensure Hercules was comfortable with all of the stunts,” the statement continued. “On the day of the shoot, Hercules did not want to perform the stunt portrayed on the tape, so the Amblin production team did not proceed with filming that shot. ” For a movie aimed squarely at an audience of dog lovers, the footage threatens to repel the precise audience filmmakers hope to draw. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has urged moviegoers to boycott the film. Several people involved in the film condemned the actions seen in the video. Lasse Hallstrom, the director, said on Twitter he had not witnessed the events but was “very disturbed” by the footage. He said he had been promised “a thorough investigation. ” “We were all committed to providing a loving and safe environment for all the animals in the film,” he said. “I have been a lifelong animal lover, and ‘A Dog’s Purpose’ is my third film about dogs. The animals’ safety was of utmost priority. ” Josh Gad, an actor who voices one of the dogs in the film and said he was never on the set, released a statement on Twitter that said he had “signed on to a film that truly stands out as one of the most beautiful love letters to animals I have ever seen. ” He added he was “shaken and sad to see any animal put in a situation against its will,” and had contacted the production team and studio to ask for an explanation. Mark Stubis, a spokesman for the American Humane Association, which monitors animals on movie sets, said in a statement that a representative had been present during filming. The employee was later placed on administrative leave, and the organization was “bringing in an independent third party to conduct an investigation,” according to the statement. “When the dog showed signs of resistance to jumping in the water, the scene should have been stopped,” Mr. Stubis said. The movie, whose cast also includes Peggy Lipton, is based on a book of the same name by W. Bruce Cameron. He wrote on Facebook on Wednesday that he was “as disturbed as you were by the video I saw earlier today. ” Dog lovers on social media appeared to be unforgiving. “This was abuse, and that human shoving the dog into the water should be charged,” one woman wrote in response to Mr. Cameron’s post. “It is inexcusable, and I won’t be spending money to see this movie. ”",0

— Bruce Porter, Jr. (@NetworksManager) October 29, 2016 
These 1,000 new emails are likely to be quite important, considering that the General was the Commander of CENTCOM and then the Director of the CIA. While we may not know what appeared in these emails, the probability that these are simple boilerplate political issues is low. The most likely reason for Clinton and Petraeus to be communicating would be to discuss classified security issues. 
Even more troublesome (for Clinton and for our national security) is what the FBI seems to have discovered on devices acquired from Anthony Weiner (and Huma Abedin). 
The FBI seems to have discovered “ tens of thousands” of emails on a laptop belonging to Abedin, and in those emails they’ve discovered a worrisome amount of obviously classified material . 
What is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account, which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiner’s computer: in the above example, the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted, with “PAGE DENIED” stamped across the first redacted page. 
An argument can be made that the extensive redaction confirms confidential material was part of the transmission… 
… According to the NYT , the number of Huma emails that made their way to Weiner’s PC was staggering: 
The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousand 
While this could (and should) damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes, the latest revelations could mean even stiffer punishment for Abedin in the not-too-distant future. Remember, Abedin swore under oath that had given up each and every device that contained State Department emails, and that she had held nothing back from investigators. This latest discovery proves that story to be a complete lie. 
This should serve as a reminder to everyone that Hillary Clinton isn’t the only person involved in this morass that deserves to serve time in prison. There is a small circle of Clinton confidantes that all owe the American people a few years in a federal prison, including Huma Abedin .

Some members of the Black Panther Party have been behind bars for more than four decades and are now suffering from poor health. In some cases, court documents show they were punished essentially for being in the black liberation struggle. Many continue to face parole board denials based on their relationship with the party. We discuss their cases with Sekou Odinga, a former Black Panther who was a political prisoner for 33 years and was released in November 2014. 
TRANSCRIPT 
AMY GOODMAN: Sekou Odinga, while you’re out of jail, you’re very much focused on those who are still in prison. Can you talk about some of those cases? 
SEKOU ODINGA: Yeah. We have a number of brothers left in the prisons, about 15 of them. And for the most part, they’re in bad condition. Most of us are getting older, you know. I believe all of them is 60 years or older. They’ve been in prison for long periods of time. Many of them should have never been in prison at all. They were framed and illegally convicted. So, I’ve been trying to, as well as many of the other brothers—I know all three of the other brothers that’s on this program with us have been advocating for the release of these other political prisoners, prisoners like Mumia Abu-Jamal, Sundiata Acoli, Mutulu Shakur, Robert Seth Hayes, Kamau Sadiki, Veronza Bowers. It’s another—like I say, it’s 15 from the party itself, and there’s many other political prisoners in this country. 
You know, this country maintains that there is no political prisoners, that everybody is criminals, but it’s just not true. You know, the same—the same things that we hurray and support in other places, like people like Nelson Mandela, our prisoners were doing the same thing, and they were captured and convicted of the same things. And we should remember them and treat them like the heroes they are. They earned that respect. Most of them, like I said, are getting older. A lot of them are sick.

1208,The Media Ignores the Good News On Climate Change,"By Rmuse on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 10:36 am To avoid climate-ending global temperature rise, it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy sources. Share on Twitter Print This Post *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Over the past few months, there has been a dearth of good news, and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical American election. Where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change. Even dismissing the horrible flooding, wildfires, droughts, sea level rise, melting ice caps, hurricanes and worldwide food shortages, there have only been dire reports on the level of CO2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly record-setting rise in global temperatures. 
This week, while most Americans were living, breathing and bleeding over Donald Trump and the tortuously-long presidential campaign, the International Energy Agency offered up some good news; for the climate, the Earth’s population, and even for America. 
The good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on Tuesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that stated according to new data, for the first time “Renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world.” 
It may not seem like such fantastic news, but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climate-ending 2-degree C rise in global temperatures, it is critical for the world to transition off of carbon-producing fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy generating sources. This is particularly true for getting off dirty coal-fired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of America’s C02 emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming. 
The IEA report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly two-thirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in, and coming from, developing and industrialized nations alike. For a developing nation, it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuel-generated power sources whether they are dirty coal-fired plants or not-quite-as-dirty natural gas-burning generating plants. 
The IEA also revised its earlier projections for renewable energy’s continued expansion and growth and “ significantly increased” the amount of “ green energy ” it expects to “ come on line ” over the next five years. Renewable energy includes so-called “green” sources such as biomass, biogas, eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Both terms, “renewable and green energy,” include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable. 
In addition to pro-renewable policies (such as the Paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the America-China deal to roll back coal-generated emissions, there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables; particularly in solar. And, the IEA projected that the worldwide costs for solar-generated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years. Onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same five-year period. 
Although the IEA report was incredibly good news for the entire planet, there was some extra good news in the report about America’s transition to renewable energy. According to the IEA’s Medium-Term Renewable Market Report, the United States is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing. What that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the ever-increasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity. Still, America has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of America’s electricity. 
In time and if the Koch brothers allow it, America may catch up to still-developing nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources. Industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy. 
Although there appears to be no down-side in this bit of good news, the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications. The dirty coal industry is facing some struggles in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices, financial mismanagement, and new clean-air regulations, but the amount of CO2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity. It is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs. 
The IEA couldn’t pass up the chance to note one “sticking point” in their otherwise encouraging report; “ persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy ” that renewables are not affecting. However, since the IEA only monitored and tracked the world’s transistor from oil and gas to biofuels, they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world, they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener, significantly cheaper, and one Hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people. 
It is a mystery how Republicans beholden to the Koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry, particularly the dirty coal industry, will absorb this good news. In the past eight years, Republicans , the Kochs, their lobbyists at the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals. It is likely that the IEA’s report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome. But now that more Americans are benefitting from renewable energy, particularly solar, Republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the Sun and saving the climate for their children’s future; something the IEA’s report never mentions.

1209,Russians Conduct Nuclear-Bomb Survival Drills as Cold War Heats Up,"Bomb shelters are upgraded, gas masks tested amid strained relations between Putin and U.S. By THOMAS GROVE 
MOSCOW—Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. 
At the Kremlin’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. 
The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. 
Videos of emergency workers deployed in hazmat suits or checking the ventilation in bomb shelters were prominently aired on television when the four days of drills were held across the country. Students tried on gas masks and placed dummies on stretchers in school auditoriums. 
The capital’s civil-defense plans are also being upgraded, said Andrey Mishchenko, deputy head of the ministry. 
“An inventory was taken in Moscow of the city’s underground spaces, in order to allow us to plan for sheltering 100% of the city’s population,” he said, as reported by state news agency RIA Novosti. 
In parallel, commentators on state-dominated airwaves issued some of the shrillest anti-American rhetoric in years. “Russia is sick of America’s arrogant lies,” influential commentator Dmitry Kiselyov said this month after a Syrian peace plan collapsed. 
After a mistaken strike by U.S.-led coalition warplanes on Syrian troops in September, Russia’s Defense Ministry warned that its air defense systems could shoot down any American plane that threatened its own forces. 
And when a Russian tabloid wrote that government officials had been asked to take their children back from the prestigious preparatory schools and universities they attend in Britain, France and the U.S., speculation swirled about preparation for all-out war with the U.S. 
The rhetoric reinforces Russians’ idea that their country is a superpower on par with the U.S. It also offers a distraction from an economic recession and from President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings, which have dipped from recent highs. The threat of nuclear war also keeps the population

1210,The Waning West: Too Many Millennials Are Cool With Communism,"Email 
“We learn from history that we do not learn from history,” observed German philosopher Georg Hegel. Perhaps nothing illustrates this better than a new survey showing that far too many “millennials” are not just cool to “capitalism,” but are actually cool with communism. As MarketWatch reports : Of the 2,300 Americans polled by YouGov , 80% of baby boomers and 91% of the elderly agree with the statement that “communism was and still is a problem” in the world today. Millennials? Only 55%. Furthermore, almost half of Americans between the ages of 16 and 20 said they would vote for a socialist, while 21% would go so far as to back a communist. Capitalism, on the other hand, is viewed favorably by 64% of those over the age of 65, compared with only 42% of millennials. 
Citing these results, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation’s Marion Smith stated, as quoted by MarketWatch , “One of the concerns [the foundation] has had since its establishment is that an emerging generation of Americans has little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history.” For sure. This was evidenced when a teenager once naively asked me, “What’s so bad about communism?” Another registered a look of shock when I gave him part of the answer: During the 20th century, Marxist governments exterminated approximately 100 million people, making them history’s most murderous ideologues. 
Related to this, MarketWatch also tells us that “a third of millennials say they believe more people were killed under George W. Bush than Joseph Stalin,” clearly oblivious to Stalin’s psychopathic actions having accounted for upwards of 20 million of the above number. Of course, 82 percent of millennials at least knew who Stalin was. This cannot be said regarding Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung; 42 percent of millennials were unfamiliar with this mass murderer of approximately 60 million. Forty percent didn’t know who Argentine Marxist and major Cuban Revolution figure Che Guevara was. With respect to Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, the “unacquainted with” figures were, respectively, 33 and 32 percent. 
Not surprisingly, this ignorance goes beyond history. While it’s troubling that almost half of those aged 16 to 20 would support a socialist, there’s good and bad news here. And they’re the same thing: 
These young people generally don’t know what socialism is. 
As I wrote in February, “People 18 to 29 just helped vault Senator Bernie Sanders to a resounding New Hampshire primary victory, not at all deterred by his socialist label. But while they view that positively, they don’t believe in socialist (in Sanders’) wealth redistribution. In fact, this research shows that they cotton to it little more than do average Americans and no more than their age group did 20 years ago. In other words, millennials may like the word socialism, but, as with so many others, they don’t understand well what it signifies or the nature of those for whom they vote.” 
In reality, the label “socialism” is applied loosely today, yet it has a firm definition. Note that socialism was popularized via Karl Marx’s and Friedrich Engels’ Communist Manifesto . And under Marxist doctrine, “socialism” — or the socialist revolution — is the transitional phase that extinguishes economic freedom and ushers in communism. Moreover, there are no communist governments because “communism” is the culmination of socialism, the stage where, the fanciful theory goes, the government has melted away and everyone lives happily and harmoniously in a state of economic equality-induced bliss. 
This is why the Iron Curtain-disgorging evil empire could, with a straight collective face, call itself the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. And it’s why we should see a red flag (pun intended) when a politician such as Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist. Maybe he’s more wizened than wise and doesn’t really know what the word means — or, perhaps, he knows full well — and is capitalizing on the fact that others don’t. 
Whatever the case, it would be a mistake to view socialist seduction as solely a “millennial” problem, as this only sparks intergenerational squabbling. For there are old fools and young fools and much foolishness in-between. Yet while we recognize that people are largely products of their upbringing, we nonetheless will analyze a given generation as if it’s a breed apart as opposed to what it almost always is: the next iteration in a pattern. 
Consider how 80 percent of Boomers consider communism a problem. While a high number, it’s still a statistically significant drop from their elders’ 91 percent figure. And this is just part of a pattern, with the percentage of each age group that views “socialism” positively being as follows: age 65+, 13 percent; 50-64, 25 percent; 30-49, 34 percent; 18-29, 49 percent ( Pew Research Center , Dec. 28, 2011). Evident here isn’t an overnight sea-change, but steadily increasing ignorance. 
Tragically, this is a worldwide phenomenon. Marxism has to an extent taken hold in Japan , Spain , and elsewhere, and Karl Marx is more popular than he has been in decades. As I wrote in 2013, “Sales of The Communist Manifesto (the best-selling book in history next to the Bible) and Das Kapital have soared since the 2008 financial crisis. Karl Marx was voted ‘favorite philosopher’ by BBC radio listeners, beating out contenders such as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Thomas Aquinas. And in an irony akin to having Marx’s picture on a Bible tract, his image is the one most often chosen by customers of Germany’s Sparkasse Chemnitz Bank — for their credit cards.” 
Given the above, it’s not surprising that what inspired mockery of late Senator Joe McCarthy has become reality: Marxist types abound in our government. New York City elected “Bolshevik” Bill de Blasio, who raised money for the Sandinistas, subscribed to their newsletter, and honeymooned in Cuba. John Drew, a former Barack Obama acquaintance and reformed Marxist with whom I’ve spoken personally, revealed that when he knew Obama, Obama was an “ardent Marxist-Leninist” who “was in 100 percent, total agreement with [his] Marxist professors”; this is no surprise because Obama’s mentor, Frank Marshall Davis, was a card-carrying member of the Communist Party USA. 
Then there are Obama’s appointees, such as former “Green Jobs Czar” and self-proclaimed communist Van Jones; former communications director Anita Dunn, who said that Mao Tse-tung was one of her “two favorite philosophers”; “Manufacturing Czar” Ron Bloom, who said in a speech, “We agree with Mao”; and “Global Warming Czar” Carol Browner, who was until recently listed as a leader of the socialist organization “Commission for a Sustainable World Society.” 
And, finally, there’s the woman who wants to succeed Obama, Hillary Clinton. Former Clinton operative Larry Nichols tells us that when he first met her, in the 1970s, she was wearing a medal around her neck stating, “Proud member of the American Communist Party” (video here ; forward to 6:07). No wonder the Communist Party USA is “all in” for Hillary . 
It’s also no wonder that Clinton is beating Donald Trump by 28 points among under-30 voters. But tolerance for socialism/communism is intolerable. If we learned that almost half of young Americans would vote for a fascist and 21 percent would go so far as to back a Nazi, we’d rightly be aghast. Instead, they’re warming to the ideological descendants of even more prolific killers. Hey, what’s 100 million victims between comrades?  ",0
1211,Russia and the United States Reach New Agreement on Syria Conflict - The New York Times,"GENEVA  —   Russia and the United States agreed early Saturday on a new plan to reduce violence in the Syrian conflict that, if successful, could lead for the first time to joint military targeting by the two powers against Islamic jihadists in Syria. The agreement was reached after 10 months of failed attempts to halt the fighting and of suspended efforts to reach a political settlement to an increasingly complex conflict that began more than five years ago. The conflict has left nearly half a million people dead, created the largest refugee crisis since World War II and turned Syria into a prime incubator of recruiting for the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, an affiliate of Al Qaeda. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, announced the agreement in Geneva after weeks of negotiations that were marred, in President Obama’s words, by deep “mistrust” between the Russians and Americans, who back opposite sides in Syria, but share an antipathy to the Islamic jihadists flourishing there. It came at a time when relations between the United States and Russia, which have worsened throughout much of the Obama administration, have been especially jolted by accusations of Russian hacking and subterfuge in American politics. The tensions have been further exacerbated by the effusive praise for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia by the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump. The new arrangement on Syria, set to begin Monday, was greeted with skepticism by Syrians on all sides and carries many risks of failure, which the Pentagon and Mr. Kerry acknowledged. “No one is basing this on trust,” he said. “We are basing it on oversight and compliance. ” The plan starts with a   continuous “genuine reduction of violence,” in Mr. Kerry’s words, and broad, unrestricted humanitarian access to the ravaged northern city of Aleppo and other besieged areas. If that works, the United States and Russia are to establish a Joint Implementation Center, where they will share targeting data, and begin to coordinate bombing of militants of the Nusra Front and the Islamic State. The key element is that Russia must then restrain the forces of President Bashar   of Syria from conducting any air operations over areas held by Nusra and other opposition forces. The United States hopes this will end the indiscriminate dropping of barrel bombs  —   including chlorine gas attacks  —   that have punctuated the conflict. In return, the United States is to persuade the opposition groups it has been supporting to separate themselves from the Nusra forces. Mr. Assad has attacked many of them on the pretense of attacking Nusra fighters. American officials expressed strong reservations about whether this new arrangement would work. Especially skeptical was the Pentagon, long suspicious of Russian intentions in Syria, since the Kremlin first deployed military forces there to help Mr. Assad a year ago. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was among Obama administration officials who raised questions over whether either Russia or the Assad government would comply with the terms. Mr. Kerry’s announcement of the deal, Mr. Lavrov at his side, was permeated with caveats. “We believe the plan, if implemented, if followed, has the ability to provide a turning point, a change,” he said. But he sounded far more cautious here than he did in Munich in February when he announced an earlier “cessation of hostilities” that failed. The accord was reached after sharp divisions inside the Obama administration over the wisdom of sharing targeting information with Russia, and accusations that the Russians have used the negotiating period to help Mr. Assad regain control in Aleppo and strike at   opposition groups. For Mr. Obama, who asked Mr. Kerry to keep working on the negotiation after the president failed to reach an accord with Mr. Putin during the Group of 20 summit meeting in China last weekend, the new accord poses considerable risks. For example, if the bombing of Nusra sites kills civilians  —   almost inevitable given the proximity of militant extremist groups and civilians  —   there are bound to be accusations about who is responsible. Pentagon officials are also concerned that Russia will use the targeting data to learn more about how American forces identify and attack targets, at a time when forces from the two countries are often near one another around Europe. Mr. Lavrov took a few shots at the United States even while celebrating the arrangement, denouncing “arrogant sanctions” levied against Russia for its annexation of Crimea two years ago. Late on Friday, he suggested the United States could not decide about the deal, sending pizza and vodka to reporters to ease the wait, and coming by to joke about how long it took Mr. Obama and his team to make decisions. But for Mr. Kerry, reaching this deal has become a personal mission, one that at times put him in conflict with the White House. He has pressed for a stronger military commitment in Syria and support for some opposition groups, along with a series of more aggressive covert actions, according to administration officials. Mr. Obama has been reluctant, as have others in the White House who fear that, even if they could engineer a transition in Syria, it could create a power vacuum that Iran, Russia and militant terrorist groups could exploit. The American skepticism is partly rooted in the failed agreement for a cessation of hostilities reached with the Russians in February. That arrangement collapsed weeks later when Russia moved heavy artillery into the Aleppo area to help Mr. Assad’s forces. Among the Syrians, the latest plan was greeted with wariness, particularly from armed opposition groups and their supporters, who, broadly speaking, have come to believe that the United States has lost interest in ousting Mr. Assad, and is willing to see them wiped out. It is a measure of how little trust the Syrians have in the international community  —   especially after the     in February  —   that initial reactions were lukewarm, even though the deal holds out the possibility of at least a temporary calming of the violence. Armed opposition groups read the deal as ordering them to remove   Nusra fighters from their areas, something they lack the military power to do alone, or else face attack by the United States  —   a country that has provided some of the rebel groups with training and weapons for years. Some government opponents noted that the deal came hours after Syrian military forces  —   with Russian air support  —     their siege of the   sections of Aleppo. While Mr. Kerry began his announcement by noting that Mr. Assad’s airstrikes were, as he put it, “the main driver of civilian casualties and migration flows,” the deal  —   as partly described  —   contains many loopholes that could allow them to continue. And no measures were described that would hold any of the parties to account if they violated the terms of a deal that is being struck at a time when the United States has little leverage over Russia in Syria. The deal allows Syrian government warplanes to continue to fly missions in some areas that are to be defined later. And Russia and the United States will target areas where they both agree Nusra or Islamic State fighters are present. What that really means hinges on how Russia and the United States define legitimate opposition groups that cannot be targeted under the deal, and how they define areas where Nusra is present. The deal also failed to mention anything about the presence of foreign Shiite militias  —   such as Hezbollah, which like Al Qaeda and Islamic State is considered a terrorist group by the United States  —   fighting on the Syrian government’s side. It also said nothing about the tens of thousands of detainees in Syrian government prisons, whose release had long been touted as a possible measure under a deal. And while it spoke of allowing aid deliveries into besieged areas, it said nothing of lifting the sieges and restoring freedom of movement of goods and people.",0
1212,"Dispatches from Wolf Country –Sitting in my cave, watching the spider spin","  Without intention, Mike kind fulfills the proverb that not all who wander are lost. A 1973 graduate of the College of the Holy Cross with a BA in Philosophy, he had successfully dodged the draft during Vietnam, despite his lottery number of 29. Logically, after failing at being a bum for a year after college, he then enlisted in the Army. His theory was to hang out for two years, go to Germany, date blondes, drink lots of beer, improve his wretched German and come home to use the GI Bill for Graduate School. Didn’t quite work out that way; he did go to Germany and stayed five years first tour; married a red-headed American GI who worked in S2; did drink lots of beer and developed some acuity with pidgin Deutsch. Mike re-enlisted and then wandered through a great 23 years as a soldier. A lot of it sucked, of course; but, he avoided ending his adolescence until the end of the 23 years…since then, he’s been in a fight to regain that feeling of camaraderie, purpose and trust. Mike chose to stay a career NCO. There were a couple of dozen reasons, but they’re best summed up by the fact that he really didn’t like officers. He still doesn’t, sheepishly at times admitting that “Some of my best friends are officers. Some of my best friends are gay. Some of my best friends are gay officers. I’m not gay and I’m not an officer – I like it better that way.” He got his initial First Sergeant assignment in his 14th year and basically stayed a First Sergeant until he retired, as a First Sergeant. If he hadn’t retired, the day after the retirement would have been the day he pinned on CSM stripes but, as he says, “Some of my best friends are Sergeant Majors; some of my best friends are hookers. I’m not a Sergeant Major and I’m not a hooker and that works fine for me.” Since retiring, Mike’s worked in Labor Relations, HR and General Management for government, tribes, nonprofits and for profits including Defense Contractors. He’s found that his “not being a hooker” approach hasn’t necessarily worked to his career advantage. He’s picked up a bunch of irrelevant graduate degrees, that basically were there to teach you how to be a Hobbit. Hobbits are small, insignificant fearful types who scurry around getting in the way and accomplishing nothing of any great merit. He believes that the movies would have been infinitely better had the bad guys killed off all the Hobbits in the first part of the first movie, and then spent the rest of it avenging the little twits. Mike really hates Hobbits He’s a Senior Professional in Human Resources and a Six Sigma Black Belt. He plays guitar, reads, broods and drives too fast in fast cars – currently, a Mustang GT – channeling Hunter S. Thompson, patrolling “on the edge of the desert, just outside of Barstow.” An avowed leftist and philosophical Stoic, Mike admits that everything is probably going to hell, but thinks that it’s the duty of people of honor to work to stop it from going there too quick. Since he regards all veterans as his extended family, he expects that they’ll do the same. An oddly religious guy, Mike believes that God is a not very bright, self—entered and hormonal teenage girl obsessed with the Jonas Brothers and whether or not her Daisy Duke jeans make her ass look fat. They do, but he’s not going to be the one to tell her the truth. God can’t handle the truth. While he might write about anything, he’s really interested in business, economics and how to keep people from being screwed by machines, be they corporate, government, or societal. He's also interested in guitars... Dispatches from Wolf Country –Sitting in my cave, watching the spider spin By Mike Farrell on November 9, 2016 I didn't think much of Donald Trump. I still don't -- I think he's a vulgar, crooked, misogynistic, racist, elitist, intellectually stunted, narcissistic, naive and utterly unprepared to be president. I think Mike Pence is a right wing troll. The thought of Newt Gingrich as Secretary of State and Rudy Giuliani as Secretary of State and Attorney General makes my skin crawl. Well, that's fine. I voted, and had my say. Now I have to deal with reality. Like it or not, we have to be adult about this. A man’s got to have a code, a creed to live by, no matter his job. –John Wayne 
Lord, she never even stopped She left fifty or sixty people still sittin’ on their cars And they’re wonderin’ what it’s comin’ to And how it got this far Oh but me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime By a mad dog, runaway red-silver streamline…train Guy Clark, Texas 1947 
As the election slogs on to the end, I’ve been relatively quiet. There was a lot to digest, a lot to think about. Obviously not in the election campaigns; they’ve been short of thought. But the implications of the demographic change in the USA, the failure of our education system, the stubbornness of entrenched wealth, and the lack of intellectual vibrancy, integrity and should provide a lot things to think about going forward. The Trump experience is going to be with us for a long time. What other people — historians, political scientists, theologians, journalists, and leaders — call American Constitutional Democracy, he condemns as a rigged system. As Bill Mahar has pointed out frequently, “When is a rich white guy in this country going to get an even break!” In an odd way, it’s true — in any contest against the rich white guys, the odds for them are always 60-40; for the rest of us, that means our odds are 60-40 against. Well, the early 20th century with Wilson Minzer contended pretty successfully that in life, the odds are always 60-40 against. I think that’s hell of an advantage people like Trump have to screw up just to face the same odds most of us face in getting through life. The thing in this election that will probably make the difference is that sometimes wealth is money, sometimes it’s access to media, and sometimes it’s something else. In this election, it’s something else. Farrell, November 6, 2016 

And then, boys and girls, I turned away from the computer because I realized that I wasn’t sure what it was that I wanted to say. Like a lot of folks from the Northeast who paid attention to New York City, I didn’t think much of Donald Trump. I still don’t — I think he’s a vulgar, crooked, misogynistic, racist, elitist, intellectually stunted, narcissistic, naive and utterly unprepared to be president. I think Mike Pence is a right wing troll. The thought of Newt Gingrich as Secretary of State and Rudy Giuliani as Secretary of State and Attorney General makes my skin crawl. 
Well, that’s fine. I voted, and had my say. Now I have to deal with a reality as a responsible citizen and patriot. Like it or not, we have to be adult about this. I think the best advice ever for an actual American who cares about his country and what it stands for was given by Marion Mitchell Morrison, better known as John Wayne, the week after the election in 1960. 
Progressives would regard Wayne as a Wingnut. He was a Goldwater Republican and a fierce patriot. He defined manhood for a couple of generations of boys and men; it’s an image that defined manhood for a lot of people. His characters weren’t him; he wasn’t his characters, but I think he was inspired by a lot of them to be something more than he was. He pushed himself to be something more than he was. He had a lot of warts, but ultimately he faced them, wore them and didn’t let them get in his way. I’m not sure who the equivalent character would be in cinema today — George Clooney? It’s actually pretty simple, there is known. I suspect it’s probably Bruce Springsteen for a lot of people, because of the impact of rock and roll on my generation and those that follow it. 
Wayne was asked what he thought about Kennedy’s election and Nixon’s defeat. His response was simple, straight and honest. I didn’t vote for him but he’s my president, and I hope he does a good job. –John Wayne 
That quote is fairly well known and often quoted, usually by progressives pointing out the problems with Conservative Obstruction and totally absurd complaints. That use has been justified. But, a lesser known quote from the Duke on the inauguration of Jimmy Carter is worth considering now. 
I’m pleased to be present and accounted for in this capital of freedom to witness history as it happens – to watch a common man accept the uncommon responsibility he won ‘fair and square’ by stating his case to the American people – not by bloodshed, be-headings, and riots at the palace gates. I know I’m a member of the loyal opposition – accent on the loyal. I’d have it no other way. John Wayne, Washington, DC. January 20, 1977 
So, President Trump, as did President Obama, will have a unique opportunity to do something. I do not think Trump has the temperament and the knowledge to be a great president but like Wayne, what the hell do I know? He isn’t a politician and he hasn’t worked in government. I suspect he’s in for a steep learning curve. I hope he has the wisdom to find some people to advise him who have that kind of experience so that he can be successful. 

Like it or not, the election shows that we are in fact a badly divided commonwealth. There’s little agreement across party lines on a wide variety of things. Some of those things are ontological — what’s the nature of truth? How important is it? Does logic matter as much, more or less than emotion? What are the limits of discourse in public? What constitutes unreasonable insult and what constitutes reasonable epithet? How do you deal with disagreement? How do you discuss policy? How do you deal with the political problems caused by economic and demographic change? 
It’s going to be interesting. President Trump has to satisfy his supporters while reconciling with those who oppose him. Since a lot of his supporters are conditioned to envy, mistrust and despise the rich bastards and Gatsby types — sound like anyone we know? — and a lot of his opponents are inclined to to distrust, despise and want restitution for his victory, it’s going to be a Herculean task for the guy to get them to agree on whether to order chicken, hamburgers or fish at a team building retreat, let alone actually do anything. 
I have to think that President Obama has had an interesting morning as well. Trump doesn’t have majorities like Obama had in Congress in 2009 and has a somewhat more disgruntled electorate. While I’m sure Obama may be tempted to short sheet the beds and put Icy Hot on the toilet seats in the Executive Mansion, I suspect he’ll be gracious and do whatever he can to assist President Trump to a smooth and reasonable transition. 
I think Lincoln had the best advice for all of us as this unfolds. Be nice if we could agree to it and be scored against it. With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. — Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural, March 4, 1865",0
1213,A Transformational November of Taking a Stand,"Leave a reply 
Henry Seltzer – The astrology of November features Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Eris. All the outer planets are strongly represented in the New Moon and Full Moon configurations, so that, as the month continues to unfold, our awareness of the transformational intensity of these times that we are living through is ever-present. The October 30th New Moon sets the stage for this powerful November cycle, bringing forward into the picture the astrological factor of thoughtful Mercury, in close conjunction with the Sun and Moon that day, and representing greater consciousness and a species of abstract logical analysis. 
The sign placement of these personal planets being Scorpio becomes an added factor of emotional intensity that stirs us deeply, especially when we consider that Mercury is in partile or same-degree trine formation with the Pisces placement of numinous Neptune. We are therefore this entire month experiencing a compassionate and a highly idealized time of recognizing what we all hold deep inside ourselves, that directly connects with, and supports and underlies, the surface details of all our activities in the visible physical plane that we more consciously inhabit. 
As befits this Scorpionic time of the year, the surface layers of our more normative comings and goings are only part of the story now, with the vast unseen realm of unconscious process taking a major role in the characterization of this month’s true activity. 
Neptune, along with the other outer planets, represents access to numinous realities beyond the purely physical, the significant life of our deep internal process. This is the vast unconscious realm, deep within, which Freud and Jung first annunciated in the early 20th century, and which finds even greater credence today. The highlighted placements of Uranus with Eris, and of Saturn and Pluto, complete the roster of planetary significators, also including Venus in close aspect with Mercury and Mars at the timing of the mid-month Full Moon that punctuates this rather intense monthly cycle. 
The new planet, Eris, beyond Pluto, only named as recently as 2006, represents the astrological archetype of Spiritual Warrior: that is to say the determination to stand up for what one most deeply believes, at soul level. This energy is strongly highlighted now, and is thus prominent on our inner radar, because still within little more than a degree of Uranus, and closely squared by Mars, in the timing of the New Moon that initiates the Scorpio cycle. 
The question that comes up for everyone quite poignantly these days is whether you can find that inner urge for true achievement, what you feel, at the most profound level, that you must, at all costs, accomplish in this lifetime. This might have nothing to do with success in the eyes of the world, but is nevertheless vital from the standpoint of an inner drive, deep within, for what feels most important. 
This month of November represents quite a ride. When we see in the timing of the First Quarter Moon of Monday, November 7th, that the Sun and Moon are closely aligned with both Saturn and Pluto, in the same degree that they occupy, in the two signs between, and that Saturn is almost exactly in parallel aspect with Pluto, we can be sure that in some profound and completely individual fashion, the structure of our lives is changing. 
We can see this also in the collective, where this thought can give us courage as we come to understand that we are not hopelessly enmired in an existing status quo, but that everything, even the underlying social fabric of our lives, is in serious flux. 
With the Full Moon of the following Monday, November 14th, at the 22 degree mark of Scorpio, the same degree that Eris occupies in Aries, we come to a culmination of these remarkable two weeks, the launch point for the remainder of the November cycle. We come as well to a better understanding of what we have going on deep within us. This includes the necessity for standing up for ourselves, and for our most deeply held values, no matter what.

1214,"Senate Formally Takes Up Gorsuch Nomination, and Braces for Turmoil - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The Senate on Tuesday began formal debate on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, hurtling toward a blistering partisan conflict this week over the selection itself, the chamber’s future rules and the decaying standards of civility among lawmakers. The consideration of Judge Gorsuch began as the Republican majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, took a procedural step to end debate this week on President Trump’s nominee. Mr. McConnell’s maneuver will set in motion a series of critical votes expected to take place on Thursday and Friday. With an almost certain Democratic filibuster of the nomination, the Senate is to vote first on whether to end debate and proceed to an    vote. If the filibuster holds, meaning fewer than 60 senators vote to proceed to a full vote on the nominee, Republicans have said they will pursue the   nuclear option: changing longstanding rules to elevate Judge Gorsuch on a simple majority vote. That would allow Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed on Friday. Yet, if the ultimate outcome has seemed preordained for weeks, lawmakers nonetheless felt compelled on Tuesday to frame the confrontation on their terms: Republicans have argued that the responsibility for their own prospective vote  —   upending Senate tradition to bypass the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations  —   actually lies with Democrats. Many have refrained from even uttering the phrase “nuclear option” when pressed, despite its common use in the Capitol, for apparent fear of associating with an act of procedural aggression. At the same time, Democrats have operated on two tracks: They have sought to present their opponents as hypocrites by reminding the public about Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee for the seat last year, whom Republicans refused to even consider during a presidential election year. But the minority party has insisted that its resistance to Judge Gorsuch is not about retribution, citing his record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence from Mr. Trump, among other concerns. They have argued that the nomination should be withdrawn if the judge cannot earn 60 votes. “We lost one, they lost one,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told reporters, predicting a successful blockade. “We should now get in a room and come up with a compromise. ” Mr. McConnell said he would have no choice but to change the rules if faced with a filibuster. “Americans will be watching. History will be watching,” he said, urging Democrats to abandon their plans. “And the future of the Senate will hang on their choice. ” The posturing came one day after Judge Gorsuch was approved 11 to 9 by the Judiciary Committee in a   vote. Both sides have pointed repeatedly to examples of escalating obstructionism in recent years, from Democratic attempts to block judicial nominees under President George W. Bush to a   proliferation of Republican filibusters under Mr. Obama. Most senators seemed to agree that they were participating in a low moment for the chamber, even as they appeared resigned to the conclusion. Grim reflection has grown more common than usual, which is saying something. “There’s a reason they call it the nuclear option,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. “There’s fallout. ” He alluded to Republican criticism of the Democrats’ choice in 2013, when they held the Senate majority, to bar filibusters on lower judgeships and executive branch nominees. “There is no equivalence,” Mr. Blumenthal said. Asked what was happening to an institution many lawmakers still revere, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, stared gravely at a group of reporters in the basement of the Capitol. “Partisanship. Partisanship. Partisanship. Partisanship,” he said. (The word returned occasionally later in his remarks.) Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, suggested there were still sporadic conversations underway between senators about a possible deal to avert the coming maelstrom. “But nothing promising,” he said.",0
1215,"At Rio Olympics, the National Anthem Sounds … Sad? - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The playing of the United States’ national anthem at Olympic medal ceremonies is bringing tears to the eyes of American athletes here. Elsewhere, the song is having a very different effect. “It is driving me crazy,” said Jason DeBord, a    living in Ann Arbor, Mich. “I hit the mute button, or I make dinner, or I just sit there and brace myself. ” DeBord has nothing against displays of patriotism, nor is he simply eager to return to the action. What irritates him is the version of “The   Banner” being used at the Olympics. Put bluntly, it has been butchered. O. K. that might overstate the problem. Maybe it would be more accurate to say the song has been altered in ways that rob it of its oomph, its power and its optimistic essence. Specifically, DeBord said, this “Banner” segues several times to minor chords, which in the Western canon are considered melancholic, in places where major chords, which are heartier and more upbeat, are the norm. The effect, DeBord said, is a rendering of the anthem that is darker and sadder. “It has a totally different emotional feel,” he said. “It is supposed to have an ascending chord structure. Instead, it sort of has a descending chord structure. ” In short, this is a defeatist “  Banner,” and it is broadcast, around the globe, at a moment of ecstatic, international triumph. DeBord, who spent 16 years on Broadway as a conductor and pianist, is on the faculty at the University of Michigan’s department of musical theater. He is the first to admit that few people are likely to notice, let alone be bothered by, the elements of the song that annoy him. But when he posted his feelings on his Facebook page, he quickly found that he had company. Lots of perturbed company. “Glad it’s not just me,” one commenter wrote. Another person posted: “Sounds like a music school project gone awry. Just awful. ” “I’m not on Twitter,” someone else added, “but there must be a way to tell ‘them’! !!” Asked for the particulars of his beef with this “Banner,” DeBord offered to head to the piano in his home and provide a live tutorial, over the phone. He quickly plowed through the beginning of the song  —   “O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light”  —   but stopped when he got to “What so proudly we hailed. ” At “proudly,” he noted, the Olympic version of the anthem goes to one of those sad, dark minor chords where majors have long been the norm. He played the standard version and then the Olympic version  —   standard, Olympic, over and over. Once he pointed out the difference, it was obvious. The Olympic version was conciliatory, maybe even retreating. The standard version was   and on the offense. “It happens again on ‘rockets’ red glare,’” he said, hands on the piano, “and then again on ‘land of the free. ’” There is no official or definitive version of “The   Banner,” and that is no accident. The 1931 bill signed into law by President Herbert Hoover that adopted the song as the nation’s anthem is a model of terseness. It is mum about both lyrics and arrangement, which, said Mark Clague, an associate professor of musicology at the University of Michigan, is one reason the anthem has continued to evolve over the years. “When Francis Scott Key wrote it, he’d just seen a decisive victory in Baltimore in the War of 1812, which was like a second war of independence,” he said in an interview. “He writes the song in celebration, and it’s played for years with a celebratory feel,   and light. Only later does it become the song we know, slower and more majestic. ” Clague, who is working on a book about “The   Banner,” did indeed notice the new Olympic take on the song. What struck him most was the way it handled the climactic “land of the free,” which is typically wrung for maximum emotion. “Here it goes to a minor chord,” he said, “so rather than having that firm, confident expression of the word ‘free,’ you get an unstable, questioning chord. Where you should be feeling victory, you have a question mark. ” Clague sounds less bothered by this take on the anthem. Maybe it is because he knows thousands of versions have been created over the years and he regards the tune as a variety of clay that everyone is free to mold. He also surmises that the arranger was adapting the song for the moment. “When we play the anthem in the U. S. it’s often all about creating a sense of unity in the country,” he said. “The Olympics is a very different context. We’re really celebrating brotherhood, international cooperation, rather than martial qualities that anthems are often called upon to express. Three flags are being raised, not one. So I think that what has happened here is they’ve softened the song,   the militant aspect and emphasizing the song’s lyrical side, to bring out the    idea. ” The United States Olympic Committee said it was not responsible for submitting the anthem to Olympic organizers. The group that is running the Rio Games said it would look into the origin of the United States anthem being played here. This version may not be making its Olympic debut. According to DeBord and Clague, the version heard here in Rio was also used at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and the 2012 Summer Games in London. Those were in the key of C major and were 70 seconds long. During a medal ceremony, Shazam, the song identification app, tagged the track as “The London Philharmonic Orchestra  Philip Sheppard. ” If this rendition originated in London, where did London get it? As it happens, a 2012 YouTube video shows the ambitious effort undertaken in the   to the London Games to record new arrangements of more than 200 national anthems. That project was led by Sheppard, a British composer, cellist and professor at the Royal Academy of Music whose website states that he has scored more than 30 films and worked with David Bowie, Jeff Buckley, the Weeknd and many other recording artists. In the video, he is seen conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road, the studio made famous by the Beatles. Sheppard could not be reached Wednesday. “The anthems serve a particular purpose at the Olympics,” he tells an   interviewer in the video. “That is namely to get the flag up the pole during the gold medal ceremonies. ” He is making the practical point that the songs cannot go on and on. So one of his biggest challenges, he said, was ensuring that each anthem lasted 60 to 90 seconds. This meant dramatic cuts for some anthems  —   like Uruguay’s, which usually lasts for six and a half minutes  —   and looping repetition for others, like Uganda’s, which is only nine bars long. All the countries had to sign off on the new arrangements, Sheppard says. At one moment in the video, he sounds a little nervous about whether Britain will give a  . The video ends, inexplicably, with the full,   rendering of “The   Banner” as the camera shows an American flag. There is no commentary. Is it possible that Sheppard went with minor chords as a way to shave time off the tune? The standard “land of the free,” for instance, when milked properly, takes its time. DeBord doubts it. But for him, the need for edits could never justify such maddening results. “You don’t need to compromise a piece of music,” he said, “to make it work for time. ”",0
1216,Single woman genuinely loves getting shitfaced alone,"Single woman genuinely loves getting shitfaced alone 01-11-16 A WOMAN who went to a dinner party with three annoying couples would definitely rather be getting hammered at home, she has confirmed. Nikki Hollis was invited to dinner by friends concerned she might be lonely and sad due to being single, when she would rather have been at home with some wine and not having to put up with their tedious married bullshit. Hollis, 32, said: “I only went along to humour them, as I know it makes them feel good to patronise me a bit about being single, especially as they are all clearly seething with resentment towards their partners. “But it was a wasted night really, as for me there is no greater pleasure than spending the night in, getting pissed and not having to talk about middle class wank. “Sometimes I drink a bottle of Prosecco from one of those massive Sports Direct mugs using a straw, just because there’s no one around to get funny about me not using a ‘proper’ glass. “Then I’ll watch seven episodes of Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares in a row before nearly setting the house on fire making toast. “Would I swap it for being tutted at and asked if I’m coming to bed soon?

1217,South Korean Leader Digs In Against Rising Calls for Impeachment - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   She is facing impeachment and prosecution over allegations of corruption and  . One of her advisers is being likened to Rasputin by a shrill South Korean news media. Increasingly large crowds of protesters have taken to the streets, demanding her resignation. President Park   has been paralyzed by a bizarre scandal and an escalating public backlash that could make her the first South Korean leader to be removed from office since her father, the military dictator Park   was assassinated in 1979. But even as her approval rating slips into the low single digits, Ms. Park has been defiant, meaning that South Korea’s worst political crisis in decades is likely to drag on for months, leaving her conservative government distracted and in disarray while it grapples with a slowing economy and rising household debt. Moreover, with reports that the cold conflict over North Korea’s nuclear missile program may be heating up as   Donald J. Trump prepares to take office in Washington, the standoff in Seoul could leave the United States with a seriously hobbled ally. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Seoul for what is believed to be the largest protest against a South Korean president. The protest capped a dramatic week in which a scandal involving a shadowy adviser to Ms. Park moved inexorably toward an impeachment vote in the National Assembly and government prosecutors accused her of criminal conspiracy, the first time a sitting president has been identified as a criminal suspect. Two top aides, meanwhile, have talked of resigning, saying they are unable to serve amid the storm of the scandal. Ms. Park has remained cloistered in the presidential Blue House, denying the charges against her through a spokesman and refusing to allow prosecutors to question her. “The president has no intention of stepping down, the people are fighting on the streets, and the government is paralyzed,” said Woo   the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party. “We have no option but to impeach her. ” An impeachment vote, expected early next month, requires a   majority to pass. If the opposition parties remain united, they will need fewer than 30 votes from Ms. Park’s governing Saenuri Party to impeach her. The vote would have to be ratified by the Constitutional Court. One prominent defection came last week when Kim   a former party chairman and Ms. Park’s presidential campaign manager, vowed to impeach her, saying she had “betrayed the people and our party. ” The alleged conspiracy revolves around a secret presidential adviser and confidante, Choi   who was indicted on Nov. 20 on charges of exploiting her influence with Ms. Park to gain access to confidential government documents and to force businesses to donate $69 million to two foundations she controlled. Prosecutors said Ms. Park was an accomplice in the scheme, directing her aides to help Ms. Choi shake down major corporations like Samsung and Hyundai. But it is Ms. Park’s   relationship with Ms. Choi, who has been described as a “shaman fortuneteller” by opposition politicians, that has enthralled  South Koreans. Ms. Choi’s father, Choi   the founder of the Church of Eternal Life and a   messiah, had been a mentor to Ms. Park. According to a report by the Korean intelligence agency, he approached her after her mother was assassinated in 1974, telling her that her dead mother had spoken to him in his dreams. The report said Mr. Choi had cultivated his influence with Ms. Park, the dictator’s daughter, to solicit bribes and accumulate a family fortune. According to the Nov. 20 indictment, his daughter continued the family business. Ms. Choi’s former driver told the Segye Ilbo newspaper last week that he had delivered a suitcase of cash from the Choi family to bankroll Ms. Park’s run for Parliament in the late 1990s. During her presidential campaign in 2012 and even after her inauguration, Ms. Choi edited Ms. Park’s speeches, Ms. Park has acknowledged. After Ms. Park took office in 2013, Ms. Choi used her connections to force a Seoul university to accept her daughter and give her good grades even though she hardly attended any classes, Education Ministry officials said. In 2014, Ms. Park instructed an aide to ask Hyundai Motor Company to sign a contract with a parts supplier owned by a friend of Ms. Choi’s, prosecutors said in their indictment of Ms. Choi. Ms. Choi later collected $44, 000 in kickbacks from her friend. In February, again acting on Ms. Park’s orders, the aide asked Hyundai to hire Ms. Choi’s advertising agency. Ms. Choi’s company earned $780, 000 from the account. Ms. Park was accused of leaking secret government documents to Ms. Choi, who did not have security clearance and had no experience in government or policy making. She shared with Ms. Choi classified information on things like appointments to top government jobs and where the government planned to build a sports complex. Two of Ms. Park’s former aides were also indicted. As early as 2013, officials tried to raise alarms about Ms. Park’s relationship with Ms. Choi, only to be demoted, fired or even imprisoned. A police detective who worked in the president’s office filed a report in 2014 accusing relatives and associates of Ms. Choi of meddling in state affairs. The detective was reassigned, and was then charged with leaking government documents, convicted and sent to prison. Ms. Park has publicly apologized twice for the scandal in televised speeches, saying she let her guard down with a trusted friend. But she has not said she knew of any extortion, and her office last week called the prosecutors’ findings groundless. “We don’t think the prosecutors’ investigation has been fair or politically neutral,” said her spokesman, Jung  . Party loyalists have banded together to thwart the impeachment effort. Lee   the party’s chairman, warned against breaking ranks: “Even if you jump off because the ship is tilting, the only thing that awaits you is a sea of death. ” He also compared party members wanting to impeach Ms. Park to Judas. Still, the prosecutors’ revelations alienated even some of Ms. Park’s staunchest conservative allies, many of whom saw her as a replica of her father, who was revered for leading the country out of poverty. Critics say her administration has been a poor copy, mimicking some of her father’s authoritarian tendencies and lacking his effectiveness and policy drive. She has shunned    briefings from her top aides and has held only one news conference a year. Her perceived aloofness came under fire after the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014, in which more than 300 people died. She emerged from her residence seven hours after she was first informed of the accident. At the same time, she adopted a   policy against North Korea and agreed to base American defensive missiles in South Korea, angering China. North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests over the last decade and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles this year, with the professed goal of developing a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. Although they are disillusioned with Ms. Park, many South Korean conservatives also fear that her travails have increased the chances of a progressive candidate winning the next presidential election and reversing or softening South Korea’s policy on the North. At this point, Ms. Park’s fate may hang on timing as much as the weight of the evidence. If an impeachment bill passes, her presidential powers will be suspended while the Constitutional Court has six months to rule on its validity. Ms. Park’s   term ends in February 2018. Analysts say she is buying time by stonewalling the investigation, hoping for the uproar to subside or for the National Assembly or the   Constitutional Court to vote against impeaching her. Running out the clock on impeachment will not necessarily spare her from prosecution, however. Already identified by prosecutors as a criminal suspect, she could be arrested the day she leaves office and loses her presidential immunity. That does not appear to be a privilege she will give up voluntarily. “She will sit tight, even if the entire 50 million people of South Korea turn out to deny her presidency and demand her resignation,” former Prime Minister Kim   Ms. Park’s relative, told the newsmagazine Sisa Journal this month. “Once she gets bullheaded, no one can budge her. ”",0
1218,"Vivian Howard, a TV Chef, Offers Hope for Her Rural Hometown - The New York Times","KINSTON, N. C.  —   Just before Christmas, in the soup kitchen that serves this small town built on tobacco, textiles and hogs, the chef and cooking show star Vivian Howard finished stirring a pot of pork and sweet potato stew and turned to a local television reporter. How does it feel, the reporter asked, to know that she had saved her hometown? “If I had saved Kinston,“ she replied, “we wouldn’t need a food bank, and all these people wouldn’t be waiting for lunch. ” Ms. Howard, 38, has been called many things. Her mother calls her the life of the party. Her father calls her Big Time, a nickname from her childhood. A few of the 80 people she employs call her a control freak. But “hometown hero” may be the label that makes her most uncomfortable. “Saving a town was not what I was trying to do,” she said. “I’m just a storyteller. A storyteller who cooks. ” Still, Ms. Howard, the girl who spent her childhood plotting an escape from this rural eastern North Carolina county, has become an unlikely engine in its economic and cultural revival. Twelve years ago, when her family talked her into coming home to open a restaurant, she thought that somehow she had failed. Now, Ms. Howard is five seasons into “A Chef’s Life,” her popular public television show. Her restaurant, Chef  the Farmer, attracts talent from the best professional kitchens in the South traveling food celebrities drop by to learn about the region. New restaurants, galleries and a brewery have come to town. The lady who taught her how to make biscuits can charge tourists $100 for a private lesson. At first glance, the show seems an unlikely hit: a     about running a restaurant, managing a family and how best to cook regional specialties like cabbage collards or flounder caught from the nearby Atlantic, or seasoning meat coaxed from the jowls and tails of pigs. Guests include the guy at the fish store, the neighbors who make collard kraut, and the farmer who sells the restaurant its vegetables. But to many of the show’s three million fans, and to the guests who travel hundreds of miles to eat at her restaurant, Ms. Howard is a rural Princess Leia. In the wake of an election that laid bare the nation’s political, cultural and economic divisions, her life has a particular resonance with the kind of people who see her story as theirs. “What I came to realize was that much of rural America feels forgotten and misunderstood and, frankly, hopeless,” Ms. Howard said. “Urban folks are afraid of rural folks, and rural folks are afraid of urban folks. On our show, we try to bridge the gap. ” She and her team paid for the first season, which aired in 2013, with a crowdsourcing campaign and a little money from organizations like the North Carolina Pork Council, Blue Cross Blue Shield and a group of civic leaders. The show was something of a Hail Mary pass for a region trying to find something to replace tobacco production and factory work. “I like to call it more like ‘Waiting for Guffman,’” said Ben Knight, 40, Ms. Howard’s husband and the restaurant’s manager, who enjoys his own celebrity status among fans. The show caught on, winning a Peabody Award and a daytime Emmy. Sponsorship is so robust that they can afford to pay some of the local residents who appear as guests. On about any weekend night, most of the 220 diners who land a seat at her restaurant will be from somewhere else. Her parents, John and Scarlett, are regulars. After they eat, they’ll take a spin through the parking to count the    license plates. “It’s the darn craziest thing I have ever seen,” John Howard said. “People will drive 300 miles for a meal. ” (As one of the state’s largest commodity hog producers, he also can’t believe the price his daughter pays for local,   pork.) On a recent night, Sarah Reichard, 35, arrived for dinner with her husband, Mitch MacDougall, 34. The vacationing Maryland couple had brought a copy of Ms. Howard’s   new book, “Deep Run Roots,” neatly annotated, with sticky notes marking their favorite recipes. At 564 pages, the book is both an important catalog of the unique cooking style of coastal North Carolina and a record of the emotional journey of a young woman who grew up feeling disenfranchised and ashamed of her people. Ms. Reichard, who was raised in a small Pennsylvania town, trembled as she spoke with Ms. Howard. “She talks about things I feel all the time,” she said. “I hate where I’m from, too. ” From as early as she can remember, Ms. Howard had wanted to get out of Deep Run, the slip of a community near Kinston where she was born. She was in boarding school by 14, then headed to North Carolina State, where she dreamed of becoming a journalist. She moved to New York, burned out at an advertising agency, and stumbled into a waitressing job at Voyage, a globally influenced   restaurant in the West Village. There, she fell in love with a   Mr. Knight, 40, an artist who paints large abstract works with glossy acrylics. She attended the Institute of Culinary Education, interned at Wylie Dufresne’s   and cooked on the line at   Vongerichten’s Spice Market. The couple were selling soup from their Harlem apartment when her    asked them to come home to Kinston and open a restaurant in the building he had bought in the faded downtown district. They moved in 2005, happy to be out of New York, living   and   in a little house on the river that her father calls his nap shack, and finding their way in the community. Still, the economic reality was grim. Hurricane Floyd had ravaged the region six years earlier. The tobacco warehouses and shirt factories had long been shut down, and the DuPont polyester plant was a shadow of its former self. “Everyone here had an excuse for why they hadn’t left yet,” Ms. Howard said. “I was like, ‘I should be ashamed of this place, too. ’” In what seemed to many a foolish move, they opened Chef  the Farmer. At first, they served fancy city food. She remembers the day her sister pointed out that three of the four desserts had vegetables in them, and that didn’t mean carrot cake. “I was cooking down to people,” Ms. Howard said. “I didn’t feel like these people had anything to teach me. ” She decided to embrace the local dishes she had grown up eating. She could elevate the wild muscadine grapes, the   butter beans and the “tom thumbs”  —     pork sausages whose casings are made from pig appendixes. In the process, she elevated herself. She came to consider the people in her town as guides to a stronger, simpler way of living. Buoyed by the increased interest in Southern cooking and a few good mentions in the regional press, she persuaded the documentary filmmaker Cynthia Hill to make a TV show. Ms. Hill had grown up seven miles away from Ms. Howard, and she understood the desire to leave a place and then come home again. “Initially, I think she was just trying to save herself,” Ms. Hill said. “In the process, she is saving a lot of people. ” The show has started a sort of renaissance in the town, where a local investor has opened a boutique hotel and the   Mother Earth brewing company and taproom. Storefronts are being refurbished. The couple has opened an oyster bar and burger joint called the Boiler Room across the alley, and are planning a bakery. “I don’t think she realized this was all going to happen, but right now she’s the hometown girl that made good and came back, which gives her some cachet,” said Bill Smith, a chef and Southern food authority who grew up in the area. Mr. Smith appeared on a recent holiday special, helping Ms. Howard and her neighbors kill a pig and make corned ham from it. Not everyone, however, is entirely enamored of the food. Grayson Haver Currin, until recently a longtime editor at Indy Week, an alternative paper published in the    Hill triangle, thinks chefs like Sean Brock in Charleston, S. C. and Ashley Christensen in Raleigh do a better job interpreting the traditional Southern culinary canon for modern eaters. “That said, in Kinston it’s kind of   that food like that exists,” Mr. Currin said. “The story of that family and what they’ve accomplished in   postindustrial America is fascinating. But it’s a slow process and it’s a limited process. No matter how many $   restaurants you put in that town, you can’t change the economics and racial realities. ” The average annual income in Lenoir County, which has about 58, 000 people, is $20, 191. In Kinston, the county’s most populous community, almost 70 percent of the residents are black, while most of its elected leadership is white. At the fish store and the Piggly Wiggly, black customers didn’t seem to know about Ms. Howard’s show or her restaurant. The managers, who were white, did. The region’s troubles only got worse in October, when floodwaters brought on by Hurricane Matthew devastated the community. Four died, bridges were washed away, and roads were closed for weeks. Four of the six hotels in the town flooded, and more than 3, 200 people applied for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Ms. Howard was on her book tour when the hurricane hit Kinston. Her marketing plan was to tour 24 cities in a   food truck. For $50, people got a book and a simple supper, like a bowl of eastern North Carolina fish stew and eggs, built from chunks of fish layered with potatoes and onions and flavored with onions, tomato paste and chile flakes. All but one event sold out. Fans lined up to tell Ms. Howard about their mothers who, like hers, suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. Ms. Howard’s young twins are sometimes on the show, which led to a parade of parents eager to discuss their own twins. Chelsie and Jono Brymer, a young couple from Trenton, Mich. drove to Chicago just to see her. They, too, had moved back home, to a struggling former steel town, to open a little French cafe called Promenade Artisan Foods. “We watched the show and realized we were not the only ones who ask ourselves if we were crazy to do it,” Ms. Brymer said. By the time she returned home, Ms. Howard was exhausted. From the road, she had organized a statewide fish stew   for flood victims that raised more than $30, 000. She had shaken hands with so many strangers that she felt like a politician. She had seen her    twins, Florence and Theodore, maybe four times during the tour. Ms. Howard vowed to stay home more, tending both to the children and to the restaurant in a more balanced way. There would be no more   with her face on them, and less energy spent on expanding her line of sauces and rubs. And Ms. Howard is changing the show, now shooting its fifth season. It will still be set in eastern North Carolina, but it will shift the focus to the people in her life who cook food from other cultures. “There’s only one of me,” she said, “and I have to decide what I want to do. ” Recipe: Eastern North Carolina Fish Stew",0
1219,"As Wildfires Rage, Israel Suggests Arson and Asks for Foreign Help - The New York Times","JERUSALEM  —   Parts of the port city of Haifa in northern Israel were ablaze on Thursday as wildfires raged through the country for a third day, devouring forests, damaging homes and prompting the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. Asked how long Haifa was likely to be battling the blazes, Mayor Yona Yahav told reporters, “This is a question that has to be referred to God. ” Israeli officials said the fires had been fanned by unusually strong winds and made worse by a dry atmosphere, but they also said they suspected that many of them had been caused by arson and negligence. Dozens of people have been slightly affected by smoke inhalation, but no serious injuries or fatalities have been reported. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s public security minister, told Army Radio that the professional assessment was that almost half the fires were the result of arson. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the fires to “natural and unnatural” causes and said that “any fire caused by arson or incitement to arson is terrorism in every sense of the word, and we will treat it as such. ” Arab leaders in Israel protested the widespread allegations that Palestinian nationalists were behind many of the fires, saying their land was burning, too, and they condemned what they viewed as unfair accusations against Israel’s Arab citizens, who make up about a fifth of the population. Ahmad Tibi, a veteran Arab lawmaker in the Israeli Parliament, wrote on Twitter: “I called Yona Yahav. Our homes are open to the evacuees. Sad and painful. Let’s join hands to overcome the fire and let’s also douse the flames of incitement. ” Mr. Netanyahu spoke on Thursday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who promised to send two huge firefighting aircraft. Firefighting planes and teams from Cyprus and Greece had already arrived, and the Israeli police and Foreign Ministry said that more help was on the way from Croatia, Italy and Turkey. The Palestinian Authority also sent some fire engines to tackle the fires. The Israeli emergency services are more prepared and better equipped than they were in 2010, when a fierce fire raged through the Carmel Forest area near Haifa. More than 40 people, most of them officer cadets from the prison service, were killed in that blaze when their bus was engulfed in flames as they were on their way to evacuate a prison. That episode counted as Israel’s worst natural disaster. The government of Mr. Netanyahu, who assumed office in 2009, was accused of being woefully unprepared. It was the first time that Israel, which often provides doctors and aid workers for disasters abroad, had to rely on international help. Israel has since added firefighting planes, but they do not have the capacity of larger aircraft like those that Russia was expected to send, nor can they operate at night. The police and emergency services have been going door to door evacuating homes, schools, two prisons, neighborhoods and, in some cases, whole communities. Noy Parati, a student at the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, described scenes of panic, with people pushing one another out of the way to evacuate. “As soon as they tell me where to go, I will leave,” Ms. Parati told Israeli television, adding, “Everyone is trying to escape. ” Yael Hamer, a resident of the Romema neighborhood of Haifa, said people were leaving on foot and by car. “My house was filled with smoke,” she told reporters by phone from her car, with the sirens of fire engines and ambulances audible in the background. “And the smell,” she added, “it was impossible to stay there. ” Local authorities in Haifa said they had set up gathering points and temporary shelters in community centers, in an auditorium and in a stadium. The police reported heavy traffic on highways around the city, and the train service to and from the city was suspended. By nightfall, about a quarter of Haifa’s population of 280, 000 had been instructed to evacuate. The Israeli military said that it had deployed two    battalions from its Home Front Command to assist evacuation efforts, and that it had called up reservists to help fight the fires. Several homes have been destroyed in recent days in the town of Zikhron Yaaqov, south of Haifa, and in Nataf, a village in the hills outside Jerusalem. Flames have also threatened Talmon, a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. And on Thursday night the police reported a fire near Shuafat, a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem. The first major fire began in the forest surrounding Neve Shalom, known in Arabic as Wahat   or Oasis of Peace, a small cooperative community about halfway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem where Israeli Jews and Arabs live together. Despite the suspicion of arson in many cases, the Israeli authorities were cautious in assigning blame. But some Israeli news organizations were labeling the wave of fires an “arson intifada,” alluding to a Palestinian uprising. Mr. Erdan, the public security minister, noted that Jewish extremists had been charged with arson attacks in the past, including one last year in the West Bank village of Duma that killed a Palestinian toddler and his parents. Mr. Erdan has instructed the police to focus efforts on locating incitement to arson on social networks. By Thursday night, Mr. Erdan said, the fires had been brought under control, though there were fears that the weather conditions could whip up the flames again. Some Palestinians were celebrating the fires on social media, posting congratulatory messages on Facebook. “Enjoy the burning of your homes, you Zionists,” one wrote. Others described the fires as divine retribution for legislation being advanced in Israel, with Mr. Netanyahu’s backing, to ban or restrict the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across Israel. Ayman Odeh, another Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, noted that several Arab cities in northern Israel, such as Umm   had also been affected by the fires.",0
1220,Hard Times in Venezuela Breed Malaria as Desperate Flock to Mines - The New York Times,"THE ALBINO MINE, Venezuela  —   The 12th time Reinaldo Balocha got malaria, he hardly rested at all. With the fever still rattling his body, he threw a pick ax over his shoulder and got back to work  —   smashing stones in an illegal gold mine. As a computer technician from a big city, Mr. Balocha was   for the mines, his soft hands used to working keyboards, not the earth. But Venezuela’s economy collapsed on so many levels that inflation had obliterated his salary, along with his hopes of preserving a   life. So, like tens of thousands of other people from across the country, Mr. Balocha came to these open, swampy mines scattered across the jungle, looking for a future. Here, waiters, office workers, taxi drivers, college graduates and even civil servants on vacation from their government jobs are out panning for   gold, all under the watchful eyes of an armed group that taxes them and threatens to tie them to posts if they disobey. It is a society turned upside down, a place where educated people abandon   jobs in the city for dangerous, backbreaking work in muddy pits, desperate to make ends meet. And it comes with a steep price: Malaria, long driven to the fringes of the country, is festering in the mines and back with a vengeance. Venezuela was the first nation in the world to be certified by the World Health Organization for eradicating malaria in its most populated areas, beating the United States and other developed countries to that milestone in 1961. It was a huge accomplishment for a small nation, one that helped pave Venezuela’s development as an oil power and fueled hopes that a model to stamp out malaria across the globe was at hand. Since then, the world has dedicated enormous amounts of time and money to beating back the disease, with deaths plummeting by 60 percent in places with malaria in recent years, according to the W. H. O. But in Venezuela, the clock is running backward. The country’s economic turmoil has brought malaria back, sweeping the disease out of the remote jungle areas where it quietly persisted and spreading it around the nation at levels not seen in Venezuela for 75 years, medical experts say. It all starts with the mines. With the economy in tatters, at least 70, 000 people from all walks of life have been streaming into this mining region over the past year, said Jorge Moreno, a leading mosquito expert in Venezuela. As they hunt for gold in watery pits, the perfect breeding ground for the mosquitoes that spread the disease, they are catching malaria by the tens of thousands. Then, with the disease in their blood, they return home to Venezuela’s cities. But because of the economic collapse, there is often no medicine and little fumigation to prevent mosquitoes there from biting them and passing malaria to others, sickening tens of thousands more people and leaving entire towns desperate for help. The economic breakdown has “triggered a great migration in Venezuela, and right behind it is the spread of malaria,” said Dr. Moreno, a researcher at a   laboratory in the mining region. “With this breakdown comes a disease that is cooked in the same pot. ” Once out of the mines, malaria spreads quickly. Five hours away in Ciudad Guayana, a rusting former industrial boomtown where many are now jobless and have taken to wildcatting in the mines, a crowd of 300 people packed the waiting room of a clinic in May. All had symptoms of the disease: fevers, icy chills and uncontrollable tremors. There were no lights because the government had cut power to save electricity. There were no medicines because the Health Ministry had not delivered any. Health workers administered blood tests with their bare hands because they were out of gloves. Maribel Supero clutched her    son as he trembled, unable to speak. José Castro held his    daughter as she screamed. Griselda Bello, who works at the clinic, waved her hands helplessly and told yet another patient to hold on a bit longer. The pills had run out. There was nothing she could do. “Come back tomorrow at 10 a. m.,” she said. “My God,” the patient said. “Someone might die by then. ” “Indeed, they might,” she said. In the nearby town of Pozo Verde, residents said malaria had swept in after miners began returning home sick, the government fumigators having vanished two years ago. Now, the public high school has become an incubating ground of its own: A quarter of its 400 students have contracted malaria since November. “You would think we would do something  —   a cordon, a quarantine,” said Arebalo Enríquez, the principal of the school, who contracted malaria, as did his wife, mother and seven other members of his family. Officially, the spread of malaria in Venezuela has become a state secret. The government has not published epidemiological reports on the disease in the past year, and it says there is no crisis. But the most recent internal figures, obtained by The New York Times from Venezuelan doctors involved in compiling it, confirms a surge is underway. In the first six months of the year, malaria cases rose 72 percent, to a total of 125, 000, according to the figures. The disease cut a wide path through the country, with cases present in more than half of its 23 states. And among the malaria strains present here is Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most fatal form of the disease. “It is a situation of national shame,” said Dr. José Oletta, a former Venezuelan health minister who lives in the capital, Caracas, where malaria cases are now appearing, too. “I was seeing this kind of thing when I was a medical student a   ago. It hurts me. The disease had disappeared. ” In El Dique, a rural town where malaria was largely unknown until two years ago, Juana García, 66, sat outside her home, newly widowed since her husband fell ill with the disease and died. She hardly spoke or moved from her chair. “She will keep fighting,” said her daughter Ana María Padrón. Inside Ms. Padrón’s adobe home, her two sons were fighting malaria, too. Almost like clockwork, their fevers began in the morning: at 8 a. m. for Omar, who is 8 at 11 for Aristides, who is 7. The family has found no medicine. The boys have only painkillers. “We pray,” their mother said. The illegal mines spill out over dozens of miles, leaving a pockmarked stretch of earth where the jungle gives way to countless craters and scars. Some are no more than tiny pools where two men sift the mud with pans, like a scene from the California goldfields more than a century ago. Others drain wide marshes with tangled networks of tubes and pumps. In another spot, hundreds of wildcatters had dug out a gaping maw of red and white soil. It sinks 15 stories deep and runs the length of a football field. They call it Cuatro Muertos, or Four Dead Men. It was not supposed to be this way. The gold reserves were once controlled by a Canadian company before President Hugo Chávez expropriated them and pledged to use their profits to fund his   revolution. But the expropriation followed the pattern of mismanagement and neglect that many others did during the Chávez era. The state eventually abandoned the territory around the mine, and the potentially lucrative profits. Wildcatters have moved in, and so have the armed groups that now call themselves the law here. But at least there is food. As the country convulses from food shortages and riots, as hungry mobs ransack grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries, the mining town of Las Claritas, only a short drive from the mines, lives in a state of relative plenty. Restaurants offer full menus. Street markets are packed with fruit. Pickups drive by loaded with pumpkins. In a country where soap is in short supply, a dozen brands are on sale in a   grocery store, where seven models of   televisions are also available. Miners dish out fat wads of their gold earnings in cash, which run through a   machine. The promise of a different Venezuela  —   one where there is ample food and work that pays enough  —   led Yudani González to abandon a program to become a preschool teacher in Ciudad Bolívar, the provincial capital, where unemployment is rampant. Instead, she headed to a ramshackle jungle camp, where she cooks for miners with one hand and cares for her two young children with the other. “Here, you can get ahead,” Ms. González said, washing her    daughter in a plastic bucket on the counter as she cooked. Danneris Flores, a government employee moonlighting as a mining camp cook, sat nearby. She is an administrative assistant in a   health clinic, but Venezuela’s currency has tumbled so far that her salary amounts to only about $1 a day at the current street value. So she asked for a vacation  —   and used it to work for a couple of weeks at the mines. Her    who works for the state oil company, Pdvsa, does the same thing. In a short stint at the mines, Ms. Flores said she could earn twice her monthly wages. She counted the days until she would be home to see her three children, whom she had left after “closing my eyes and making my heart small. ” “I never imagined that I would work in a mine,” she said to Ms. González as they served a meal. “Before, people thought of going to school. ” A miner walked in to greet the women and said he had recently watched someone collapse and die of malaria on her way to a market. Ms. González said she had come down with it four times herself. Her    she said, has had it three times. “They charge you two grams of gold for medicine,” she said. “You pay what they ask. ” Not everyone can find medication, even with gold earnings. José Yoel Castillo stumbled to the doorstep of the malaria clinic in Las Claritas, carried on the shoulders of two relatives as he convulsed and was unable to speak. He had been making a living in the town of Caicara del Orinoco, driving passengers on the back of a motorcycle. But an armed gang took the vehicle, and Mr. Castillo could not afford a new one. So he came to the mines. He quickly found work and money  —   even malaria medication the first time he became ill. But when the symptoms came a second time, he could not find treatment anywhere. “Some people can just keep working through it,” said his    Alejandro López. “But others can’t. ” Even with money in their pockets, the miners know the dangers of going back home. Josué Guevara, 20, gave up last November on his university studies in industrial engineering in a city about 10 hours away. He once pictured himself as a manager at the   aluminum company, Alcasa. But his family members who worked there could barely afford food, he said. “Now I have other goals,” he said, standing at the edge of the Cuatro Muertos mines, where he lives and works today. Using gasoline and other chemicals to extract the gold, Mr. Guevara earned 500, 000 bolívars  —   around $500 at   exchange rates, about 33 times the country’s minimum wage  —   during a lucky   stretch. But when he got malaria this spring, he did what many miners do: He returned to his hometown to recover, bringing the disease with him. “Everything has its risks,” he said. On the other side of the vast pit, Pedro Pérez, 38, sat in a structure made of tree poles and tarp where he sleeps with 10 other miners. He tested positive for malaria twice in March. The third time he fell ill, he did not bother to get tested. “I was lying here and I felt the same symptoms,” he said. He, too, went back home  —   to the provincial capital, Ciudad Bolívar, where his mother eventually caught malaria, as well. “It’s coming from us,” Mr. Pérez said. Mr. Pérez remembered his life before he came to the mines last fall: He was a supervisor at a   metal refinery, he said. He owned a     house and a 2005 Ford Focus. He and his wife, a lawyer, once jetted off on   getaways to Isla Margarita, a tropical island off the north coast of Venezuela. Yet even before he lost his job last year and was unable to find another, Venezuela’s plummeting currency had whittled his salary down to about $26 a month. He eventually left home for the mine. “I am still not used to washing myself every day in a river of dirty water,” he said. “I thought I had a good life. ” A few weeks ago, his wife came to Las Claritas to buy the food and soap she could not find in Ciudad Bolívar. The couple spent three nights together in a miner’s hostel. After she left, Mr. Pérez felt the strains on their marriage. “‘I know it’s hard for you,’ I tell her, ‘but we have to accept this new reality,’” he said. Back in Las Claritas, at a table in a dark brothel that smelled of alcohol, sat Angélica, a young woman with long black hair whose parents do not know she has turned to prostitution to make her living. She left the eastern city of Maturín three months ago when riots erupted because food had gone scarce. “Before, you waited in line for hours, but you got something,” said Angélica, who did not give her last name, ashamed of her work. “But now there is nothing there. ” Today she earns the equivalent of $40 when a miner wants to spend the night with her. More often, the money comes in increments of $8, when a customer wants to have sex and leave a short time later. At times, she said, it may be a stranger who is trembling with fever, unable to perform because of malaria. Other times, it is the owner of one of the Chinese grocery stores. The men come from all corners of the country. “The most difficult part of this life is being with someone who you do not love,” she said. Venezuela rose only after malaria declined. It was the 1920s and another resource had set off a bonanza  —   the black gold of oil, discovered in massive supply. But a vast malaria hot zone, then   of Venezuela, stood between the country and its riches. The deadly scenes were later immortalized in “Dead Homes,” a 1955 Venezuelan novel about the rural epidemics of malaria and the waves of migration to the country’s oil fields. Freeing the country of malaria became pivotal to Venezuela’s development, said Dr. Oletta, the former health minister. “Only once malaria was gone, roads could come, industry,” he said. “This was a sick country, and when it got well, things changed. ” That transformative effort was led by Dr. Arnoldo Gabaldón, the former health minister who began one of the world’s first   efforts to eradicate malaria and who became a national hero during his age. Teams across the Venezuelan countryside built irrigation ditches to drain pools of standing water, distributed quinine and constructed cinder block homes in rural areas so that mosquitoes had fewer places to breed. Dr. Gabaldón founded a research center in the city of Maracay, outside of Caracas and itself a malaria zone at the time, to broaden the mission and train officials from Latin America and Africa. But it was his use of insecticides  —   initially DDT, then other substances  —   that began to turn the tide. The walls of nearly every rural home in the country were sprayed, a technique that killed mosquitoes when they landed to rest. Fumigators would leave an envelope showing the date they would return. By 1949, malaria deaths had fallen drastically: to nine per 100, 000 people from 300. By the time Mr. Chávez assumed the presidency 50 years later and began to carry out his   vision for Venezuela, the regimented system of Dr. Gabaldón had long faded, though malaria still appeared to be confined to a few rural areas. But the restructuring of the economy under Mr. Chávez and his followers, including a growing dependence on oil revenue and a system of currency controls restricting American dollars, would eventually change that. In 2014 and 2015, as oil prices collapsed and the government scrambled for money to pay for goods, services and imports, there were long shortages of chloroquine and primaquine, two drugs used for Plasmodium vivax, the most prevalent malaria parasite in the Americas. By 2016, doctors said there were shortages of nearly all   drugs, most notably a drug cocktail for the deadly falciparum strain that costs just several dollars for a full round of treatment. Though debilitating and even fatal, malaria is easily treatable with the proper medication. Dr. Leopoldo Villegas, an international malaria expert in Bangkok, said the government also relied on outdated methods like outdoor fogging with insecticides, which had unproven effects on adult mosquitoes that transmit malaria. And because it was not publishing epidemiological reports of new malaria cases or deaths, it was unclear how much medicine was needed each year. “This is an emergency, this is an outbreak, and it’s not being dealt with by the government this way,” Dr. Villegas said, adding that the Venezuelan government had repeatedly denied the extent of malaria’s resurgence to international organizations that could help prevent its spread. Gustavo Bretas, a Brazilian malaria expert, said that Venezuela once trained people throughout the region in malaria prevention. But Venezuela’s inability to contain its own outbreak means that it now plays the opposite role: It poses a threat to the countries around it, particularly Brazil, where there are also illegal gold mines. “It’s starting to spill over into neighboring countries,” he said, adding that the lack of government statistics made the extent of the problem hard to assess. Venezuela’s Health Ministry did not respond to requests for an interview, including a letter delivered to its offices. Oscar Noya now works in Dr. Gabaldón’s old laboratory in Caracas under a picture of his mentor in a suit and bow tie. On a recent day, malaria patients once again sat on the steps, most having arrived from the mines. Fifteen had come on a recent morning 12 of them tested positive for the disease. Dr. Noya tries to make do without many vital drugs, like artesunate, listed by the W. H. O. as an essential medicine for the treatment of severe cases of falciparum malaria. He has only three vials of it left. He needs six to treat a single patient with a serious case. One recent night, a gang entered one of his malaria laboratories and stole the computers, one of about 20 attacks this year against the Tropical Medical Institute where he works, Dr. Noya said. He wonders if the groups are aligned with the government. “We believe this is no more than intimidation because we’re not quiet and we won’t be quiet,” he said, referring to public advocacy about malaria and the spread of other diseases. Dr. Noya put away his vials of artesunate as more patients gathered outside. He looked up with an air of desperation. “Dr. Gabaldón would have died of a heart attack if he’d seen what is happening,” he said. Despite the constant churn of workers from across Venezuela, there is a clear order to the mines. It is enforced by an armed group known as the Union. One of the Union’s bosses came to the mines years ago to work as a dentist. He still does. But the squads of patrolmen on motorbikes who dominate this place are the real source of his wealth and power. He sports gold chains, two gold teeth  —   and brass knuckles made of gold. After the government abandoned them, the mines soon grew again, this time at an unruly pace as wildcatters plowed into the forest, creating pools of stagnant water and a population of easy prey for the mosquitoes that breed in them, paving the way for the explosion of malaria. Sitting on his patio, the boss, who declined to be named because he could be arrested by the government, took pride in what he said was the Union’s ability to fill in for the vacuum left by the state. Yes, he acknowledged, the punishments the group meted out could be gruesome, like shooting off a man’s hand when he stole, or tying others to posts at the entrance of town with a sign detailing the offense committed. But he argued that the discipline kept crime in the camps low and allowed miners to go about their business in peace  —   another aspect of life that has steadily eroded in Venezuela’s dangerous cities. “To get justice from the police is a joke,” he said. “You have to get your own justice. ” Eduardo Medina agreed. A former pharmacist, he said he had left the drugstore where he worked in the state of Zulia a year ago to start mining because he saw the economic crisis spread and law and order slip away. “At any time, you might go out and someone would put a pistol in your face for your phone, or knife your mother,” Mr. Medina said in his tent. “Crime is under control here. They charge us, but they solve the problems, too. ” But the appearance of calm is deceiving. Storms rage in other places where rivals vie for control of the mines. In March, at least 17 miners were killed in what the authorities believed was one such dispute. Mr. Medina, on a break, looked down into the pit where his fellow miners labored. “At any moment, you can be killed in Zulia,” he said. “But you can be killed here, too. ” For all the challenges of keeping order, the boss said, malaria was even harder. “On malaria, we are screwed,” he said. The task of monitoring the disease seems to have been delegated to people like a state health employee named Miguel Martínez, who sat at a lonely post a short walk from a brothel near the mines, examining blood samples from miners. Under his microscope, a dye had stained the malaria parasite a dark purple. The log beside him showed that half of the patients who had visited him that day had tested positive for malaria. Like many health workers in this country, Mr. Martínez was exasperated. “Just as there are no rice and beans in this country, there are no medicines,” he said. Evening approached at the mine, the time when the Anopheles mosquito begins to feed. Dusk settled over a clapboard Pentecostal church, where parishioners speak in tongues, and past a    circus tent promising alcohol and a strip tease. Under a tarp, five men hammered away at a vein of quartz, which they would grind down and sift for gold. Others waded up to their shoulders in pools laden with heavy metals like mercury, angling tubes to pump the mud. Tropical birds flew in the distance. “Is the malaria really coming from the miners?” asked Aníbal Flores, 28, a miner who sleeps in a hammock between two poles beside the mine. “But where else can we go to make money? The city? There is no food there. ” Lately, many Venezuelans have taken matters into their own hands. Five hours away in the newly infected town of El Dique, residents were collecting 100 bolívars from each household to hire a fumigator to come spray their homes. In the mine, where malaria tests are sometimes unavailable, miners said they had developed an exam of their own: Drink two bottles of beer. If a sharp pain is felt afterward in the liver, where the parasites reside, then the patient has malaria, the test goes. Health officials said the measure was futile. Still, Mr. Balocha, the former computer technician who works in the Albino Mine, lives by it. Miners call it an “artisanal test. ” He was sick once again, waiting for medicine at a   fence on the edge of a clinic. He recalled the words of his uncle, who phoned him a year ago when Mr. Balocha found his salary as a computer technician to be worthless in the city of Valencia. “There is money here,” said the uncle, who was mining then. “You have to know how to find it. ” Mr. Balocha started as a “palero,” a stone breaker, getting the smallest cut of the take. But it was still more than what his salary bought in the city after inflation had whittled it away, he said. He recalled the first time he got malaria, too, the “chills like you were lying down between two blocks of ice. ” “The first time you get malaria is the ugliest,” Mr. Balocha said. “You can’t control the tremors. You feel like you will die. You feel like you are a zombie. ” But he would become a millionaire here, he joked, and one day he would head to Europe  —   with a Latin American woman, he added  —   far from the mines, the malaria and the Union. He sighed, looking up at the sky. “In the mine, happiness is only temporary,” he said.",0
1221,"Before Orlando Shooting, an Anti-Gay Massacre in New Orleans Was Largely Forgotten - The New York Times","The terrorist attack that killed 49 and wounded 53 in Orlando, Fla. was the largest mass killing of gay people in American history, but before Sunday that grim distinction was held by a largely forgotten arson at a New Orleans bar in 1973 that killed 32 people at a time of pernicious   stigma. Churches refused to bury the victims’ remains. Their deaths were mostly ignored and sometimes mocked by politicians and the media. No one was ever charged. A joke made the rounds in workplaces and was repeated on the radio: “Where will they bury the queers? In fruit jars!” Outpourings of grief from politicians and everyday people have followed the Orlando shooting, but for those who remember the fire in the New Orleans bar, the UpStairs Lounge, its lonely memory has loomed large over conversations about the carnage this week at the Pulse nightclub. Mike Moreau, 72, who lost several friends in the fire, said he was struck by all the differences between then and now, but also by the familiarity of tragedy’s dull ache. “What happened to us had to be kept so private,” said Mr. Moreau. “The public didn’t want to know about it, and if they heard about it they didn’t care  —   ‘Thank God, they’re gone, they deserved it. ’” “To see the outpouring of love and support that these poor families have gotten is fantastic,” he added about the Orlando massacre. “They are hurting the same way we hurt, but at least they know that the world supports them and understands their grief. ” Mr. Moreau was with friends at a nearby bar on June 24, 1973, when an arsonist doused the stairs of the UpStairs Lounge with lighter fluid, set it aflame and rang the doorbell. When someone answered the door, a fireball burst into the room. One group of patrons fled out a back exit, but another was trapped across the room, caught between the flames and    windows fitted with metal bars. When firefighters extinguished the blaze, they found a pile of charred bodies, some embracing and others pressed against the windows. Congregants from the New Orleans chapter of the Metropolitan Community Church, an L. G. B. T.  group, were meeting there after services. The Rev. Bill Larson was among the dead. His charred body was left slumped against the window bars in full view of   for hours. He was one of many who died without ever coming out to their families, and his mother would not deal with his remains, said Robert L. Camina, who directed a documentary, UpStairs Inferno, about the blaze. “His mother refused to collect his ashes because she was too embarrassed that she had a gay son,” Mr. Camina said. “And that is just one example. There are three people who were never identified at all. Why? Somebody has to miss them. ” Those three were buried in unmarked graves in a potter’s field along with a fourth person, Ferris LeBlanc, whose family did not know his fate until last year, Mr. Camina said. “They dug a hole in the ground and put a bag in it and covered it back up,” Mr. Moreau said. Public figures were unsupportive. The mayor, Moon Landrieu, did not cancel his vacation. Forty years later, a son of his, the current mayor, Mitch Landrieu, declared a day of public mourning for the fire’s victims on its anniversary. “L. G. B. T. people have a place at the table now that they did not have then,” said Clayton   who wrote a book about the arson that was published in 2014. The fire was an open wound for the gay community in New Orleans for years. No one was charged with the attack, and a man viewed by many as the primary suspect was never arrested. He committed suicide a year after the blaze. “There was never any sense of justice,” said Sebastian Rey, the president of the L. G. B. T. Community Center of New Orleans. Survivors had to deny any connection to the fire, including the loss of loved ones, because they could lose their jobs or apartments if bosses and landlords suspected they were gay. Mr. Rey said people who lived through that period did not talk about it for decades. As time passed, the tragedy became “a rumor” to new generations of L. G. B. T. people, he said. Johnny Townsend, who interviewed survivors in the late ’80s and finally published their accounts in 2014, said the 40th anniversary commemoration gave it a kind of public attention it had not had before. “People now feel more of a sense of their own history,” he said. For Mr. Moreau, the outpouring of support for the victims in Orlando has been an “uplifting” sign of progress, he said. ”In Orlando, those poor people know at least that the whole world is behind them,” he said. “Nobody cared about us. ”",0
1222,Could the Latest Solar Storm Warnings Bring an End to Civilization as We Know It?,"Did you know that the White House is currently coordinating with Homeland Security to make preparations for a possible solar storm that could bring an end to civilization as we know it? An Executive Order published on October 13, by the Obama administration shows an increasing concern among White House officials about “solar flares, solar energetic particles and geomagnetic disturbances,” following a solar event which generated a Category G2 geomagnetic storm on October 8. This action could likely mean that we have an imminent solar threat in our near future. A solar discharge of great magnitude could mean entire countries could be without electricity, civil unrest and countless lives lost. If federal officials are preparing for this sort of disaster, we have enough reason to arm ourselves with the knowledge of what we might face.
Prepare for any disaster step-by-step What are CMEs? Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are violent explosions of plasma originating from the Sun’s corona, out of which energized particles and powerful magnetic domains emerge as fast as 3,000 kilometers per second. A CME has an associated shock wave and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that can travel toward the Earth and interrupt satellites and power grids around the planet. There are currently no public disclosures of CMEs being detected, but there is a significant geomagnetic storm event beginning, combined with the Executive Order previously mentioned, gives cause for concern about the possibility of a CME striking our planet in the near future.
A recent report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center predicts a Category G2 geomagnetic storm from October 24 – 26. An aurora borealis is projected to be seen in the skies above New York to Wisconsin to Washington state, and interruption to satellites and power lines are expected.
It is possible that this particular storm is not the result of a CME, but in order to be prepared, one must first know what disasters may lie ahead and plan accordingly.
Here are 5 catastrophic consequences of a major CME hitting the Earth and changing life as we know it: Satellite Disruption If there was a high-magnitude impact of solar energy and particles, we would see an immediate response on low-Earth orbiting weather, communications, and military satellites. Some satellites could be crippled for up to a decade . The first sign that a major CME is about to strike will be a loss of connection with or permanent failure of a portion of low-Earth orbiting satellites and their associated infrastructure. The shock wave, in combination with an EMP, would likely cause significant disruption of GPS signals, possibly creating long-term failures across the global navigation satellite system. This would have disastrous implications for commercial airplanes and ships, many of which rely on GPS guidance systems for landing and docking, and a failure of timing on either of these systems could put countless lives at risk. Seismic stations, computer network synchronization and many electric power grids across the world rely on GPS clocks. Geomagnetic disturbances associated with CMEs are known to disrupt GPS clocks through interference of high frequency radio signals in both air and ground transmission. Here is some more information on EMPs.
EMP Primer Smart Technology Will Mean Nothing After an EMP Event What Will Happen to the Nuclear Power Plants Following an EMP? Protect Your Vehicle From an EMP Build Your Own Faraday Cage Out of an Ammo Can Power Grid Failure A large-scale geomagnetic storm generated by interactions between Earth’s magnetic field and magnetic domains originating from the Sun could cause geomagnetically induced current (GIC), where transformers and power lines can experience a large flux in power from changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. The transformers and associated infrastructure may overheat and the power grid across more than half of the U.S. and many other industrialized countries could fail and cause a widespread blackout scenario if there was a large enough solar event. A study by Metatech corporation shows that a GIC with comparable magnitude to that of the 1921 geomagnetic storm would be projected to destroy more than 300 extra high voltage transformers and adjacent power lines across the U.S., leaving approximately 150 million people without power. The study highlights the risk to the power grid saying, “In 1921, a geomagnetic disturbance of approximately 5000 nT/min, ten times the magnitude of the 1989 storm, is believed to have occurred. A storm of this magnitude today would cause widespread damage to the electric grid of unprecedented proportions.”
This means that all streetlights and stores could lose power without warning. Hospitals could lose power, causing failure of equipment and countless lives could be lost. Computers, cell phones, electric cars and anything else that requires a charge would die and be rendered unusable for the duration of the power grid failure. Credit card transactions and ATM machines will not work. A prolonged failure of even one-third of the grid could potentially require at least ten years for the repair and replacement of fried transformers, capacitors and power lines across the country. The end result of such a sudden and extreme loss of electricity would result in a cataclysmic loss of life, with projected human casualties at almost 100 million as a result from one major geomagnetic disturbance.
Hurricanes &Tornadoes Hurricanes and tornadoes are thought to be closely associated with solar activity, according to Dr. Vladimir I. Merkulov, a Russian physicist who is well-known for his research into gravitational waves in the atmosphere and in vortex chambers. Merkulov has developed the Electro-gravitational Dynamic Concept of Hurricanes and Tornadoes based from observations of the physical structure of vacuum domains originating from the Sun. In his book, Amazing Hydromechanics , he says that tornadoes and hurricanes are caused by increased solar activity, including CMEs, from which vacuum domains emerge that have both electrical and magnetic properties. According to Merkulov, this means that a large CME event could be closely associated with an inestimable increase in the occurrence of tornadoes and hurricanes. While satellite communications fail and the power grid shuts down, residents of the Midwest may be dealing with multiple tornado strikes and coastal areas could have a hurricane fast-approaching the shoreline. Many of them may not realize the immediate threat that is heading toward them due to failing emergency communications being disrupted. Nearby hospitals may be unable to help those who are injured due to the failure of large portions of the power grid.
Economic Collapse The economic collapse that would result from this event would create a poverty never before seen in North America. Losing electricity would mean that ATM machines will not work and banks will be closed. Losing access to electronic currency will cripple many who have become reliant on credit cards and other forms of digital currency. Grocery store shelves will be left entirely empty and supply trucks would likely be unable to resupply stores. If there are gas stations able to process transactions, gas supply will be severely limited. There is no reason to expect that the Federal Reserve Note will survive such a collapse; stored precious metals might become an alternative form of currency and bartering may become a primary means of exchange. Here are six ways to prepare for this type of disaster.
Social Upheaval When people starve and are unable to get what they need for survival, you can expect that a certain amount of them will end up looting homes or stores . Those who do not live near a river or stream may entirely lose access to clean water, which could likely mean that millions of people would be forced to relocate within days of the initial event. Having firearms for self-defense will be necessary amidst the social upheaval resulting from a CME and the associated events mentioned above. There is no reason to expect that police and military will have the desire nor capability to help those who may fall victim to looters; everyone will have their own family and loved ones to look after.
Knowing the risks to life and property that may lie ahead is only a part of the battle. Each of the likely future scenarios mentioned above should be planned for in conjunction with the others.

1224,State G.O.P. Leaders Move Swiftly as Party Bickers in Congress - The New York Times,"When Republicans in Kentucky seized total control of the state government last year, Damon Thayer, the majority leader in the State Senate, began asking around for advice from counterparts in other capitals where the party already dominated both the legislative and executive branches. How should we handle all this power? he wanted to know. One answer impressed him, Mr. Thayer said, from a senior Republican lawmaker in Wisconsin: “Move quickly. ” Kentucky Republicans have done just that, swiftly passing laws to roll back the powers of labor unions and restrict access to abortion. But they are only getting started, Mr. Thayer said in an interview: They also plan to make sweeping changes to the education and public pension systems this year. And they have plenty of company. While Republicans in Washington appear flummoxed by the complexities of   rule, struggling with issues from repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, to paying for President Trump’s promised wall on the Mexican border, rising party leaders in the states seem far more at ease and assertive. Republicans have    control in 25 states now, holding both the governorship and the entire legislature, and Republican lawmakers are acting with lightning speed to enact longstanding conservative priorities. In states from New England to the Midwest and across the South, conservative lawmakers have introduced or enacted legislation to erode union powers and abortion rights, loosen gun regulations, expand   programs and slash taxes and spending. State Senator Scott L. Fitzgerald of Wisconsin, the Republican majority leader, said conservatives in the states had taken the party’s national victories in November as a directive to “shake up” government. “That has been amped up as a result of Donald Trump being elected president,” he said. “There’s a higher expectation now. ” If Republicans in the states have taken Mr. Trump as an inspiration, in some respects they are also largely unburdened by his personality and his political whims. Republicans in Congress are plainly struggling to overcome deep internal disagreements and to balance traditional conservative goals with Mr. Trump’s distinctive priorities. But for Republicans in state capitals, these are comparatively remote considerations. Some Democrats fear that while their own party is consumed nationally with fighting Mr. Trump, leaders and activists may be too distracted to throw up effective roadblocks to the ideological agenda that Republicans are ramming through at the state level. “Progressives cannot afford to forget about what’s happening in our backyards,” said Nick Rathod, executive director of State Innovation Exchange, a   liberal group focused on state legislatures. “Some of it is even more egregious than what is currently happening in Washington, D. C. ” Republicans have gained power rapidly in the states since the 2008 presidential election, winning 33 governorships and in many instances entrenching themselves in power through legislative redistricting. Riding to office on a wave of discontent with the Obama administration, headstrong governors in states like Wisconsin and Ohio embarked on a ferocious quest to transform their states, repeatedly battling powerful unions and popular backlash. Sidelining Democratic lawmakers and grinding down liberal interest groups, these Republicans may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump’s victories in a string of traditionally blue Midwestern states last year. Acting fastest at the moment, though, are four states where Republicans won total control of the government only in November. In addition to Kentucky, Missouri and New Hampshire became   states with the election of Republican governors, and Republicans in Iowa snatched away the State Senate, where Democrats had held their last grip on power. In all four states, Republicans are racing to strip back the influence of labor unions, a key Democratic constituency. In Missouri, where union membership has waned, Gov. Eric Greitens, a telegenic former member of the Navy SEALs, signed a “right to work” bill into law on Monday, denying unions the power to require that workers at companies they represent pay dues or their equivalent as a condition of employment. In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin signed a similar measure in January, along with the repeal of a law that kept wages high on public construction projects. And in New Hampshire, State Senator Jeb Bradley, the Republican majority leader, said      legislation was a top priority. In Iowa, Republican leaders announced this past week that they would pursue sweeping changes to the collective bargaining rights of public employees. State Senator Bill Dix, the new Republican majority leader, said his party had campaigned on such changes  —   which would cut deeply into unions’ negotiating power  —   and intended to make good on its commitments. He said Republicans would also seek to change state laws governing health care and to enshrine in the State Constitution the right to bear arms. “Iowans expect us to take action,” Mr. Dix said. His counterpart in New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley, a former member of Congress, echoed that language, but cautioned in an interview that Republicans had to move deliberately and not just fast. “We can’t just start bonfires that we can’t put out,” he warned. “But we can certainly move forward with a conservative agenda that’s a reasonable conservative agenda. ” Democrats and labor unions, which in the past have been able to thwart conservative legislation with the help of a supportive governor or a bloc of allies in the legislature, describe the onslaught in newly Republican states as overwhelming. “They’re killing us here in the state of Missouri,” said John Stiffler, executive   of the St. Louis Building  Construction Trades Council. Some unions in the state, shut out of power, are attempting to put the      law up for a direct vote in a 2018 referendum. For the moment, Mr. Stiffler said, union leaders are seeking to meet with Mr. Greitens in the hope of finding a compromise on other policies, like   legislation. “We’re trying to find a way to get even a small audience with him,” Mr. Stiffler said of Mr. Greitens. The Republican agenda in the states goes well beyond limiting unions. Party leaders in Kentucky, New Hampshire and Missouri have signaled that they plan to expand   and charter school programs and, in some instances, to pursue tort reform and to place new regulations on voting. Beleaguered Democrats see each policy as devised to undercut one of their core political constituencies: teachers, trial lawyers, minority voters or young people. In several states that the party has controlled for a longer span, Republican governors have also announced aggressive plans to overhaul the size and functions of government, including a Wisconsin   proposal, backed by Gov. Scott Walker, and a large program of tax cuts in Florida, championed by Gov. Rick Scott. Both men were first elected in 2010. Republicans in a number of states are also pushing a deeply conservative social agenda. In New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley had long been pushing a bill to let people carry concealed guns without a permit repeatedly, it passed both legislative houses only to be vetoed by Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. “We had no chance of overriding her veto,” lamented the   Mr. Bradley, but Ms. Hassan was elected to the Senate in November. The gun bill cleared the legislature again on Thursday, and the new Republican governor, Chris Sununu, has “every intention of signing it,” David Abrams, a spokesman of his, said. In Kentucky last month, Mr. Bevin, 50, an activist with close ties to the Tea Party, signed a set of new restrictions on abortion, banning the procedure after 20 weeks and requiring that every woman who seeks an abortion undergo an ultrasound first. Iowa Republicans have advanced a bill to defund Planned Parenthood Missouri legislators have filed a barrage of   bills, including one that would ban the procedure entirely, in defiance of the Supreme Court. In a handful of states including Missouri and Texas, lawmakers are considering legislation that would designate public restrooms and locker rooms as  . And as Mr. Trump attempts to crack down on “sanctuary cities” at the national level, lawmakers in states like Texas and Tennessee have proposed measures to force municipalities to enforce federal immigration law more assertively. Democrats and their allies, including groups like Planned Parenthood, often have little recourse in these states but to rally popular outcry and organize for the next election, or to challenge   policies in court. They have succeeded from time to time, including in North Carolina last year, ousting a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who signed legislation gutting   protections for gay and transgender people. In 2013, Virginia voters broke a Republican monopoly by electing a Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, who campaigned in part against abortion restrictions passed by a   legislature. And in   Louisiana, voters elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, in 2015, to succeed the unpopular Bobby Jindal, who pursued a   agenda and briefly ran for president. Mr. McAuliffe, one of a growing number of Democrats who have called on the national party to devote more attention to state elections, said Democrats should recognize the role governors play in heading off the kind of conservative legislation they find deeply offensive. Mr. McAuliffe, who has used his veto pen 71 times, said Virginia Republicans had pushed “nuttier, more socially divisive legislation than even North Carolina. ” “This isn’t scare tactics  —   this is actually happening,” Mr. McAuliffe said. “If you had a Republican governor, he would have had to sign them, and think where we would be today. ” In Iowa, a Democratic state senator, Janet Petersen, said the zeal of the new Republican majority had broken a mood of passivity among    Democrats. On the Planned Parenthood issue alone, Ms. Petersen said her office had received about 1, 500 emails from alarmed constituents. “If there’s one positive thing to come out of this horrible legislation,” she said, “it’s that complacency is gone. ”",0
1225,Tips for Keeping That Post-Vacation Feeling - The New York Times,"A colleague recently returned from a trip to Europe with that unmistakable     glow. Striving to hold on to it for as long as possible, she deployed various strategies including placing her used boarding passes front and center on her desk, and leaving receipts from the TV Tower in Berlin and the Eiffel Tower in Paris on a bedroom chest of drawers that she passes each morning. “It just surrounds me,” she said of the strategic placement of her vacation mementos. “It sustains that warm vibe. ” She also made a point of incorporating items that she bought during her trip into her daily life back in New York. In Berlin, for instance, she picked up a silver Bodum milk frother with the idea that when she returned home she would make her coffee the way a friend made it for her each morning in Berlin. (Yes, she could have bought a Bodum frother in New York, but hers is imbued with meaning because she purchased it in Berlin where her friend bought hers.) Wearing clothes acquired on vacation also helps, she said, especially if you first wore that new dress to a jazz club or while strolling from the Latin Quarter to the Marais. “It brings back the memories,” she said, “because you’re wearing the memories. ” I liked her strategies and began wondering about other potential   tactics. A number of studies suggest that much pleasure can be derived from actively anticipating a vacation: looking at photos of the places you plan to visit, reading about the culture, making dinner reservations, or simply imagining yourself enjoying your time there. Maintaining pleasure after a great vacation is more challenging. Researchers have found that the glow, if achieved at all, fades quickly. Indeed, one such study, published in 2010 in Applied Research in Quality of Life, surveyed 1, 530 Dutch individuals and noted that only vacationers who said they had a “very relaxed” trip benefited in terms of   happiness. And even among that group, the   high lasted a mere two weeks or so. One possible reason that travelers have an easier time anticipating a vacation than hanging on to its afterglow is that, in general, anticipation evokes stronger feelings and images. Research published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology in 2007 by Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Laurence Ashworth at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, found that “the tendency to report more intense emotions during anticipation than during retrospection is robust and pervasive in everyday life. ” Even so, all is not necessarily lost the moment you step off the plane. There are some things you can do before you travel and when you return home that may help keep you in a holiday state of mind. 1. Plan. Make sure that your vacation is likely to provide you with happy memories by nailing down in advance the kind of details that can trip you up (which bus to take into the city, what hours the museum is open).   vacations lower stress, according to research by Shawn Achor, a former lecturer at Harvard known for his talks on positive psychology, and the founder of Good Think, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. along with Michelle Gielan, founder of the Institute for Applied Positive Research. “Poorly planned and stressful vacations eliminate the positive benefit of time away,” Mr. Achor wrote in a blog series for the Harvard Business Review last year. “A positive,   vacation can make you happier and less stressed, and you can return with more energy at work and with more meaning in your life. ” 2. Reminisce. Most people snap back to their particular baseline level of happiness shortly after returning from a vacation. But psychologists say that reminiscing about a trip, even long after it’s over, can bring deep pleasure in the present. “Flipping through a photo album or watching old video clips (us at the Grand Canyon, me driving my motorbike) helps us relive the positive experience and the positive feelings we had at the time,” writes Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside, in “The Myths of Happiness. ” This can also be accomplished, she and others have said, by savoring the details of a trip (the smell of jasmine in the park, the sound of the orchestra in the amphitheater) and sharing them with others. “Rather than letting our   possessions and experiences to gather dust on shelves and in closets and memories,” Dr. Lyubomirsky wrote, “we can either literally   them in the present (e. g. by taking out the faded Trivial Pursuit) or metaphorically (e. g. by reminiscing about spring break). ” 3. Retreat. “Nowhere is there a more idyllic spot, a vacation home more private and peaceful, than in one’s own mind, especially when it is furnished in such a way that the merest inward glance induces ease,” wrote the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in a translation of his “Meditations” by C. Scot Hicks and David V. Hicks. “Take this vacation as often as you like,” he continued, “and so charge your spirit. ” Knowing I was in the market for   preservatives, another colleague shared with me that passage, which seems as relevant in the 2000s as it was in the 100s. The importance of vacation has been explored in various studies including one published in the journal Society and Mental Health in 2013. The authors, including Terry Hartig, a professor in the Department of Psychology at Uppsala University, Sweden, looked into whether the potential benefits of vacationing (having more energy, fewer health complaints, better life satisfaction) could spread among individuals, contributing “more to population health than the sum of benefits to individual workers. ” Using data from a pharmacy corporation allied with Sweden’s national health care system and from governmental sources, they found that the dispensation of antidepressants declined with an increase in the number of vacationing workers. Ideally, vast swaths of the population would take time off simultaneously for what the researchers call “collective restoration. ” However, the researchers also found that having a good vacation may not only benefit you, it may also benefit others. Those good feelings you return with can spread to your colleagues, even though they themselves didn’t take a vacation. So consider encouraging your   to tack those postcards to her cubicle wall, or wear that new bangle from Santorini. Who knows? The happier she is after her vacation, the happier you may be, too.",0

1227,Alaskans Brace for Spending Cuts as Oil Prices Tumble - The New York Times,"The impact of falling oil prices in Alaska, which has seemed for many residents like a distant worry until now, is about to land. The turning point came on Friday, when the State House of Representatives, meeting at the Capitol in Juneau in the fifth special session since last summer, failed to override a   veto of the budget by Gov. Bill Walker. That means the $1. 3 billion in spending cuts imposed last month by Mr. Walker, a political independent, will almost certainly take effect on top of cuts that lawmakers in the   Legislature had already agreed on. And those effects will ripple far and wide across the state, from public schools and the University of Alaska, which will see steep declines in state aid to individual households, in the form of reduced state oil investment dividend checks to the state court system, which began closing at noon on Fridays to save money. Tiny airports that connect the state’s vast rural areas may have to close. Leaders in both parties said that positions were too entrenched and bitter to even bring up an override attempt to the floor, where it would have required a   supermajority to succeed, or to consider any of the taxes that Mr. Walker proposed to keep programs from being cut. Although the State Senate plans to continue meetings next week, the legal deadline for trying to roll back Mr. Walker’s dramatic   restructuring passed on Friday with the close of business. “Staying here for another 30 days is not going to resolve the revenue issues before us,” said Mike Chenault, the House Speaker, a Republican. Taxes paid by oil and gas companies, from the fields at Prudhoe Bay to Cook Inlet near Anchorage, make up about 90 percent of the state’s general fund revenues in Alaska, which has no statewide sales tax or income tax. But with the price of crude down by more than 50 percent from its high a few years ago, and production in   decline, those tax collections have dried up, exposing a deep dependence, and vulnerability. Anger is swirling, too. A petition drive has begun, seeking a ballot vote to recall Mr. Walker, a former Republican who was elected in 2014. Lawmakers in both parties could face voter anger in November, if only for being ineffectual in doing anything about the governor’s cuts. “I think it is likely that someone will file a lawsuit  —   highly likely,” said Senator Bill Wielechowski, a Democrat who said he thought Mr. Walker’s actions in unilaterally reducing dividend payments were illegal. “I’ve been getting calls from people who want to file a lawsuit, want to be a part of a lawsuit, people who have been around for a long long time, very well known politically in Alaska. ” In Mr. Walker’s veto, he also slashed tax credits that oil companies can get for exploration, which many Republicans objected to, saying it could hamper incentives to bring in new energy fields. But he also made some Democrats wince, in cutting education spending and the dividend fund paid to residents, which budget analysts at the University of Alaska said would hit poorer residents hardest because a state check is a bigger part of their income. Residents will still get a dividend from investment income earned by the state’s $54 billion Permanent Fund, but Mr. Walker ordered it capped at $1, 000 per person, down from just over $2, 000 last year. In Alaska  —   where many things, from food to energy, are expensive  —   the dividend has become entwined into the economic system. Police departments and social services agencies, for example, routinely garnish the dividend checks of people who owe fines or delinquent child support payments they have begun calculating the costs of what cannot be collected or distributed. Mr. Walker, who proposed a raft of new taxes to keep state programs afloat, including the reintroduction of an income tax, repealed in 1980 after the oil boom hit, said in his veto message that inaction by the Legislature had become a threat to Alaska’s future, requiring a response from the executive branch. He also said that the Legislature’s plan to rely on borrowing from a savings fund to keep programs afloat  —   and the refusal by a majority of lawmakers to consider any significant increase in taxes paid by residents  —   meant that problems will grow worse. “My team and I introduced a balanced plan in December that fairly distributed the burden across all demographics. Not a single measure of that plan was passed by the Legislature, nor was another plan even introduced,” Mr. Walker said. On Thursday, at a news conference before the Legislature’s adjournment, his exasperation was clear. “How bad does it have to get before we actually do something?” he asked. Budget pressures have pushed Alaska to make structural changes that people in both parties say will ultimately be good for the state. An overhaul of the criminal justice system, for example, that was signed into law by Mr. Walker on Monday and supported by lawmakers in both parties, aims to reduce the prison population by 13 percent over the next eight years partly by reducing penalties for nonviolent offenses like drug possession, saving the state $380 million. Some of those savings will be reinvested into drug treatment services,   support for offenders returning home from prison, violence prevention programming and crime victims’ services. Mr. Walker, a former energy lawyer and mayor of Valdez in southern Alaska, has said that his unaffiliated political status has given him greater latitude to push for changes like justice reform and fiscal overhaul. But as his allies have pointed out, Mr. Walker has constructed his administration in a way that could now divide or confound the governor’s enemies. A former Republican candidate for the United States Senate, Joe Miller, is leading the recall drive to kick Mr. Walker out. But if Mr. Miller’s efforts are successful, they would propel a Democrat, Lt. Gov. Byron I. Mallott, into office.",0
1228,"Email Hack Details Movements of Joe Biden, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Hackers on Thursday posted hundreds of emails from a young Democratic operative that contained documents detailing the    schedules and precise movements of the vice president, the first lady and Hillary Clinton during recent campaign   and official political events. The emails included names and cellphone numbers of numerous Secret Service agents, spreadsheets with the names and Social Security numbers of campaign donors, and PowerPoint presentations showing    directions for where officials like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should walk when they arrived at events. The hackers who posted the emails also distributed what they claimed was a scanned image of the information page from Michelle Obama’s passport, though the authenticity of the image could not be verified. The emails were stolen from the personal Gmail account of the Democratic operative, Ian Mellul. They reveal how widely White House officials, Clinton campaign operatives and Secret Service agents have exchanged detailed and sensitive information with people using personal email accounts. There is no indication that Mr. Mellul, 22, who was in effect working as a freelancer when the White House or the Clinton campaign needed help, did anything wrong, and government officials declined to talk about the use of the private account. About a year and a half’s worth of emails from Mr. Mellul’s account were posted late Wednesday by the website DCLeaks. com, which earlier this month released a batch of emails from the personal account of Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, in which he voiced his scorn for Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and his personal peeves with Mrs. Clinton, his Democratic opponent. The newly released emails do not provide specific security details, but they do reveal the types of movements that top political officials make at such events. If emails were hacked before an event, that could present a more serious security issue. One document instructed Mr. Biden to walk up four steps at a loading dock in Cleveland before climbing 26 steps to a holding room. Another used blue arrows to show the route Mrs. Clinton should walk through a donor’s house in Houston. Both documents included   pictures of the event locations. Mr. Mellul, who volunteered to work as an advance staff member for the White House and the Clinton campaign as he finished his undergraduate education at George Washington University in Washington, declined to comment. “I’ve got to hang up,” he said Thursday when reached on his cellphone. Cathy L. Milhoan, the director of communications for the Secret Service, said the agency was “aware of the alleged email hacking of a White House staffer. “Obviously the Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,” she added. An F. B. I. spokesman said the bureau was looking into the hacking. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that officials took “any reports about a cyberbreach seriously” and that the episode was “something we are taking a close look at. ” DCLeaks. com is a relatively new website that has posted documents taken from the accounts of prominent figures like Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the former commander of NATO forces in Europe, and George Soros, a wealthy backer of liberal causes. On the site, its creators describe themselves as American “hacktivists” who aim to “publish a large amount of emails from   officials and their influence agents all over the world. ” Mr. Mellul hardly fits either description. His   job ranks just above that of an intern. The emails from his account document the often mundane process that White House or campaign staff members go through to prepare for an event, including setting up stages, organizing photo lines, arranging for lecterns and coordinating with the Secret Service about getting clearances for all of the people the politician will encounter along the way. One email contained a spreadsheet with the names and Social Security numbers of almost 100 people scheduled to attend a Houston   for Mrs. Clinton. In another exchange, a Secret Service agent discussed how many official “pins” would be provided for hotel staff members to have access to an event. After Mr. Mellul said the hotel had requested 50 Secret Service pins, the agent wrote, “Yikes. ” Several of the emails contain what is referred to as a “movement document” or a “site diagram” involving the vice president, the first lady or Mrs. Clinton. Those emails were often sent to a large number of people, including Mr. Mellul. In other cases, Mr. Mellul emailed copies of the documents to other campaign or government officials, including Secret Service officials. “Good morning all,” Mr. Mellul wrote on May 20, the day of a Hillary for America  . “Please find the attached site diagram for Houston’s H. F. A. finance event this evening. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Ian. ” The emails begin in February 2015, when Mr. Mellul was in the honors program and studying political science. In the messages, Mr. Mellul comes across as a conscientious and courteous young man whose friends would email him for help with their school essays and résumés. After high school, he jumped into the intern circuit that feeds into   jobs in Washington. In 2014, he received a coveted internship at the White House and later parlayed the connections he had made as an intern into   freelance work for the White House. His tryout, it appears, was helping Mrs. Obama’s team at a lunch for congressional spouses on April 15, 2015. In an email two days before the event, Lindsay Drewel, a Washington public relations executive, wrote to Anthony R. Bernal, the deputy chief of staff for Jill Biden, the vice president’s wife, that if Mr. Mellul “can survive that crazy event (which we know he will) he’ll be ready to go! Haha. ” After the event, Mr. Mellul even included a Secret Service agent in his round of emails thanking those with whom he had worked. And the day after the lunch, the first lady’s office reached out again to see if he could help with an event in Virginia. Mr. Mellul was excited, and in an email to a friend later that day, he noted that he had been told “it takes a few good   before they really trust you. ” On April 20, 2015, five days after his first job with Mrs. Obama’s team at the congressional lunch, Mr. Mellul described himself as “on the advance team” for the first lady in an email to his professor saying he might miss class because of an event.",0
1229,Obese Woman Loses More Than 100 Kilograms After Breaking Up With Her Feeder Boyfriend,"Patty Sanchez, 51, used to eat 13,000 calories a day and weigh more than 320 kilograms as she tried to satisfy boyfriend's fantasies

Patty weighed more than 320 kilograms when she split from her feeder boyfriend, who was constantly encouraging and enabling her weight gain. 

Patty Sanchez has gone from 320 kilograms to 215 kilograms after years of constant eating with the encouragement of her ex-boyfriend and online fat fetishists. 

Having purposefully consumed up to 13,000 calories per day for years on end, it is a minor miracle in itself that Patty has made it to 51 and is in position to change her lifestyle. 

After splitting from her boyfriend of ten years, Patty soon realized that she had become very isolated and vulnerable due to her size.


The mother-of-four has spoken out about the positive effect weight loss has had on both her personal and family life, also allowing her to undertake a wide range of everyday tasks previously impossible to her. 
""I was tremendous – and I was dying a slow death.I realized that the feeding relationship I was in and the squashing was benefiting others, but it wasn’t for me. The weight loss had a lot to do with my break up with my ex – I was being served every meal daily, and when we broke up I had to take care of myself.I never feared death before – it was something I never thought about when I was getting bigger and bigger. But when I reached my lowest and couldn’t walk to the bathroom without getting winded I was worried I wouldn’t be there for my kids and grand kids. My struggles didn’t fully surface until I was single and had no one to help me and couldn’t cook, bathe, or leave the house – it was very lonely,” she said in an interview. Today, with the help of her sons, Patty eats 3,000 calories a day and is more mobile. 

She said: “I stay away from fast food and eat more vegetables, fruits and poultry. Now I can do things that people take for granted that I couldn’t do - like walk, bathe, and paint my toenails which I couldn't reach for years."" 


“My children are very proud of me for changing my life around - we have a better relationship now,"" she added.

1230,FBI Director Comey Asks President Putin: “Is Anthony Weiner Yours?”,"
An absolutely astonishing Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today details an extended telephonic conversation held Thursday between President Putin and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey wherein America’s top law enforcement officer asked Russia’s leader “Is Anthony Weiner yours?”, to which Putin replied, “You should ask Aleksandr Poteyev”—and that led, less than 24 hours after this call ended, to Hillary Clinton being placed, once again, under FBI investigation. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Director Comey’s call to President Putin was in regards to the Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) this past Tuesday advising all Federation security and intelligence organizations to cease all contact and cooperation with the FBI—and that we detailed in our report titled Russia Breaks All Contact With Hillary Clinton’s “Ministry Of Terror”—Once Called The FBI.
With “many/numerous” joint terrorism and international criminal investigations currently ongoing between FIS agencies and the FBI, this report continues, Director Comey expressed his concerns to President Putin that the ending of them “would/could” cause “dangers/alarms” to both the Federation and United States—to which President Putin agreed, and in a bid to ease Russian-US war tensions publically stated after this call ended that “Russia is not going to attack anyone, that’s ridiculous”.
Though not the “main/central” focus of their conversation, this report notes, President Putin did become “annoyed/perturbed” when Director Comey asked him about former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (aka Carlos Danger) while seeming to allege that he was in some way a Russian spy—and that President Putin bluntly replied to by reminding Director Comey that the correct person to ask that question to was former Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) officer Aleksandr Poteyev, whose location could be found by asking the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
SVR officer Poteyev, this report details, was the “overseer/director” of a Federation “honeypot” intelligence operation operating in the United States whose mission was to “discover/unmask” high ranking American elite politicians, bankers, businessmen, etc., preying upon young Russian girls brought to that country to perform pedophile sex acts.
Once these sexually deviant elite Americans who preyed upon these young Russian girl children were identified by the SVR, this report explains, they were put under electronic surveillance—and once being notified of this, many of them volunteered to assist the Federation in “other meaningful ways”.
This highly successful SVR operation was, however, destroyed, this report continues, when SVR officer Poteyev turned against the Federation and became an operative for the American CIA—who this past July, immediately after FBI Director Comey announced Hillary Clinton would face no charges for her crimes, was suddenly declared dead (without any evidence) by the CIA, but that the SVR knows is not the truth.
Master SVR intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko (in the US known as Anna Chapman) just prior to her and other SVR “operatives/specialists” being betrayed to the CIA by Poteyev, this report continues, had identified US Congressman Anthony Weiner as being a pedophile and targeted him for “extreme/radical” electronic surveillance—but whose mission was ended on 27 June 2010 with her arrest by US authorities.
The SVR’s “extreme/radical” electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner was justified, this report explains, due not only to his being a sexual deviant, but, also, because his wife, Huma Abedin, was the top aide to then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—whom the Federation has long noted is an “existential threat” to the entire world.
This report doesn’t mention in its unclassified portions if the SVR continued their electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner, but does allude to the CIA picking up this investigation where intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko left off—and as evidenced by the CIA’s outing him as a sexual deviant 11 months later in May 2011.
To why the CIA turned the SVR’s Congressman Weiner surveillance operation against Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin, this report further notes, was due to Secretary Clinton, in 2011, ordering the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi (and the destruction of Libya)—who was a major CIA asset and had allowed, since 2004, this US spy agency to use his country to interrogate (actually torture) high value Islamic terror leaders.
Within 24 hours of President Putin directing FBI Director Comey to look for answers about Congressman Weiner’s association with Russia by asking Aleksandr Poteyev (really the CIA), this report continues, Director Comey notified the US Congress that his investigation into Hillary Clinton was being re-opened—and was due to the “mysterious/magical” appearance of tens-of-thousands of secret Hillary Clinton emails discovered on the computer of former Congressman Weiner, and that led Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein to state that a “real bombshell” had been discovered otherwise the FBI wouldn’t have dared begin this whole sordid process again.
To how the Obama regimes FBI, CIA and Department of Justice (DoJ) will untangle the Hillary Clinton catastrophe they’ve ensnared themselves, and the American people, into this report doesn’t even venture an opinion on—but it does conclude by noting that the chaos enveloping America right now includes not only their presidential election, but Attorney General Loretta Lynch stunningly pleading the 5th Amendment in a letter to the US Congress this week over the payment of $1 billion in cash to Iran, and a terrifying new US Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure set to go into effect on 1 December that will legalize the ability of the US government to hack into computers in any jurisdiction, even in foreign nations.
Leading any ordinary American, one would think, to ask of themselves the same thing Donald Trump has been asking: “Why not vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose?”—after all, with Hillary Clinton having already been caught on tape talking about rigging one election, whose to say she isn’t about to do it again?

1231,"Wikileaks 20: Downplaying Benghazi, Bill Clinton's slimy past discussed in latest Podesta emails","Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:56 UTC © Brian Snyder / Reuters John Podesta WikiLeaks has released a 20th batch of emails from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chair. The issues discussed include Bill Clinton's past, Benghazi, the email server scandal and even alien life. The whistleblowing site has promised to release 50,000 messages from Podesta in the lead up to the US presidential election on November 8. A total of 34,197 communications have been released to date. Bill's past Bill Clinton's controversial past was evidently of concern to his wife's campaign team, which discussed how to handle questions on allegations of sexual assault against him. Preparation for what the media might throw at her included the questions: ""Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?"" and ""How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did?"" The mail was sent by Ron Klain, a member of Clinton's debate preparation team, on January 12, 2016. Several days previous Paula Jones, one of Bill Clinton's accusers, gave an interview calling Hillary Clinton a""liar"" and ""two-faced"" for trying to discredit her husband's accusers. Let's hope the Democratic party is not suicidal A July 2015 email from Clinton adviser Neera Tanden to Podesta discusses a CNN poll which she guesses will show, ""Bernie doing pretty well w Hillary and doing as well against Jeb or close to it."" ""Can you imagine what Republicans would do with him if he were the nominee?"" Podesta replies, referring to Sanders. ""Well, let's see what the poll actually says. Let's hope the Democratic party is not suicidal,"" Tanden says. ""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?"" she asks. ""And has that person been drawn and quartered?"" ""Like whole thing is f*cking insane,"" she adds. Downplaying Benghazi An October 2015 email chain between staffers discusses upcoming paid media ads about Benghazi and Clinton's email scandal. The group debates whether the ads should target Iowa and New Hampshire or be a national buy. ""I know the boss wants a national cable buy to reach the inside the beltway types, press and donors,"" Jennifer Palmieri says. ""But press will hate this."" Oren Shur replies, ""If the objective is purely to undermine the Benghazi hearings, I think these spots will certainly help do that. But if the objective is to connect emails-Benghazi and conflate the two in voters' minds (which consultants feel is an imperative here), I'm not sure we know whether we can credibly do that."" The campaign appears to have decided to do a national ad on the subject. Small tweaks A March 2016 email chain discussing Clinton's inaccurate statement about the late Nancy Reagan starting a national conversation about AIDS, when she did the opposite, reveals Clinton's unwillingness to admit mistakes, even when she is proven to be wrong. The subject of the meeting is described as ""the difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent ETI and the celestials in our own universe."" The team go back on forth on Clinton's statement about the issue. ""YESTERDAY I MADE A MISTAKE IN SPEAKING ABOUT NANCY REAGAN'S record on HIV AND AIDS,"" it begins. ""I think the chances of her OK-ing this statement with that top are slim,"" Megan Rooney says. ""Here is a revised draft of a statement. It does include the words 'I made a mistake' in the first line,"" Rooney says. ""We need a strategy for getting her to approve this. I don't know if that means someone who is traveling with her (Maya?) making the case... or something else."" A later draft was then sent, changing it to, ""I said something inaccurate when speaking about the Reagan's' record on HIV and AIDS."" ""The Secretary approved the statement, with small tweaks,"" Rooney says. Extraterrestrial disclosure Former astronaut Edgar Mitchell, known for his correspondence with Podesta regarding extraterrestrials, emails Podesta regarding the ""Phoenix Lights"" incident in 1997, in which thousands of people reported sightings of hovering lights in the sky. Mitchell ""was on the phone just as they were happening over Phoenix with an eyewitness describing on March 13, 1997. This incentives about disclosure, while other reports like Roswell disincentives,"" according to the mail from April 2015. The subject of extraterrestrial disclosure is ""now more important than ever"" according to another mail sent on Mitchell's behalf a month later. ""It is also imperative that after your talk with Edgar, he then speak directly with President Obama via Skype for historical purposes, about the same issue, while the President is still in office,"" Podesta is told.",0

Various UFO conspiracy ideas have flourished on the internet. UFO conspiracy theories argue that evidence of unidentified flying objects and extraterrestrial visitors is being suppressed by various governments, and politicians in every country, most notably the officials of Washington DC. 
In Soviet times, the Ministry of Defense was working on a secret project aimed at creating a superhuman with paranormal abilities. Under this project, a group of scientists managed to get in touch with a foreign(read alien) civilization. The head of this top-secret project shared some details with reporters for the first time. 
“Along with the briefcase with nuclear codes, the president of the country is given a special ‘top secret’ folder. This folder in its entirety contains information about aliens who visited our planet,” 
Along with this, you are given a report of the absolutely secret special service that exercises control over aliens on the territory of our country. 
""I will not tell you how many of them are among us because it may cause panic,” Said Anatolyevich Medvedev. 
The important documents released a couple of years ago by Wikileaks, offered hints about aliens and extraterrestrial presence – Is it coincidental that recently, NASA, who have for along time been accused of hiding alien life, have accepted that we are not alone in the universe. Tags",0

Faulkner, â€œNo matter who wins.â€
Schoen, â€œNo matter who wins. But if the secretary of State (Clinton) wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with Huma Abedin under investigation, the secretary of Stateâ€“the president-electâ€“should she win under investigation. Harris, under these circumstances I am actively reassessing my support. Iâ€™m not a Trumpâ€Śâ€

1234,NAACP Vows to Oppose Trump’s Voter Fraud Investigation - Breitbart,"The head of the NCAAP has come out in stark opposition to President Donald J. Trump’s coming investigation into voter fraud, claiming it is “racist. ”[In an interview on CNN, Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of the NAACP, insisted that his organization would “resist” the president’s investigation into fraud during the 2016 election.  “The President has claimed millions of fraudulent ballots were cast. The only place you will find millions of fraudulent ballots are right beside that fake birth certificate for Barack Obama, inside the imagination of President Trump. They don’t exist,” Brooks said on Thursday. Instead of vote fraud, Brooks insisted that there was “unrelenting voter suppression” of the minority vote in 2016. “We have seen our rights denied as Americans. Particularly seniors,   Latinos and younger people,” Brooks exclaimed. “So, if the President insists upon conducting an investigation into voter fraud as a pretext for voter suppression, the NAACP, along with millions of Americans of every human heritage, will resist. We will push back. ” Brooks recently jumped to his Twitter account to attack the President’s investigation, calling it a figment of Trump’s imagination. 1) Only place you’ll find millions of fraudulent ballots are beside B. Obama’s fake birth certificate —  inside #POTUS ’s imagination. @NAACP pic. twitter.   —   Cornell Wm. Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 26, 2017,  In a formal statement, Brooks called vote fraud a “myth” and insisted that voter suppression is a fact. He wrote: Today, President Donald Trump called for the federal government to spend resources investigating alleged “voter fraud” in the 2016 elections. Unable to accept the fact that he lost the popular vote by some 2. 8 million votes, President Trump has repeated his naked and reckless claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election by “illegal immigrants. ” However, this notion of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election, or any other American election cycle for that matter, is false and dangerous. On CNN Brooks added that he would suggest the president change the direction of his investigation or they will have to resist it. “If the President goes down this road, we must resist, and we must resist massively,” Brooks claimed. The claims Brooks made fly in the face of the evidence, according to longtime vote fraud investigator John Fund. In a piece published by Fox News, Fund and the Heritage Foundation’s Hans von Spakovsky say that Trump’s investigation is a long overdue look at the problem of vote fraud in the U. S. Fund and von Spakovsky reveal that the Obama administration spent its entire eight years trying to quash investigations into vote fraud and also refused to allow the states to fix their voter rolls to eliminate dead voters and voters registered in multiple jurisdictions. The authors further point out that our electoral system is currently set up entirely on the honor system, expecting that all voters will be telling the truth by affirming they are both registered and will only vote once. Fund also notes that voter ID cards are perfectly acceptable and that, “All industrialized democracies  …     require voters to prove their identity before voting. ” “Our honor system for voting doesn’t work,” Fund concluded. “We don’t know how big of a problem voter fraud really is because no systematic effort has ever been made to investigate it. But the public doesn’t think it’s as insignificant as the media insists. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
1235,100 Days: Donald Trump Still Needs Big Win from Congress,"President Donald Trump won the 2016 election promising to be a dealmaker, but he has yet to score a big win in Congress after his first 100 days. [Trump tried to wrangle Congress into supporting the House Republican Obamacare replacement by using all of the social tools of the White House.  He met with conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus at the White House and moderate members of the Wednesday Group. Senior White House aides and Vice President Mike Pence hosted multiple meetings at the White House to make a deal. “He’s thrown the doors open to the White House,” one White House aide explained to Breitbart News, ticking off the various executive meetings with members of Congress. The meetings have gone both ways. Trump traveled to the Capitol to discuss his agenda, attending a Senate lunch where he was warmly received. Wednesday, the president’s cabinet secretaries will propose dramatic tax reform proposals, urging Congress to rally behind his ideas to jumpstart the economy. On the same day, a plan to adjust the House replacement of Obamacare is taking shape, after conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus have drafted adjustments to the legislation. Although congressional members have been on break for most of April, White House aides say their legislative staff has worked with the White House to develop a plan to push solutions forward. House Republican leaders remain intentionally vague about a date on healthcare legislation, in an attempt to avoid an “artificial deadline” that cannot be met. Republicans were embarrassed after Speaker Paul Ryan canceled a scheduled vote on the healthcare bill because it lacked support. If the House plan to replace Obamacare passes, it will be the end of an exhaustive whip process where many Republicans might not be delighted with the results. But the White House is not entirely frustrated with Congress. With their cooperation, Trump signed 13 Congressional Review Acts to cut regulations and roll back some of the more onerous   agenda items in the federal government. Trump also extended the Veteran’s Choice Program, allowing veterans facing long wait times or are long distances from a VA hospital to seek care at a private hospital. The “big win,” however, remains elusive, as media critics jaw about the Trump White House’s inexperience with the ways of Washington, DC, and the befuddled House Republicans, who suddenly have to lead after years of obstruction. The future of Trump’s presidency depends on whether his White House learns to lead Congress  —   and whether Congress can rally behind his agenda.",0
1236,Rigged Election: Hillary & Trump Caught Partying with Kissinger at Jesuit Gala,"By Covert Geopolitics
We have been very, very suspicious of Donald Trump since he began his political run.
Many believed he was an outsider who was our “only hope” to tame the US federal government beast. But it has become very clear he is not.
First, Wikileaks showed that Killary herself actually approved Trump to be her competitor. According to an email sent from an assistant at the Clinton campaign, Hillary was aware that Trump was going to run before the political process was fully underway.
Clinton advised the mainstream media to push his legitimacy as a “pied piper” candidate because she realized, after looking at the poll numbers, that she wouldn’t stand a chance at winning the presidency against any of the establishment republicans without making them “pied pipers” – it just so happened that Donald was the easiest to play the role considering his long history of friendship with the Clintons.

In addition, the mainstream media was more than complicit in creating a narrative that the 2016 presidential elections were about Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump from the get go.
But, barely reported in the media, was that after the 3rd presidential debate, Clinton and Trump went out for a night on the town together… and where they went is of great interest.
They went to an annual Jesuit function which is usually full of New World Order types.
THE JESUITS One of the more interesting things that occurred right at the end of the Jubilee year in early October, was that the Jesuits installed a new Superior General, with the date to commence being actually at midnight on the end of Jubilee.
We found this interesting because there is plenty of evidence that the Jesuits are at least one major arm of what you can call the illuminati.
In fact, the Jesuits were founded in Spain by what various reports call “crypto Jews” – those who are Jewish but pretending to be Catholic. Certainly at that time in Spain it was safer not to be a Jew.
Even Wikipedia, which wouldn’t recognize a conspiracy if it were directly presented by its participants has this to say about the Jesuits:
… In the first 30 years of the existence of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuit conversos (Catholic-convert Jews) including the second Father General Diego Lainez … The original founder Ignatius … said that he, “would take it as a special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage.” 
At the beginning of the Al Smith dinner party after Cardinal Dolan was introduced, a joke was even made by a speaker that “everyone in attendance is doing their part in supporting their charitable efforts and that it couldn’t be done without the support of many of the other devoted “Catholics” on stage like Henry Kissinger, Howard Rubenstein, and Mort Zuckerman” – all of whom are obviously Jewish so this remark was naturally met with a lot of laughter…
In fact, an extraordinary amount of controversy swirls around Jesuits. They are said to constitute the “Black Church” and thus adhere to the same Satanic religion as the world’s elite bankers supposedly hold.
The leader of the Jesuit order is commonly recognized in conspiratorial circles as the “Black Pope” whose signature staff is a crooked cross. Historically, the Jesuit Order has been seen as one that shirks no crime in expanding the power of the Church.
Lest this sound entirely outrageous, one must note that the Jesuits are, for instance, the inventors of concentration camps, which they established in Paraguay in order to incarcerate and then torture the native indians of the area.
But the litany of attributed Jesuit evil is even darker than that according to those who believe in the order’s continued malicious pursuit. The supposed founder of the Bavarian-based Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, was a Jesuit.
In fact, the order is reputed to have been deeply involved in the Illuminati’s initial expansion, and chances are it is still deeply involved.
One more thing that highlights the evil of the Jesuits is their extreme oath of induction which all superiors must take in order to be elevated to the higher rungs of the organization. This is taken from the book Subterranean Rome by Carlos Didier, translated from the French, and published in New York in 1843 and reads in part,
“…promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants’ heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus…”
One of the most poignant quotes regarding the malevolence of the Jesuits comes from Marquis de LaFayette 1757-1834; who was a French statesman and general who served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.
His quote is as follows:
“It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.”
THE BIG BASH When evaluating Jesuit behavior and influence, please keep in mind that both Donald Trump and Hillary’s VP, Tim Kaine, are Jesuit educated. And it should be of GREAT interest, therefore, that practically on the eve of the US election, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton partied the night away at a Jesuit function that included such prominent Jesuit-trained attendees as Henry Kissinger.
Not only did the two not look like sworn enemies… they looked like two star crossed lovers going to their first prom.
We have long held to our stance that Killary will be the next President of the US. The amount of vote rigging, murders and shenanigans to even get her to where she is so far has been tremendous… and it won’t stop.
That said, if by some fluke, and the Diebold machines malfunction or people in the US wake up slightly and Donald Trump gets elected… it is pretty clear they are on the same team and, as we’ve said previously, nothing major will change.
So, if you were hoping that this election could change things in the US… get over that hope right now. It might change things, but only for the much, much worse.
This charade is being played right in front of everyone’s eyes and most do not understand what is happening or why jokes like the “Catholic” joke is actually funny to these elite people.
They are laughing at the peasants’ stupidity and lack of understanding, not because the men mentioned are Jews… anyone with half a brain knows that.
… The groundwork for global governance has been laid, don’t let them blindside you as they attempt to carry out their nefarious plot. Donald Trump even stated at the dinner, “We’ve got to come together, not only as a nation, but as a world community.”

1238,Syrian Observatory: 300 ISIS Child Soldiers Killed in Past Two Weeks Around Mosul,"Share This 
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 300 Syrian children, recruited as child soldiers by ISIS, have been killed over the past two weeks in fighting in and around the Iraqi city of Mosul. The brigade is called the “cubs of the caliphate.” 
Locals reported that the loss of children in fighting around the Syrian town of Daquq was spun by ISIS religious leaders as minor compared to the gains they would secure in Mosul. The fighting is fierce around Mosul, and the casualties are high. 
The Observatory said that at least 480 Syrian fighters had been killed in fighting around the Mosul area since the fighting began two weeks ago. This means that a strong majority of those casualties were actually children. 
The US has claimed they believe between 800 and 900 fighters have been killed overall around Mosul. This indicates that the fighting outside of Mosul is heavily between invading Iraqi forces and ISIS’ Syrian auxiliaries. Large numbers of ISIS fighters are believed to have remained within Mosul, preparing to defend the city itself.  ",0
1239,Afghan Response to Female Pilot’s U.S. Asylum Case: ‘I Am Sure She Lied’ - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Contending that her “life isn’t at risk at all,” military officials in Afghanistan have asked that the United States reject the asylum case of Capt. Niloofar Rahmani, the first female   pilot in the Afghan Air Force. On Thursday, Captain Rahmani revealed that she had applied for asylum this summer, saying she felt unsafe in Afghanistan, where she and her family have received death threats. For the last 15 months, she has been training at air bases in Arkansas, Florida and Texas. Captain Rahmani said that her Afghan male colleagues in the air force treated her with contempt and that she felt at risk. “Things are not changing” for the better in Afghanistan, Captain Rahmani said in an interview on Friday. “Things are getting worse and worse. ” Gen. Mohammad Radmanish, a Defense Ministry spokesman, disputed her claims of being in danger. “I am sure she lied by saying she was threatened, just to win the asylum case,” General Radmanish said on Sunday. “It is baseless that she claimed her life was at risk while serving in the Afghan Air Force. ” “Since Captain Rahmani’s claim is new, we expect her to change her mind and return to her own country and continue serving as a pilot,” the general said. “We request from our American friends and government to reject her asylum case and send her back, because knowing the truth, Captain Rahmani’s life isn’t at risk at all. ” The American government has celebrated Captain Rahmani as an example of its success in advancing women’s rights in Afghanistan. In 2015 the State Department honored her with its annual Women of Courage award, and Michelle Obama praised her courage. In Afghanistan, few supported her decision, and there were worries that her asylum request would affect the process of training Afghan pilots outside the country. “Captain Rahmani’s claim that she was harassed in the workplace is not true, because in the air force all the pilots and staff are   and highly trained people,” said Col. Ayan Khan, a helicopter pilot in the Afghan Air Force. “How can they harass their female colleague who serves along them?”",0

Not only did Trump win the last debate , he won it without reading the answers and information that someone else was feeding him.

It was signed by the heads of the governments of the SRV and all the EAEU Member States – Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Russia in May 2015, but it could only come into effect after its ratification by the Parliaments of the countries listed above. The EAEU has been trading actively with Vietnam for many years. Over the period from 2010 to 2014, the trade volume increased by more than 60%, exceeding $4 billion. The establishment of the free trade zone is a logical step in this cooperation. According to the Eurasian Commission’s forecasts, it may lead to more than a twofold growth in trade turnover by 2020, and Russia will enjoy no less than 80% thereof. The total population of the EAEU is 183 million people and the total GDP exceeds $2 trillion. Privileged access to such an extensive market is surely a boon to Vietnam’s economy. The EAEU also stands to make gains: SRV’s population exceeds 95 million people and its GDP amounts to $192 billion. According to data gathered in recent years, the country’s economy is rapidly developing. Thus, the Free Trade Zone Agreement is advantageous for both parties. According to the document, most goods from both the SRV and the EAEU are subject to complete or partial exemption from import duty for the next ten years. This should lead to a reduction in their cost and rapid trade development. In addition, the Agreement also focuses on intellectual property protection, cooperation in e-commerce and in public procurement. It also covers competition protection. Alongside imports and exports, the Free Trade Zone Agreement will facilitate mutual investment. Vietnam’s leadership sees a lot of potential in the trade partnership with both the EAEU and Russia in particular. According to data as of 2016, Russian-Vietnamese trade turnover amounted to $3.7 billion. Owing to the establishment of Free Trade Zone, it is expected to exceed $10 billion by 2020. Alongside the provisions that are common to all the Members States, the Free Trade Zone Agreement primarily included sections related only to the SRV and Russia. They specify additional terms and conditions, which facilitate trade, investment, and the movement of individuals between the two countries. After the Agreement was signed, the Russian-Vietnamese “Intergovernmental Protocol on supporting motor vehicle production in the territory of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” came into effect. This document was signed in March 2016 by Vietnam’s Minister of Industry and Trade Vũ Huy Hoàng during a visit to Russia. D. Manturov, the Russian Minister of Industry and Trade, signed the Protocol on behalf of Russia. According to the document, joint ventures will be established in the SRV between Vietnamese firms and Russian companies such as the GAZ Group, KamAZ, Sollers, which will produce various types of automotive vehicles. Concluding the Free Trade Zone Agreement with Vietnam is beneficial to the EAEU and Russia in particular. However, its significance is greater than simply gaining a good trade partner. It may be posited that the Russian economy has reached a new level: Russia has not had such agreements with countries outside the former Soviet Union before. Furthermore, this is the beginning of the large-scale promotion of the EAEU and Russia in the Asia-Pacific Region. Since the EAEU’s inception in 2015, it has been trying to establish trade relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is well-known that Vietnam is an important member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which unites a number of states in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is quite probable that the free trade zone with Vietnam is a step towards establishing free trade zone will all other Member States of the ASEAN. Many ASEAN Members are favourably disposed towards this idea. Negotiations are being held with Indonesia, the Kingdom of Cambodia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Furthermore, the possibility of establishing free trade zones with non-ASEAN states in the Asia-Pacific Region, such as India, China, and New Zealand is under consideration. Thus, it can be said that the EAEU’s position in the Asia-Pacific Region is gradually strengthening. This was also confirmed by Mongolia’s statement in November 2016 on its desire to join the EAEU. At first glance, it may seem that the EAEU’s presence in the Asia-Pacific Region will lead to the competition with China, now one of the major players in the region amid the weakening position of the USA. In fact, the growing influence of the EAEU is more profitable for China. It is well known that the opposition between China and the USA currently dominates the Asia-Pacific Region. America’s economic and political influence in the region has weakened considerably in recent years, but it is still great. America is trying to maintain its power as much as it can and win over as many countries as possible. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement was signed in February 2016. The TPP includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the USA, and Vietnam. All these states are united by a free trade zone and a number of common rules. It is undoubtedly difficult to compete with such a union as about 30% of global trade is undertaken by TPP Member States. Moreover, negotiations are under way regarding the creation of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The USA hopes to attract the European Union’s involvement. The probability that these negotiations will be successful is small: the project is too disadvantageous for Europe. However, if this happens, major and rich unions may appear on both sides of Eurasia, which will account for about 80% of the global trade. What’s more, the USA will control each of them. Therefore, the TPP and T-TIP member states may considerably reduce the trade volume with the rest of the world, including the People’s Republic of China, which is currently the largest trade partner for most of them. In addition, one of China’s major projects, which it is laying high hopes – the New Silk Road – will be exposed to risk. It should connect Europe and Asia and become a free trade zone itself in the future. This scenario is surely unacceptable for both China and many other countries in Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific Region. In order to successfully compete with the TPP and T-TIP, the EAEU states and the states of the Asia-Pacific Region should put great effort into mutual integration. This integration would allow Russia, China, India, ASEAN and Central Asia to be more confident in the face of competition. However, many states that do not wish to cooperate with the USA have fears about a powerful and expansive China. This is an obstacle to regional unification. Perhaps, the emergence of a third power, such as the EAEU, will be a solution to the situation and will help establish a successful partnership.

1244,Chris Rock Returns With Jokes and Personal Anguish - The New York Times,"DURHAM, N. C.  —   As soon as Chris Rock strode onstage here on Monday in the first performance of his   “Total Blackout Tour,” he explained why, nine years after his last   special, he’s pacing stages again: “That’s what alimony will do to you. ” Mr. Rock, who was married for 16 years,  divorced last year, and while his quip had the jackhammer snap that has long made him the best deliverer of punch lines in comedy, the old swagger faded during his     show. Now 52, Mr. Rock, looking trim in casual black pants and jacket, talked about his vanity, insecurities and failures with startling frankness. “I wasn’t a good husband,” he said, standing still, shifting into a quieter register. “I didn’t listen. I wasn’t kind. I cheated. ” Mr. Rock paused as the audience waited for the joke. It arrived eventually, but it did not match the impact of this silent, dramatic beat. In his new set, Mr. Rock appeared to be after something more than laughs. It is rare to see a celebrity discuss his infidelity with the specificity that he did here  —   detailing who and how many  —   but he talked about this in an anguished, searching tone that fans may find surprising. At times, Mr. Rock sounded like a man confessing his sins, turning vulnerability into his latest provocation. Ever since his breakthrough 1996 HBO special, “Bring the Pain”  —   his new set includes giant initials evoking that seminal show  —   Mr. Rock has maintained a secure place in the   pantheon. But in contrast with peers like Bill Burr and Louis C. K. his specials are infrequent enough that every one is a major event. His current show will be released as a special on Netflix, part of a   $40 million deal. His last, “Kill the Messenger,” was recorded during the 2008 election, and it’s hard not to be struck by his cheerful mood then, sounding positively giddy as he pokes fun at John McCain, skewering him as a “war hero who got captured. ” In the recent presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump made the same point about Mr. McCain in similar language, but without the punch line. In the past nine years, the line for transgression has shifted. But Mr. Rock didn’t try to adjust to it. Nor did he approach the recent election with what has become the standard alarm of many comedians. Barack Obama was the anomaly, he argued, while Mr. Trump is a return to business as usual in a conservative country always run by rich white men. “I’m not scared,” Mr. Rock said, looking to the evils of history for comfort. “I’m black. The future is always better when you’re black. ” Comedy is about surprise, and one reason Mr. Rock has been his generation’s finest political   is his ability to consistently go against the grain with conviction. (Unlike some, he always seems to believe the premises of his jokes.) The rise of Mr. Trump, he concluded, taking his critique to a comic extreme, stems from our battle against bullying. “We got rid of bullies,” he said. “When a real one showed up, we didn’t know what to do. ” He also discussed police shootings in an unexpected way, saying that he would think that law enforcement might try to shoot a white kid for once, “just for appearances. ” But he also spent time sympathizing with police officers, describing work that has zero room for error and draws pay that is far too low. If his current social commentary has a common thread, it’s an alertness to how economics colors every issue. “Whole Foods does not say ‘No Blacks Allowed,’” he said. “But a $7 orange does. That’s the new Jim Crow. ” What stood out most about this show, however, was the personal, not the political. Mr. Rock has mostly kept the audience at a distance from his private life. He isn’t the type to dwell on his demons or soul search on a podcast. So it’s a surprise to see him tell jokes about the dark consequences of his addiction to pornography or the excruciating details of family court. This is not his funniest show, but it might be his most compelling, a departure even in its form. The distance between his forceful   persona and the   more thoughtful one he displays in interviews has shrunk a bit  —   and his jokes are more intricate, denser. What remains firm is a lyricist’s gift for concision, boiling down a thought to its comic essence. On bullying: “Pressure makes diamonds. Not hugs. ” Mr. Rock’s comedy has always been happily cynical about marriage, his jokes regarding relationships rooted in regressive stereotypes about men and women. He’s found many laughs in sympathy for men behaving badly, blaming Hillary Clinton for her husband’s cheating and pointing out how O. J. Simpson had to pay steep alimony while his former wife slept with another man. (“I’m not saying he should have killed her, but I understand. ”) When discussing his own marriage, however, he blamed only himself, repeatedly, allowing sadness to creep into his dynamic voice. He also dug into his past, telling a story about his grandmother disparaging poor men that stuck with him for years, and another about his grandfather mocking him for crying. Mr. Rock wants to tell us where he came from, and also where he hopes to go. “I’m trying to get a little bit of religion,” he said, before backtracking: “Not a lot. ” He added that he believes in God, but only a bit. Onstage, Mr. Rock has always had the intonations of a preacher  —   which his grandfather was  —   repeating premises until they sound like incantations. But his real religion is comedy, and at the end of this discussion of his relationship with God, he contrasted the sureness of faith with the questioning nature of a comic. But as comedians go, Mr. Rock has always been one of the most forcefully confident. What’s different is he now sounds more anxious. And while the election and his divorce may have added heaviness to his gait, this evolution may also stem from simply growing older. In a line he repeated over and over on Monday, Mr. Rock explained his spiritual search in the hardheaded pragmatic terms we’ve come to expect from him: “I want to find God before God finds me. ”",0
1245,"Trump Sons Forge Ahead Without Father, Expanding and Navigating Conflicts - The New York Times","President Trump’s old office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan sits unoccupied now, unofficial storage space for the gathering trove of memorabilia that his two oldest sons say they hope will eventually be turned over to their father’s presidential library. But just one flight down, in Eric and Donald Trump Jr. ’s cramped offices, their father is    —   in the seven copies of a recent issue of Golf Digest with his photo and the headline “  ” on the cover stacked on Eric’s desk in his visage looping endlessly on CNN (yes, they watch CNN) in the cardboard cutout of the president watching from behind a stash of blueprints in the corner. This is the conundrum facing the two brothers as they assume control of the empire their father built: How do they move forward, and navigate the ethical shoals, at a business predicated entirely on the brand of the man they have vowed to distance themselves from? “His DNA will always be in the company in a big way,” Eric said, during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week at Trump Tower. “His DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We’re extensions of him in so many ways. ” Both he and Don Jr. insist that they do not need their father’s input to run the company  —   the apprentices have become the boss. And even as questions remain about potential conflicts of interest, they say, unapologetically, that they plan to forge ahead with expanding the Trump Organization’s footprint, both in the United States and abroad. On Saturday, in fact, they will cut ribbon at their company’s newest branded property, billed as a “magnificent golf course” in the booming United Arab Emirates city of Dubai, before hundreds of Emirati power brokers. A week later they will head to Vancouver, British Columbia, for another opening celebration, of the latest Trump International Hotel and Tower, one of a dozen major international projects still underway, from the Dominican Republic to India. Back home in the United States, they are planning to open a new boutique hotel chain,  Scion, in perhaps 30 cities. With the aggressive push forward, though, comes the persistent thrum of ethical qualm. Just last week, news that Eric had traveled to the Dominican Republic to restart a stalled project there prompted controversy, given the Trump Organization’s pledge of no new overseas deals. The Washington Post reported that when Eric visited Uruguay on business in January, the trip cost taxpayers nearly $100, 000 in hotel bills for the required Secret Service agents and for embassy staff members. Also echoing through the office at Trump Tower was the   over the decision by Nordstrom and several other retailers to stop selling their sister Ivanka’s clothing line. Don Jr. called that “disgusting,” and both brothers said their father was right to take Nordstrom and other retailers to task publicly in Ivanka’s defense. “He’s Papa Bear,” Eric said. Despite pressure to do so, President Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include a stake in a   office buildings, more than a dozen golf courses and at least 15 hotels that the company owns or manages. Instead, he has signed over control of    operations of his privately held company to the two sons and Allen Weisselberg, a trusted lieutenant at the Trump Organization, with an agreement not to discuss company business. The arrangement and the president’s decision to not release his taxes have brought widespread criticism from liberal groups and even the federal government’s top ethics watchdog, Walter M. Shaub Jr. the director of the Office of Government Ethics. President Trump has continued to frequent his commercial properties, including over the weekend in Florida, bringing them global media attention and potential new customers. But the brothers say they are convinced that they and their father have taken sufficient steps to create a management structure that will allow them to avoid creating the kind of appearance of conflict of interest that plagued Hillary Clinton as secretary of state while her husband continued to operate the Clinton Foundation. The measures they have taken, they say, have included explicit instructions to their domestic and international business partners not to reach out to anyone in the United States government for help. The brothers’ expressions tightened and their voices rose when they were asked, in separate interviews, about suggestions that their father was using the presidency as a way to enhance the family’s profits. “Who in their right mind would try to enrich themselves by spending a fortune to run against 17 seasoned politicians on the Republican side, to then go up against the Clinton machine, Wall Street, Hollywood, P. C. culture?” Don Jr. asked. “To use that as the way to enrich yourself is laughable. ” The family, he added, would face heat whatever it did. If the Trump Organization sold its assets, there would be allegations of impropriety, as foreign investors would most likely be involved. If it liquidated and put the cash into the bank, he said, his father would be accused of artificially inflating interest rates for personal gain. For critics, though, particularly Democrats in Congress, the continuation of the global operations of the Trump Organization  —   even if President Trump is not directly involved  —   is fraught with problems, with even some Republican observers questioning whether the brothers can steer clear of trouble, regardless of their intentions. Even with no new foreign deals, the company is in a position to get tax breaks and other business inducements from state and local officials. While such incentives are hardly unusual for growing businesses, with this family business they will unavoidably raise questions of whether different players involved might be seeking special White House favors. “People are going to offer them sweetheart deals,” said Peter Schweizer, the conservative author whose book “Clinton Cash” argued, among other things, that Mrs. Clinton had used her position as secretary of state to favor donors to the foundation. “It is just the way it works, as it comes down to the fact that people want access to national leaders in the country, and unfortunately in the past, be it Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Roger Clinton, relatives become vehicles to accomplishing that,” Mr. Schweizer added, referring to relatives in past administrations who drew scrutiny because of their business activities. The two oldest brothers have worked in various roles at the Trump Organization for much of their adult lives, but without their father’s daily presence  —   and with the departure of Ivanka from the company offices  —   their responsibilities have grown. Eric Trump, 33, oversees construction and says he, not his father, is now the named officer on hundreds of Trump companies. Don Jr. 39, is in charge of commercial leasing, as well as many of the remaining companies. And while they share a certain      look, their personalities are distinct. Don Jr. the Trump child with the clearest memory of the divorce that split up his family, is the most publicly confident, and the most politically conservative. Eric appears more cautious, more worried about how what he says will be perceived. Yet neither is particularly shy. “There has never been a Trump that is introverted,” Eric said, laughing. What is it like  —   after a lifetime as the sons of Donald Trump, and now business executives in their own right, and even   in a reality television show  —   to be the sons of the president of the United States? “It’s bigger, it’s bigger,” Eric said, struggling for the right word, then turning to a superlative, a habit inherited from his father. “This is really the biggest thing in the world. ” For all the talk of its global reach, the Trump Organization still has a family feel to it. The small offices assigned to Eric, Ivanka and Don Jr. are lined up in a row, with Ivanka’s, like her father’s, sitting unused since she left the company and moved to Washington with her husband, Jared Kushner, who is serving as a senior White House adviser. During the recent snowstorm in New York  —   with schools closed for the day  —   Don Jr. who has five children, had his    daughter in the office, sharing breakfast sent up from a restaurant downstairs. Trump Tower, by and large, seems back to normal since the building’s most famous resident moved to Washington, though Secret Service agents are still stationed in the Trump Organization lobby and elsewhere. Just days before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump announced plans to resign from hundreds of entities he controls and place his assets in a trust. The move drew sharp criticism from ethics lawyers, who said the move was window dressing because Mr. Trump, as sole beneficiary of the trust, still owns the assets, benefits financially from any money they might make and will quite likely get updates, Eric said, roughly every quarter on the financial health of the company. Still, President Trump assigned control of the trust to Don Jr. and Mr. Weisselberg, with Eric as the sole member of what he described as an advisory council. The three men have to vote unanimously, Eric said, to make decisions regarding new deals and other major business decisions. To Don Jr. everything the company does these days seems to breed controversy. Much of it he says is unwarranted. For instance, people have questioned why corporate records in Delaware do not show that the president has resigned from his companies registered there. Eric says that he has, but that it can take more than a year for records there to be updated. And the brothers expressed irritation that their presence at their father’s announcement of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy provoked media reports that they were not honoring the agreement to stay clear of White House matters. In fact, they said, they were in Washington to visit the new Trump hotel in the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue and stopped by to say hello to their father and share in the historic moment. Don Jr. said he knew his father was busy, and had called him only once since his inauguration. Eric said he talked to his father “a few” times a week. But he insisted he knew which lines not to cross. “In the next four years, do I ever expect him to say: ‘Hey, how’s Turnberry? How’s the new green? How’s the new 10th tee? ’” Eric said. In a case like this, he said, he would probably say, “Dad, it’s great” and “The property looks awesome. ” He continued: “Am I ever going to say: ‘Listen. Hey, we have a tax issue’? No, no, no. There’s a difference. ” Recently the brothers stripped most of the photographs of their father and even his signature from the Trump Organization’s marketing material. And the new Scion hotel chain, which the company will brand and manage, does not feature the Trump name. Eric said they were hoping to locate Scion, offering a   alternative to their Trump International Hotel brand, in large to midsize “trendy” cities like Austin, Tex. Charlotte, N. C. and Nashville. One of the first Scion locations, Eric said, could be Dallas, where the brothers and their executive team are evaluating possible sites. They are in talks with a possible partner, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, a developer based in Texas who had previously considered projects with the Trump Organization in Iraq and Turkey, where he was born. Though the company runs the risk of becoming entangled with foreign partners on projects in the United States, and might have to deal with the suspicion that it got tax breaks and other incentives from local governments because of its ties to the White House, company officials say they decided not to stop domestic expansion because it is creating jobs for Americans. The Trump Organization said it had dropped a host of proposed projects overseas, including Trump Office Buenos Aires in Argentina Trump Towers Rio and Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, both in Brazil Trump International Hotel  Tower Baku in Azerbaijan Trump Tower Batumi in Georgia and Trump Riverwalk in Pune, India. Other deals still in the conceptual stage  —   including a possible office building in Dubai and towers in Australia, China, Israel and Vietnam  —   have also been shelved. “I was the first person to raise my hand and say you should not do certain deals, as I understood the optics, as you can’t build the tallest building in Tel Aviv and try to negotiate peace in the Middle East,” Eric said. He estimated that the company had canceled a billion dollars’ worth of deals  —   although this estimate could not be confirmed independently. Still, the company will continue to see through the dozen projects that the brothers say were underway before Inauguration Day and so do not qualify as new. They include two resorts in Indonesia Trump Tower Mumbai and a Trump tower in Gurgaon, also in India Trump Tower Punta del Este in Uruguay and a second golf club in Dubai, as well as the Dominican Republic resort, which was started in 2007 but stalled during the financial crisis. “That doesn’t mean the deal doesn’t continue to exist,” Eric said, amid the criticism last week that the project was a “new deal. ” Another Trump property in the ethical spotlight lately is    the oceanside estate turned private club in Palm Beach, Fla. that the president is styling as his winter White House. Mr. Trump arrived there again on Friday for a golfing visit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “There should be no intermingling of White House and business operations,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, who is troubled whether the president hosts the Japanese prime minister for free  —   at a commercial operation  —   or charges him, which would mean a foreign government official is paying Mr. Trump’s family. “There should be no intermingling of his private moneys with public affairs. ” Eric dismissed the questions as meaningless, comparing    to the Crawford, Tex. ranch of former President George W. Bush. He said his father was without peer when it came to forging friendships on the golf course, and his eyes grew wide as he talked about the family resort’s potentially becoming a place where world alliances are struck. To the Trump family, that mixing of business and officialdom  —   at least when it comes to their father’s visits  —   is just fine. “If he could do that with Putin, if he could do that with some of these horrible actors around the world who only want to compromise us as a country, and he can make them friends and they can have trust in one another, he just did something that not many presidents have been able to do,” Eric said.",0
1246,THIS Is Why Most Analysts’ Gold & Silver Price Forecasts Are Wrong,"THIS Is Why Most Analysts’ Gold & Silver Price Forecasts Are Wrong Posted on Home » Silver » Silver News » THIS Is Why Most Analysts’ Gold & Silver Price Forecasts Are Wrong 
What Has Been The Real Driver Of The Gold & Silver Price? 

From SRSRocco : 
Precious metals investors are being misled by most analysts’ price forecasts because they do not understand the critical underlying fundamental value mechanism. Furthermore, there seems to be a great deal of animosity from the short-term trading analysts who view many in the precious metals community as pandering hype and conspiracies. 
One of these analysts is Avi Gilburt of the Elliottwavetrader site. He criticizes the “Gold bugs” in a few of his more recent articles, Who Do You Allow Yourself To Be Manipulated , Did Your Mother Write An Article On Gold , and Damn Manipulators . 
Feel free to check out these articles as Avi Gilburt condemns those precious metals analysts who continue to regurgitate the “manipulation” theme over and over. On the other hand, Avi truly believes the value of the metals, and other commodities are based upon looking at the “tea leaves” or studying “goat entrails” as it pertains to the Elliott Wave theory . 
Most certainly, he will defend the Elliott Wave theory to the death. While I admire that sort of conviction, Avi Gilburt is just as guilty in his forecasting of the “value” of gold and silver just as much as the precious metals community that he constantly criticizes. 
That being said, there is a difference between the two camps, in my opinion. While I am frustrated with the precious metals community in their lack of understanding of the true value of gold and silver, the short-term trading analysts such as Avi Gilburt and Dan Norcini are quite vicious in their critiques. 
This is also true for CPM Group’s Jeff Christian. I heard from a source that when Jeff Christian was a part of a precious metals round table, when the question was posed to the group to the number of individuals who believed the metals were being manipulated, he blurted out, “Anyone in this group that follows my work, YOU BETTER NOT RAISE YOUR HAND.” Now, that isn’t the exact remark… but close enough. 
The subject of precious metals manipulation is quite complex, so I’d rather not get into it in this article. However, I will show where the precious metals community and the short-term trading analysts are incorrect in their approach for forecasting the value of gold and silver. What Has Been The Real Driver Of The Gold & Silver Price 
Even though I have discussed this in prior articles, new information confirms my analysis. While most economists, traders and the those in the precious metals community believe that “Supply & Demand” have been the leading factor in determining the value of gold or silver , it’s not, rather it has always been the “ENERGY FACTOR.” 
Here is an updated chart showing the relationship between the price of silver and oil since 1900: 
As you can see, the price of silver and oil remained flat (on the chart) until 1971. Actually, the price of oil and silver stayed below $2.00 (except for a few years) from 1900-1970. When President Nixon dropped the Gold-Dollar peg in 1971, this significantly changed the value of the precious metals and oil. 
Even though the movement of the oil and silver price are not exactly related, we can definitely see a high degree of correlation. Thus, as the price of oil skyrocketed in the 1970’s, so did the price of silver. Moreover, the same thing took place in 2000-2016. 
Does Avi Gilburt have a chart showing this to his members? I doubt it. Of course, the short-term price movements of silver and oil are not as precise as the longer term valuations shown in the chart above, but we can clearly see that the forces of “Supply & Demand” are less of factor than the changing value of oil. 
This is also true for gold. This chart shows the price of gold versus oil since 1940: 
Again, we can clearly see that the price of gold and oil remained flat-lined until 1971. As the oil price shot up in the 1970’s, so did the gold price. When the oil price declined and stayed low in the 1980’s and 90’s, so did the value of gold. However, as the price of oil surged to $112 in 2012 from $20 in 1999, so did the value of gold. Gold jumped from $279 in 2000 to $1669 in 2012. 
There’s no coincidence that the value of oil and gold jumped 500+% from 2000-2012. While the silver price jumped seven times from $4.95 in 2000, to $35 in 2012, its current price is 3.5 times higher than 2000 and gold is 4.5 times higher. 
Which means, there are more factors in determining the gold and silver price than just the metals relationship with the oil price. That being said, supply and demand factors play a “ROLE” in impacting the price of gold and silver… BUT ONLY AS A MINOR PART compared to the overriding oil price dynamics. 
What I am saying here is this… the value of gold and silver has been, and will continue to be tied to the oil price dynamics, however, supply and demand factors are contributor… BUT TO A MUCH LESSER DEGREE. Gold & Silver Bullion Are Beginning To Disconnect To The Value Of Oil 
Something interesting has happened recently in the price movement of gold and silver… they seem to be now disconnecting from the value of oil. If we take a look at the two gold and silver charts below, we can see that as the price of oil has remained flat in 2015-2016, the gold and silver price has turned higher, especially the gold price: 
While the gold price has jumped up higher than the silver price (in relative terms), they are both moving up as the oil price remains flat. To understand why this is happening, I have to explain two KEY FUNCTIONS; Market Sentiment The Coming Oil Price Crash 
Short-term trading analysts suggest that “Market Sentiment” plays a role in determining the price of a commodity, stock or bond. While I would agree with them to a small degree, they are correct for the wrong reason. 
Let me explain this as it pertains to the value of gold and silver. At the beginning of the year, the stock market crashed 2,000 points quickly, so investors moved into gold and silver in a big way, especially the institutional investors who bought the Gold ETFs. So, the “Knee-Jerk” reaction by most traders and investors is that market sentiment turned around and the movement of funds into gold and silver pushed up their price. 
Again, I agree with that on principle, but for a very different reason. “Market Sentiment”, as it is used as a tool for determining the price of gold and silver, is only working to the extent that it is “WAKING UP INVESTORS TO THE TRUE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE”, but just for a brief period of time. 
You have to think of precious metals market sentiment similar to when a spouse believes their partner might be having an affair. When something very suspicions happens, the spouse gets very angry and the partner tries to calm them down by giving a reason (excuse) why is not true. So, in a few days, the spouse believes the partner and everything calms down. 
This type of “UP & DOWN” sentiment continues in the relationship causing a great deal of volatility in the marriage. However, one day, the spouse finally catches the partner in the act and the TRUTH finally comes out. Then there is no more lies, deceit, excuses or manipulation of the facts to keep the spouse believing that everything is fine. The spouse has now taken the RED PILL, so to speak, and cannot unlearn what they now know. 
This is a perfect example of what is taking place as it pertains to “MARKET SENTIMENT” in the precious metals market. When investors start to get fearful or extremely worried about the Stock & Bond markets, they rush into the precious metals… for a brief period of time. 
When the Fed and Central Banks pump Trillions of Dollars of liquidity into the financial system, they bring calm back into the markets easing investors fear and worry. Thus, gold and silver demand declines. 
Unfortunately, this is a game that is hiding the truth. So, when investors finally realize the Stock and Bond Market are the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history, the MAD RUSH into the metals will begin. 
Now, the reason the Stock and Bond Market are nothing more than HOT AIR and the typical Ponzi Scheme, can be seen in this chart by Louis Arnoux: 
The value of U.S. GDP per head, in Oil & Gold all went up together until 1970. While U.S. GDP has continued higher and higher, we can clearly see that the gold and oil (red & blue color) trend lines behaved much different;y. I would advise watching my Thermodynamic Collapse Interview with Dr. Louis Arnoux to explain the details: 
However, the only way for real wealth to be generated, it has to coincide with the value of gold and oil. Unfortunately, the value of gold and oil in GDP per head for each American crashed (2012), while stated GDP continued to record territory. 
Thus, the real GDP value reported by the U.S. Government is highly inflated. This is based on understanding the “Thermodynamic Oil Collapse” and its impact on the entire global economy. According to Louis Arnoux and the Hills Group work, the price of oil will continue to crash to a MAXIMUM PRICE of $12 by 2020. 
This is due to their calculation of the “Remaining Value” of oil in a barrel. You have to think about it like an automobile. When the car is brand new, the value is say, $30,000. However, after 15 years, the car is only worth $5,000. The economic value of that car has been “DEPLETED. ” While it still works, the 15 year-old car does not contain the same “embedded” energy as a brand new car…. so the value is much less. 
The Hills Group ETP oil model has calculated that the value of a barrel of oil is behaving similar to a used car. The costs of producing a barrel of oil is so high now, when we consider the entire Oil Industry & Support Systems”, there won’t be much value left to the Globalized Industrial World in five years. 
I will be writing more on this going forward as gold and silver investors will benefit the most as the Thermodynamic Oil Collapse goes over the cliff. Why Will The Value Of Gold & Silver Surge When Most Everything Else Implodes 
While the oil price has been the leading driver in the value of Gold & Silver for more than a century, it is beginning to disconnect. Why? Because the gold and silver price have been valued as “commodities”, rather than as “high-quality stores of value.” 
I will be writing an article showing this more in detail, however total Global Assets are estimated to be $373 trillion, according to a report by Savills World Research. The majority of those assets are real estate…. mostly residential real estate. 
As the price of oil continues lower and lower, it will destroy the value of most Stocks, Bonds and Real Estate. These assets only derive their value from burning more energy each year. However, the cost to produce a barrel of oil has become so high now, there isn’t much value left over to support the $373 trillion in global assets. 
Which means, the collapse in the price of oil, will be the FACTOR that finally wakes up the world that they have been investing in the wrong assets. It will be the MOTHER OF ALL MARKET SENTIMENT moves. 
I gather Avi Gilburt will discard this article as just another complete waste of time, but he is undoubtedly blind to the oil-energy dynamics. So, I would bet my bottom Silver Dollar that Avi will continue to read the tea leaves and goat entrails of the Elliott Wave Theory right up until the point the system disintegrates. And maybe he should, because when the PHAT LADY SINGS, he will have to find some other occupation. Buy 90% Junk Silver Coins at SD Bullion As Low As $2.19/oz Over Spot!",0
1247,How Far Are We from War with Russia Over Syria?,"  
OK you Russians! No more gentle American diplomacy! No more Mr. Nice Guy! So thundered US Secretary of State John Kerry last week. 
Right on cue, the usually overwrought US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, blasted the Russians as ‘barbaric’ for their bombing campaign in Syria. She made no mention of the US using B-52 and B-1 heavy bombers as well as killer drones in Afghanistan. The lapdog US and British media were quick to run anguished pictures of Syrian babies but we saw narry a picture of an injured Afghan child. 
Noble Peace Prize winner, Barack Obama, ducked and left Washington’s growing anti-Russian jihad to his aides while he flew off to Israel for the state funeral of the Shimon Peres, by now sainted by media as Israel’s ‘man of peace.’ In fact, Peres was the father of Israel’s nuclear weapons programs. 
Under Peres’ auspices, Israel secretly offered nuclear warheads and then Jericho missiles to the embattled South African apartheid government. This was ironic because Israel has been insisting that Iran – which does not have nuclear weapons – will proliferate them around the globe. 
Back in Washington, just about everyone is now ignoring lame duck Obama and doing their own thing. Recently, the Pentagon, which has no use for Obama, likely sabotaged joint US-Russians plan to end the bloody Syrian civil war by bombing a Syrian Army camp and killing close to 100 Syrian troops. ‘Ooops, sorry, a mistake’ explained the Pentagon. 
More Russian warplanes are on the way to Syria. Ominously, Moscow just warned the US not to attack Russian military forces. Hillary Clinton’s supporters keep urging a so-called US-imposed ‘no fly zone’ in Syria, which is code for the US Air Force blowing Syria’s and Russia’s warplanes out of the skies and going after command control of Syria’s anti-aircraft systems. Which could be code for World War III. 
Part of the reason for this intensified bellicosity is that Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air power, are making important if bloody progress in their siege of rebel-held sections of Aleppo. 
At the same time, Turkey is decreasing its five-year old support for Syria’s rebels, including the al-Qaida allied Nusra Front (new relabled Jabhat Fateh al-Sham). The Saudis and Gulf emirates, who are financing much of the civil war, are hard up for cash. All sides in this bitter five-year old conflict are exhausted and war-weary. Once lovely Syria lies in ruins. For the extreme Sunni insurgents their best hope is direct US military intervention. They are waiting for the hawkish Hillary Clinton. 
Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed this week that Washington is protecting the Nusra Front as its ‘Plan B’ for Syria. He also asserted that the US will install Nusra in Damascus in the event that President Assad’s government falls. But the majority of Syrians and all its minorities would be bitterly opposed to being ruled by fanatical Wahabi Islamists. 
This writer believes the US has long aided ISIS and still sees it as a potent weapon against the Assad government. Why else would it take the US and its Arab and Kurdish foot soldiers so long to move against ISIS strongholds at Raqqa and Mosul– which are, as this writer knows, only a taxi-ride away? ISIS is a rag-tag bunch of 20-something amateur Rambos, not the Wehrmacht. 
One likely answer is that imperial Washington is totally confused over whom to support and how to do it. The bewildering fracas between Sunnis, Shia, Kurds, Arabs, Yazidis, assorted Christians, ISIS wildmen, egged on the US, Israel, Turkey, Russia, France, Britain, Lebanon, Jordan, the oil Arabs is just too much for Washington’s ill-educated, or often downright dim policy makers. 
This writer has long believed that certain elements in Washington helped create ISIS as a potentially useful tool against non-obedient Mideast regimes, notably Syria and Libya. Israel, which whispers a lot into Washington’s ears, did the same thing by encouraging the growth of Hezbollah and Hamas as enemies of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Today, they are Israel’s toughest enemies, not the utterly corrupt regimes that run the Arab world. 
The bright idea to overthrow Syria’s recognized government goes back to that Father of Disasters, George W. Bush. He planned to attack Syria with Israel. Bush was restrained when no suitable Syrian opposition group could be found to install in power. The Sunni opposition was mainly Muslim Brotherhood, a name that spooked Washington. So Washington waited until 2011 to ‘regime change’ disobedient Syria.  ",0
1248,"In Israel, Lauding and Lamenting the Era of Trump - The New York Times","JERUSALEM  —   Many Israelis are buoyed by signs that President Trump will be a friend to Israel. But the recent wave of toppled tombstones and threats against Jewish centers in the United States has at least as many worrying that his rise may also not be good for Jews. “Jews in America, that’s supposed to work,” said Einat Wilf, a former member of the Knesset for the   Labor Party. “To have these instances, is that an aberration? Or has the American president unleashed forces  —   willingly, unwillingly, consciously, unconsciously  —   but maybe he has unleashed forces that will challenge the place of Jews in America?” Israelis have grown used to rising nationalism in Europe that has fed  . But many have looked to the United States, home to the largest number of Jews outside Israel, as a relative refuge from   not another front for it. Few here suggest that has permanently changed (though the Labor Party leader, Isaac Herzog, recently said Israel should prepare for a wave of American immigrants). But worry spans left and right, even if they disagree on exactly how much to blame Mr. Trump, who is seen here as growing more confusing by the day. What to make of a president who, on the same day, denounced the   attacks but also suggested  —   in remarks widely covered here  —   that they might have been carried out by his own enemies? There is the Mr. Trump whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described in their meeting in February: “There is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump,” he said, citing personal ties of decades and agreement on many policies, including the perils of Iran and of Islamic extremism. There is also the Mr. Trump in the photograph on the front page of Israel’s leading newspaper. “Living in Fear in His Country,” read the headline in the newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, previewing a   special section to Friday’s weekend supplement on “the new America” with “swastikas, desecration of tombstones, curses and threats. ” Reuven and Negina Abrahamov, grocery owners outside Tel Aviv, are Trump supporters and disturbed by what they see in United States. “It’s a combination of racism and violence, and I’m not sure it’s directly related to Trump,” said Mr. Abrahamov, 43. “This could be just what America is. ” “Of course it’s related to Trump,” Ms. Abrahamov, 40, answered. “Now that Trump came into power, all he does is support Israel. And I do not think Trump is someone who plays a double game. He just goes with his truth the whole way. ” “But in this case, his truth screws over Jews, and it also might screw over Israel,” she said. It is causing a particular quandary for Mr. Netanyahu, who is charged with guiding the relationship, always deep and complicated, with Israel’s closest ally. “The unenviable challenge facing the Israeli government is how to express its visceral horror over the resurgence of   in the U. S. without becoming a pawn in America’s partisan debate or jeopardizing its critical working relationship with the administration,” said Shalom Lipner, a former Israeli official and now a nonresident senior fellow with the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. At a time of weakness for Mr. Netanyahu, amid several corruption investigations, he has found both political renewal and common cause with Mr. Trump. Many who share Mr. Netanyahu’s politics thought that, finally, Israel had an American president who was an unconditional friend. Mr. Trump initially promised to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, long a dream of many Israelis but opposed by Palestinians as a de facto recognition of Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war. And Mr. Trump at first remained conspicuously silent as Mr. Netanyahu announced thousands of new Israeli settler units in the occupied West Bank and pushed through a contentious law granting retroactive legality to thousands of Israeli houses built on Palestinian property. But the president has distanced himself somewhat since then, raising questions about whether he would ultimately toe a more traditional American line on critical Israeli issues. The embassy move has been postponed at a minimum. At a news conference during their meeting, Mr. Trump publicly asked Mr. Netanyahu to “hold back on the settlements. ” At that same news conference, other apparent divisions rose: Mr. Trump pointedly refused to denounce   sentiment among some of his supporters  —   and the next day he similarly refused, as he berated a religious Jewish reporter who asked a question about it. In turn, the prime minister faced much criticism here for being reluctant to take his own public stand against   in the United States  —   apparently not wishing to anger Mr. Trump, or perhaps willing to give a pass, of sorts, to a sympathetic conservative. Mr. Netanyahu did, however, speak out on Wednesday, after Mr. Trump used the opening of his speech in Congress to denounce the attacks and threats. “  certainly has not disappeared. But there is much we can do to fight back,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a videotaped address, praising Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who has also spoken out against the attacks. Still, this has been a jarring time for Israelis of all political beliefs. Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident and head of the Jewish Agency, said he did not blame Mr. Trump for the attacks, even if, he said, the president is “clearly a reflection” of rising nationalism generally. And while Mr. Sharansky said he was also troubled by the White House’s failure to mention Jews in its statement this year on Holocaust Remembrance Day, he repeated his contention that   was not solely a problem of the right. “We saw a lot of this     feelings in the last 15 to 20 years,” he said. “And a lot of people were trying to separate it from the   of the right. In fact, this difference is erasing itself. ” Joni   61, moved here nearly 40 years ago from the United States and does not recall   as a problem, she said. Now vandals have toppled graves in the cemetery in St. Louis where her grandparents and many other members of her family are buried. “It validates that there should be an Israel, if these things can happen in the States,” she said. Otherwise, she described her emotions as “very complicated. ” She has maintained her American passport and cast her ballot for Hillary Clinton. Yet she hopes Mr. Trump will fulfill his promises to broker a deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. “However,” she added, “I am still shocked by what he says every day. ”",0

1250,"Christie Lists NJ Mansion on Airbnb, Becomes an Uber Driver","  ""We all need to look ourselves in the mirror,"" says Christie 
Trenton, NJ - After the great ""purge"" of NJ Governor Chris Christie and his cronies from Donald Trump's presidential transition team, Christie has started his new career as an Uber driver. 
Originally Christie hoped for the vice presidential nod, and then a cabinet position. But after being purged by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, from Trump's inner circle, Christie thought he would serve America and the Trump administration best by becoming an Uber driver. 
Christie purchased the Uber Medallion for $300,000 from the Port Authority of NY & NJ, in a reported deal to forget about Bridgegate, ""like it never happened."" Christie denied the reciprocal deal, but held up his Uber Medallion for all to see. 
""Here is my ticket to freedom!"" he reportedly said. 
Meanwhile, Christie's wife, Mary Pat, has listed the NJ Governor's mansion on Airbnb for rentals of up to ""one year"". 
Insiders state that Christie is ""livid"" that he will not be a part of the Trump cabinet but hopes that a cabinet member will need his Uber driving services or at least stay overnight at his mansion. 
Having put Kushner's father in jail as an overly zealous prosecutor who targeted Democrats solely to advance his political career, Christie did himself no favors, says one insider. 
Mary Pat Christie rolled her eyes at the reporters, stating, ""He's got 22 percent approval rating, the embarrassing Bridgegate scandal, and his idol Bruce Springsteen thinks he is pathetic. What more? Just leave us alone. We need to make a living too, and Chris is already coming home every night and crying himself to sleep."" 
On his first trip out, Christie drove his green Pinto over a curb into the sunset, and his car was completely filled with junk, including pictures of himself hugging President Obama, Time Magazine covers about elephants, toilet bowl plungers, a sleeping bag, pillows, and multiple bags of laundry. 
Christie ignored reporters' questions and looked at himself in the rear view mirror of the car as he put on his cabbie cap. He sped off the wrong way down a one-way street, just missing a motorcyclist, while giving the NY Times reporter behind him the middle finger.

1251,"Price for a Green Card: $500,000 Stadium Stake - The New York Times","ORLANDO, Fla.  —   For years, sports teams have tried to defray the   costs of their new stadiums by asking fans to pay thousands for personal seat licenses that entitle them to buy season tickets. Flávio Augusto da Silva is taking the concept further. In what may be the first deal of its kind, Mr. da Silva, the majority owner of Orlando City of Major League Soccer, is asking investors from Brazil, China and elsewhere to pay $500, 000 each for a stake in the stadium he is building near downtown Orlando. In return, the foreign investors receive annual dividends, two season tickets and something even more valuable: a green card that allows them, their spouses and sometimes even their children to live and work in the United States. The visa offer is legal, and it uses a    federal program, known as   that is under renewed scrutiny in Congress. Created in 1990, the program was intended to help pay for infrastructure projects in rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods. After bank lending dried up in the last recession, developers turned to the program to finance hotels, condominiums and other projects from Manhattan to Miami. As a result, the number of   visas awarded grew to almost 9, 000 last year, from fewer than 100 in 2003. Mr. da Silva, though, is building a $156 million stadium, not a   building or a shopping mall, and he is marketing to foreigners not because lending is tight, but because lawmakers in Florida would not provide subsidies for the stadium in the Parramore neighborhood of Orlando. “For us, it was a business decision,” said Mr. da Silva, who expects to raise about half the construction cost through the    program. “There was already demand from people who want to move to the U. S. have a green card and have a good opportunity to participate in the growth of the club. ” Orlando City’s use of the visa program, which was criticized by a leading Republican in March as “riddled with corruption and national security vulnerabilities,” is a new approach for sports teams looking for ways to pay for stadiums without financial support from local communities, where officials are under pressure from voters opposed to using public money to help wealthy owners.   financing helped pay for infrastructure work connected to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but not for the arena itself. Developers previously tried to use the   program to finance   projects in California, Florida and elsewhere, but they hit roadblocks, including the unpredictable pace of getting   investors approved for projects that often have to be opened on specific timelines. The Orlando project features a   stadium, scheduled to open for the 2017 seasons of both Orlando City S. C. and the Orlando Pride, the women’s team that Mr. da Silva owns with his partner Phil Rawlins. Originally, the city and county agreed to subsidize the project. But when state lawmakers balked at approving a sales tax rebate, Mr. da Silva turned to the   program, something Orlando’s mayor, Buddy Dyer, cheered. The team’s solution “ended up being a    for everybody,” Mr. Dyer said in his office near the 10.  building site, where the skeleton of the stadium is taking shape. “What I tell other mayors is that I’m the happiest mayor in America, and I go through the whole litany, including soccer. ” Mr. da Silva knew about the   program because he obtained his own green card in 2009 by investing in a   project in Vermont. While the strongest demand for   visas is from China, Mr. da Silva, who made a fortune  —   his net worth was $444 million in 2014, according to Forbes Brasil  —   building a chain of   schools in his native Brazil, decided to single out his countrymen. Brazilians are   and some even follow Orlando City, whose games are broadcast in Brazil and who are led by Kaká, a World Cup winner for Brazil and a former world player of the year. Mr. da Silva’s sales pitch has benefited from several years of political and economic turmoil in Brazil, where some of the country’s elite are rushing to move money offshore. The club said it had already attracted 30 investors, bringing in $15 million, or 10 percent of the project’s cost. Mr. Rawlins, the team’s founder and president, said about $5 million in new commitments is secured each month. “I don’t know why people haven’t taken more advantage of it, because it’s a perfect thing when you’re building a stadium,” Mr. Rawlins said of the visa program. “The program is really about economic development. ” Mark Abbott, deputy commissioner of M. L. S. said the league had reviewed the financing proposal and found it “innovative. ” “The league doesn’t permit this type of financing for clubs,” Mr. Abbott said, “but for stadium projects, we thought it was appropriate. ” In addition to their stakes in the company that runs the stadium, investors in the project receive two club seats for 10 seasons. (The investors have no control over the team itself, which is part of a separate company.) But Mr. da Silva and others did not dispute that the visas were the real draw. Using the   program, though, can be complicated because the construction site must be in an area with high unemployment. To qualify, boundaries are sometimes gerrymandered to create an economically challenged (but essentially manufactured) neighborhood. Developers also must spend millions of their own money to start the construction because it can take months and even years for the government to approve each   visa. Visa applicants must pass a background check and prove that the project is viable and will create at least 10 jobs for each visa issued. The visas can be made permanent after a   probationary period. Some financial advisers recommend that foreigners who are considering putting $500, 000 into a real estate project choose a hotel, mall or other more certain venture  —   anything but a sports stadium, whose main tenant could have unpredictable results. “When these guys win games and championships, great, but if they’re not, that cash flow could change,” said Michael Gibson, who helps foreigners invest in   projects. “Why invest in that when you can invest in something steadier?” It is unclear how long other sports franchise owners will have the   program as a financing option. It is facing new questions on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are trying to close loopholes that allowed money to be steered from projects in needy areas toward wealthier districts. Some    projects have turned into boondoggles, producing little or no economic benefit. In other cases, foreign investors have accused developers of misspending their money and not paying promised returns. For now, opponents of the program have been unable to get the votes to overhaul or eliminate it, so other teams may be able to follow the path Orlando City has blazed. In M. L. S. alone, a group led by David Beckham, the former soccer star from England, has been trying to assemble a plan for a stadium in Miami, and the owners of teams in New York, Los Angeles and Washington are in various stages of the same process.",0

1253,Why Standing Rock Matters,"Right to Clean Water & The Fight Against Eminent Domain Images come from the great video coverage of TYT, Democracy Now!, and Unicorn Riot By Jamie Poulos / filmsforaction.org 
The 3.8 billion dollar Dakota Access Pipeline project that has been the subject of controversy, encapsulates some of the main social problems facing society at this time: A justice system that b enefits corporate interests, often at the expense of true progress. Police increasingly being m ilitarized and civil liberties being eroded to protect the powerful! In addition to these issues, you have the determined continuation of a failed energy policy. Pipeline and oil projects are being given the green light without proper assessment of ecological, cultural, and social costs. The protesters want to protect our water, their land, and the sacred heritage sites of the Native Americans. 
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ), predicts that by 2040 water demand will surpass supply by 40% . This will obviously affect the poorest most. The project has been halted next to the Missouri River and if allowed to continue the drinking water of the area will be threatened. Of course the most disenfranchised groups will suffer the most, mainly the Native Americans. The protesters make up a diverse group , comprising many indigenous peoples, environmentalist, and local farmers.They believe in the justice of their cause, so much so, that they endure extreme encounters from local police force. Dogs, rubber bullets, tear gas, and unfair arrest have been used to intimidate and deter protests. A militarized local police force has not only arrested hundreds of people on false accusations, but have used their position of authority to humiliate those they detain . Daughter of an indigenous leader was targeted, thrown into prison, and forced to sleep naked . Others arrested, were put into dog kennels and numbered . One farmer was arrested on her own land! Technically, according to the Treaty of 1851 , the contested land is actually belonging to the Native Americans. By proclaiming eminent domain the pipeline company has taken over property belonging to other people, including local farmers. Many can not afford to fight the legal battles needed to keep the construction of the pipeline off their own property! When directly asked about the aggressive police force used against peaceful protesters, President Obama placed responsibility on both sides. The aggressive and highly militarized responses of police has been well documented over the past months. This isn’t a two sided story as far as social justice is concerned. However, in the Pay to Play global system of today, there is another side. CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, Kelcy Warren, has donated heavily to politicians, local government, and various oversight boards. Could this be one reason their project is receiving the amount and extent of local protection? The oil and gas industry has spent a total of 88 MILLION dollars lobbying this year alone! Why? Subsidies and favorable legislation. While fact and science are not on the industries’ side, money is. The Huffington Post recently wrote an article placing Standing Rock into the larger framework of what is happening nationwide. Since the Keystone XL controversy, government agencies have been approving project after project without completing the necessary environmental risk analysis. Advocates of the pipeline emphasize the unlikelihood of any leak or spill occurring. Yet, oil spills and pipeline explosions happen often and go under or unreported. Think Progress published an article stating that over 300 oil spills went unreported within a two year period. Tens of t housands of gallons of oil are allowed to spill without it receiving any attention. James Sutton, from The Hill Talk , notes that from May to June 2016 over 20 oil spills in the US alone went unreported . There are many who criticize the current regulation system which places to much trust in companies. Oil companies are responsible for estimating how much oil has spilled and are then fined per gallon. Needless to say, the damage is often much more than they are readily willing to admit. Another argument often used in favor of this project and others like it, is job creation. The only logical step is to create an energy policy that would force investment into renewable energy . In the documentary Before the Flood we are shown a Tesla Gigafactory. Elon Musk claims 100 such mega battery factories could well remove our reliance on fossil fuels. The industry of oil and coal isn’t about creating jobs; it is all about socializing risks and privatizing profits. Not only do certain industries add to the problems of global warming, but they actively deter alternatives . The documentary Who Killed the Electric Car , is a great example of this. By demanding a strict policy forcing a shift to sustainable energy we would be creating far more jobs and slashing the cost of energy. The Green New Deal proposed by Jill Stein is a good starting point for political dialogue. Scientist across disciplines and from all over the World have warned that we are moving closer and closer to a point of no return. We have the technology to reverse this. Do we have the will? We need a major shift in consciousness to begin to solve the pressing issues of our time. This begins with the individual. It need not be a daunting task: One Step",0

Everything is being done to convince the public that Russia wants war; that it has annexed Ukraine; that it will attack Western Europe; that it will crush the Baltic states and Poland in its advance; that it’s committing war crimes in Syria; that Assad is a dictator and a butcher; that he has met peaceful demands for reform with brutal repression; that those fighting Assad are moderate rebels; that he is dropping barrel bombs on civilians. Why are they lying? Because the people don’t want war: they want jobs and bread. They will not agree to murder people who have done them no harm. They will consent to war if told they are under attack or that the war will save other people from genocide, rape, or other gross violations of human rights. The people are not interested in world domination, but the elite are. The people are, therefore, the enemy within. They must be persuaded to support the elite’s plan by perverting their decency. They must be made to cringe in fear. They must be made to believe that war—any war—will be defensive. This is the tactic of terrorists: terrorizing the population to obtain political ends. Hillary Clinton is lying: a no-fly zone in Syria will not “save lives.” In her last presidential debate, Clinton said that she wants a no-fly zone in Syria because it will “save lives”: “I’m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria, not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.” The “leverage” she is seeking is Russian roulette with the planet. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, noted in response that a no-fly zone in Syria might trigger a war with Russia, a nuclear power. Neither does she believe that a no-fly zone will save lives. In a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013, Clinton said: “To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk—you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians.” She knows what is at stake with a no-fly zone in Syria, and yet she tells us the opposite of what she knows will happen. In other words, she’s lying. What has changed Clinton’s mind since 2013? In 2013, there was no need to risk nuclear war over Syria. The so-called Free Syrian Army and assorted rebel groups were doing just fine in their offensive. In 2013, Syria stood alone, apart from some Iranian assistance. Until 2015, the Assad government was on its last breath, in retreat from the provinces of Raqqa, Aleppo, Hama, Idlib, and Latakia. By September 2015, the generous financial, military, and operational support by the United States, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey to the “anti-Syrian coalition”– Islamic State, the Jabbat al-Nusra, the “Free Syrian Army”–was paying great dividends in advancing the destabilization of the Assad government. Soon, it could be expected that the symbolic head of Assad would sit on a silver platter in the White House, along with other colonial trophies. In their obsession to vilify Trump, who certainly deserves a lot of manure for his innumerable character flaws and vile political ideas, the Democrats and other liberals massing under Hillary’s “Big Tent”, have totally forgotten Hillary’s many crimes and also embraced the demonization of Putin and Russia, a different game altogether, and one with huge risks for humanity. The Orwellian assault on Russia is part of a filthy propaganda line floated by the warmongering Neocons Imperialists, of which Hillary is a card-carrying member. But self-righteous stupidity, and lopsided vision is the very trademark of Democratic party liberals and fellow water carriers. The saddest and most disturbing part of this abject campaign without precedent in its degree of filth even for American standards, is that even people who normally know better have embraced it, as this disgraceful cartoon by the normally lucid Dan Perkins (Tom Tomorrow comic strip) sadly proves. (Click image for best resolution). The humanitarian consequences for Syrians, however, were catastrophic. Fleeing the terror of a Syria in the clutches of cutthroat mercenary armies, refugees flooded Turkey, Jordan, Greece, and other countries, becoming human barter between Turkey and the European Union. The EU paid Turkey two billion euro to keep within its borders this human avalanche of “collateral damage.” That was the situation in September of 2015, when Russia, invited by the legitimate Syrian government, legitimately intervened in Syria with aircraft, support personnel, military advisors and equipment. In a year of Russian efforts to establish a premise for a peaceful solution in Syria by eliminating the militant rabble the Western chorus of “Assad must go” has mutated into a furious hiss of impotent rage. No one expects Assad to go now, unless the US comes up with a strategy to reverse the losses the Russian intervention has inflicted. In a year of Russian efforts to establish a premise for a peaceful solution in Syria by eliminating the militant rabble the Western chorus of “Assad must go” has mutated into a furious hiss of impotent rage. Enter Hillary’s reversal on the no-fly zone, which now, contrary to her judgment in 2013, will “save lives.” What is a no-fly zone? A no-fly zone is a coercive appropriation of the partial airspace of a sovereign country. It is the arbitrary creation of a demilitarized zone in the sky to prevent belligerent powers from flying in that air space. In Syria, the “belligerent power,” ironically, would be the internationally recognized legitimate Syrian government and its legitimate ally, Russia. According to former UN Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in an interview with John Pilger, a no-fly zone is illegal under international law. No-fly zones are post-Soviet inventions. The measure was never proposed, used, or authorized to this day by the UN Security Council until the Soviet Union virtually dissolved. This restraint was exercised by the US for the excellent reason that no such aggression on a sovereign state would have been tolerated without massive fuss at the UN Security Council and a bad rap for the US. There have been only three instances of a no-fly zone so far, all in the wake of the disappearance of the USSR: Iraq (1991-2003), Bosnia (1993-95), and Libya (2011), all initiated on the hypocritical pretense of “saving lives.” What is Plan B? I n one word: escalation. Apart from partitioning the air space of Syria, Plan B would provide for supplying, through Qatar or Saudi Arabia, man-portable air defense systems to the “moderate opposition,” including if it is acknowledged that the “moderate opposition” has allied itself openly with the al-Nusra front. Plan B has not been approved, but the media has floated a series of reports throughout October as being under consideration. On October 28, the New York Times published an astonishing conclusion about an aspect of the Obama administration’s strategy in Syria, though gently and benevolently worded. The Times indicated that it was being felt that Obama had insufficiently armed the “moderate opposition,” so that in Aleppo it had “no choice” but to partner with al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra) to fight off Putin and Assad. At the same time, Reuters noted that the Obama administration had formerly considered arming the “moderates” with anti-air missiles but was constrained by the fear that such weapons would fall in the hands of ”extremists.” Such reports suggest, rather boldly, I think, that “former restraint” might have to give way to greater support for the “moderate” militants, including if they partner with “extremists.” Thus, we arrive at a point of utter bewilderment in which we verify the absurdity of launching a War on Terror to end up fighting a War with Terror. Oppose US imperialism I t is good and proper that we should denounce Hillary Clinton for her vile record of regime change (in Honduras), crime of aggression (Libya), threats to Russia and China, corruption, illegality, and abuse of power. She’s clearly unfit to be president of any decent country that calls itself democratic. However, fixating on her individual agency lets the policy off the hook. The US is not yet a banana republic, in which the patriarch of some rich landowning family becomes the patriarch-autocrat of a country. An intricate network of powerful interests, which determine the policy, rules the US, frantic to maintain global economic and military dominance. This ruling class selects the candidate who will best carry out the policy. Hillary Clinton will be the servant of the interests of the ruling class of which she is a member. She will be their president. So it’s the policy that must be opposed, and this policy is imperialist. We must develop a principled opposition to this policy, without prevarications. The task falls on the left, but it cannot be a left divided by relativist consideration of “evil” on all sides. However we may feel about the morality of governments in Russia, China, Syria, Iran, etc., one thing is clear: they did not launch a war on Iraq, opening the door to all the crimes that followed from that original crime. It is time to decide whether we want to live with things as they are or change them. And we must begin by changing them at home.

1256,"When Dad’s Kind Birthday Gift For Ex-Wife Has His Friends Puzzled, He Explains Who It’s Really For","Share on Twitter 
On October 21, 2016, father of two Billy Flynn woke up early. He bought his ex-wife a bouquet of flowers, a card, and a gift, and he helped their kids make their mom breakfast for her birthday. 
Flynn was questioned about why he doing something nice for his ex-wife. This, he says on Facebook, annoys him. 
Warning: Graphic Language Loading Facebook Post... 
He writes, in part: 
“[I'm going to] break it down for you all. I'm raising two little men. The example I set for how I treat their mom is going to significantly shape how they see and treat women, and affect their perception of relationships.” 
Now don't get Flynn wrong, it hasn't always been this easy. In fact, he tells Independent Journal Review that it took him and his ex-wife a while to create a mutually respectful relationship. 
But as Flynn points out, when a divorce involves children, the well-being of those children is much more important than how the adults feel about each other. 
The proud father credits their two boys with inspiring them to work hard on their new relationship: 
""It definitely wasn't easy up front. I'd say it took us a good year to get it right. 
Divorce is hard and I think we all do and say some things that really aren't our best selves. But we always put the kids first, and honestly, I think that focus helped us repair our relationship into one of mutual respect over time, and our kids win as a result."" 
Flynn tells Independent Journal Review that he believes it is “extremely important” for parents to show care and respect for one another, especially when they are around their kids. Loading Facebook Post... 
He explains: 
""I'm not advocating that everyone can or should do what we do for each other to model for the kids. But I believe it is extremely important for parents to show each other respect and care in front of the kids. If your ex doesn't have a new [significant other], you got to make sure those kids have Mother's and Father's Day cards, birthday gifts, etc. 
Kids want to care for their parents by nature, but they cant do it alone. It's our job to facilitate that. So even if your ex is a terrible person in your eyes, you need to set it aside and realize your kids love this person. Seeing you mistreat someone they love is traumatic, whether you want to own it or not. 
So focus on the kids, make a pact, and I think you'll be surprised to find that your mutual focus on the kids will actually benefit your post-divorce relationship because it takes the spotlight off your individual hurts and anger and resentment."" 
As Flynn says on Facebook, if others in a similar situations aren't modeling “good relationship behavior,” then he suggests they wise up and be an example for their children. 
Some may say it's impossible, but Flynn couldn't disagree more. He tells Independent Journal Review that while establishing a mutual understanding with his ex-wife was hard, it was possible. And he knows that if he did it, you can do it too. 
By being able to rise above all the drama, co-parenting will turn into “raising good men and strong women,” which as Flynn says, is something we need now more than ever. ",0
1257,"Mexico, Chinese New Year: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.  President Trump’s aggressive moves on security and immigration drew strong responses both domestically and internationally. Tensions with Mexico are particularly high. Its president, Enrique Peña Nieto, above, canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump, and the two feuded  —   largely over Twitter  —   as reports emerged that Mr. Trump could consider a 20 percent tax on imports to pay for a border wall. Mexico said its 50 consulates in the United States would work to protect the rights of Mexican immigrants, while America’s   sanctuary cities, including New York, Boston and Los Angeles, vowed to resist   immigration enforcement. _____ 2. Mr. Trump told Republican leaders at a policy retreat in Philadelphia that this Congress would be the busiest “in decades, maybe ever. ” His adviser Steve Bannon deepened tensions with the news media, saying it had been humiliated by election missteps and should “keep its mouth shut. ” He added: “I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. ” This may not come as a surprise: Sales of dystopian novels, most notably George Orwell’s “1984,” are spiking. Our literary critic offers a reappraisal. The Times is tracking Mr. Trump’s full agenda, and covering many more aspects of his administration. You can also sign up for our daily politics newsletter here. _____ 3. Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the   March for Life on the National Mall on Friday. Organizers have ramped up attendance efforts, not wanting to be embarrassed by a poorer turnout than the women’s marches last weekend. And health clinics across the developing world are bracing for cuts because of Mr. Trump’s revival of a policy prohibiting foreign aid to groups that discuss abortion, a rule that often curtails broader health services. Above, a woman who suffered complications from a botched abortion in the Democratic Republic of Congo. _____ 4. The Doomsday Clock has moved nearer to midnight than it’s been in more than 60 years. Devised by the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, it’s meant to convey “how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making. ” It debuted in 1947. Two of the group’s scientists cited alarm over Mr. Trump’s positions on nuclear weapons and climate change. _____ 5. In China, hundreds of millions of people are traveling from industrial regions to their hometowns to celebrate the start of Lunar New Year on Saturday. Some cities have restricted the use of fireworks over pollution concerns. _____ 6. For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos. The advance brings scientists closer to developing human organs in animals for later transplant. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. _____ 7. Tributes to Mary Tyler Moore, the iconic actress who died on Wednesday at 80, continue to pour in. The TV journalist Jane Pauley, above, said the character of the single,   news producer Mary Richards was a role model and more. She even mimicked her fashion and home décor choices. The show “made a woman in the newsroom seem normal,” wrote Ms. Pauley, the anchor of “Sunday Morning” on CBS. _____ 8. Serena and a resurgent Venus Williams will face each other in the final of the Australian Open on Saturday. It’s the first time they’re playing against each other in a Grand Slam final since Wimbledon in 2009, above. If Serena wins, she would set an   record with a 23rd Grand Slam singles title. And a surprisingly strong Roger Federer defeated Stan Wawrinka to advance to the men’s final. He’ll seek his first major title since Wimbledon in 2012 on Sunday. _____ 9.   years after the movie “Trainspotting” gave the world a glimpse into the   underbelly of Edinburgh, the characters are back. “T2 Trainspotting”  —   with the same director and several of the same stars, including Ewan McGregor, above center  —   checks in with the unmoored but compelling characters as they face middle age. It’s being released this week in Britain and reaches the U. S. in March. We rounded up the early reviews. _____ 10. Finally, whatever your politics, your fears, or your troubles, a gift: the Great National Cute Animal   of 2017. Over the past two days, American zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals. And the world cracked a smile.

1258,"NeverTrumper Michael Hayden of CIA, NSA: Breitbart News ’Illegitimate’","Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency (NSA) director Michael Hayden did his best in 2016 to elect Hillary Clinton. Worse, Hayden made the inflammatory and frightening claim on CNN at the time that Donald Trump was a “clear and present danger” to the country. [Given his background, those words carried weight and contributed to the climate of fear and division that burdens our democracy today, including within the intelligence agencies.  Hayden also signed a letter last August urging Americans to vote against Donald Trump. Anything Hayden says about politics today must therefore be interpreted in that context. He is hardly a disinterested observer, and clearly resents the fact that the American people ignored his unsolicited advice. Now, Hayden tells the Business Insider that Breitbart News has an “illegitimate worldview. ” He was apparently objecting to Breitbart News’ story last week documenting mainstream media reports that the Obama administration had conducted surveillance at Trump Tower and of people connected to the Trump campaign, and that it had disseminated the products of that surveillance. Hayden admitted that he had not examined those media reports themselves. Nevertheless, he attacked Breitbart, Drudge and others: The retired   Air Force general said too that “there’s an amazing consistency” on numerous subjects between the information disseminated by Russian media outlets and that of conservative American sources like the Drudge Report, radio and television host Sean Hannity, and Breitbart. “You have a Breitbart News story essentially launching the Starfleet of the federal government about one of the most horrible political scandals in American history, if true,” Hayden said, adding that it was “very troubling” the president seeming to value Breitbart reports over data compiled by intelligence agencies. “Breitbart doesn’t do any creative journalism  —   it just moves the parts around,” Hayden continued. “And I haven’t done this personally, but I’ve heard others say, when you dig into the Breitbart sources, the articles don’t really say that. ”   …     “They have a worldview, and they are playing with it,” he said. “I think it’s an illegitimate worldview, and I think it’s a    worldview. It’s a worldview in which preexisting visions seem to be being used to distort the fact pattern that exists. ” The proper address for Hayden’s complaints is the mainstream media, and possibly the Obama administration. Regardless, the views he considers “illegitimate” are enjoyed by the 45 million unique visitors who read our website every month. The fact that Hayden and other disgruntled members of the Washington establishment still refuse to acknowledge the basic validity of a different perspective outside the Beltway and the mainstream media is precisely why Trump won in November. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the “most influential” people in news media in 2016.

1259,Anthrax: The Forgotten Iraq War Lie,"We all remember the lies that led the US into the Iraq war. 
But after years of media indoctrination, it’s easy to forget the other lie that helped rally the country around the illegal invasion of Iraq. 
John McCain : There is some indication, and I don’t have the conclusions, but some of this anthrax may — and I emphasize may — have come from Iraq. 
David Letterman : Oh, is that right? 
John McCain : If that should be the case, that’s when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made. 
Source: McCain and the Anthrax Scare [0:12 – 0:26] (Higher quality clip?) 
“When Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit about this amount – this is just about the amount of a teaspoon – less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001. This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope. 
“Iraq declared 8,500 liters of anthrax, but UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoon-full of this deadly material.” 
Source: Colin Powell’s Presentation to the UN on Iraq WMD [26:37 – 27:45] 
Although it is difficult to remember at this point, the anthrax scare of late 2001 was widely seen as a follow-up to the 9/11 attacks, and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the so-called War on Terror. Beginning in late September and continuing for several weeks, multiple anthrax-laced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two US Senators, killing five and injuring 17. 
It did not take long, however, for the neocons in the Bush administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen: Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. 
In his book, “ The 2001 Anthrax Deception ,” Dr. Graeme MacQueen describes this as “the double perpetrator hypothesis,” an attempt to blame the attacks on both Al Qaeda and Iraq. He writes: 
“What I call the ‘Double Perpetrator hypothesis’ held that Bin Laden’s group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores, namely Iraq.” 
This hypothesis, insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press, had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently. 
MACQUEEN1 –“Well the young woman who opened Senator Daschle’s mail…Afghanistan and Iraq” [0:16 – 2:02] 
The story of Iraqi collusion with Al Qaeda sounded credible enough to an American public that had no familiarity with the Muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of 9/11. The only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie. 
When key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite, a signature of the Iraqi anthrax program, the Bush administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between Saddam and the attacks. 
As filmmaker Robbie Martin explains in his documentary, American Anthrax , however, that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media. 
Martin points to disgraced ex-New York Times journalist and Iraqi WMD pusher Judy Miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie Iraq to the anthrax letters. 
As we now know, of course, the anthrax attacks were a false flag event. 
By early 2002 it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, a key facility within America’s own bioweapons program. Soon suspicion fell on Steven Hatfill, a “person of interest” identified by the FBI who eventually won a $4.6 million lawsuit against the Department of Justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press. The blame for the attacks was then pinned on Bruce Ivins, a researcher at Fort Detrick who conveniently died before the FBI could identify him or try him in court. The National Academy of Sciences and the Government Accountability Office have both cast doubt on the FBI’s scientific investigation of the attacks, however, and a whistleblower within the FBI’s own investigation has revealed that the Bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate Ivins. 
Whoever the perpetrator may have been–even accepting that Ivins was the attacker–it is a fact that the attacks were a false flag, using crudely forged letters to convince the American public that they were written by Al Qaeda agents. And that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in Iraq. 
The legacy of that war remains with us today. The middle east, including Iraq itself, remains in chaos, a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country. An invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications. 
The blood of a million dead Iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war, and those who aided and abetted those liars. 
Meanwhile, the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression.",0
1260,6 Things To Know About Prague (Czech Republic),"A “gateway” between Western and Eastern Europe lies on the Charles River in the Czech Republic—Prague. It’s been a Western tourist hotspot for many years now. Many people consider it a city “overrun” by the Westerners. Ruined, and no longer worth it.
I’ve spent the last month of my travels here in Prague, and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east– Ukraine. 
With that being said, here are 10 observations I’ve made about Prague.
1. Yes, It’s Overrun, BUT… 
That doesn’t mean you can’t find places that aren’t overrun. Yes, if you choose to stay in Prague zone 1, you’re going to have a drastically different experience. There will be hoards of people with selfie sticks, and fat Western girls wobbling all over Old Town (blocking the already narrow streets).
If you head out to Prague 2, 3, 5, etc., you’ll have a much different experience. You’ll get to meet some locals, try beer other than Staropramen, and avoid the throngs of tourists.
Of course, it’s important to note that Prague is a beautiful city. It’s natural to want to see some of the sights. If you choose to go this route, there’s simply no way around it.
2. The Reaction From Locals Changes Over Time 
Simply put, locals are used to Westerners. And most of them roll their eyes at them. However, once they know that you’ve laid down some semi-permanent roots, they’re far more friendly.
Just the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete 180 on me in the few weeks I’ve been here. It went from a general coldness that they show all English speakers to genuine warmth.
3. The Beauty (Of The City) Is Unreal 
This is my third time in Prague, and I’m still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is. From the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings, it’s just a very pleasant place to be. There are a lot of beautiful cities in Europe, but Prague is definitely near the top of all of them.
You can’t really blame people for wanting to come and see it.
4. Cheap By Western Standards, Expensive By EE Simply put, if you’re looking for short-term rentals—you’re getting hosed. And there’s not many ways around it. Prague landlords know the power of Western currency and know that the short-term stag parties don’t mind blowing it.
It’s far, far cheaper to sign a lease for a 3, 6, or 12 month period.
A meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between $8-12 USD. This is incredibly cheap compared to places like Italy, Spain, or London. At the same time, it’s definitely a bit more expensive than places such as Kiev, Budapest, or some cities in Poland.
If you want actual numbers, I’d say it’s about 30% more expensive than Kiev. Probably about 10-15% more expensive than Budapest (the last time I was there was April 2015, so keep that in mind), and just marginally more expensive than Poland.
Of course (as I keep harping on this), it’s going to get cheaper the further you go from the Old Town area.
5. The Girls 
I know this is probably a large part of the reason you’re reading this. So let’s break it down. The girls are hot. They’re not as hot as Ukrainian and Russian girls, but they’re a step above Polish women. 
At this point, it’s easy to see that any and all local Czech girls living in Prague are basically immune to foreigners. You aren’t going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the Old Town. In fact, she’d probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area.
However, being a foreigner will give you some major value if you’re living there. In Colombia, girls will bang you just because you’re a foreigner. In Ukraine, they’ll probably at least give you one date for being foreign. In Prague, they’ll do neither— especially the high quality ones. 
However, the same things apply if you’re living there (or coming back consistently).
Plus, it’s not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around. Just keep your liquor in check, and avoid putting a GoPro on your head–you’ll already be ahead of the game.
6. Conclusion—Is It Livable? 
When you come from a place like Ukraine, Prague feels much more like home. The English is better, and it has a more Western feel. You can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the Former Soviet Union countries (Ukraine, Belarus, etc.).
The question is whether or not it’s worth it to deal with what comes with those Western amenities—high amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over. There’s no denying that Prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was 20 years ago.
However, Prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done. The internet is fast, the city is interesting, and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do.
You could do a lot worse.

Look at what is happening now across the European continent! Europe is being occupied by invading hoards of millions of Muslims as we speak, demanding more mosques to be built with state money (tax payer money), chanting Allahu Akbar in the streets, teaching Muslim prayers in schools, banning Christmas street lights and more!
Some of these migrants even took it to a step further, now posing as “children”. Some stupid Europeans actually believe them and adopted them as their own children. 20-30 even up to 40 year old men! Imagine adopting a 30 year old man as your “child”…
Despite having nationalist political parties surging across the continent, there has been no major victory!!! The nationalists do NOT own a single country in Europe! France is still under socialist Hollande, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, Greece everyone is still under socialist/liberal leadership.
Despite having the UK historically exiting the EU with their famous Brexit vote, the UK is still under “principled conservative” leadership, you know that conservatism similar to Paul Ryan (open borders). The country fell on Theresa May’s hands after Boris Johnson who helped Nigel Farage make Brexit happen cucked-out and refused to take the leadership. Theresa May is super similar to David Cameron, the former Prime Minister who resigned after Brexit. Both David and Theresa are like Jeb! Bush or Paul Ryan clones. Same “principled conservative” rhetoric but with open borders.
Europe is basically lost and no one can do anything about it at this point. Even a classic revolution is impossible at this point. There’s no spirit, we don’t have a strong leader here in Europe like they do in America, with Donald Trump, our European nationalist leaders are all weak, soft cucks. The people are too materialistic, they chase money, music, movies, games like nothing else matters.
Here’s the average European daily conversation in BOTH West AND East Europe: “Look at my new car! Do you like it?? You wanker, who cares about Muslim immigration, check out my new Iphone 7! And have you heard that new Beyonce song which tells whites to fuck themselves? Wow its so awesome! By the way I’m going to Ibiza next week! Bloody hell mate, let’s play my new FIFA 17 PS4 game before you go, it has awesome graphics mate! It’s better than PES 17!!!” This is no exaggeration and this is exactly how European people behave these days. All Europeans, UK, France, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Italy, Austria, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, even Russia, EVERYONE! Total cuckoldry!
Some people like to think that East Europe is somewhat purer and holier than the West but it’s not anymore. Especially Americans have this idea that Eastern Europe is not as tainted as the West. Its the same thing, the eternal chase of entertainment.
The question is what’s next? How would Christians survive as minorities among these peaceful people? Perhaps we should pack our bags and start a new white flight to Russia. As long as Putin is in power we know he is gonna protect the rights of European Christian people and ensure their survival. Lets hope and pray he would allow us to invade his country. While Russia is no different in those terms, at least they have a leader who watches over them and protects them while they have fun. Another option would be to pack our bags and move to America if Trump wins and IF Trump would allow us to go there…. because we do know he’s very anti-immigration. Should Hillary “win” (steal the election) may God help us all because WW3 is upon us.
So here’s a bunch of new Muslim challenges Europe is now facing:
GERMANY – Children Forced to learn Muslim prayers and shout Allahu Akbar 

Pupils at a primary school were forced to chant “Allahu Akhbar” and “there is no God but Allah”, an appalled father has claimed.
The father of the pupil at the girl’s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given.
He claimed she had been “forced” by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24.
The handout read: “Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.”
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in “ethics” at the Bavarian school.
ITALY – Thousands of Muslims Pray in the Streets of Rome near Colosseum, Shout Allahu Akbar, Demand more Mosques 

Thousands of Muslims gathered in protest outside Rome’s Colosseum Friday after Italian authorities shut down a number of so-called “garage mosques” to avoid young people becoming radicalized.
The Muslim community of Rome chose the iconic Colosseum, a worldwide symbol of Christian persecution and martyrdom, to stage their demonstration against the alleged shutting down by police of illegal places of Muslim worship in the city.
Many Roman citizens were visibly disturbed by the protest, noting that in its propaganda videos, the Islamic State has repeatedly employed images of the Colosseum when threatening to conquer Rome and the “Crusaders.”
Two months ago, Italian police set up a high-security perimeter around the Colosseum, after the Islamic State issued a new threat to “conquer” Rome in its latest video.
UNITED KINGDOM – British press wants more 40-year-old migrant “children” posing as 16-year-old 

Won’t you take pity on this poor, innocent little child?
This image of a “16-year-old” migrant crying – which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian – is nothing short of laughable.
“A 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,” the photo’s caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: “Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais.”
The “child migrant” is clearly in his 40’s, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they’ll actually believe they’re looking at a 16-year-old boy.
This comes amid a recent report where grown men pose as children in the UK , get adopted by British families then threaten to “love” them in exchange for their care. Some were even caught drawing ISIS flags on 1st grade coloring books.
SWEDEN – Christmas Street Lights BANNED to Avoid Offending Muslim Migrants 

Towns across Sweden have banned Christmas street lights in the name of “security,” but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to Islam after importing countless Muslim migrants over the last two years.
According to an SVT report, The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages, meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets.
Despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades, this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of Muslim migrants flooded into the country – just a coincidence I’m sure.
In reality, the Christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending Muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like Malmo, where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near Muslim ghetto ‘no-go areas’ is becoming a routine occurrence.

1263,What Is At Stake In The Election — Paul Craig Roberts,"What Is At Stake In The Election
Paul Craig Roberts
Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control American’s Minds: http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/26/1010359-65-us-journalists-at-a-private-dinner-with-hillary-clintons-team-and-john-podesta/ 
I just heard an NPR presstitute delare that Texas, a traditional sure thing
for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary.
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-25/texas-rigged-first-reports-voting-machines-switching-votes-hillary-texas 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump’s election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us—Hillary’s win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement—the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn’t they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn’t even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet.
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump’s lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth.
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage.
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be “the new Hitler” and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia.
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it?
Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media.
In other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a people’s democracy protected by a free press.
In truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy.

1264,What is the goal of the Progressive Movement: to gain power or to give it away?,"pirate clip art free printable | Illustration of Pirate Skull ...(image by ) The Pirate Party of Iceland, the one nation that jailed its crooked bankers, is poised to win the election, less than 4 years after forming.
Their motto is: "" ""We are not here to gain power. We are here to distribute power."" 
I think this formulation can serve the Progressive Movement in the US, as it approaches mainstream status and is the most popular political movement in the nation, with 67% approving of the term progressive, over 55% supporting Sanders, and a robust majority supporting progressive programs like gun and immigration reform, raising the minimum wage, etc. 
And this formulation also deals with the issue of Bigness, which many think incompatible with democracy and human rights. What if the purpose of bigness (ie winning elections) is NOT to consolidate power in new hands but to change the system by using this status to distribute power. - Advertisement - 
Progressives are commonly accused by the right of being for Big Government, for thinking that government power is the solution to all problems. This Pirate formulation disrupts that claim, by showing a way to use the consolidation of power in order not to create a stronger state but to redistribute power and thus lessen the power of the state and powerful corporations and other institutions, public and private. 
This formulation comes out of the anarchist tradition of decentralized power. The Pirate party has allied libertarians of both the right and left to take power, in order to distribute it from the banks and their servants back to the people themselves. Anarchism, we understand, is self-government, which means decentralized power. - Advertisement - 
The success of the Pirate party shows how anarchists and libertarians of all kinds can come together to form a coalition Big enough to win but committed to breaking up the concentration of power, mostly in the hands of the financial institutions and their corrupt public servants. 
The way to get beyond the ""Iron Law of Oligarchy,"" which over 100 years ago German sociologist Robet Michels, which states "" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchic tendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations."" is to use consolidation of power (bigness) in the service of decentralizing power, pushing it back to the people and smaller communities. 
Therefore, the goal of Progressives is NOT to gain power that is the means: the goal is to replace the old hierarchical system with a system of decentralized power, a model of self-government.",0

1266,YIELD…! Funeral Ahead…!,"from Rogue Money : 
The Wolf’s sense of smell has been in confusion of late trying to figure out which way the winds blow. Are free markets about to make a come back, or have they been with us all along, once you fully factor in the effects of “cognitive dissonance” over the past couple decades? Meaning “cognitive dissonance” is also a part of the free market equation, and the markets have just been factoring them in appropriately. 
One thing is for sure, the biggest bubble in world history is starting to get “thin in the skin,” as in ready to pop. Which bubble, you ask? The western debt markets. Putting that aside for the moment, the good news of late is that nationalism is on the rise in the USA with a Trump victory, but it ain’t the only thing on the rise. “Yields” are as well folks. It would appear a debt funeral is “dead” ahead, along with an associated paper wake. In a rather timely fashion the professor Ken Schortgen Jr., just provided a top down analysis to a western paper funeral, with historical theories that are now becoming reality. 
Before getting into the meat and potatoes of this installment, I have to throw out a theory from an installment written over two years ago. A theory that will fit nicely, and one that states that the markets are actually free. “Free,” just like the international man Doug Casey has said. I know what you may be thinking, that with a supposed honest market filled with “informed” investors that the prior couple of sentences are totally incorrect, especially with respect to the hard asset markets. Incorrect except for one major thing. If free markets are truly free, and additionally allow for the “stupid/cognitive-dissonant” people to freely participate, then I suppose you have to factor in the unpredictability of “stupidity/cognitive-dissonance.” 
At least for a while, as it appears responsibility and intelligence may be taking hold in some corners. Witness the public’s uprising in the recent US election, but that same election has released a dose of “election victory cognitive dissonance.” The more things change, the more things stay the same! 
The time frames for “stupidity/cognitive-dissonance” (SCD) being an overdeveloped defining factor in free markets are typically limited. Decades apparently mark the political free market’s limits regarding the afore mentioned ‘SCD’. Again, witness the recent election. And the winds seem to be telling one Wolf Gray that we are about to see how Economic Mother Nature presides over the current limits to the time frame that will define the “Fiat King Dollar’s” life span. A life span fueled of late by the last fumes in the gas tank, the typical fumes of cognitive dissonance, plus a dose of stupidity. An ‘SCD’ that I am afraid to say may have just got a boost by the recent election. 
The Wolf’s and the Wolfpack’s sense of smell is somewhat confused and would seem to be alone on this bottom up view, so ‘I/we’ could use your guidance. To wit, those happy Trump voters that seem to think the US economic life boats are coming to their immediate aid are about to see a delay to their ‘pocket-book’ rescue, thanks to the ravages that will come with rising debt “Yields.” These rising “Yield” signs say the market is about to let each of us know, “it doesn’t suffer fools gladly.” WG 
Yield! The funeral cometh ! And, sorry folks it can’t be Trumped. There are limits to man’s abilities to forestall “nature” economic and or otherwise. 
News that…….Yields? 
First please note the recent top down analysis of the overall business economic landscape by the professor, with reference to Dr. Jim Willie’s theories and analysis.

1267,"Cecile Richards, Barbara Bush and the Sisterhood of Political Progeny - The New York Times","“I love that you still say y’all!” Cecile Richards said to Barbara Bush. Within minutes, both women sounded markedly more Texan than they had when they walked into the restaurant. But Texas twangs may be the least of what they have in common. The families of Ms. Bush, 34, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the chief executive of Global Health Corps, a nonprofit organization, and Ms. Richards, 58, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and daughter of former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, go way back. At the 1988 Democratic convention, Governor Richards, who died in 2006, got off one of the best   in memory when she said of former President (and candidate at the time) George Bush: “Poor George. He can’t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. ” His son George W. evened the score in 1994 by beating her decisively in the Texas governor’s race. But there was no trace of animosity when the women met for lunch at Gotham Bar and Grill. They are enthusiastic supporters of each other’s work. Before becoming president of Planned Parenthood in 2006, the nation’s leading provider of reproductive health services and sex education for women, men and young people, Ms. Richards founded America Votes, a group that coordinates and promotes progressive issues. Before that, she was deputy chief of staff to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is now the House minority leader, and worked for many years as a labor organizer. Ms. Bush founded Global Health Corps in 2009 (along with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others) to address disparate health results among rich and poor countries. The organization provides yearlong fellowships to young professionals with diverse backgrounds by embedding them in health organizations in Africa and underserved communities in the United States. The number of fellows has grown from 22 in its inaugural year to 140 in its eighth class, which began this month, from a pool of over 5, 000 applicants. Over black cod (for Ms. Bush) and branzino (for Ms. Richards) the pair discussed the challenges of growing up in political families the politicization of health care, especially for women and the coincidence of appearing in a recent collection of essays, “What I Told My Daughter: Lessons from Leaders on Raising the Next Generation of Empowered Women,” edited by Nina Tassler. PHILIP GALANES: Let’s start with Nora Ephron, who said that, as a kid, she dreamt of being the president’s daughter because of all the attention she’d get, especially from boys. Did that indirect spotlight appeal to you? BARBARA BUSH: I really didn’t notice it. I was so young. When I was 8, I asked a friend when her grandfather’s inauguration was. I had just been to my grandfather’s, and I assumed everybody had one. PG: How about when your father ran for president? BB: We were 18 then. At 18, you’re focused on yourself and where you’ll go to college. Our parents wanted that for us. CECILE RICHARDS: I was at a very different time in my life. I was 30 when I moved back to Texas to help with Mom’s campaign. I had a    daughter and was pregnant with twins at her inauguration. BB: You have twins? I’m a twin. CR: Twins are the best. PG: Did you like campaigning for your mother, or was it an obligation? CR: Oh, there was never any question about it. It’s different, running as a woman. And at that point, my mother wasn’t married. We were her support system. But it’s a mixed bag, seeing your parent run for office. There’s a little bit of glamour, but a lot of pain and suffering, watching them go through tough times. BB: I never read the media about my dad. I already had an opinion about him, millions of opinions. I didn’t need another person telling me what to think. And when it comes to attacks, people are attacking a caricature. They don’t actually know the person. I have the luxury of knowing my parents deeply. CR: A lot of people think of Ann Richards as larger than life. She always said: “Take me, warts and all. ” But I saw the vulnerabilities that the public didn’t. One of her favorite things was going to the movies and sitting in the dark. No one could bother her there. PG: You also can’t criticize your parents the way we civilians can. The first time I was really aware of Barbara was when you made that P. S. A. for gay marriage. There was a firestorm about your falling out with your father. BB: I didn’t realize how much attention that would get. Whoopi Goldberg had done one. And Julianne Moore. They had about 70 views. I didn’t think mine was going to get many more. But, of course, it did. Because the narrative was that I was breaking with my father. But I had talked to my dad about doing it, and he was very supportive. What surprised me were all the people who said: “How brave! Betraying your family like that. ” But my parents raised us to use our voices for issues we care about, and I feel strongly about marriage equality. The only brave thing is that I’m shy. That was the win: I used my voice. PG: It was your media debut. Meanwhile, everyone alive must know about Cecile’s marathon testimony before Congress last year over the battle to defund Planned Parenthood. Five hours! Lots of coffee or tranquilizers  —   or both? CR: They don’t let you do anything. You just sit there, at the pleasure of Congress, while they go in and out, taking breaks and talking in the hallways. I had no idea that it was going to be   on television, or that so many people would watch. I still have people come up to me on the subway and say they watched all five hours. PG: I couldn’t believe how rude the congressmen were. In a weird way, did they do you and Planned Parenthood a favor? CR: I think millions of people were exposed to the   of health care, and the aggressive attitudes toward women, the disrespect. It happened to be me, but it could have been any woman. There was a real lack of empathy for what women go through to access health care. PG: Did you walk out of the room thinking, “I just knocked it out of the park”? CR: Oh, no. It was more like: I just survived an endurance test. Later, I read a text from one of my twins, Daniel, who wrote: “Mom, I’m so proud of you. You’re doing a great job. And I think raising me really prepared you for this hearing today. ” BB: That’s so sweet. PG: It also brings us to your great commonality: women’s and global health. With your connections, I bet you could do anything you want. What led you to health care? The last I knew, Barbara was doing an internship at Proenza Schouler. BB: I still love them and would work for them still. PG: I remember an interview with your mother, Laura Bush, who sounded slightly apologetic that you were taking so long to land on a career. And you were only 25. CR: So, we share that, too: mothers who had high expectations for us. It’s a lot. BB: I still don’t know what my end goal is going to be. CR: Can I say how impressive Barbara is? It’s one thing to work at a    organization like Planned Parenthood, trying to shift the boat into the 21st century. But it’s another to say: “I see a problem, and I’m going to start an organization to fix it. ” BB: Since I was born, in 1981, we’ve had the drugs to save the millions of kids around the world who die every year. Yet the number of deaths hasn’t dropped at all. We have the tools to keep people healthy, but the systems are broken. CR: All my life, I’ve been lucky to work in social justice, starting as a labor organizer working with   working women. They’re the same ones we see at Planned Parenthood now: women trying to raise their kids, many of them single moms, working two jobs. And if you don’t have access to health care, women will put their health after everyone else’s. It’s like dinner was in Texas: Women took the chicken legs after everyone else had eaten. Women will go without cancer screenings or family planning, which causes unintended pregnancies. Barbara knows this from global health: If women are healthy, their families are healthy, their communities are healthy. It’s one of the most powerful ways to make social change. BB: Thanks to my parents, I got lots of exposure. I traveled with them when they launched Pepfar, an amazing program that saves the lives of people with H. I. V. around the world. At that time, if you were H. I. V. positive in the United States, it was just another chronic illness. But in a developing country, it was a death sentence. I met people who were mourning the deaths of their children and sisters, because they didn’t have access to drugs that exist. That blew my mind. We have the tools to solve these problems. We just need to use them more effectively. CR: It’s the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it’s not enough unless there’s public policy that supports getting women access to care. PG: I can’t imagine anyone in America disagreeing with the idea that we should all have health care. So, why is this conversation so poisonous? CR: There’s a total disconnect between political rhetoric and where the American people are. They believe folks should have access to health care and family planning. They believe young people should have sex education. No parent wants their child to get an infection, or get pregnant before they’re ready. We’re at a   low for unintended pregnancy in America. In any other moment, folks would go: “Wow! Let’s do more of that. It’s good for women and saves money. ” But the political environment is tough right now. BB: It’s crazy, and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue, because it’s not a polarizing space. As a human, I hope everyone is healthy. And what happens in other places matters here. We saw that with Ebola. Everyone started paying attention when it seemed like it might impact us. But diseases don’t respect international borders. PG: Do you see big roles for storytelling and empathy? CR: So much shame has been placed on women, for having sex or using birth control or choosing to end a pregnancy. When women tell their stories, it makes a big difference. We learned that from the L. G. B. T. community, in terms of knowing people. Women come up to me all the time and thank me for telling my story, and sometimes they tell me theirs. But I was with three women in Pennsylvania, where they were trying to pass an outrageous, restrictive bill on abortions. These women desperately wanted their pregnancies, but learned at 20 weeks about severe fetal abnormalities. And here they were at a press conference, sharing their anguish in front of clicking cameras. I had two thoughts: What bravery. Then, why should they have to bare their souls? I see empathy every day, but I’m sorry that women still have to share their most personal stories. PG: The   millennials play big roles in both your organizations. BB: We think millennials are great. So many young people want to work on social change. They want to do good. Global Health started because this great talent pipeline was not moving into health care. It’s hard to know how you fit in if you’re not a doctor or nurse. If we can demystify that and create channels into Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations, then we’ll have an army of people working to solve health problems. CR: Ten years ago, when I came to Planned Parenthood, I met these young kids who were called “peer educators. ” They provided sex education in schools and talked to their principals about access to health care. They were in every town. I thought, “What you really are is leaders. ” And the great thing about bringing in thousands of young people to an organization is they begin to change it. One of the things I’m proud of at Planned Parenthood is the number of health centers providing trans care, which was largely driven by young activists. BB: I didn’t know what was in front of me when we were starting Global Health Corps. We didn’t even know if anyone would apply. We could never have predicted that a few years in, we’d have gotten to work with 600 amazing young people, 97 percent of whom stay in global health or social justice issues related to it. Our challenge is to keep growing as responsibly as we can. But we see a huge demand. CR: My biggest hope is that we can take partisanship out of this arena. Not to get too political, but we have Republican patients and staff members and board members. The need for health care doesn’t come with a party label. Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman who has health insurance gets birth control at no cost. That’s 55 million women. We don’t have to invent a new kind of birth control. We just have to close the lid between needing it and delivering it. And I’m optimistic that we’re on the cusp of making that happen. BB: You’ve got to be an optimist. PG: Let’s end with Nina Tassler’s book, “What I Told My Daughter. ” Cecile wrote an essay, and Barbara is the subject of her mom’s essay. So, what would you tell young women on the road to empowerment? CR: My mom used to say she saw too many young women passing up opportunities because they were afraid of failing. Her message to me was: “This is the only life you get. Take every chance and run with it  —   even if it doesn’t work out. ” BB: When I was thinking about starting Global Health, but afraid I wasn’t ready, my mom said: “You’re in another job, but always talking about Global Health. Are you going to be happy leaving this on your   list forever?” It’s the same with young fellows I speak with. They’re worried about taking the “right” next step at the “right” time. But there’s never a right time. Who knows where life is going to take us? CR: Exactly. Just do it. What’s the worst that could happen?",0
1268,"In Alabama, a Slow-Burning Scandal Engulfs the Governor - The New York Times","MONTGOMERY, Ala.  —   Gov. Robert Bentley engaged in an “inappropriate relationship” with his chief adviser, then used intimidation tactics and deployed state law enforcement officials in an effort to cover it up, according to a bruising report released Friday in support of the effort to impeach him. The report also claims that the   governor tried to pin nonexistent crimes on a top law enforcement official. The release of the   report by a special counsel to the state House Judiciary Committee is almost certain to further imperil Mr. Bentley, an avuncular physician and former Sunday school teacher. Mr. Bentley, a Republican, has vowed to fight to keep his office despite a steady drip of embarrassing and sometimes salacious details that have fueled a scandal that has embarrassed this conservative state and all but consumed its political culture for the last year. Despite mounting calls from members of his own party that he step down, the governor won a significant battle Friday afternoon when a local judge granted a   temporary restraining order Mr. Bentley had sought. The order effectively blocks impeachment hearings that were set to begin Monday in the Legislature, which is dominated by Mr. Bentley’s own party. In many other ways, it was a very bad week for the governor. On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause that he had violated ethics and campaign laws, and referred the case to a local district attorney for possible criminal prosecution. A separate inquiry, already underway, is being led by a special prosecutor appointed by Alabama’s attorney general. This week, both Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh and House Speaker Mac McCutcheon, both Republicans, called on the    Mr. Bentley to resign. State Representative Corey Harbison, another Republican, said that he was worried about the possible violation of laws, but also the distraction the scandal has caused, and its damage to the state’s reputation. “It is a terrible black eye for the state,” said Mr. Harbison, who has called for Mr. Bentley’s ouster. When Mr. Bentley was sworn in as governor in 2011, it seemed almost impossible to conceive of a politician with less potential for drama. He was   and long married and had earned wide respect as a dermatologist in his hometown, Tuscaloosa. Whatever Mr. Bentley’s fate, it is unlikely to shake the dominant Republican Party here. The state is simply too conservative to see mass defections to the Democrats. And he has not been viewed as a particularly powerful governor. Before 9 a. m. Friday  —   hours before the release of the report  —   Mr. Bentley appeared on the Capitol steps minutes after his office alerted reporters that he would be speaking. The governor spoke of how he had put his fate in the hands of a higher power, mentioning the word “God” nine times in under seven minutes. He said he had done nothing illegal, and he apologized directly to the people of Alabama: “There’s no doubt I have let you down,” he said. He also warned there were more “embarrassing details” to come. Headline writers have taken to referring to Mr. Bentley as the “Love Gov,” over the accusation that he had engaged in an affair with his former senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason  —   an accusation both Mr. Bentley and Ms. Mason deny. For months now, residents have had to endure a leaked audio recording of Mr. Bentley in conversation with a woman  —   said to be Ms. Mason  —   in which he describes embracing her and placing his hands on her breasts. The governor could also be heard saying, “If we’re going to do what we did the other day, we’re going to have to start locking the door. ” The report issued Friday involved interviewing 20 witnesses and 10, 000 pages of documents. In the report, Jack Sharman, the special counsel, noted that Mr. Bentley and his associates, including Ms. Mason, refused to cooperate. The governor, Mr. Sharman said, refused to turn over all state documents investigators requested, while his campaign committee turned over no documents. “The Committee may consider the Governor’s   as an independent ground for impeachment,” the report stated. The report also notes that in Alabama, a gubernatorial impeachment investigation is not a criminal one, and that impeachable offenses “may include but are not limited to crimes. ” The report described a chief executive racked with “increasing obsession and paranoia,” but one who also did little to hide his relationship with Ms. Mason from his inner circle. When his wife was able to make the clandestine recordings of Mr. Bentley speaking “provocatively” to Ms. Mason, the report states, “Governor Bentley’s loyalty shifted from the State of Alabama to himself. ” Mr. Bentley worried the recordings would become public, the report stated, and embroiled law enforcement officers in the drama, directing them, among other things, to investigate who might have copies” and to identify potential crimes which they could be charged. He also encouraged “an atmosphere of intimidation” to ensure that no one spoke of it, the report stated. Ms. Mason, meanwhile, exercised “extraordinary policy authority while receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from Governor Bentley’s campaign account and from an apparently lawful but shadowy nonprofit,” it stated. The speculation about an affair came to light in March 2016, after the governor fired Spencer Collier, the head of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Mr. Bentley said he had fired Mr. Collier after a review uncovered “possible misuse of state money” at the agency. The Alabama attorney general’s office opened an investigation, only to close it in October, noting that “no witness had established a credible basis for the initiation of a criminal inquiry in the first place. ” Soon after his firing, Mr. Collier held a news conference in which he accused Mr. Bentley of having an affair with Ms. Mason, whom he described as Alabama’s “de facto governor. ” The report accuses Mr. Bentley of “prematurely and publicly” accusing Mr. Collier of criminal misconduct, with the “likely” purpose of demonizing him. It also noted that Mr. Collier has since been cleared of wrongdoing. It is unclear when a new impeachment timetable will be established. Lawyers said that Greg Griffin, the circuit court judge who issued the restraining order, could issue an order laying out an impeachment process that would address the governor’s concern that he was not granted proper due process. If the State House, which would take up the matter first, votes to impeach, Mr. Bentley will be temporarily removed from office while the Senate deliberates his ultimate fate. If Mr. Bentley is charged and convicted by the Montgomery County district attorney, he will face a   to   prison sentence and a fine of up to $20, 000 for each of the four potential violations. This year, Mr. Bentley sparked concerns among some lawmakers when he appointed Luther Strange, a former state attorney general, to the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, who left to become President Trump’s attorney general. Mr. Strange had been overseeing an investigation of Mr. Bentley, and his successor has appointed a special prosecutor to take over the investigation. But Mr. Harbison, the Republican state representative, said that the appointment could give the perception that Mr. Bentley was trying to derail the inquiry. Today, Mr. Bentley’s private life appears to be as complicated as his public one. His wife filed for divorce in August 2015. Ms. Mason resigned last year. Her husband remains the director of the Governor’s Office of   and Volunteer Service, and the couple traveled with Mr. Bentley to Washington, for Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January. Ms. Mason could not be reached for comment. Her lawyers said in a court filing last year that she had “done nothing wrong, either civilly or criminally. ”",0
1269,Peaceful Dueling Protests So Far as G.O.P. Convention Begins - The New York Times,"CLEVELAND  —   The start of the Republican National Convention on Monday instantly inspired dueling protests, with both supporters and critics of Donald J. Trump pressing their cases in neighboring demonstrations as Republicans strained to project party unity. But amid the twin national reckonings over police violence and violence against the police, officers here seemed determined to avoid provoking those who gathered. Though the police presence was felt at every turn, where uniformed officers often waited on rows of bicycles, they intervened in the protests sparingly, to enforce security perimeters or, in a handful of instances, to separate protesters and counterprotesters. “It’s a little scary,” Kim Moran, the wife of an Illinois delegate, said as she recorded a video of an   rally. “There’s just a lot of hate going on. ” Yet for most of the day, rival demonstrators appeared to have achieved a relative peace, however fleeting it might prove. The proceedings began around noon, when about 200 Trump supporters gathered in a park for an “America First” rally, hauling lawn chairs and, occasionally, carrying firearms for an event intended to exhibit the breadth of Mr. Trump’s followers. Subgroups drawn to the rally included Bikers for Trump, Truckers for Trump and Students for Trump. “He’s never said anything racist,” said Eric Smith, 36, who is black and was wearing a Trump  . “He means just to say, ‘Make America great again as itself.’ It’s like, ‘Build yourself up and then you can build up the people around you. ’” Soon, Roger J. Stone Jr. a longtime Trump confidant, regaled the crowd with attacks on Hillary Clinton. Meeting at a public square less than a mile away, hundreds of   protesters marched through downtown Cleveland, hoping to move as close as possible to the Quicken Loans Arena, the site of the convention. When they arrived at the low concrete barriers outside the arena, they chanted: “Shut it down!” After a few hesitant moments, people began climbing over the barriers. The police did not interfere. As marchers approached the main security checkpoint for the convention grounds, where delegates pass through Secret Service screenings, a phalanx of officers on bicycles rode tire to tire, preventing the protesters from reaching the inner security perimeter. “There are all kinds of different groups here for different reasons, but we’re united to shut this down,” said Holly Counterpane, a protester from Chicago. “Nobody’s trying to hurt, get hurt or get arrested. ” The officers, like urban cattle wranglers, steered the marchers along a row of downtown restaurants. Bryan Hambley, a Cleveland doctor who is organizing a protest march against Mr. Trump planned later this week, said the news media had exaggerated the potential for violence and chaos. “The Trump supporters are having their rallies across town,” he said as the first   gathering began. “They didn’t send any counterprotesters here. ” He added, “We didn’t send counterprotesters to antagonize them. ” At times, officers positioned themselves between small groups of   protesters and counterprotesters as the dueling groups exchanged insults. Before the convention began, the shooting deaths of three police officers on Sunday in Baton Rouge, La. promised to cast a pall over the first day. Mr. Trump has taken pains to present himself as the “law and order” candidate  —   the theme of Monday’s convention program is “Make America Safe Again”  —   and the campaign has made clear its plans to capitalize on the national sense of unrest. The smattering of demonstrations on Sunday had been mostly tame. But with the convention officially beginning, the slate of protests on Monday produced a measure of tumult. Around 3 p. m. the band Prophets of Rage, which includes veterans of Rage Against the Machine, highlighted a second   march, which later joined with an antipoverty march. “Thank you for coming out today with your joy and your militancy,” Tom Morello, a guitarist with the group, told the crowd. His hat bore a message: “Make America Rage Again. ” While organizers had expected thousands of people at the antipoverty march, the total was closer to a few hundred, shouting slogans like “Cleveland means we got to fight back” and “they think it’s a game, they think it’s a joke. ” Some demonstrators expressed mixed feelings about the conspicuous police presence. Rodrigo Starz, part of the   duo Rebel Diaz, surmised that there were “more police than people,” calling the officers’ approach menacing and unnecessary. But, he said, he was grateful that the march had been peaceful. The attack in Baton Rouge on Sunday had prompted urgent calls from one local police union to restrict   gun laws near the convention site. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, said he could not legally intervene, given the state’s gun laws. Calvin D. Williams, Cleveland’s chief of police, told reporters on Monday that the shooting in Baton Rouge had not altered the city’s security plans. After five officers in Dallas were killed this month, the police here began dispatching patrol cars with at least two officers at a time. “Our officers are told to be especially cautious,” Chief Williams said. At another briefing in the early evening, Chief Williams said one person had been arrested on Monday, a woman with a felony warrant. He did not say what the warrant was for. He said officers had confiscated several items, including a small knife, gas masks and a slingshot. Still, some attendees seemed a bit skittish about their security, wondering aloud about the state’s   designation. One Trump supporter, John Nadler, 63, said he feared his Trump apparel made him a target. “Even Governor Kasich said he’s not going to stop open carry,” said Mr. Nadler, one of the few Trump admirers from Chappaqua, N. Y. where Mrs. Clinton lives. “They got cops, I’m afraid they are going to get me. I got a Trump hat and a Trump  . Why not pick me off?”",0
1270,Greeks Appeal for Aid After Fire Damages Refugee Camp - The New York Times,"ATHENS  —   Thousands of people were left homeless after a fire tore through a refugee camp Monday night on the Aegean island of Lesbos, and the Greek authorities appealed on Tuesday to the European Union for more support in managing the migration crisis. The fire, which started in the island’s main Moria camp, destroyed 50 prefabricated homes and dozens of tents, driving 4, 400 migrants into nearby fields, according to humanitarian aid workers. Footage aired on Greek television showed the bulk of the camp in flames. About 100 unaccompanied children were the first to be resettled to a hostel Monday night, and about half the families had returned to the Moria camp by midday on Tuesday. The Shipping Ministry said it would send a vessel to anchor at the island, providing temporary accommodation for about 1, 000 of the migrants. “Things are very difficult,” an Interior Ministry official, Nikos Toskas, told Greek radio. “The Europeans must send real, genuine aid,” he said. He condemned European countries that “build fences and then send blankets,” an apparent reference to Balkan states that closed their borders to migrants this year, leaving thousands trapped in Greece. The cause of the blaze remained unclear. Local news media said clashes had broken out between different ethnic groups in the camp amid rumors that large numbers of migrants would be sent back to Turkey. The police detained nine camp residents. Earlier in the day, residents protested, calling for the migrants to leave the island. In the wake of the unrest, Mr. Toskas said, two riot police units would be sent to the island. A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said frustrations had frequently bubbled over into clashes in camps, as many migrants have been living in poor conditions for months amid uncertainty about their future. “These people gave up everything to seek a better life months ago, and now they’re stuck,” said Roland Schoenbauer, the agency’s representative in Greece. He said frustrations and tension were being fueled by the slow pace at which the Greek authorities were processing the migrants’ asylum applications, and a sluggish European relocation program that has moved 3, 700 people to other countries from Greece over the past year, far short of the target of 66, 400. If the pace does not pick up, “it will take several years to resolve the problem,” Mr. Schoenbauer said. “This is not going to go away,” he continued, adding that economic migrants who do not merit asylum should be repatriated “in a humane and dignified way” to free up space at the camps. More than 60, 000 refugees or asylum seekers are in Greece, the vast majority in camps across the country, most of them cramped and dirty. Over 5, 700 are on Lesbos, which has borne the brunt of the migrant influx into Greece. Arrivals from neighboring Turkey have dropped since the peak of the crisis this time last year, when thousands made the short, perilous journey across the Aegean Sea aboard rickety boats, many drowning in the attempt. An agreement in March between the European Union and Turkey to curb human smuggling across the Aegean reduced the arrivals to virtually zero. However, there has been a significant uptick since July, after the failed coup attempt in Turkey. Now scores, sometimes hundreds, are arriving daily. The increase in arrivals and rising tensions in the camps have fueled protests in some communities close to   camps where many residents are fed up with the growing migrant populations. Last week, residents on another Aegean island, Chios, protested. The upheaval has been exploited by members of   groups who have also protested, often clashing with more moderate demonstrators. Mayor Spyros Galinos of Lesbos said the protests were being “guided by certain circles,   circles who are being supported by members of other parties that have found the opportunity to boost their following, and all this is a dangerous climate that can become explosive. ” Addressing a United Nations summit meeting in New York on Monday, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, called on other European Union countries to take in more refugees from Greece and emphasized the risk of giving “space to nationalistic and xenophobic forces to show their faces. ”",0
1271,Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy     : Information," Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order
By Paul Craig Roberts
 Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the white trash that they are denouncing.
I think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trumps presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup.
The organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions.
The Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians.
The same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that for many Americans across the country, Donald Trumps victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight. This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.
I hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?
What is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, who benefits?
There is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as free trade, is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent.
When US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires.
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the Russian Threat by demonizing Russia.
Accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
The military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up the war on terror to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of the Muslim threat, even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims havent needed an army. Refugees from Washingtons wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.
The excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created the New Hitler in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchys principle agent for heating up the new Cold War.
Hillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But if Trump resolves the Russian threat, the Oligarchy takes an income hit.
Hillarys job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.
Those Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.
In other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that there can be no crime without intent. (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .)
One would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trumps victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him.
In other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trumps government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination.
The protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchys wars to overrun Europe.
Trump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did.
So what are the protesters protesting?
There is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.
The protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet.
The Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.
Trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.
Trump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.
Karl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.
Washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.
Hugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.
According to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.
Latin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be conciliatory.
Trump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.
Trump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washingtons policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans economic prospects.
If tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we wont be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.
Note: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters mandate for their platform.

(Global Dispatch) Following in the footsteps of his father, former Texas Congressman Ron Paul, U.S. Senator Rand Paul announced recently that he saved more than $620,000 from his official FY 2016 operating budget, bringing the total amount Dr. Paul has returned to the taxpayers to over $3,000,000 since taking office in January 2011. 
“It’s easy to picture Washington’s out-of-control spending as a massive, untamable beast,” said Dr. Paul. “So I determined to show change is possible by starting in the area under my control, while working everywhere else I could to stop ‘business as usual.’ 
“I promised Kentuckians I would stand for smaller, more efficient government, balanced budgets, and spending restraint. I’m proud my staff and I have kept that pledge while operating one of the most active federal offices.”",0
1273,"Boaty McBoatface, From Internet Joke to Polar Explorer - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Boaty McBoatface is back, but this time it’s serious. The   remotely operated yellow submarine, bearing a name that began as a joke, will begin its first mission this week through a deep current that starts in Antarctica and goes through the Southern Ocean. Boaty will navigate through underwater waterfalls and rapids on a   mission, collecting data to help scientists understand how global warming affects oceans. It will depart on Friday aboard the James Clark Ross, a British polar research ship, from Punta Arenas, Chile, and will head to the Southern Ocean. The scientists involved can only hope that Boaty McBoatface will find something that draws as much attention to climate change as the odd story of how the vessel got its name. That story started a year ago, when the Natural Environment Research Council, a British government agency, opened a public campaign to name a ship to replace the James Clark Ross. That plan backfired in spectacular fashion, with voters overwhelmingly supporting a name that failed to capture the grandeur that officials were probably looking for: Boaty McBoatface. To the dismay of many, the Science Ministry ignored the results of the poll and announced that the ship would be named after the naturalist David Attenborough. In an attempt to soothe hurt feelings, British officials acknowledged the Boaty McBoatface phenomenon by bestowing the name on a remotely operated submarine that would accompany the David Attenborough in collecting data and samples. Enthusiasm for Boaty McBoatface continued to run high on Monday, even though, as one Twitter user noted, it’s not  a boat, and it doesn’t have a face. The robot submarine’s missions can last for several months and include traveling thousands of miles under ice while reaching depths of about three and a half miles to measure seabed properties on an oceanic scale. The submarine can then rise to the surface to transmit data to oceanographers via a radio link. The British National Oceanography Center says it hopes Boaty will be able to make the first   crossing of the Arctic Ocean. Construction of the David Attenborough, a project expected to cost 200 million pounds, or about $240 million, continues at a shipyard in Liverpool, in northern England. The vessel is expected to become operational in 2019.",0
1274,"Using Special Forces Against Terrorism, Trump Seeks to Avoid Big Ground Wars - The New York Times","MARA, Chad  —   From Yemen to Syria to here in Central Africa, the Trump administration is relying on Special Operations forces to intensify its promised fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups as senior officials embrace an   strategy to minimize the American military’s footprint overseas. In Africa, President Trump is expected to soon approve a Pentagon proposal to remove constraints on Special Operations airstrikes and raids in parts of Somalia to target suspected militants with the Shabab, an extremist group linked to Al Qaeda. Critics say that the change  —   in one of the few rejections of President Barack Obama’s guidelines for the elite forces  —   would bypass rules that seek to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks and commando operations. But in their two months in office, Trump officials have shown few other signs that they want to back away from Mr. Obama’s strategy to train, equip and otherwise support indigenous armies and security forces to fight their own wars instead of having to deploy large American forces to   hot spots. “Africans are at war we’re not,” said Col. Kelly Smith, 47, a Green Beret commander who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and was a director of a counterterrorism exercise in Chad this month involving about 2, 000 African and Western troops and trainers. “But we have a strategic interest in the success of partners. ” Mr. Trump came to office without a clearly articulated philosophy for using the military to fight terrorist groups. He had promised to be more aggressive in taking on the Islamic State  —   even suggesting during the presidential campaign that he had a secret plan  —   but had also signaled a desire to rein in the notion of the United States as the world’s peacekeeper and claimed at various points to have opposed the ground invasion of Iraq. Now, surrounded by generals who have been at the center of a   shift to rely on Special Operations forces to project power without the risks and costs of large ground wars, he is choosing to maintain the same approach but giving the Pentagon more latitude. That leeway carries its own perils. Last week, the Pentagon went to unusual lengths to defend an airstrike in Syria that United States officials said killed dozens of Qaeda operatives at a meeting place  —   and not civilians at a mosque, as activists and local residents maintain. It was yet another example of the mixed success Mr. Trump’s forays with special operators have had so far. An   raid in January by the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 against Qaeda fighters in Yemen marred the president’s first counterterrorism mission, five days after he became commander in chief. In Mosul, however, Special Operations advisers are the American troops closest to the fight in Iraq to oust the Islamic State from its stronghold there. That is also likely to be the case in the impending battle to reclaim Raqqa in eastern Syria. Mr. Trump is largely relying on the policies of his two immediate predecessors, Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush, who were also great advocates of Special Operations forces. On Mr. Obama’s orders, SEAL Team 6 commandos killed Osama bin Laden in his   in Pakistan in 2011. But Mr. Trump seems to have taken that appreciation and reliance to another level. He appointed a retired Marine Corps general, Jim Mattis, as defense secretary, and a   Army officer, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, as his national security adviser. Both men have extensive experience with Special Operations forces. And the National Security Council’s new senior director for counterterrorism, Christopher P. Costa, is a retired Special Forces intelligence officer. Sharing an unusual window into the private conversations between Mr. Trump and his senior commanders, Army Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of the military’s Special Operations Command, said the president had made clear his urgent priority for counterterrorism missions conducted by the military’s elite forces during a visit to military headquarters in Tampa, Fla. last month. “There were some pretty pointed questions about what winning looks like, and how are you going to get there,” General Thomas told a Special Operations conference outside Washington after the presidential visit. And while the Pentagon could eventually send a few thousand more conventional troops to the fights in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, General Thomas warned that senior commanders feared that “more troops on the ground may mean you own the problem when you’re done with it. ” That concern gives weight to arguments for greater reliance on special operators as the Trump administration for now eschews larger deployments of conventional troops and proposes deep cuts in foreign aid and State Department budgets. The global reach of special operators is widening. During the peak of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 13, 000 Special Operations forces were deployed on missions across the globe, but a large majority were assigned to those two countries. Now, more than half of the 8, 600 elite troops overseas are posted outside the Middle East or South Asia, operating in 97 countries, according to the Special Operations Command. Still, about   of the 6, 000 American troops currently in Iraq and Syria are special operators, many of whom are advising local troops and militias on the front lines. About a quarter of the 8, 400 American troops in Afghanistan are special operators. In Africa, about   of the nearly 6, 000 overall troops are Special Operations forces. The only permanent American installation on the continent is Camp Lemonnier, a sprawling base of 4, 000 United States service members and civilians in Djibouti that serves as a hub for counterterrorism operations and training. The United States Air Force flies surveillance drones from small bases in Niger and Cameroon. Elsewhere in Africa, the roles of special operators are varied, and their ranks are small, typically measured in the low dozens for specific missions. Between 200 and 300 Navy SEALs and other special operators work with African allies to hunt shadowy Shabab terrorists in Somalia. As many as 100 Special Forces soldiers help African troops pursue the notorious leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, Joseph Kony. And Navy SEALs are training Nigerian commandos for action in the   delta. The United States is building a $50 million drone base in Agadez, Niger, that is likely to open sometime next year to monitor Islamic State insurgents in a vast area on the southern flank of the Sahara that stretches from Senegal to Chad. Mr. Trump’s tough talk on terrorism has been well received here in Chad, where American Special Operations and military instructors from several Western nations finished an annual   counterterrorism training exercise last week. Many African soldiers and security forces said they would welcome an even larger United States military presence to help combat myriad extremist threats. “Of course we’d like more,” said Hassan Zakari Mahamadou, a police commissioner from Niger. “U. S. forces enhance us. ” The Pentagon has allocated about $250 million over two years to help train the armies and security forces of North, Central and West African countries. But American aid and training alone  —   along with occasional secret unilateral strikes  —   will not be enough to defeat groups like Al Qaeda, Boko Haram and the Islamic State, officials say. “We could knock off all the ISIL and Boko Haram this afternoon,” Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the leader of the military’s Africa Command, told the Senate this month, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “But by the end week, so to speak, those ranks would be filled. ” Here on the outskirts of the Chadian capital, N’Djamena, last week, four   boats with mounted machine guns roared down the Chari River. The boats pulled up along the riverbank, just opposite neighboring Cameroon, and disgorged   Chadian Special Antiterrorism Group forces and their American trainers. In a hail of gunfire, shooting blanks, they stormed the thatched huts of a suspected Boko Haram bomb maker seized laptops, cellphones and other material inside for clues on terrorist operations and dashed back to the river, fending off a mock ambush on the way. Piling back into their boats under covering fire, the Chadian commandos sped off in a drill that American and Chadian officers often play out for real in the nearby Lake Chad Basin area. “Extremism is like a cancer,” said Brig. Gen. Zakaria Ngobongue, a senior Chadian officer who has trained in France and at Hurlburt Field, Fla. and was helping oversee the exercise. “We need to continue to fight it. ”",0
1275,Comment on Chicago Tribune: Hillary Clinton should drop her campaign to be POTUS by stevor,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 12 Comments 
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the agency is re-opening its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton’s unsecured and illegal private email server, as a result of the FBI discovering 650,000 emails of Hillary’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, on a laptop computer that Abedin shares with her now-estranged husband, the disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner. See “ Weinered: FBI re-opens investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails “ 
Experts, such as Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein, say that only the discovery of something truly awful would lead the FBI to reopen its investigation at such a late date, with just days to go before the election. 
Now, a major U.S. newspaper — the Chicago Tribune that endorsed libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president — is saying what needs to be said: Democrats should ask Hillary Clinton to step down, or risk her being elected President who begins her term of office facing a criminal investigation. Note: Founded in 1847, Chicago Tribune is the 8th largest newspaper, by circulation, in the United States. 
Below is Chicago Tribune reporter John Kass’ stunning article in its entirety. 
Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside 
by John Kass • October 29, 2016 
Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday’s FB I announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state? 
We’ll find out soon enough. 
It’s obvious the American political system is breaking down. It’s been crumbling for some time now , and the establishment elite know it and they’re properly frightened. Donald Trump, the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect. 
FBI director James Comey’s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious. 
This can’t be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner’s wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been “reckless” with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution. 
So what should the Democrats do now? 
If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: 
They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately , and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. 
Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. 
Since Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta release another 15,000 emails. 
What if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands. 
The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now . It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media — fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton’s political action committee — should begin demanding it. 
But what will Hillary do? 
She’ll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence. 
She’ll remind the nation that she’s a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been . 
Remember that Bill Clinton leveraged the “Year of the Woman.” Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left — most particularly the women of the left — defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas. 
If you take a step back from tribal politics, you’ll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She’d never be hired. 
As secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn’t remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids. 
And there was no prosecution of Hillary. 
That isn’t merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous. 
And during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants. 
I’ve always figured that, as secretary of state, Clinton kept her home-brew email server — from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information — so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes. 
The Clintons weren’t skilled merchants. They weren’t traders or manufacturers. The Clintons never produced anything tangible. They had no science, patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars. 
All they had to sell, really, was influence. And they used our federal government to leverage it. 
If a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates, then we’ll learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days, won’t we? 
John Kass concluded his article with the observation that a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates . 
So what do the comments from some of the readers of Kass’ article say about the people and this country? Below is a sample: 
MerryPrankster: Real journalists should ask John Kass to step aside. 
millekj61: Do you actually “think” before you write? There are 9 days to go before the election, who do you suggest they substitute for her? 
pagewerks: Did you even do the slightest research? The email “scandal” you’re panting over is non-existent, and apparently has to do with another investigation. But don’t let that stop you from making a damn fool of yourself. 
MChicago99: What is unfathomable about this column and the comments is how disconnected from reality and truth it and the comments are. There has been no reopening of the investigation. THE emails in question are probably all duplicates of emails the FBI has already examined. The FBI did not find anything illegal in Clinton’s use of the personal server. Just a desperate ploy to throw last minute obstacles into the election process. 
Wavo: I believe it is time for you to retire from your “establishment” job at the Tribune John. Your shtick is tiresome and inflammatory. Maybe you should consider a second act over at Breitbart…they and their readers seem to love your work. 
larry_wesbsite: You Trumpites actually want national socialism under a national socialist leader who will ride roughshod over the Constitution seeking what you think are simple fast answers to complex, difficult questions and problems. Maybe you will learn or just blame Trump and move on to the next demagogue. All of us will pay the cost for your mistakes. 
dsm606: Sorry angry old white man. I’m still not voting for Trump. Nice try, though. 
Jim Kaestner: I am tired of tribune columnists telling me how to vote, who to support. Go tell Trump to quit, he has admitted to sexual assault. 
bluedemondan: Excuse me, you sure this isn’t The Onion? I usually confuse The Onion with the Trib’s editorials. 
JNAlbukerk: Kass have you no shame sir? Convicting someone with no evidence? Clinton is the most vetted and experienced candidate in history. Until you have evidence otherwise it is you who should step aside as you have abused the power your employment has granted you.

1276,So ein Ärger! Obama hat über Nacht sämtliche Atomcodes verloren,"Mittwoch, 9. November 2016 So ein Ärger! Obama hat über Nacht sämtliche Atomcodes verloren Washington (dpo) - Wie konnte das nur passieren? Barack Obama soll in der Nacht zum heutigen Mittwoch seinen Atomkoffer verloren haben. Das gab der scheidende Präsident nach den ersten Hochrechnungen zur Wahl bekannt. Er glaube auch nicht, dass dieser innerhalb der nächsten vier Jahre wieder auftauchen werde. In dem Koffer befinden sich unter anderem die streng geheimen Atomcodes, auf die ausschließlich der Präsident Zugriff hat. Obama erklärte sein Missgeschick so: ""Ich schaute gerade gespannt die ersten Prognosen zur Wahl, als ich plötzlich zu meinem Entsetzen bemerkte, dass der Koffer weg war. Was bin ich nur für ein Schussel!"" Er habe zwar sofort das komplette Weiße Haus abgesucht, aber die Codes blieben verschwunden. ""So ein Ärger. Naja, nützt ja nichts. Aber die Codes wurden in der Vergangenheit ja ohnehin nicht benötigt, deshalb ist der Verlust nun nicht ganz so tragisch. Mein Nachfolger wird auch ohne Atomkoffer auskommen. Vielleicht fällt mir ja in vier Jahren wieder ein, wo ich das Ding hingepackt habe."" Nicht hinter dem Sofa, nicht unter dem Schreibtisch und auch nicht von Bo im Garten vergraben... Der Atomkoffer ist und bleibt verschwunden. Zeit für eine noch intensivere Suche hat Obama, der in zwei Monaten das Weiße Haus räumen muss, eigenen Angaben zufolge leider nicht. ""Ich muss ja noch Schönheitsreparaturen für die Übergabe durchführen. Gerade bin ich dabei, alle Räume pink zu streichen."" Es sollte nicht das einzige Missgeschick des Präsidenten bleiben: Nur kurz nach offizieller Bekanntgabe von Trump als Wahlsieger trat ein peinlich berührter Obama erneut vor die Mikrofone und teilte mit, dass er ""blöderweise"" jetzt auch noch ein Glas mit hochaggressiven Termiten fallen hat lassen, die das Weiße Haus bis zur offiziellen Übergabe womöglich schwer beschädigen werden.",0
1277,Forget ‘Pat the Bunny.’ My Child Is Reading Hemingway. - The New York Times,"Alice Hemmer’s favorite part of Jack Kerouac’s novel “On the Road” doesn’t involve the     road trips, encounters with prostitutes in Mexico or wild parties in Manhattan. Alice, who is 5 and lives in a Chicago suburb, likes the part when Sal Paradise eats ice cream and apple pie whenever he feels hungry. She hasn’t actually read Kerouac’s        classic. (Alice is a precocious reader, but not that precocious.) Instead, her father read her a heavily abridged and sanitized illustrated version of “On the Road” designed for   to    children. “She didn’t love it,” said her father, Kurt Hemmer, an English professor at Harper College and scholar of the Beat Generation, who noted that even some college students failed to appreciate the novel’s subtle spiritual message. “To really grasp it, you need to be a bit more mature. ” “On the Road,” with its recurring references to sex, drugs and domestic violence, might not seem like an ideal bedtime story for a child. But that’s precisely the point of KinderGuides, a new series of books that aims to make challenging adult literary classics accessible to very young readers. Along with “On the Road,” KinderGuides recently published picture book versions of Ernest Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea” and Truman Capote’s melancholy novella “Breakfast at Tiffany’s. ” (It skipped over the awkward question of whether Holly Golightly is a prostitute.) In one of its most ambitious and bizarre efforts, it released a cheerful take on Arthur C. Clarke’s opaque,   science fiction novel, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” an allegory about the evolution of human consciousness that many adult readers find impenetrable. With their bright illustrations and breezy language  —   “Sal is ready for an adventure!” pretty much typifies the tone of “On the Road”  —   the books almost seem like parodies, or the perfect gag gift for the hipster parent who has everything. But the creators of the series, the graphic designer Melissa Medina and her partner, the writer Fredrik Colting, insist they aren’t joking. They’re already working on the next four titles in the series  —   versions of Paulo Coelho’s   novel “The Alchemist,” Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice,” J. D. Salinger’s “The Catcher in the Rye” and Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird” (minus the rape charges, Ku Klux Klan rallies and racial slurs). “The goal of all of this is to get them really psyched about these books now, so that they’ll want to read the originals later,” Ms. Medina said. Though the premise of their project may strike some as absurd  —   does a first grader really need to be introduced to Kerouac or Capote?  —   kiddie lit has become a surprisingly lucrative and crowded niche. Anxious parents who played Mozart for their babies in utero and showed them Baby Einstein educational videos have snapped up children’s books that promise to turn their offspring into tiny literature lovers. BabyLit, an imprint that publishes board books for babies based on “Anna Karenina,” “Wuthering Heights,” “Don Quixote” and other classics, has sold more than 1. 5 million copies of its 24 titles. Next fall, the company will introduce a series of picture books based on classic novels geared toward older children, which will include more of the plot, starting with “ ” and “Pride and Prejudice. ” “It’s a more educational approach than just Spot the dog,” said Suzanne Gibbs Taylor, the creator of the BabyLit series. Another popular series, Cozy Classics, which was created by the twin brothers Jack and Holman Wang, reduces great works of literature to   stories, illustrated with photos of handmade felt figurines. (Their rendition of Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” can be rattled off in a single breath: “       !    . ”) Their titles, which include “Jane Eyre,” “Emma” and “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” are designed for babies and toddlers, but include some arch visual jokes directed at the parents, like a felt figurine of Miss Havisham flailing about in flames in “Great Expectations. ” Even with the adorable fuzzy figures, the books can be overwhelming. “My daughter started crying hysterically 3 pages into it,” one reader wrote of her    in an Amazon review of “ . ” Another reviewer questioned whether a toddler is ready for “Jane Eyre,” and called the Cozy Classics version “weird, dark and not the most appropriate for kids who are reading board books. ” Holman Wang said he and his brother wanted to preserve the sometimes grim and complex tone of the originals, rather than conforming to the “fluffy bunny aesthetic” of most contemporary picture books. “It’s not about saying, ‘My    has read ‘Pride and Prejudice,’” he said. “We try not to cheaply capitalize on these   stories by sanitizing them and losing the themes. ” Some educators are skeptical of efforts to   complex literary works to small children, especially when there’s such a rich body of classic children’s literature. “It’s ludicrous to take great works that are clearly for adults and reduce them for children,” said Monica Edinger, a   teacher at the Dalton School in Manhattan, who dismissed KinderGuides as a disingenuous attempt to exploit parents’ insecurities. Still, some parents counter that children can absorb the bigger themes, like the idea of resilience in “The Old Man and the Sea” or adventurousness in “On the Road. ” Brent Almond, a graphic designer and parenting blogger who lives in Maryland, said his    son, Jon, had responded enthusiastically to some of the books. “A lot of these books are melancholy or outright depressing, but it’s been cool to see how he reacts to them,” Mr. Almond said. Jon likes the book based on “2001” the best, because “it’s in space and it’s kind of creepy,” Mr. Almond said. (Jon didn’t seem especially bothered by one of the more chilling scenes, when the ship’s computer, Hal, turns on the astronauts and sends one of them out of the spaceship to his death, Mr. Almond said. ) Ms. Medina and Mr. Colting got the idea for KinderGuides about a year ago, when they were visiting her family in Kansas. Mr. Colting was reading “The Old Man and the Sea,” and Ms. Medina’s    niece asked him what it was about. He realized the story was easy to summarize, and saw a market opportunity. Mr. Colting, a native of Sweden, already had a background in publishing, albeit a somewhat checkered one. In 2009, he was sued by the Salinger estate for publishing an unauthorized sequel to “The Catcher in the Rye. ” He settled the lawsuit and withdrew copies from North America. Despite that earlier legal entanglement, Mr. Colting had no qualms about repurposing famous novels as picture books, including “The Catcher in the Rye. ” He argues that because they function as study guides as well as entertainment, the KinderGuides books don’t infringe on copyrighted works. Some copyright experts dispute that logic. “If you are literally taking a book and trying to translate it for children, taking what makes it literature and copying that, that sounds like infringement,” said Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. This year, Mr. Colting and Ms. Medina started an independent publishing company out of their home in Los Angeles, and began making a list of beloved classics to recast. After choosing their first few titles, they read the original works and highlighted the central themes and characters, and consulted study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes. Mr. Colting wrote the text, and Ms. Medina created storyboards pairing the texts with sketches or descriptions of images. They hired a different illustrator for each book, and printed 20, 000 copies in total for the first four titles. They aim to publish 50 books, though not every classic novel seems feasible. James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” for instance, was considered but ultimately rejected. “We couldn’t in good faith do it,” Mr. Colting said, “because we haven’t read it. ”",0

I’m so happy, so happy, and excited and can’t wait for him to become our president tomorrow. ”  Asked by Breitbart News’ Washington political editor Matt Boyle what she wants to see done on Day One of Trump’s presidency, she said: “Build that wall! Build that wall, stop illegal immigration. Keep American families from being killed by illegal immigrants. ” Dan Golvach, whose son, Spencer, was killed by a   illegal alien, told Trump to stick to his guns. “Keep being yourself,” Golvach said. “No other candidates that were in this race reached out to us.

1280,South Korea’s Top Spies Give New Evidence in Plot to Kill Kim Jong-nam - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   Officials from North Korea’s secret police and Foreign Ministry were involved in the killing of the estranged half brother of the country’s leader, South Korean intelligence officials told lawmakers on Monday. Ever since Kim   the eldest brother of the North Korean leader, Kim   was first reported assassinated, the South Korean government has held the North responsible. On Monday, the National Intelligence Service in Seoul provided more details of what it described as   terrorism, saying that four of the eight North Koreans identified as suspects by the Malaysian authorities were agents from North Korea’s Ministry of State Security, the country’s secret police. Speaking on Monday in a   parliamentary hearing, Lee   the director of the National Intelligence Service, said that two other suspects worked for the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The remaining two were affiliated with Air Koryo, the North’s   airline company, and Singwang Economics and Trading General Corporation, Mr. Lee said, according to two lawmakers who attended the briefing. Singwang is among North Korean companies facing United Nations sanctions. The Malaysian authorities have said that Mr. Kim was killed by an extremely toxic nerve agent known as VX. They said that the North Koreans had hired and trained two women, one from Indonesia, the other from Vietnam, to attack Mr. Kim at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The women smeared his face with the chemical while he was waiting to check in for a flight to Macau, where he and his family had a home, they said. The two women are now in police custody in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Lee, the South Korean intelligence chief, was quoted by the lawmakers as saying that the eight North Koreans, working as two   teams, converged in Kuala Lumpur to carry out the Feb. 13 assassination. He said that Ri   a state security agent, and Ri   a Foreign Ministry official, had brought Doan Thi Huong, a    Vietnamese woman, into the assassination plot, while Siti Aisyah, a    Indonesian woman, was hired by O   a state security agent, and by Hong   a Foreign Ministry official. The four North Koreans who made up the assassination team left Malaysia the same day Mr. Kim was killed and are believed to be back in their country, Mr. Lee was quoted as saying. The Malaysian police have confirmed their departure. Hyon   a senior diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and three other North Koreans worked as a support team, Mr. Lee told the lawmakers, keeping track of Kim  ’s whereabouts and providing logistical assistance. Mr. Hyon worked for the Ministry of State Security, he said. Mr. Hyon and the Air Koryo employee, Kim   remain at the embassy in Malaysia. A third member of the support team, identified as Ri   has been arrested in Kuala Lumpur. The fourth, identified as Ri   is believed to be at large in Malaysia. North Korea’s Ministry of State Security specializes in ferreting out people whose loyalty to Kim  ’s totalitarian regime is in doubt. Mr. Kim is believed to have used the ministry in the arrests and executions of senior officials, including an uncle, Jang   who was executed on charges of corruption and sedition in 2013. The ministry also runs a network of prison camps. During the intelligence briefing on Monday, Mr. Lee told the lawmakers that five senior officials affiliated with the State Security Ministry had been executed with antiaircraft guns. He also said that Gen. Kim   who was removed as chief of the secret police in January, was in detention as part of a purge. Mr. Lee said that General Kim and his five deputies had angered Kim   by filing false reports, but he did not elaborate. The South’s intelligence agency had said earlier that General Kim was dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power. He was the latest in a series of   party and military officials that Kim   has fired, demoted or executed in efforts to consolidate his power through what South Korean officials have called a “reign of terror. ”",0
1281,The Ancient Spiritual Roots Of Russophobia,"280 Views November 06, 2016 No Comments Analyses The Saker 
This article was written for the Unz Review: http://www.unz.com/tsaker/the-ancient-spiritual-roots-of-russophobia/ 
Introduction 
The term “russophobia” (the hatred and/or fear of things Russian) has become rather popular in the recent years, courtesy of the anti-Russian hysteria of the AngloZionist Empire, but this is hardly a new concept. In his seminal book “ Russie-Occident – une guerre de mille ans: La russophobie de Charlemagne à la Crise Ukrainienne ” (“The West vs Russia – a thousand year long war: russophobia from Charlemange to the Ukrainian Crisis”) which I recently reviewed here , Guy Mettan places the roots of russophobia as early as the times of Charlemagne. How could that be? That would mean that russophobia predates the birth of Russia by a full two centuries? And yet, Mettan is correct, although even he does not paint the full picture. 
What I propose to do today is not to discuss modern russophobia which has numerous causes and forms, but to look far back into history for the ancient spiritual roots of this relatively modern phenomenon. 
My thesis will probably trigger even more condescending smirks, expression of outrage and accusations of bigotry and racism than usual. That is fine. In fact, I will welcome them as a visceral reaction to what I propose to uncover below. One glaring weakness of my argument will be that I won’t bother presenting numerous sources as evidence for my assertions. Not only am I not writing an academic paper here, I simply don’t have the time and space needed to substantiate all my claims. Still, all the facts and claims I make below are easily verifiable for anybody with an Internet connection. My goal today is not to convince the naysayers, but to offer a few hopefully useful pointers to those seeking to connect the dots and see the full picture. This being, said, let’s now go far back in time. 
A 2000 year old dispute 
Those who believe that the Romans crucified Christ better stop reading here and go back to the comfort of ignorance. Those who have actually read the New Testament or, for that matter, the basic Judaic texts on this topic, know that Christ was accused and executed for the crime of blasphemy: He claimed to be the Son of God, the Son of Man (a messianic title), the messiah announced by the prophets and that He was God: “ Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM ” (John 8:58) (this “I AM” is a direct reference to Exodus 3:14). This claim is what split the Jewish people into those who accepted Christ’s claims and believed Him and those who did not. What is interesting here, is the view which the Jews who did accept Christ had of those Jews who did not. As we all know, Saint John the Theologian wrote the famous words “ I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan ” (Rev 2:9). And Christ Himself said “ If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham ” (John 8:39). What we see here is the basis for a claim which was first made in the Apostolic times and which was later fully endorsed and further developed by the Church Fathers: those Jews who rejected Christ thereby lost their “Jewishness” and the “new Jews” are the Christians, regardless of ethnicity, which now have become the new “chosen people”. In our modern times of hyper-political correctness and generalized “ecumenical dialogs of love”, Christians are mostly ignorant of theses facts and, when they are, they dare not mention them in public. At a time when Popes declare that Jews are their “older brothers”, that they need not accept Christ and that Christians and Jews are awaiting the same 2 nd coming of Christ, saying that Christianity denies Jews their very Jewish identity is definitely “ mauvais ton ”. But before the 20 th century, this Christian claim that modern “Jews” were not really Jews anymore was common knowledge, both amongst Christians and amongst Jews. 
[Sidebar: as I explained it in some details here , modern “Judaism” is not the religion of “Abraham, Isaac and Jacob” but the religion of Maimonides, Karo and Luria and has its roots in the teachings of the sect of the Pharisees, the Talmud and the Kabbalah. The closest modern heir to Christ-rejecting Jews of the times of Christ would be the Karaite sect. Modern “Judaism” really ought to be called “Phariseic Talmudism”. For a traditional Patristic look at Phariseic Talmudism, please see here and here ] 
Conversely, Judaic teaching about Christ are not sympathetic either. A quick read of the Toldot Yeshu or, for that matter, the passages about Christ in the Talmud, will convince anyone in need of convincing that the Pharisees’ hatred for Christ was not satiated with His crucifixion. And lest anybody think that this is all racist drivel by blue-eyed Nazis, here is a good article on this topic from Ha’artez corroborating it all. 
Nowadays an uninformed observer might erroneously conclude that there is a big love-fest between Judaics and Christians, but to the extend that this is true, this is solely due to the fact that most modern Christians and Judaics have long ceased to believe, think and act in accordance to their own traditions. The reality is that for traditional Christians, modern Judaics are fallen, lapsed, people who have failed to live up to their election by God and who now are determined to take by force what had been promised to them by God. For traditional Judaics, Christians are idolaters of the worst kind, as they worship a blaspheming magician, born of a promiscuous hairdresser and a Roman legionnaire, who was justly executed for his crimes and who now forever is confined to hell where he boils in excrements. And lest anybody believe that this hostility is only a matter of a long gone past, I would add that while the Judaics are still waiting for as their messiah, the Christian consensus patrum indicates that this Judaic messiah will be the very same person whom Christ and the Apostles called the Antichrist. 
Why does all this matter? It matters because at the very core of it all is the claim that Gentiles have replaced Jews as the chosen people of God, that Christians are the “new Jews” and that modern day Jews are simply not Jews at all, not only because most of them are more Khazarian than Jewish, but because their faith, traditions and beliefs are not the ones of the ancient Jewish people as described in the Old Testament. In other words, Christianity says that Jews are not Jews. 
A 1000 year old dispute 
Western history books usually say that Rome was sacked in 410 and fell in 476. The former is true, but the latter is completely false as it conflates the city of Rome and the Roman Empire. Only the city of Rome and the western Roman Empire came to an end in the 5 th century, but that very same Roman Empire continued to exist in the East for a full 1000 years (!), until the 1453 when the Ottomans finally captured the city of Constantinople. In fact, the imperial capital of the Roman Empire had been moved from Rome to the city of Constantinople, the “New Rome”, by the Emperor Constantine in 320. Thus, the Rome which, at various times, Visigoths, Vandals and Ostrogoths sacked was no longer the capital of the Roman Empire. 
These two crucial dates, 476 and 1453, are often used to mark the beginning and the end of the Middle-Ages (along with other dates between the 5 th and the 15 th century). And since I am setting up the crucial dates for my argument, I will add another one here: 1054, the “official” date for the so-called “Great Schism” between, on one hand, Rome (the city) and, on the other, the other four Patriarchates founded by the Apostles: the Patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople. 
At this point, things get complicated and a halfway decent explanation of what really took place would require no less than 100 pages, including a discussion of dogmatic theology, culture, sociology and, of course, politics. The best I can provide at this point are a few bullet-point style sentences summarizing what happened: 
The Franks, especially Charlemagne, decided that they would re-create the Roman Empire. To be truly Romans, the Franks also wanted to make their own, original, contribution to Christian theology. They did so by making an addition to the so-called “Symbol of Faith”, or “Credo” in Latin, a text which summarizes the key Christian beliefs. Furthermore, since they were now occupying Rome, the former imperial capital of the Empire, the Franks felt that they were in control of the spiritual capital of the Christian world and that, therefore, the rest of the Christian world ought to accept the primacy of the bishop of Rome – called the “Pope” – and his right to impose a new dogma on the entire Christian world. Following roughly 200 years of tensions between the (Frankish-occupied) Rome and the (still free) eastern Roman Empire the final separation took place in 1054 when the Pope excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople who then returned him the favor. What is important for our purposes is this: not only did the Frankish invasion of Rome mark the end of the Roman civilization in the West, it also cut-off the western world from the Roman Empire which continued to exist for another ten centuries. The process of severance between the two parts of the Empire began in the 5 th century following the fall of the city of Rome and continued throughout the following centuries. During the 10 th century, Rome suffered during the so-called dark ages ( saeculum obscurum ) and the so-called the “Rule of the Harlots” ( pornokratia ). At a time when the Roman Empire in the east was almost at the apex of its glory, the Franks were indulging in an orgy of destruction and corruption which completely changed the face of the western part of the European continent and completely severed the vital cultural and spiritual ties which had kept the Roman Empire together in the past centuries. 
During the following 1000 years while the Roman Empire continued its existence in the East, the European Middle-Ages slowly and painfully gave birth to a new civilization, the West European civilization, which really took its first mature shape during the Renaissance with it’s re-discovery of the ancient Greek and Roman world. Whatever form this so-called “re-discovery” took, it is a fact that the 1000 years of the Middle-Ages separate modern western civilization from the Roman civilization and that modern Europe was born not of the Romans, but of the Franks. The (Orthodox) East, however, has never known any “Middle-Ages” and has maintained a cultural and religious continuity to the ancient Christian world and the Roman Empire. 
In the West, the so-called “Roman Catholic Church” (another misnomer – there is nothing Roman or “catholic” – meaning “universal” – about the Papacy as it is Frankish and local) likes to present itself as the original Church whose roots and traditions go back to the Apostolic times. This is simply false. The reality is that the religion which calls itself “Roman Catholic” is a relatively new religion, younger than Islam by several centuries, which was born in the 11 th century of a rejection of the key tenets of the 1000 year long Christian faith. Furthermore, from the moment of its birth, this religion has embarked on an endless cycle of innovations including the 19 th century (!) dogmas of the Papal infallibility and the Immaculate Conception. Far from being conservative or traditionalists, the Latins have always been rabid innovators and modernists. 
Nowadays there are many Christian denominations out there, but only the Orthodox Churches can testify to the fact that the Frankish local Church is neither Roman, nor Catholic, that it’s roots are not in the Apostolic times, but in the (dark) Middle-Ages and that far from being a heir to the 2000 year old faith “ which the Lord gave, was preached by the Apostles, and was preserved by the Fathers ” to use the words of Saint Athanasios, the Latin faith is nothing but a collection of deviations from the original Christian faith. 
The feared and hated witness 
Now we see a pattern here. Both for the Judaics and for the Latins, the Orthodox Christians are the only witnesses out there who can (and do!) openly challenge not only their legitimacy, but their very identity. From an Orthodox perspective (and here I am referring to the traditional, Patristic, point of view) modern Jews are not Jews and the Catholics are not catholic . In both cases, we are dealing with very successful frauds, but frauds nonetheless. Orthodox Christians believe that they, and they alone, are both the real Jews and the real Catholics. Modern Jews are nothing but Pharisees while Latins are simply heretics. Jews were called to be the Chosen People while Rome used to be recognized as the “first amongst equals” by the other Patriarchates. Alas, in both cases a tragic fall from grace occurred in a manner reminiscent of Lucifer’s fall from Heaven (“ How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! ” Isa 14:12). And to those who would say that such a claim is preposterous, Orthodox Christians would simply point at the immense corpus of Patristic writings which has always supported that claim. The only option for somebody rejecting this claim is to reject Christianity itself. 
My argument here is not a historical or theological one. Regardless of whether one accepts or not the Orthodox view of modern “Judaism” and “Roman Catholicism” – it is certain that both Judaics and Latin were quite aware of this view (there were plenty of polemical texts written over the centuries by all sides to this dispute) and that this challenge to their very legitimacy and identity was perceived as a monumental affront and, when supported by an immense and powerful empire like the Russian one, a mortal enemy which had to be either conquered or eliminated. 
[Sidebar: Islam. It is interesting to note here that Orthodox Christianity, which Muslims called “Rum” as in Rome, in no way challenges the legitimacy or identity of Islam. While Islam and Christianity have plenty of irreconcilable theological differences, Muslims do not claim to be Jews or Christians. As for Orthodox Christians, they obviously do not claim to be the true or original, Muslims. Thus the co-existence of these two religions is not logically mutually exclusive even if their theologies are fundamentally incompatible]. 
The modern dispute 
It would be ridiculous to claim that the cause(s) modern fear and/or hate of things Russian can all be explained by ancient theological arguments. In reality, neither Russia nor the West are all that religious nowadays. And while there is definitely a religious rebirth taking place in Russia, it remains also true that only a minority of Russians are truly religious or well-versed in Orthodox theology. Furthermore, there are plenty of reasons why some hate/fear Russia which have absolutely nothing to do with religion, including the fact that Russia is, and has always been, an unconquered military superpower, that the Soviet regime has oppressed millions of people in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union and that any more or less sovereign and independent regime in Russia stands as the main obstacle for the West to take control of Russia’s immense resources and many other reasons. As for (truly religious) Judaics and Latins, they are a small minority compared to the vast majority of largely agnostic people around them. In reality, modern russophobia has numerous independent “vectors” all contributing to a grand “sum vector” expressed in the West’s current policies towards Russia. And yet. 
Regardless of the actual level of religiosity in Russia, Russia remains the objective historical and cultural heir to the Roman Empire: the First Rome fell in 476, the Second Rome fell in 1453 while the Third Rome fell in 1917. 
[Sidebar: A Fourth Rome cannot happen simply because, unlike what happened with the First and Second Rome, the Third one could not “pass on” its role to a hypothetical Fourth one. Seventy years of Communist rule will forever remain and unsurmountable barrier between Russia the Third Rome and modern Russia and not true succession is now possible] 
To ignore the historical importance of a Christian Roman civilization which lasted from the 4 th to the 20 th century would be a major oversight. Those 16 centuries have had a huge impact on the Russian culture, even upon those Russians who are only superficially religious or outright agnostic, and they still can be felt today. The same is true for what is called the “West” nowadays: what is the AngloZionist Empire if not the cultural continuation of the British Empire with the Zionist (and, thus, Judaic) element recently added to it ? And don’t let the fact that Protestants and Anglicans are not “Roman Catholics” distract you from the reality that Protestantism itself is just the offspring from the spiritual intercourse between its Latin and Judaic parents, just as Freemasonry – the dominant ideology and worldview today – is the offspring resulting from the spiritual intercourse between of Protestantism and Phariseic Judaism. Whether we are aware of it or not, we live in “civilizational realms” which have ancient roots and our worldview and outlook on life are often shaped by a past which we often know very little about. 
Conclusion 
There is a clash of civilizations taking place. It does not primarily oppose a putative “Christian West” to Islam. For one thing, the modern “West” has long ceased to be Christian and should now be categorized as post-Christian. Furthermore, the Muslim world is not united and does not have the resources to meaningfully oppose the AngloZionist Empire. Until China, Latin America or some other civilization truly rises up to be able to challenge the current world order, Russia is the only country which will dare to openly challenge the very legitimacy of the western political system and the ideology it has been built upon. Modern Russia is both capable and willing to challenge the dominant western ideology (from Capitalism to the belief that homosexuality is a normal and healthy variation of human sexuality ) precisely because of her position as the heir to, and continuator of, the Christian Roman Empire. True, for the past 300 years or so, Russia has been ruled by a generally westernized ruling elite, but that elite itself has always remained a foreign superstructure imposed upon the Russian nation which never truly identified with it. With Putin Russia has finally found a leader who does not represent the interests of the elites, but rather the interests of the vast majority of the population – hence Putin’s stratospheric popularity ratings. And that too frightens the West, especially the western elites who now feel that their rule is threatened by a nuclear superpower which is determined not to let them take over our entire planet. It is impossible to predict what will happen next. But it does appear likely to me that this ancient conflict between two fundamentally opposed spiritualities and civilizations will come to some kind of a resolution, for better or for worse, in the near future.

1282,"Washington, DC Bar-Goers Express Disappointment over James Comey Hearing - Breitbart","Although around 500 people excitedly gathered at Union Pub Tuesday morning in Washington, D. C. in anticipation of the live airing of a Senate hearing featuring former FBI Director James Comey, many left disappointed. [At least 50 people were in line before the bar opened at 9:30 a. m. for the 10:00 a. m. Senate intelligence hearing, including unemployed former government officials. A woman standing in line at Union Pub said she looked forward to hearing “Comey tell the truth. ”  But after roughly     hours, people shuffled out, calling it “underwhelming. ” “It’s what I expected, it’s underwhelming, nothing explosive has been revealed so far. James Comey is pragmatic, he’s a Washingtonian who still has a lot of his future career ahead of him. He does not want to create unnecessary conflict,” said one man, who wished not to be named. “The investigation is not a public matter. It is a legal, technical, and professional matter. But people here in DC are turning it into the Super Bowl,” said another man, who also did not want to be named. An office manager at a university named Derek said he was happy that Comey called the President a “liar” but said he wanted some evidence. “I want there to be tapes,” he said. Another man who wished to remain anonymous said he was “hoping to hear more damning testimony, more smoking guns,” but that Comey “phrased things carefully to be accurate. ” One man with a computer wallpaper that said “Impeach Trump” refused to talk to Breitbart. Several people said they hoped more would come out of a closed hearing later in the day, where Comey can discuss classified information. “What we got out of this hearing was an affirmation of what we already knew. Any juicy bombshells will come out of the closed door meetings,” he said. A man named Ben, who is currently unemployed but used to work at the State Department, said that the “best hope” for Trump getting impeached would be the Democrats winning the House, since he doesn’t see Republicans going along with it. But one man, Christopher, who worked at Trader Joe’s, said he was happy with Comey’s performance, despite him not opining on whether there was any obstruction of justice. “Comey was in control, got his message out. He knows it’s not to say whether it’s obstruction. He did what he set out to do,” he said. Another said he came just to “enjoy Comey’s testimony. ” “He’s a rock of integrity,” Tom, a computer science major, said. “He’s willingly testified against and for both sides. ” Another man, Alex, who works in environmental relations for a utility, did not hide his anger. “My take can’t be quoted in a family friendly publication. It shows how   everything is  —   a bunch of senior Republicans abase themselves in a grotesque manner as they run flack for a man they’re covering for him and abasing themselves even though this is national security,” he said. Paul, an Army veteran and Ph. D. student, said there was “something for everyone here. ” “This is just confirmation bias both sides will find stuff that benefits them,” he said. There was only one person, a government affairs intern named Alex, who identified himself as a Republican in the elite DC watering hole. He called the hearing “same old, same old. ” “The only person who effectively pressed Comey was Marco Rubio. I’m not a Trump fanatic, but if he does well, it’s good for the country. We have an issue in this country of unprecedented division,” he said.",0
1283,TIME Cover Features Stephen K. Bannon - Breitbart,"TIME magazine features former Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon as “The Great Manipulator” in Donald Trump’s administration. [The cover story, authored by David Von Drehle, describes how Bannon considers himself a honey badger tearing down the establishment.  Over a piece of old nature footage, a clever narrator commented on a   beast known as a honey badger. Through bee stings, snakebites and other degradations, the animal never stops killing and eating. “Honey Badger don’t give a shit,” the narrator summed up. Bannon adopted the phrase as a motto. Official Washington and its counterparts around the globe are struggling to understand just how much the honey badgers are now running the show. There is no doubt the badgers are starving for change and don’t care if they get stung by swarms of pundits, incumbents, lobbyists and donors —  not to mention foreign leaders and denizens of Davos. In fact, they seem to like it. Describing Bannon as a “manipulator” is part of a growing false narrative set by the left that Trump is not in control of his own administration. New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman described the “Steve   White House” while the left is demanding the impeachment of “President Bannon. ” Bannon has worked closely with the president to implement his agenda despite efforts from the Washington establishment to bend the Trump administration to abandon campaign promises that got him elected.

1284,School Parade in Taiwan Featuring Swastikas and Nazis Unleashes Uproar - The New York Times,"TAIPEI, Taiwan  —   A high school parade in Taiwan in which students dressed as Nazi soldiers and carried swastika banners has created a storm of criticism in one of Asia’s most open societies. Hsinchu   High School in Hsinchu City held the parade, which focused on Adolf Hitler, as part of the school’s anniversary celebrations on Friday. The parade also featured cardboard tanks. The students chose the theme, according to local news reports. Photographs of the event spread quickly online, creating a backlash, with the unofficial diplomatic missions of Israel and Germany issuing letters of protest. The episode resulted in the resignation of the school’s principal, Cheng   this week. Mr. Cheng said that he took responsibility, adding that the primary issue was “our education’s problem,” according to local news reports. “It wasn’t necessarily a problem created by the children. ” Taiwanese textbooks, like those in other Asian countries, focus on fighting in Asia during World War II, resulting in lower awareness of events in Europe. In addition to the Israeli and German missions’ responses, the Chabad Taipei Jewish Center also issued a statement expressing regret about “the use of Nazi imagery and logos by students in Taiwan, as it reopens historical wounds suffered by the Jewish people. ” Ross Feingold, chairman of the center, said that many people in Taiwan were unaware that there were more than 1, 000 Jews living among them, many of them   residents with businesses or investments on the island. “Certainly it’s not meant to be an act of ” Mr. Feingold said. “Holocaust education is extremely limited here. ” The parade in Hsinchu is not the first incident in which Nazi references have offended Jews and other groups in Taiwan. In 1999, an advertisement for   DBK space heaters in Taiwan featured a smiling Hitler with the caption, “Declare war on the cold front!” The next year, a restaurant with a concentration camp theme opened, closing weeks after it became a source of outrage. In 2001, the governing Democratic Progressive Party created a television advertisement contrasting Hitler with John F. Kennedy and other leaders, which the party modified after protests from the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei and others. Officials at the school, which is private but receives subsidies from Taiwan’s Ministry of Education, have said they will show their students movies such as “Schindler’s List” to better educate them on the atrocities of the Holocaust. “A   showing of a movie is not a sustainable program,” Mr. Feingold said. “What is more sustainable is reaching out to the Jewish community that lives here in Taiwan, many of whom have relatives who died in or survived the Holocaust. ”",0
1285,Three Quarters Of Americans Oppose Gun Control,"Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
Steve   
A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . 
The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. 
The findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. 
The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are “against” a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or “assault weapons”as the corporate media refers to them. 
That figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. 
Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. 
In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. 
In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a “paradox”: 
Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. 
The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton’s position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. 
Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. 
Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt–and eventually end–gun manufacturing in the United States.

1286,The Playlist: Burial and Laura Marling Slip Deeper Into the Void - The New York Times,"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos  —   and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. You can listen to this playlist on Spotify here. Like this Playlist? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes. com, and sign up for our Louder newsletter (coming soon!) here. The electronic musician who calls himself Burial deals in blurry, melancholy, ominous implications. His first release since 2013 is a pair of tracks that are never far from dissolving into entropy. “Young Death” can be glimpsed from the farthest fringe of dance music most of it has fairly steady but nearly subliminal beats, though they are submerged deep in the mix. Much closer to the foreground are crackly sounds  —   a storm? a burning city?  —   and voices singing words that would be soothing if they didn’t sound so utterly lost: “Don’t fear,” “Don’t cry,” “I will always be there for you. ” The beat is absorbed by the static, to be replaced by one that’s slower and even less supportive. “I’ll be there, promise I’ll be,” a voice offers before the haze swallows it, too. “Nightmarket” is an even more shadowy, attenuated travelogue. Its passages of blippy arpeggios are separated by lengthy stretches with echoes of wind chimes, distant keening voices, screams, whispers and stray spoken words  —   “Come with me,” “the frontier,” “over here!”  —   that only lead deeper into the void. JON PARELES The title of Laura Marling’s ravishing new song isn’t meant as a descriptor, but rather a note of anguish  —   like the word “water” as rasped by someone crawling across a desert. “Oh my hopeless wanderer,” she sings at the start of the track, tracing an upward arpeggio in a minor key. “You can’t come in, you don’t live here anymore. ” Still, Ms. Marling toys with aspects of seduction in the song’s arrangement, which leans heavy on a sinuous electric bass, and in the video, which she directed herself. Inspired by a series of dreams she had while making her new album  —   “Semper Femina,” due out in March  —   it’s a vision of human bodies as sculptural forms, and also an argument for physical intimacy as just another mode of performance. NATE CHINEN If you are the sort of person who expends much energy stressing about the fact that rapper du jour Lil Yachty had not, until recently, listened to the music of the Notorious B. I. G. then little in this   freestyle  —   on the Beats 1 radio show of his longtime antagonist Ebro Darden  —   will change your mind. Rather than concede to the beat  —   Craig Mack’s “Flava In Ya Ear,” the remix of which featured B. I. G.  —   and perform a flow that recalled the original, in an act of homage, Yachty goes rogue, rapping in elongated sentences that stretch past the ordinary beat boundaries. It’s not quite virtuoso, but it’s intriguing  —   the sound of a rapper following the beat in his head, not his earphones: I’m in a Benz and I’m getting a BentleyI’m reading texts from last night, she said ‘I love how you bent me’I just bought a Benz and it said ‘please take me’You wanna buy it but you can’t, so you’re rentingYou take it back in six months, if there’s no denting JON CARAMANICA “Arkansas,” by the rising Texas country singer Troy Cartwright, is wonderfully patient. On this song, from his recent EP, “Don’t Fade,” he muses about the stability of a relationship (“Is this love or is this convenience? ”) and, after a couple of minutes, comes to no conclusions. And yet his voice is remarkably free of anxiety  —   he’ll wait as long as it takes, play it as it lays. That’s clearest when he’s not singing at all: the   at the song’s end that’s just melancholy, stretched out ambient notes with cricket noises screaming for attention in the background. J. C. You won’t hear Paul Simon’s voice until after the   mark on “Stranger,” a hypnotic new track featuring elements of his recent songs “The Werewolf” and “The Clock. ” Made by Nico Segal and Nate Fox of the Social Experiment  —   a Chicago group best known for its affiliation with Chance the Rapper  —   it’s a remix and   but also an imaginative new creation. Those first two minutes involve some sharp, brooding horn playing by Mr. Segal, who until recently went by the name Donnie Trumpet. The production on the track is dreamy but also clearly drawn, so that Mr. Simon’s voice, when it does surface, practically crackles in the mix. N. C. “When and where did we go cold?” Oliver Sim of the xx wonders in “On Hold,” the single previewing the xx’s album “I See You,” due Jan. 13. It’s a familiar sentiment for the xx, an English band known for   introspection and dialogues of estrangement sung by Mr. Sim and Romy Madley Croft. But now the band is visible by daylight, and they even smile now and then. The video clip for “On Hold” is set under the cloudless blue skies of Marfa, Tex. the town known for Donald Judd’s Chinati Foundation, a Minimalist monument. When Mr. Sim and Ms. Madley Croft aren’t trading recriminations and regrets (via landlines) the video shows glimpses of   life, including a romance between a football player and a cheerleader. Meanwhile, the song presents the xx as no longer rigorously minimalistic. A dance beat periodically surges in the mix, echoing what Jamie xx has been doing as a solo act and club D. J. meanwhile, a sample from Hall  Oates’s “I Can’t Go for That” suggests that the xx isn’t entirely isolated from pop after all. J. P. The new album by the cornetist and composer Taylor Ho Bynum is “Enter the PlusTet,” a rich textural odyssey featuring a   orchestra. It’s a grand statement, but hardly the only thing Mr. Bynum has been working on. A couple of months ago, at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, he introduced a smaller band he calls Rank Sentimentalist, whose ranks include the electric bassist Stomu Takeishi and the cellist Marika Hughes. This video captures the opening song in the set: a   hallucinatory cover of “Black Lake,” by Björk. Stick with the clip for the full     minutes, and you’ll begin to understand how improvisers like Mr. Bynum can turn a brief scrap of melody into something as churning and vast as an oceanic swell. N. C. Jamire Williams is a drummer with a   capacity for groove, which has served him well as a sideman. He also has his own band, Erimaj  —   but on “      EFFECTUAL,” he pares down almost entirely to solo drum kit, creating a series of poetic experiments in rhythm and tonal color. The album, produced by Carlos Niño, recalls jazz precursors like Max Roach as well as   loops and West African folk drumming. And while there isn’t much in the way of melody, the closing track, “Collaborate With God,” features some atmospheric keyboard work by Chassol, the French soundtrack composer who can also be heard on Frank Ocean’s recent visual album, “Endless. ” N. C. A technological collapse is just the entry point to a personal one in “A Lost Machine,” from a Grandaddy album due in March. The music unites fragility and majesty, placing Jason Lytle’s high, quavery voice atop a piano hymn that swells into a vastly reverberant processional, like Neil Young leading Pink Floyd. The lyrics start out by sketching a   landscape, where wandering people desperately seek shelter in a “canyon land” littered with old, obsolete gadgets. But that’s their problem: Halfway through, Mr. Lytle turns his voice into a chorale and laments: “Everything about us is a lost   about we is a forgotten dream. ” A broken world can’t compare to a broken heart.

1287,Facebook ‘Fact-checker’ Poynter: Worth Considering ‘Fake News’ Didn’t Significantly Impact 2016 Election,"The Poynter Institute, the group helping Facebook determine whether certain news stories are “disputed,” has determined it is worth considering the possibility that “fake news” stories did not significantly impact the 2016 presidential election after all. [Poynter’s Chief Media Writer James Warren was reporting on a study concluding that while “fake news” stories favoring Donald Trump far surpassed those in favor of Hillary Clinton, such stories didn’t significantly affect the outcome of the election. “Did fake news help elect Trump? Not likely, according to new research,” was the title of the Poynter article.  In response to the study, Warren concluded: The paper is worth consideration especially given overriding press assumptions about the potency of ideologically driven news coverage. The study, titled, “Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,” was   by economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University.  The paper utilized web browsing data, a database of   fake news stories, and a   online survey about news trends. Warren reported on the survey results: In sum, they conclude that the role of social media was overstated, with television remaining by far the primary vehicle for consuming political news. Just 14 percent of Americans deemed social media the primary source of their campaign news, according to their research. In addition, while fake news that favored Trump far exceeded that favoring Clinton, few Americans actually recalled the specifics of the stories and fewer believed them. “For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads,” they conclude. Poynter further quoted from the survey itself: “In summary, our data suggest that social media were not the most important source of election news, and even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a small fraction of Americans. For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0. 7 percent of Clinton voters and   who saw it to shift their votes to Trump, a persuasion rate equivalent to seeing 36 television campaign ads. ” Poynter’s reportage on the matter is particularly significant since the journalism nonprofit has partnered with Facebook with the specific goal of combatting “fake news. ”  This after numerous politicians and pundits have claimed that alleged fake news helped sway the election. The International   Network (IFCN) which is a project of the Poynter Institute, drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook last month explained it will work with “    organizations” that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the “fact checking organizations” determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, “there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

As the due date approached, Mr. Janu found himself praying for a girl. In the delivery room at St. Agnes Hospital, after more than 20 hours of labor, the infant finally arrived,   and wailing. The newborn had Mr. Janu’s blue eyes and Mrs. Janu’s full lips and nose. The new father exulted. Then he felt the weight of his new reality. “Now, I have a black son in Baltimore,” the white police detective remembered thinking as he cradled his baby boy. Wesley William Janu, born on May 23, 2016, smiled for the first time during a summer bloodied by the worst confrontations between   and the police in decades: The    killings in July of black men in Baton Rouge, La. and Falcon Heights, Minn. followed by the killings of five officers in Dallas and three more in Baton Rouge. This month, protesters burned buildings and clashed with law enforcement officers in Milwaukee after an armed black man was shot to death there by the police. The violence has been wrenching for families like the Janus, an interracial couple struggling to straddle the nation’s racial fault lines in a red brick rowhouse in a quiet corner of Baltimore. But the heated national discussions over policing and race feel particularly piercing for a black woman born in the South and her white husband who wears a badge. They know their son is taking his place in the world at a time of promise and unease. Wesley will learn to sit up on his own during the final term of the nation’s first   president. He will celebrate his first birthday in 2017, the year that will mark the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that overturned state bans on interracial marriage. By the time he is 28, more than half of the population in the United States will very likely be members of ethnic or racial minority groups or mixed race, according to the Census Bureau. Yet this is also a time when black and white Americans find themselves deeply divided. In Wesley’s face, there are glimpses of the country’s racial future, yet that future often feels uncertain and unsettled. Born in Louisiana, Mrs. Janu grew up in a predominantly white suburb in upstate New York, joined a white sorority in college and married a white detective. Yet these days, she fears that racism and bias might be “ ” into society and wonders how that might affect her family. She worries as her husband holsters his Glock 22, kisses her goodbye and heads out the door to pursue gun runners and violent criminals in this predominantly black city. Will he be a target now on the street? She worries as she has adjusted to the rhythms of    feedings and diaper changes. What dangers might Wesley face as a teenager at the hands of the police? And then there is the racial divide that runs right through her living room, the issues that occasionally create a rift between husband and wife. Mrs. Janu, 31, is a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, for instance, while Mr. Janu, 42, argues that some of its activists “do more harm than good” and spew “a lot of hate” toward the police. “Am I being a disloyal law enforcement wife because I do feel so strongly for Black Lives Matter, because I do feel such a strong affinity for the movement?” asked Mrs. Janu, describing her internal turmoil during 12 weeks of maternity leave. “I try to see both sides of it,” she said. “It leaves me a little bit torn. ” The warnings flashed on Mr. Janu’s cellphone after nightfall on July 7 as he cruised through downtown Baltimore in his unmarked police car. It was his first inkling that a calamity was unfolding. “Watch your back,” one friend texted. “Be safe out there,” another wrote. At home, Mrs. Janu was trying to erase the image of a dying black man from her mind. She had delighted that day in one of Wesley’s milestones, when she realized he was following her every move with his eyes, and recorded the thrill in an app tracking his development. But then, as she was nursing her baby, she signed onto Facebook and there was Philando Castile, slumped and bleeding in his car in Minnesota, while his girlfriend filmed her confrontation with the officer who had shot him. Mrs. Janu scrambled to press the pause button, but she had already seen too much. She sat stunned on the sofa, with Wesley in her arms, reliving her fears about his future. She was asleep by the time Mr. Janu came home. By then, he knew why he had received the urgent texts. Five Dallas police officers had been shot to death that night. Shaken, he stayed up all night, flipping between CNN, MSNBC and Fox until dawn. Only then did he talk to his wife about what had happened in Texas. “All I wanted to do was hug her,” he said. The couple met six years ago, casually introduced by mutual friends who were shocked when they got together. Mrs. Janu, who is wry and bracingly frank, had vowed never to date a police officer. She had grown up hearing her parents’ stories about ugly encounters between   and the police in the segregated South. She remembers the day her father was pulled over. She was 7 at the time, sitting in the back seat. And she still remembers the pains he took afterward  —   checking and rechecking his turn lights and headlights  —   to ensure that it would never happen again. “Bullies,” she said,    describing the men she assumed joined the force. Mr. Janu, who is stocky, bald and bearded, looked like a character in a television crime drama. He had spent a decade in the military and a decade on the police force, mostly in a specialized squad that focused on gun sales and gun offenders. But he was unlike any officer she had encountered. He was silly and cracked her up. He had studied marine biology in college, loved travel and art and shared her nostalgia for “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” the cult television series. (The Janus named their son and one of their dogs, Buffy, a Maltese poodle mix, after characters in the show.) His father, who abhors interracial relationships, stopped speaking to him. Mr. Janu was undeterred by his disapproval, and by the stream of news articles and blog posts that Mrs. Janu emailed him, warning about the challenges facing interracial couples and parents of biracial children. But the pain still surfaces. A year ago, Mr. Janu bumped into his father while he was visiting family near Cleveland. His father stood up without speaking, strode to his white convertible and locked the door. Mr. Janu chased after him, pounding his fists on the car windows. “Why won’t you talk to me?” he remembered shouting before his father drove off. Sometimes, the Janus manage to put that aside, the knowledge that their son might never meet his paternal grandfather, and their fears about what he might face as a young man. They lose themselves in the cocoon of their   home, shouting out answers to the contestants on “Family Feud,” chatting about the summer electric bill, the paperwork for day care and their perennial efforts to prod Wesley to nap just a little bit longer, which most recently involved the purchase of an outfit called “Baby Merlin’s Magic Sleepsuit. ” “He slept for three hours!”  Mrs. Janu announced gleefully to her astonished husband one recent evening when he arrived home from work. They focus on Wesley  —   Mr. Janu calls him “Little Man”  —   on the grip of his fingers, the pout of his lower lip, the way he scales tall buildings with his eyes. “I think he wants to climb them,” joked his father, who envisions his boy hurling a football and sliding into home plate. But this summer, the ugliness of the outside world has always seemed to intrude. Just days after the Dallas shootings, one of Mr. Janu’s colleagues, an officer who had attended his wedding, narrowly escaped a spray of gunfire. Some in the department worried initially that the assailant had intended to ambush the police. Two weeks later, as Mrs. Janu was pulling the new sleepsuit out of the package, Mr. Janu called to tell her that his squad was bracing for protests. The state’s attorney in Baltimore had announced that she was dropping the case against the officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who was found to have a fatal spinal cord injury after being transported in a police van. Mrs. Janu, who works for the federal government on the Affordable Care Act, was still on maternity leave. “There’s going to be rioting  —   is that what you’re saying?” asked Mrs. Janu, her phone tight to her ear, as she bounced Wesley on her hip. This city remained calm. But this month, the fires were burning in Milwaukee. And the Justice Department released a scathing report, accusing the Baltimore police of systematically stopping, searching and arresting black residents for minor offenses, often without cause. Wesley is blithely unaware of the tumult. But his parents have already begun preparing what to tell him, when the time comes.  Don’t do things that bring too much attention to yourself, even if your white friends are doing it. You can’t go running around in a hoodie. Don’t run into someone’s yard and grab a ball. If a police officer tells you to do something, just do it. Mrs. Janu considers herself the   practical parent, but the list fills her with sadness. “Black boys aren’t allowed to be innocent or young,” she said. “They don’t have that privilege. ” Mr. Janu felt bewildered at first by such talk. He is the optimist in the family, the dreamer. He had never imagined such a discussion with his son. “You wouldn’t have to explain that to a white child,” he said. He said he had lived most of his life “with blinders on. ” His conversations with his wife have opened his eyes. In the past, Mr. Janu said, he often assumed that the black boys he saw on impoverished street corners were    youngsters destined for handcuffs. Now, he looks for the exuberance in the faces of the wisecracking, jostling boys still savoring the waning days of summer. He hopes that other police officers will see that, too, someday, in his son.",0
1289,Rio ‘Has Never Felt So Safe.’ But What Happens After the Games? - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Portugal’s education minister was robbed at knife point. So was the chief of security for the opening ceremony as he left Olympic Stadium. A police officer was killed when his vehicle was sprayed with gunfire, and an Olympics bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks. Even before the armed robbery this weekend of four American swimmers, including the gold medalist Ryan Lochte, a series of crimes had drawn attention to Brazil’s shortcomings in providing security for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. But for many in this   city, a bigger question remains: What will happen after the Games? To thwart crime around the Olympics, Brazil has mobilized a security juggernaut in Rio twice the size of the one used for the London Games in 2012. Mindful of Rio’s reputation for violent crime, the Brazilians have deployed 85, 000 security personnel. This show of force includes 23, 000 soldiers patrolling the city, some in military vehicles, along with helicopters and warships looming around the city’s most popular beaches. “The city has never felt so safe,” said Gilberto Dias, 50, a hot dog vendor who described how plainclothes officers had sprung to action one morning last week after two muggers accosted a tourist in the upscale Copacabana neighborhood. “They just materialized out of nowhere, which is something I’ve never seen before. ” But even before the Games began, Rio was facing a surge in lawlessness in recent months that had rattled residents and alarmed the authorities. With the economy in turmoil, assaults and robberies on the street jumped by 42 percent in May, with 10, 000 robberies that month. And after years of declining homicides, the number of murders increased by more than 7 percent during the first half of the year, with over 1, 500 people killed. As dread persists over street violence and gun battles rage in Rio’s favelas, some Brazilians worry about what will happen in the aftermath of the Games, when the soldiers are withdrawn and the city is left on its own to grapple with a financial crisis. “The assault on the American athlete is what happens to us in Rio every day,” said Marcello Brito, 51, an architect, referring to Mr. Lochte. Rio’s finances were so bad before the Games that it had declared a “state of calamity. ” Budgets had been gutted, with police officers and firefighters protesting delays in receiving pay by holding signs at the airport telling visitors, “Welcome to hell. ” The federal government responded with an $850 million bailout package to help the state of Rio de Janeiro stay afloat, pay salaries and keep essential services running during the Olympics. But the crisis in Rio’s finances, which are heavily dependent on global oil prices, remains, and the security lapses threaten to undermine ambitions for a resurgence in the city’s fortunes. The authorities invested billions of dollars in sports venues, transit systems and   pacification projects in poor urban areas, arguing that the Olympics would serve as a linchpin in overhauling the city. In the weeks before the Games, Mayor Eduardo Paes even contended that Rio would be “the safest city in the world. ” Many residents have welcomed the increased security. “It’s nice to see soldiers patrolling the streets, at least where I live,” said Cassius Almada, 39, a high school math teacher who lives in Copacabana. “It could be a lot worse. ” But those living beyond the necklace of upscale seafront neighborhoods say the increased security has had little effect in communities that have long been troubled by violence. Maria do Rosário Silva Santos, 54, who was visiting Rio from Brasília, the nation’s capital, said she had been stunned to see young men  —   not police officers  —   toting guns casually in Acari, a   neighborhood in north Rio, where she was staying during the Games. “It was shocking to see,” she said. “As far as I can tell, nothing has changed. ” Some security experts emphasized that considerable risks persisted around the city, especially in favelas, the poor areas that generally emerged as squatter settlements and that are still controlled by drug gangs. Because of Rio’s financial crisis, plans fell apart to establish a network of policing outposts in Maré, one large area of favelas. Julita Lemgruber, the director of the Center for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship at Candido Mendes University in Rio, said it was naïve to expect a drastic drop in crime during the Games. “The government thought a snap of their fingers would bring peace to a city that has lived through so much violence in the past few years,” she said. “It doesn’t do any good to have this show of thousands of extra police unless you tell every Olympic athlete to walk the street with a policeman by his side. ” The Olympics, she said, had actually increased bloodshed  —   but only in the vast favelas, where the police have been battling militias and drug gangs. In Complexo do Alemão, a large group of favelas, a   of gun battles since the start of the Olympics has left at least two residents dead and two police officials wounded. “Police forces are invading the favelas every day and killing people, which is outrageous,” Ms. Lemgruber said. “How can anyone hope to bring peace by spreading violence?” Heder Martins de Oliveira, the vice president of Brazil’s National Association of Police Officers, said that the killing of the officer in Rio last week pointed to the risks that security forces faced daily in the city. Referring to the wave of armed assaults during the Games, he said, “The situation would be even worse, an international disgrace, if dedicated police weren’t doing their job at this time. ” “Of course, there’s more attention to these episodes because they’re taking place when the world is looking at Rio,” Mr. Martins de Oliveira said. “But this is a dilemma that Rio faces on a daily basis. ” The police have also been involved in violent episodes blemishing the Olympics. Over the weekend, an   federal police official opened fire in the direction of a man he was brawling with at Rio Scenarium, a downtown nightclub. It was not clear whether anyone was seriously injured. Amid the surge in lawlessness, many residents have found a measure of solace on social media, where they commiserate about their experiences and document each episode of crime in hopes of spurring the authorities to action. Among dozens of Facebook groups focused on crime is “Where I was robbed,” a   map containing dots that form a road map of brutalization and despair. “Hello, hello, authorities!” one Facebook user, Eliane Cattapan, wrote recently. “With the arrival of all the tourists, I’m much more afraid of the rise in street crime than terrorism. ”",0
1290,Biden Warns Trump Is Risk to U.S. Security - The New York Times,"SCRANTON, Pa.  —   Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. warned on Monday that Donald J. Trump, even as a candidate, had elevated the dangers confronting American allies and military personnel overseas. Mr. Biden said that on a trip to Kosovo and Serbia this week, he would be compelled to “reassure” allies that the United States would honor its commitment to NATO, given Mr. Trump’s comments saying he would reassess the arrangement if elected. “Because they’re worried,” Mr. Biden said, in his first campaign appearance beside Hillary Clinton. He added that if his son Beau, who died of brain cancer last year, were still serving in Iraq, he would advise him that the danger had increased “a couple clicks” because of Mr. Trump’s remarks, which have included the suggestion that President Obama was the “founder” of the Islamic State. “This guy’s shame has no limits,” he said. Mr. Biden suggested Mr. Trump had demonstrated a fondness for brutal leaders like Saddam Hussein  —   “He would have loved Stalin,” Mr. Biden said twice  —   and repeatedly reminded the crowd of the stakes. “There’s a guy that follows me, right back here, has the nuclear codes,” Mr. Biden said at one point. Mr. Trump is so reckless, the vice president said, that if his late son had planned to enlist in a Trump administration, “I would have thrown my body in front of him. ” For Mr. Biden, after nearly eight years in the nation’s chief supporting role, the appearance hinted at the niche he sees for himself as Election Day nears: a figure who can argue, plainly and personally, that Mr. Trump has already imperiled the nation he aspires to lead. It was also a glimpse at the campaign that wasn’t  —   the earned folksiness, the willingness to test audience stamina, the years of practice at appearing unpracticed  —   laying bare the strengths and tics of a   candidate who decided last year against challenging the woman he spent Monday embracing. He mustered characteristic zeal to hold forth on American greatness and sacrifice. He interrupted himself at one point to wave to his family, arranging aloud for a future hug. He appeared to make an   joke about an old house of his in Scranton. For much of the   performance  —   with sleeves rolled slightly and any prepared text doomed to be ignored  —   Mr. Biden assured his hometown’s residents that Mrs. Clinton was “made of the same stuff,” even if she could not always show it. “Maybe the difference between the Irish Catholic and the Methodist,” he wondered aloud, comparing himself to Mrs. Clinton from behind the   seal. “We wear everything on our sleeve!” Since announcing in October that he would not seek the presidency, Mr. Biden has been a loyal Democratic lieutenant, taking care to praise Mrs. Clinton in public and rousing Democrats with a vintage address at the party’s national convention last month. But their   relationship has more often been defined by an intense rivalry in private  —   a predictable tension, perhaps, for two figures who have long imagined themselves in the nation’s top job. As he considered a run last year, still grieving his son’s death, Mr. Biden felt slighted as the party establishment fell in line behind Mrs. Clinton, viewing himself as the natural heir to President Obama’s legacy. In conversations with donors, Mr. Biden expressed astonishment at Mrs. Clinton’s handling of questions over her private email server. At times last year, people close to the vice president said, the mere mention of Mrs. Clinton’s name could make him fume. “They were professionals, but also competitors,” William M. Daley, President Obama’s former chief of staff, said of their time in the administration. “They’d do the dance. There was respect there, but Joe considered himself the expert on foreign policy. ” Asked if largely watching the campaign from the sidelines had been hard for Mr. Biden, Mr. Daley said: “Of course. He wanted to run. ” Yet in their first joint campaign appearance on Monday, in the city where both claim roots  —   Mrs. Clinton’s father also grew up here, as she said at the outset  —   any lingering rancor was well concealed. They took the stage to Bruce Springsteen’s “The Rising,” with Mrs. Clinton clapping the beat. Mr. Biden settled in a chair behind her, turning back to smile at the crowd. Mrs. Clinton introduced him as “a fighter for families” and a passionate advocate. She said, if elected, she would ask Mr. Biden to continue to help lead a “cancer moonshot” initiative at the White House. She even brandished a few retail politicking touches that Mr. Biden might appreciate, describing her own christening “at the Methodist church on Court Street,” recalling summer visits to Lake Winola and detailing her grandfather’s time at the Scranton Lace mill. She said her father had “literally hopped a freight train from Scranton to Chicago” to find work, deploying Mr. Biden’s favorite adverb, if perhaps unwittingly. She heaped praise on local officials, including “your amazing Lackawanna County recorder of deeds,” and spoke deferentially of her time in the “  cabinet. ” And in an attack on Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton  —   a speaker so formal that she often ignores contractions in prepared text to deliver them as two words  —   set off on a   flourish of her own. She was discussing Mr. Trump’s assertion that he provides child care services. In fact, Mrs. Clinton said, those benefits apply only to the pampered guests at some Trump properties  —   not to his workers. “Just sayin’,” she added. Repeatedly, the complex filled with chants for the two, with signs of “Welcome home, Joe!” or, simply, “Joe” shooting into view. Mr. Biden, recalling weekly breakfasts with Mrs. Clinton, described himself as her “Obama whisperer. ” “She’d look at me and say, ‘What did he mean by that? ’” Mr. Biden said, often clutching the lectern with two hands. Often, Mr. Biden conspicuously interrupted himself, as if bantering with his own notes. “I really mean this,” he said. “This is not a joke. ” But sometimes it was. Shortly after taking the stage, he meandered through an anecdote about a former home. “I was there when I was running, and up in the bedroom, written on the wall is one of those, ‘Joe Biden slept here,’” he said. “Then it said, ‘lived here. ’” He held for a beat: “Glad they added the ‘lived here’ part. ” Chuckles filled the space, where Mr. Biden had appeared with Mrs. Clinton eight years earlier to campaign for President Obama. For about 30 minutes, the people were rapt. Then a child cried audibly. “I am testing your stamina,” Mr. Biden said, smiling once more. He wrapped up.",0
1291,Положит ли Дональд Трамп конец «ваххабитскому беспределу»? | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Саудовская Аравия Как отмечает в своей статье американский политический активист Калеб Маупин, ни для кого не является секретом, что пока Вашингтон продолжает рассуждать о «правах человека» и «демократии», он продолжает совершенно открыто поддерживать самые реакционные ближневосточные державы. В частности Саудовскую Аравию, Катар и Объединенные Арабские Эмираты, где господствуют средневековые нравы, а о таком понятии, как «права человека» даже и не слышали. Более того, аравийские монархии продолжают поддерживать террористические группы по всему Ближнему Востоку, большинство из которых придерживаются ваххабитских взглядов в религиозных вопросах. Автор отмечает, что недавно избранный будущий президент США Дональд Трапм, который в ходе избирательной кампании не раз и не два критиковал Эр-Рияд, должен ответить для самого себя на вопрос: готов ли он положить конец «ваххабитскому беспределу», кардинально изменив тем самым политику Вашингтона? И если такая решимость у Трампа все-таки имеется, ему придется искать сотрудничества с так часто демонизируемой на Западе Москвой, а также и с Тегераном, о котором он в ходе своей кампании отзывался не слишком-то любезно. Именно Москва и Иран на сегодняшний день стоят на передовой войны с радикальным экстремизмом, и без взаимодействия с этими державами едва ли как-то можно изменить ситуацию на Ближнем Востоке.

1294,One Season Ends and Another Begins: Baseball Playoff Matchups Are Set - The New York Times,"The baseball gods spend six months twisting the sport into a knotty lump. No one knows quite how to untangle it, and then the final week zips by. All those possibilities, resolved just like that. The season rushes to the end. “Rushes to the end,” Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said, musing in his office at Yankee Stadium before this weekend’s critical series. “That sounds like a great name for a book. ” Now we can close the volume on the 2016 regular season. The Orioles survived to live another day, earning a date in Toronto on Tuesday for the American League   game against the Blue Jays. The Mets will host the National League   game the next night, against the San Francisco Giants at Citi Field. The Orioles and the Blue Jays both won on Sunday to finish with identical records,  . The Blue Jays won the teams’ season series to earn the right to host the game, which was also how the Mets did it. The Mets and the Giants both finished   but the Mets won the season series. The A. L.   winner will face the Texas Rangers, who went   in a division series opener on Thursday. The Boston Red Sox will visit Cleveland that day to start their series with the Indians. The N. L. series begin Friday in Chicago and Washington, with the Cubs ( ) facing the   winner and the Nationals hosting the Los Angeles Dodgers. Before we get there, though, the   appetizers will be delicious. The Orioles lost the A. L. Championship Series in 2014. The Blue Jays lost it last year. Neither of the teams, rivals in the A. L. East, has won a pennant in decades, and both are trying to do it with brute force. The Orioles led the majors in homers this season, with 253, and the Blue Jays had 221  —   the next highest total in the   playoff field. The N. L. game features a dream pitchers’ duel: the Mets’ Noah Syndergaard against the Giants’ Madison Bumgarner. In Syndergaard’s last postseason appearance  —   Game 3 of last fall’s World Series against Kansas City  —   he announced his presence with a fastball to the backstop, then earned the Mets’ only victory. In Bumgarner’s last October game, he twirled five shutout innings on the road on two days’ rest to close out the Royals in Game 7 of the 2014 World Series. The Royals are missing from the stage this time, slumping to a . 500 record after their two trips to the World Series. Also absent: the St. Louis Cardinals, bystanders to the party after a streak of five postseason visits. The Cardinals were alive at the start of play on Sunday but needed a victory and a loss by the Giants to force a tiebreaker game with San Francisco. The Cardinals beat Pittsburgh,   but the Giants did not comply. They thumped the Dodgers,   sweeping their final   series after a ghastly second half had threatened their playoff hopes. The Detroit Tigers also started the day needing help to keep playing. Their path to the wild card would have been complicated had they survived Sunday, the Tigers would then have had to make up a game rained out last week. Instead, the Tigers made it easy on themselves. They got seven strong innings from their ace, Justin Verlander, but lost by   in Atlanta when Justin Upton took a called third strike to end it with the tying run on first base. The game finished with fans doing one last tomahawk chop chant, summoning the glory days of Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Greg Maddux. All returned to Turner Field as the Braves closed the park after only 20 seasons, bound for a new home in suburban Cobb County next spring. The stadium had a brief and unfulfilling legacy. The Braves were a certified powerhouse when it opened, but they played only two World Series games within its walls, losing both to the Yankees in 1999. Three other teams  —   the 1997 Marlins, the 1998 Padres and the 2001 Diamondbacks  —   won the N. L. pennant on the Braves’ ground. The Braves were one of eight teams with 90 losses this season, but no team came within nine games of the Minnesota Twins, who managed a victory Sunday over Chris Sale, the ace of the Chicago White Sox, to finish  . It was the worst record for the franchise since 1949, when it was the Washington Senators. After the game, White Sox Manager Robin Ventura announced he would not return next season. Ventura, the popular former third baseman, led Chicago to a winning record as a rookie manager in 2012, but four losing seasons followed. “It’s not like they’re going to be building a statue out on the concourse,” he told reporters in Chicago, in his trademark deadpan, when asked what his legacy would be. “You do what you can, and that’s all you can really do. ” There were other goodbyes around the game. Boston’s David Ortiz played his final   game, and the Red Sox announced that they would retire his No. 34. The Yankees held a ceremony to honor Mark Teixeira, their first baseman for the last eight years, who is retiring after 14 seasons. The Phillies also saluted first baseman Ryan Howard, whose option they will decline after the season. Howard was the last link to the Phillies’ most recent championship, in 2008. He finished his final season in Philadelphia with a . 196 average, the precise average Mike Schmidt produced as a rookie in 1973. Schmidt and Howard combined for 930 homers and led the Phillies to their only two titles. Ortiz, Teixeira and Howard all went hitless, though Ortiz will get more swings in the playoffs. Vin Scully, the voice of the Dodgers for the last 67 seasons, had a more elegant  . Scully, 88, finished his career at the home of the Dodgers’ rivals, who dedicated a plaque in the visiting broadcast booth at ATT Park to commemorate his final game. Willie Mays dropped in for the occasion. Scully grew up in New York and rooted for the Giants as a boy, sharing the story in his closing remarks after the game. “You and I have been friends for a long time,” Scully told his audience. “But I know in my heart that I’ve always needed you more than you’ve ever needed me, and I’ll miss our time together more than I can say. ”",0
1295,Virgil: The Beltway Assures Us the Deep State Doesn’t Exist,"In parts one and two of our guided tour of the Deep State, we looked at two anchors of the Federal Triangle in downtown DC, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency.  And while Virgil looks forward to continuing his tour of the Triangle and other nodes of the Deep State, sometimes breaking news breaks in, and so we should pause to consider the latest. [On March 10, from his podium at the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, President Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, was asked about the Deep State.  The question:   Does the White House believe in a “Deep State” that is actively working to undermine the president? And here’s Spicer’s answer:  I think that there’s no question when you have eight years of one party in office, there are people who stay in government —  and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration.  So I don’t think it should come as any surprise there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration and may have believed in that agenda and want to continue to seek it.  I don’t think that should come as a surprise. In other words, Spicer’s answer to the answer to the question was “Yes. ”  So now there can be no doubt that the concept of the Deep State will be discussed for a long time to come.  And yet if Virgil might be permitted to quibble with Spicer, he would say that the Deep State is a lot deeper than just the past eight years —  we’ll come back to that point. But first, let’s hear from other voices on the issue of whether or not there’s a Deep State.  As we can see, it’s gaining a critical mass of recognition, at least on the right.  And that’s good, because, as they say, forewarned is forearmed.   On March 5, former House speaker Newt Gingrich made himself clear —  as he always does:  There is an active Deep State opposition to a populist disruptive reformer.  Many [in the government] believe it is their duty to break the law and lie.  For Trump to succeed, there will have to be profound overhaul of the bureaucracy. A few days later, Rep. Mike Kelly ( ) didn’t use the actual words “Deep State,” but his point was the same when he described the situation in Powertown: “The same people were there, and they don’t think the new owners or the new managers should be running the ship. ”  And then Kelly added this point about former president Barack Obama: He’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is totally going to upset the new agenda. So is the 44th president setting up a permanent campaign against the 45th president?  Obama denies any such intention he says that he and his family are remaining in Washington so that his youngest daughter, Sasha, can finish high school.  Of course, that explanation doesn’t quite tell us why former White House consigliere Valerie Jarrett has moved into the Obamas’    home in the swanky Kalorama neighborhood, just a couple miles north of the White House. In fact, the real goal of the relocation, according to The Daily Mail, is to “oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment. ” Meanwhile, others in Congress, too, are eyeing closely the shadowy armada arrayed against the new administration.  In the words of Rep. Thomas Massie ( ) “I think it’s really the Deep State vs. the president, the duly elected president. ” And on March 9, Fox News’ Sean Hannity, was even more direct:  Deep State Obama holdovers embedded like barnacles in the federal bureaucracy are   on destroying President Trump.  It’s time for the Trump administration to purge these saboteurs. Interestingly, by coincidence, or perhaps not, the very next day President Trump’s Justice Department ordered the firing of 46 US Attorneys, all Obama holdovers.   Still, some in the Main Stream Media, even now, choose to deny that there is any such thing as a Deep State.  One such is David Ignatius, veteran columnist for The Washington Post, who wrote on March 7 that what we’re seeing is simply the collision of President Trump and the properly established legal system:  Some [Trump] supporters claim he’s facing a secret coup from an intelligence and foreign policy establishment that constitutes a despotic “deep state. ” But really, Trump is confronting the orderly process we call the “rule of law. ” Virgil thinks that it’s rich, indeed, for Ignatius to insist that there’s nothing going on except the proper rule of law.  Why?  Because it was Ignatius’ own reporting, back on January 12, that demonstrated the   power of the Deep State.  That was the report that revealed that on December 29, Michael Flynn, named as Trump’s national security adviser in the new administration, had been intercepted talking on the phone to the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.  And from that first report, events tumbled, and as we all know, Flynn resigned from his White House post on February 13.  And yet a few days after that Ignatius story ran on January 12, Virgil wondered aloud how he got the information about a private phone call: “Now how did Ignatius know that?”  That is, how did Ignatius learn about the   conversation?  Continuing, Virgil wrote back then, “The Postman won’t say, other than that he got his information from a ‘senior US government official. ’”  Virgil then pointed out that even if was legal to record the call —  yes, it’s smart to surveil Russians —  it’s not legal to leak such information to the media, especially if it involves an American citizen.  “Such disclosures aren’t legal,” Virgil added with a sigh, “but once again, nobody in Washington, DC, seems to care. ” So we can see: In the Flynn case, the power of the Deep State wasn’t at all about the “rule of law. ”  It was about just the opposite.   Others, too, take the Ignatius line —  even if their denials are weirdly weak and  .  Here, for example is a March 9 headline in Politico, the bible of the Beltway: “The Deep State Is a Figment of Steve Bannon’s Imagination. ” The author, Loren DeJonge Schulman, starts out by firing both barrels at Bannon and anyone else who might have suspicions about the Deep State: Here’s a handy rule for assessing the credibility of what you’re reading about national security in the Trump era: If somebody uses the term “Deep State,” you can be pretty sure they have no idea what they’re talking about.  Got that?  Nothing to see here: So if you hear Spicer, Gingrich, Kelly, Massie, Hannity —  or, of course, ol’ Virgil —  nattering on about the Deep State, well, have a dunce cap handy.    So who’s the author of this don’     piece?  We can see from her bio that Loren DeJonge Schulman, who now works at a     in DC, has an extensive background in the politics of the Democratic Party and the Deep State, both.    So maybe it’s not so surprising that Schulman wouldn’t want anyone nosing around too much in Deep State matters.   After all, nobody likes being snooped on, right?   In fact, Virgil is reminded of the 1999 Brad Pitt movie, Fight Club, featuring these   lines:  Welcome to Fight Club.  The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.  The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club! That was Hollywood’s way of expressing the most basic wisdom of any secret enterprise: Keep it secret!  So Virgil was surprised to see how Schulman chose to end her denial piece.  After nearly 2000 words of mercilessly mocking the idea that there was any such thing as a Deep State, Schulman closed by . . . outing herself as a Deep Stater:  So the next time you hear someone using the term Deep State, send them a copy of this article.  Ask them to stop using it.  Tell them the term betrays their ignorance, and obscures and misleads far more than it illuminates.  And if that doesn’t work, well, we Deep Staters will take matters into our own hands. [emphasis added] One supposes that Schulman would say that her final words were just her way of being funny: What an arch sense of humor she has!  And no doubt she got some yuks from her pals in Cleveland Park, Crystal City, and Chevy Chase.  Meanwhile, other Americans, curious about how they are being governed, might wonder what’s so funny about being threatened by a   Beltway apparatchik.  Yes, an attempt at humor, however ominous, is one possible explanation for Schulman’s close.  Another possibility is that she is, in fact, proud to be a Deep Stater, and that her pride shines right through her feigned irony.  That is, she is eager to signal to her friends and colleagues in the Deep State that she is truly one of them, even as she laughs it off.   ",0
1296,Minority Youths Mistrust Police. A Brooklyn High School Has a Plan. - The New York Times,"On a chilly morning in November, Lt. Donzel Cleare of the New York Police Department stood in front of a classroom at Liberation Diploma Plus High School in Coney Island and asked a simple question: “How many of you guys feel that I work for you?” Before him, in desks arranged around three sides of the room, sat roughly 15 students, mostly male, with a group of girls gathered together on one side. Most of them were black or Hispanic, and because Liberation is a   transfer school, virtually all of them had dropped out or fallen behind at other schools. Not a single student raised a hand. A few actually laughed. They were there at the beginning of a monthslong course, conceived by Liberation’s founding principal, April Leong, as an experiment in bridging the gap between New York City’s police and young people from a poor, minority community in Brooklyn. An elective class called the Junior Citizens Police Academy, it met weekly and was made up of students selected by Ms. Leong, in some cases because they had expressed negative feelings about the police. It is a common sentiment in the neighborhood around Liberation. The 60th Precinct, which includes Coney Island, has nine public housing projects, some with   feuds between their residents. Last year there were 23 shootings in the precinct. This year, as of Aug. 28, there were nine  —   half as many as there were by this time last year, though it is unclear why the total is down. A number of Liberation’s students have had friends or family members killed. Some have watched fathers, brothers or friends go to prison. Others have themselves been incarcerated. Two years ago, Manuel Ocampo, an    student, was shot in the head and killed by a retired police officer. The police said that Mr. Ocampo had a gun and was trying to rob the former officer and steal his car. The shooting was determined to be   and the former officer was not charged. The week before he died, Mr. Ocampo had given a short speech at school, thanking his mother and Ms. Leong for helping him to turn his life around. Ms. Leong keeps a photograph of him on the wall next to her desk. It is no surprise that many of Ms. Leong’s students are suspicious of and hostile to the police. They are mostly resigned to the idea that officers will never be held accountable for what the students see as mistreatment of black people. Lieutenant Cleare, the commanding officer of the housing bureau’s community affairs unit, said later that he knew what the students’ response would be before he even asked the question, but he saw it as a way to get them talking. “It was very important when I came in there to let them voice their true feelings and opinions and concerns,” he said. “I didn’t want them to feel that this was going to be a brainwashing session. ” But the skepticism he faced from the students was   especially about the idea that community residents should help the police stop crime. “That’s not going to happen,” a young man named Jahkhil said at the end of the first class. (He, like most of the other students, is being identified by only his given name at the school’s request, so that the details of their lives don’t affect their future opportunities.) “It’s just a rule  —   you just don’t snitch,” he said. “You can’t snitch. ” The consequences for those who do are clear. “You going to be looked at a certain type of way,” he added, “and certain people are going to want to kill you. ” As politicians, police officials, civil rights activists and others talk about how to change relationships between the police and poor minority communities, there has been little discussion of what role schools might play. The city’s Education Department has made some modest efforts. In May, more than 300 elementary schools received visits from officers from their local precincts, who read to students or led physical education classes or other activities. But there was little preparation, and the program was not aimed at neighborhoods where mistrust of the police is most pervasive. On July 14, after the shootings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, and then of five police officers in Dallas, New York City’s schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, sent a letter to principals, teachers and other department staff members asking for lesson plans to address topics of civil rights, guns and violence. She also asked for suggestions about how schools could develop relationships with local police precincts. But few if any schools have attempted a program as intense as the one at Liberation. Ms. Leong and Lieutenant Cleare plan to repeat the class this year, with more field trips and   activities. Over the   course, they intend to have the students tour the 60th Precinct’s station house and the new headquarters of the local housing police unit, Police Service Area 1. Liberation occupies a former Catholic school building on the corner of West 19th Street and Mermaid Avenue. Its enrollment varies throughout the year but hovers around 200 students. More than half of the students are black, and close to a third are Hispanic. Eighty percent qualify for free lunch. At their former schools, these students slipped through the cracks. Ms. Leong’s goal is to not let that happen again. For her students, not graduating from high school means facing grim life prospects. According to the Brookings Institution, a research organization based in Washington, black men born in the late 1970s who did not graduate from high school had a nearly 70 percent chance of being imprisoned by their  . That was higher than their chances of being employed. For both male and female students, not completing high school means a high likelihood of a lifetime of poverty. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2014, black high school dropouts age 25 and older had a median weekly income of $440. Female high school dropouts of all races fared even worse, with a median weekly income of $409. Some observers have identified what they call a “   pipeline,” in which young black and Hispanic men are funneled into the criminal justice system by punitive school disciplinary standards. When Ms. Leong heard last year that a    drug addict had fatally shot a police officer in East Harlem, her first thought was about school. She wondered what New York City schools the man, Tyrone Howard, had attended and what chances were missed to put him on a better path in life. Her approach is shaped by her own background. She was born in Brooklyn to a    mother and a    father. She did well academically but was pregnant by the time she graduated from high school. She often tells students about how she took her infant son to her orientation at Baruch College because she didn’t have a babysitter. When she saw other students staring at her and whispering, she wanted to leave and never come back  —   just as they might feel out of place when they get to college, she tells them. But her adviser in a program for   students encouraged her, and she stayed, graduating and ultimately becoming a teacher and then an administrator. She started Liberation in 2007. The son she had at 18 went to Yale, and her younger son is now a student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Lieutenant Cleare, 47, who is black, grew up in Rosedale, a suburban section of southeast Queens. Like the students at Liberation, he said, he and his friends didn’t like the police officers in their neighborhood, most of whom were white. “They would be using the   they would be slamming you up against walls,” he said. He went to York College in Queens, where he was the captain of the basketball team. After York, even though friends and cousins who had become police officers tried to persuade him to join the force, he took a job as a high school drug counselor. He finally became an officer when he was 29. He has spent 14 of his 18 years on the force doing youth development and community outreach. At Liberation, he approached the students as something of a father figure. But if the divide between black communities and the police is often characterized as a confrontation between black and blue, Lieutenant Cleare was clearly speaking from the blue side. “When there’s shooting around your way  —   ’cause there’s shootings all the time  —   when people are running away from the gunfire, who’s running toward the gunfire?” he asked. “Cops,” the students said. “Does it happen in a white neighborhood?” No, the students conceded. He acknowledged that not all officers were model public servants. “I’m going to say that to you right now: There’s a bunch of idiots out there,” Lieutenant Cleare said the first day. But over the months he did not engage in deep discussions about misconduct or police brutality, and as the students sometimes pointed out, he tended to put the onus for improving the relationship on them. He compared getting stopped by the police to being robbed at gunpoint and asked why people did not respond to commands from an officer as they would to orders coming from any other person with a gun. “Your most important priority when you get into an interaction with the Police Department is to leave the same way you came,” he said. “Just like the robber comes to you and says, ‘Yo, run that,’”  —   he demonstrated demanding someone’s money  —   “your whole goal is to walk away safe and sound. ” But instead, he said, people often talked back to the police. Lieutenant Cleare explained: “You think  —   and this is what’s crazy  —   on one hand, you think, Oh, it’s just a cop. There’s a certain level of trust. That’s why you can disrespect that officer, because you feel, at the end of the day, ‘You just a cop  —   you got that badge and gun, but you’re really not going to use it. ’” The students were not buying it. “Talking is different than touching somebody,” Bobby, 19, objected. “I can say whatever I want, ’cause it’s only my mouth  —   freedom of speech  —   but you can’t touch me. ” Another student, Shanell, said, “You’re saying because they have guns, because they have badges, we can just be disrespected!” “No!” Lieutenant Cleare said, throwing up his hands in frustration. At times, their views of the world seemed unbridgeable. Lieutenant Cleare said residents of Coney Island did not do enough to stop crime, because they refused to talk to the police. “You basically want people to start snitching,” Bobby said. “Define what a snitch is, Bobby,” Lieutenant Cleare responded. “Someone not intimidated to communicate  —   that’s what Ms. Leong told us,” Shanell said, sounding dubious. “Once we snitch, who come in guns blazing for us?” Lieutenant Cleare encouraged them to take the first step and be friendly to the scared rookie officer on the street. In a class in January, he said most officers would be dumbfounded if the students said a simple “Good morning” or “Be safe, officer. ” He went on, “How am I supposed to know that you’re a good guy unless you show me?” Bobby wondered why things couldn’t run the other way. “How about if you show me something, I show you something?” he asked. “How we always got to show you something and you can’t show us anything?” Bobby was a star of Liberation’s basketball team and the unofficial ringleader of the policing class. The other students listened closely to him, and he delighted in making them erupt in laughter. He lived in a nearby housing project and was the youngest of 10 children, one of eight brothers. He transferred to the school from Abraham Lincoln High School in fall 2014, when he should have been a senior. He broke his ankle in the winter of his sophomore year and skipped most of the rest of the year, he said. Bobby said he was uneasy around the police in part because he had seen one of his older brothers arrested inside their apartment when he was around 8. “I see one cop with a gun to his head, and one cop having him lay down with his knee in his back,” he recalled. “I thought I was about to see him die right in front of me or something  —   it was crazy. ” His brother went to prison for five years, though Bobby wasn’t sure what the charges were. “I think for robbery and assault,” he said. That experience, he said, was one reason he would never inform on someone to the police. “If you tell on somebody,” he said in January, “they got a whole family that they probably had to provide for in a situation where, in the streets, it’s hard. ” And yet his own family had been victimized by violent crime. His eldest brother, then 29, was shot and killed the previous school year. Bobby had been willing to give Lieutenant Cleare a chance partly because he trusted Ms. Leong so much. She had supported him after the killing. According to the police, his brother was visiting a female friend on Staten Island when her former boyfriend showed up they argued and the man shot him. Ms. Leong and two other staff members went to the funeral. Bobby said he had gone a little crazy for a while, thinking about tracking the man down and shooting him with his brother’s gun, but his surviving brothers talked him out of it. The man was arrested and indicted on a count of   murder, among other charges. He is currently on Rikers Island and awaiting trial. But Bobby said he would have preferred that the man hadn’t been arrested. He would have preferred that he be dead. At Liberation, violence never seemed to be far away. In   the cousin of one student was murdered in East New York, Brooklyn. The next day, another man was found dead behind one of the Coney Island projects, in what some suspected was retaliation. The week after the killings, Lieutenant Cleare talked in class about his own youth and how close he came to getting into serious trouble. At one point when he was a teenager, he said, he bought a gun to try to settle a dispute and hid it in the back seat of his aunt’s car, which sat in the driveway but was never used. Then his stepfather found it. Jahkhil, 19, who is slight, with tendrils of hair framing his face, laughed. “You got snitched,” he said. “I came home,” Lieutenant Cleare said, “and I heard my mother on the phone: ‘All I know is that the bullets are the size of C batteries! ’” “If I had ended up using that,” he added, “I wouldn’t be here today. ” One day in February, another young man, skinny and tattooed, said that the class was helping him understand why the police did certain things, but that he didn’t think his views would ever fundamentally change. He said he resented the police because his father had gone to prison for eight years, starting when he was 10. “My birthday was like the day before he got locked up,” he said. “Imagine, 10 years old, birthday  —   you think you’re about to get presents, everything. ” He said he had been close to his father when he was younger, but now they did not understand each other, and he had seen him only once since he was released from prison last year. Before coming to Liberation he attended Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School, from which he should have graduated in 2015. (Asked why he fell behind, he smiled and said, “They had too many girls over there. ”) Still, he said he was confident he would graduate in June, as long as he could pass the algebra Regents exam that month. But just four days later, he was arrested along with a younger boy and charged with robbery. According to a criminal complaint, he pointed a BB gun at several young people and took two cellphones. The police arrested them on a bus, nine blocks west of the school. His first day back at Liberation, a little over two weeks later, the policing class met but Lieutenant Cleare couldn’t make it, so Ms. Leong talked to the students about a coming field trip to Baruch College. After class, she approached the young man, who hung his head and looked embarrassed. In a voice barely above a whisper, he said that he hadn’t wanted to come to school that day, but he had pushed himself. “I’m just trying to stay focused,” he said. Ms. Leong asked gently, “You want to speak to Cleare?” The young man nodded. She dialed her phone and handed it to him. He spoke quietly for several minutes, explaining his version of the story, and listened to Lieutenant Cleare, who told him it was important that he find a good lawyer and take responsibility for his actions. Ms. Leong said later that she worried the student would become discouraged and drop out. He was already 20, so he had little time left to graduate before he aged out of the public school system at 21. In March, Detective Joseph Agosto, a firearms instructor at the Police Academy, came to the class with the department’s firearms simulator. The law enforcement equivalent of a video game, it lets participants act out various policing scenarios. The instructor gives the details of a 911 call to which the police are responding. Then the scene is projected on a screen. The participants  —   usually police recruits  —   can talk to the characters and give commands. They can use pepper spray or a baton. Or they can shoot a gun or a Taser. If they hit a character in the right spot, the character will fall. Detective Agosto told the class that his responsibility was to train police officers to avoid getting shot. He said the Supreme Court had set a standard known as objective reasonableness for deciding whether an officer was justified in using force. He said it meant that an officer did not have to be right to shoot, but only to respond reasonably. Vinnette Carrasquillo, 20, was about to graduate that month, six and a half years after starting high school she had missed a year and a half while she was pregnant and after her daughter was born. She said she had heard that police officers were trained to shoot to kill and asked if that was true. “That’s a complete fallacy,” Detective Agosto said, “but that’s what people want you to hear. ” As it turned out, when the students took their turns at the simulator, they were more than ready to use lethal force. In one scenario, two students shot a mentally disturbed woman in an alley who was brandishing a pair of scissors. In another, Jahkhil and Jonathan, a classmate, responded to a call about a burglar alarm going off at a warehouse and found a man inside standing behind a table, with one of his hands hidden. Jonathan pointed his gun. They ordered the man to put his hands up. He argued with them instead. When he lifted one of his hands holding a metal object, Jahkhil and Jonathan opened fire, and the man fell. Only afterward did they see that the object was a staple gun. The class hooted, and Jahkhil burst into tense laughter. “You’re laughing, right, because what did you just do?” Detective Agosto said. “Killed him,” Jahkhil said. “You shot a guy with a staple gun,” Detective Agosto said. Why would someone do that, the students asked. “There’s a phenomenon called suicide by cop  —   it happens all the time,” Detective Agosto said. One scenario involved a shooting at a minimart, which led to a firefight with the perpetrator. In another situation, two students were told they were responding to a call about a domestic dispute. “Is there kids in the house?” asked Alisha, one of the students. She had transferred to Liberation from Lincoln in the fall, not because she was behind, she said, but because she wanted to be in a smaller school. Like Vinnette, she was about to graduate. Looking in the window of the house, Alisha, 18, and her partner, Malik, 19, saw a man with his back turned leaning over a couch, and a woman screaming in terror. When they called out, the man turned around. In his hands was a shotgun, which was pointed right at them. Malik froze, but Alisha sprang into action. She fired 10 rounds, missing once or twice, then hitting him in the elbow and the torso. She fired a couple of rounds after he fell. When she went back to her seat, her hands were shaking, and after a minute tears started streaming down her face. Ms. Leong rubbed her shoulder, and Detective Agosto asked why she was emotional. “Because that’s a common situation, personally,” she said. “You have to think of it this way,” Detective Agosto said. “You may have shot this guy. But what did I do? I also saved his wife. ” After the students ran through five scenarios, Detective Agosto’s partner, Officer Steven Malone, made an observation. Of the five scenarios, he said, only the conflict at the minimart had to end with the police firing their guns. “You shot everybody,” he said. Vinnette nodded. “Then we sit here: ‘Cops are killing everybody,’” she said. Lieutenant Cleare asked how the students who had fired their weapons felt. Alisha said she felt sympathy with officers. Bobby, who sat in the back and was unusually quiet, said, “I understood, like, why they do what they do. ” “You all human,” said Jahkhil, “just like us. ” A young woman in the policing class, who asked to be identified by only her middle name, Marie, began missing class in February. Marie, 20, was in her third year at Liberation and close to graduating, but she had recently been kicked out of her mother’s apartment and had lost custody of her    son to the city’s Administration for Children’s Services. At one point, she sent Ms. Leong a text message saying she had to leave school because she’d had little to eat in the past two days and didn’t feel well. Pointing to her own background, Ms. Leong urges students to recognize the disadvantages they face at home but not to use them as an excuse. Instead of offering Marie sympathy, Ms. Leong noted that she could have asked for food from the school’s pantry, which is stocked with pasta and other staples for students who do not have enough to eat at home. “She said, ‘I don’t want to keep asking,’” Ms. Leong said later. “I said, ‘That’s your choice. ’” Although Ms. Leong is tough on students, she is not punitive, even when they curse at her or other staff members. She said that some teachers wanted her to be more harsh. But when students are accustomed to being hurt by the people closest to them, she said, a suspension often has little impact. “They say it out loud  —   ‘So what? ’” Ms. Leong said. “‘My mother just kicked me out. Kick me out, too? Go right ahead. ’” Ms. Leong said it was usually more effective to talk with students than to suspend them. “Taking ownership and apologizing and ‘what am I going to do different’ is different for them, and I think they learn to respect that,” she said. As the year went on, Lieutenant Cleare continued to emphasize that students could change their relationship with the police by extending some basic courtesy. And he offered his own friendship. He cheered on the basketball team at its championship game in February, and in May he challenged the players to a game at the Coney Island Y. M. C. A. against him and a group of fellow officers. The students won both games. He attended graduation in June, and in August he helped Ms. Leong organize what she called a unity barbecue at the school for current students and recent graduates, their families and officers from the 60th Precinct and PSA 1. If the goal of the Junior Citizens Police Academy was to change the dynamic between the students and the police, it did not work miracles or magically erase a legacy of distrust. Many of the students remained wary of the police and still believed that many officers were racist. But they had developed, in many cases for the first time, a close relationship with a police officer, as well as some respect for the challenges of policing and the risks officers take to protect the public. Bobby and Jahkhil both became interested in law enforcement as a career, which in turn sharpened their interest in college as a necessary step on that path. Often, what Lieutenant Cleare said in class discussions mattered less than that he was there at all. Jonathan, 19, who grew up in Coney Island with Bobby and, like him, transferred to Liberation from Lincoln, said the basketball game against the officers had affected his feelings about the police more than anything in the class had. “I could tell they had love for the game, like I do,” he said. He added that even though he never confided in Lieutenant Cleare about something deeply personal, he now felt that he could. Lieutenant Cleare said the class had affected him, too. “It actually just gave me more insight to the struggle that our kids face  —   the real struggle that they have being in an urban community,” he said. Even though he works with students often, he explained, he rarely has the chance to build close relationships with them. “This class enabled me to develop those bonds, where they were comfortable enough to talk to me about issues and be real,” he said. Lieutenant Cleare said he was considering going back to work in schools as a counselor when he is eligible to retire from the department in two years. The school year ended in June. Alisha, Bobby, Marie and Vinnette graduated. Jonathan, who had finished all his credits but had not passed the global history Regents test, failed the exam in June and then again in August and is now back at Liberation, studying to retake it in January. The student who was arrested in February did not drop out, and he attended every meeting of the policing class. Ms. Leong made him one of her interns, which meant that he worked for her after school and helped host community events, and he went to summer school. She expects him to graduate in December. His court case is in preliminary and evidentiary hearings. By the time of the shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, the students had scattered. Ms. Leong said she had spoken with some of them, and they wondered whether the officers in those encounters had received sufficient training. She said of the students’ reaction: “Their thing was, This is why more of us should think about going into law enforcement, because we need to change who is in law enforcement, so that they wouldn’t be racist or have stereotypes in their heads or be so afraid to deal with us that you’re ready to shoot us. ” She hopes that offering the class again this year will keep alive the conversations about policing and racial justice that were stirred up by recent events. Too often, she said, her students become angry but don’t think they can change anything, so they move on. “That level of empowerment or voice just seems out of their reach,” she said. Ms. Leong wants to convince her students that they have a voice. She plans to ask some of the students from the previous class to speak to a group of high school principals to encourage them to consider organizing similar programs. And in the future, she hopes to raise money to take the students to other cities to talk to young people there about what they learned. Bobby, who started taking classes last month at Borough of Manhattan Community College, said the shootings of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile made him angry. He said he still believed that the majority of police officers, at least outside New York City, were racist. But before the class, he said, he would have condemned all police officers as a group. “There just would have been no respect,” he said. Now his perspective had shifted somewhat. “I got respect for those who have respect for me,” he said. “That’s how I feel now. ”",0
1297,"A Routine Night, Until an Explosion Lifted Her Off Her Feet - The New York Times","In the shadow of Bellevue Hospital Center, cast by a luminescent moon early Sunday, the only hint of the chaos that had erupted on the other side of Manhattan hours earlier was a trim woman in gray sweatpants and a     shirt who limped out onto First Avenue. This was Helena Ayeh. She said doctors told her that she was the last bomb victim there to be released. Just after 4 a. m. she told the story of what happened to her. On Saturday night, she was walking through the metal gate outside her apartment building on the south side of West 23rd Street, where she has lived for 11 years. She carried a bag with some bottles of wine inside. Without warning, an explosion lifted her off her feet. The blast, which injured 29 people, appeared to be an intentional act, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said, though the authorities did not believe it was linked to international terrorism. “It was the biggest blast I ever would imagine lights flashing, glass shattering,” Ms. Ayeh recalled. “It happened so fast I was thrown up and landed down. I didn’t know where it had come from. ” She could not guess how high or how far she was thrown. But the concrete she landed on was littered with shards of glass, including from her shattered wine bottles. She reached a hand to her face. “I realized there was blood streaming down my face, and I couldn’t see out of my eye,” Ms. Ayeh said. “I said, ‘Help! Help!’ when I saw the blood. ” Around her, the   air was filled with the shrieks of bystanders and the sirens of emergency vehicles. Someone shouted to her that an ambulance was near the end of the block. With blood pouring from the wound to her right eye, she struggled on injured legs toward it until emergency medical workers met her. “The ambulance, they literally picked me up off the ground,” Ms. Ayeh said. At Bellevue, she received multiple stitches to a cut at the edge of her right eye. Beneath her   glasses, it was red and swollen. Her injured legs were also treated. “They patched me up,” she said, a weary smile on her face. Ms. Ayeh later said in a   interview: “I consider myself very, very lucky I’m not blind. I’m very blessed, I think. ” Just before a taxi stopped and took her away on Sunday morning, she reflected on the Dumpster under which officials said the bomb had been placed. She knew it well. “It’s been there forever,” she said. “I really didn’t think about it. ”",0
1298,North Korea’s Nuclear Blasts Keep Getting Stronger - The New York Times,"North Korea said it conducted its fifth underground nuclear test on Friday. Since the first test, almost a decade ago, the size of the resulting earthquakes from the country’s test site have increased, indicating that the devices are becoming increasingly powerful. The device detonated on Friday looks to have had a force equivalent of 10 kilotons of TNT, according to the South’s Defense Ministry. In contrast, the last device tested by the North, in January, had a force equivalent of six kilotons of TNT, the South’s intelligence agency said. The aboveground Trinity Test in New Mexico in July 1945, which ushered in the nuclear age, had a yield of 20 kilotons. But power is not the only measure of a device’s lethality. The weapon must also have a way to be delivered. South Korean, American and Japanese officials want to determine whether the North Koreans are capable of building a miniaturized nuclear device that can be mounted on a ballistic missile and successfully detonated at a target hundreds, if not thousands, of miles from the launch site. In the past decade, South Korean and American experts have said that the North appears to be closer to achieving that goal. Here is a timeline of how North Korea built up the capability of its nuclear weapons. The earthquake magnitudes are from the United States Geological Survey, which differ from those measured by the South Korean authorities. They may also be slightly revised from numbers reported immediately after the events. Magnitude of Earthquake: 4. 3 Device: United States officials said at the time that the weapon used plutonium and had a yield of less than one kiloton. Missiles: Three months before the nuclear test, North Korea fired a barrage of missiles into the Sea of Japan, including a Taepodong 2 intercontinental missile designed to be capable of reaching Alaska. The Taepodong 2 test was a failure, with the missile falling into the sea before its first stage burned out. Magnitude of Earthquake: 4. 7 Device: Chinese scientists estimated that this bomb had a yield of 2. 35 kilotons. Missiles: A failed satellite launch using a Taepodong 2 missile in April 2009 sent its payload into the Pacific Ocean. On July 4, 2009, North Korea launched three missiles into the sea, with none apparently flying more than 300 miles. Magnitude of Earthquake: 5. 1 Device: North Korea said this bomb, stronger than the first two tests, was miniaturized. After the launch, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency estimated with “moderate confidence” that North Korea had learned how to make a miniaturized nuclear weapon capable of being delivered by a ballistic missile. But the report said the weapon’s “reliability will be low. ” Military officials in the United States and South Korea publicly expressed doubt that North Korea had actually developed such a warhead. Missiles: In May 2013, North Korea launched three   missiles into the Sea of Japan. Magnitude of Earthquake: 5. 1 Device: North Korea claimed this device was a hydrogen bomb. In May, American and South Korean intelligence officials concluded that North Korea was now able to mount nuclear warheads on   and   missiles that would be capable of hitting Japan and South Korea. Missiles: In April, North Korea launched a missile from a submarine. Magnitude of Earthquake: 5. 3 Device: South Korean officials said this was North Korea’s most powerful device to date. Missiles: In June, North Korea successfully launched an   ballistic missile into high altitude after five consecutive failures. The missile may be capable of reaching American forces based on Guam, in the Pacific Ocean.",0

1300,Opioid Prescriptions Drop for First Time in Two Decades - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   After years of relentless growth, the number of opioid prescriptions in the United States is finally falling, the first sustained drop since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. For much of the past two decades, doctors were writing so many prescriptions for the powerful opioid painkillers that, in recent years, there have been enough for every American adult to have a bottle. But for each of the past three years  —   2013, 2014 and 2015  —   prescriptions have declined, a review of several sources of data shows. Experts say the drop is an important early signal that the   prescription opioid epidemic may be peaking, that doctors have begun heeding a drumbeat of warnings about the highly addictive nature of the drugs and that federal and state efforts to curb them are having an effect. “The culture is changing,” said Dr. Bruce Psaty, a researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle who studies drug safety. “We are on the downside of a curve with opioid prescribing now. ” IMS Health, an information firm whose data on prescribing is used throughout the health care industry, found a 12 percent decline in opioid prescriptions nationally since a peak in 2012. Another data company, Symphony Health Solutions, reported a drop of about 18 percent during those years. Opioid prescriptions have fallen in 49 states since 2013, according to IMS, with some of the sharpest decreases coming in West Virginia, the state considered the center of the opioid epidemic, and in Texas and Oklahoma. (Only South Dakota showed an increase.) So far, fewer prescriptions have not led to fewer deaths: fatal overdoses from opioids have continued to rise, taking more than 28, 000 lives in 2014, according to the most recent federal health data. That number includes deaths from both prescription painkillers, like Percocet, Vicodin and OxyContin, and heroin, an illegal opioid whose use has been rising as access to prescription drugs has tightened. While experts agree that the decline is real, they differ on what it means for patients. Some say opioid prescribing has been too loose for too long, and that it must be tightened, even if that means extra hurdles for patients in pain. “The urgency of the epidemic, its devastating consequences, demands interventions that in some instances may make it harder for some patients to get their medication,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “We need to set up a system to make sure they are covered. But we cannot continue the prescription practice of opioids the way we have been. We just can’t. ” Others argue that efforts to rein in prescribing have gone too far and are penalizing patients who take the medicines responsibly and need them for relief. “The climate has definitely shifted,” said Dr. Daniel B. Carr, the director of Tufts Medical School’s program on pain research education and policy. “It is now one of reluctance, fear of consequences and encumbrance with administrative hurdles. A lot of patients who are appropriate candidates for opioids have been caught up in that response. ” Opioid painkillers present a uniquely difficult public policy puzzle, in part because they became so essential to so many Americans and health officials remained deadlocked for years over how to handle them. In the past, prescribing of opioids was limited, often aimed at the pain that comes after surgery or with terminal illnesses like cancer. But it took off in the 1990s, as drug companies and medical experts argued that opioids could be used to treat chronic conditions like back pain without addicting patients. Medical residents began learning that pain was the “fifth vital sign”  —   a body function to be assessed after temperature, heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure  —   and that opioids could help mitigate it safely. Sales of the drugs exploded, rising to nearly $10 billion in 2015, from $1 billion in 1992, according to IMS. But recently, some doctors say they have detected a shift in the attitudes of some patients toward opioids. “It used to be that people would come in and sometimes be quite insistent” about receiving opioids, said Dr. Wanda Filer, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. But in the past year or two, she said, “I think we’ve seen some dampening of that effect. It’s all anecdotal, but I’m hearing it state by state, all around. ” Nationally, some of the biggest declines have been in the prescribing of hydrocodone, according to IMS and Symphony Health. These drugs, which include brands like Vicodin and Lortab, remain the most broadly prescribed opioids, often given after routine dental work or other minor procedures. Prescriptions for OxyContin declined, but those for generic oxycodone went up, IMS data showed. The data measures numbers of prescriptions, not pills, but is a rough proxy for Americans’ use of opioids. One important development that may have helped propel the decline came in 2014, when the federal government tightened prescribing rules for one of the most common painkillers: hydrocodone combined with a second analgesic, like acetaminophen. In the first year after the measure took effect, dispensed prescriptions declined by 22 percent, and pills by 16 percent, according to an analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine. Refills  —   which the change made much more difficult  —   accounted for 73 percent of the decline. Over the past few years, medical schools have stepped up efforts to impress upon students the dangers of opioid prescribing. Dr. Jeanmarie Perrone, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, predicted the next generation of doctors would be appropriately “much more sparing” in their use of opioids. “When I was a resident, treating patients’ pain as a vital sign was assumed,” said Dr. Branson Page, an emergency medicine doctor in Raleigh, N. C. who finished his residency in 2008. “Now, more of us are aware that even prescribing a small number of opioids to a patient who’s never taken them before is rolling the dice on whether that patient will become addicted. ” Still, Dr. Perrone, who helped review new federal guidelines on prescribing opioids for chronic pain, said there was some risk in making young doctors “too cautious. ” “Sometimes now I will see a patient with a resident who says, ‘I don’t want to give them opioids,’” she said. “But of course they need opioids  —   they have lung cancer and worsening pain. ” The   public debate is changing minds in other medical practices, too. Dr. Mitchell Stark, an oral surgeon in Rockville, Md. said he cut his opioid prescribing this year after reading an article about teenagers getting addicted after having their wisdom teeth removed. Now he tells even patients recovering from multiple extractions to try   ibuprofen first. “I don’t want to be the person who gets a call from someone saying, ‘My kid had an overdose with the Vicodin he had left from getting his wisdom teeth out,’” Dr. Stark said. State prescription drug monitoring programs, online databases that let doctors check whether a patient is getting prescriptions from other doctors, have also helped drive declines. Tennessee tried hard to get doctors to consult the database it set up in 2006, to no avail  —   the number of doses prescribed rose by 12 percent from 2010 to 2012, state officials said. So in 2013, the state made checking the database mandatory, and the number of doses declined by 14 percent from 2012 to 2015. Many experts say that the drop in prescribing is at best a half victory, in light of the rise of deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic painkiller. Some addicts who started with prescription painkillers are merely turning to such street drugs or getting their hands on prescription drugs by other means. “We are seeing, in our area, many more pharmacies being robbed,” said Dr. Richard Vaglienti, the director of outpatient pain services at WVU Medicine, a health system in West Virginia. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged caution. “It’s a tide turning, but you have to put it into perspective,” he said. The current level of prescribing, he added, “still leaves us in very dangerous waters. ”",0

A top confidant to Hillary Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta suggested the person who told the former secretary of state she could use a private email should be “drawn and quartered,” according to a leaked email chain. 
“Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?” Neera Tanden, of the Center for American Progress, asked Podesta in a July 2015 email . The email was one of thousands released by WikiLeaks from Podesta’s hacked Gmail account. 
“And has that person been drawn and quartered?” Tanden added. “Like whole thing is f*cking insane.” 
Clinton has said former Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested she use a private email, just as he did, while serving as the U.S.’s top diplomat. Clinton also said she used a private email server for “convenience” and it was done in accordance with State Department guidelines. Though, she did say it was a “mistake” for her to use a private server. 
Powell, however, criticized Clinton for trying to bring him into the email issue. 
“Sad thing,” Powell wrote to a friend in a hacked email. “HRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me to it.” 
“I told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton’s [ sic ] party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these ‘character’ minefields,” Powell wrote, adding he tried to meet with Clinton aide Cheryl Mills to settle the issue.

The ACLU has a message for Donald Trump. 
NEW YORK — In response to Donald Trump’s election as president of the United States, Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , had the following statement: 
“For nearly 100 years, the American Civil Liberties Union has been the nation’s premier defender of freedom and justice for all, no matter who is president. Our role is no different today. 
“President-elect Trump, as you assume the nation’s highest office, we urge you to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. These include your plan to amass a deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants; ban the entry of Muslims into our country and aggressively surveil them; punish women for accessing abortion; reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture; and change our nation’s libel laws and restrict freedom of expression. 
“These proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed, they are unlawful and unconstitutional. They violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. If you do not reverse course and instead endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of card-carrying supporters are ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights. 
“One thing is certain: we will be eternally vigilant every single day of your presidency and when you leave the Oval Office, we will do the same with your successor.",0
1303,Figuring Out When and Why Squids Lost Their Shells - The New York Times,"Shaped like a torpedo and about as swift, squids are   underwater predators. Together with their nimble brethren, the octopus and cuttlefish, they make for an agile invertebrate armada. But that was not always the case. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the ancestors of the tentacled trio were slow, heavily armored creatures, like the   ammonites and the   belemnites. Alastair Tanner, a doctoral student at University of Bristol in England, wanted to better understand why those cephalopods lost their shells. But though both ammonites and the belemnites have left behind rich fossil records, their   descendants have not. So Mr. Tanner conducted a genetic analysis of 26 present day cephalopods, including the vampire squid, the golden cuttlefish and the southern   octopus. With the molecular clock technique, which allowed him to use DNA to map out the evolutionary history of the cephalopods, he found that today’s cuttlefish, squids and octopuses began to appear 160 to 100 million years ago, during the   Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Mr. Tanner published his findings last week in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. During the revolution, underwater life underwent a rapid change, including a burst in fish diversity. Some predators became better suited for crushing shellfish, while some smaller fish became faster and more agile. “There’s a continual arms race between the prey and the predators,” said Mr. Tanner. “The shells are getting smaller, and the squids are getting faster. ” The evolutionary pressures favored being nimble over being armored, and cephalopods started to lose their shells, according to Mr. Tanner. The adaptation allowed them to outcompete their shelled relatives for fast food, and they were able to better evade predators. They were also able to keep up with competitors seeking the same prey. Today most cephalopods are squishy and  . The biggest exception is the nautilus. But though there are more than 2, 500 fossilized species of nautilus, today only a handful of species exist. Squid and octopus species number around 300 each, and there are around 120 species of cuttlefish. The differences in number, compared with the nautilus, indicates the advantages that these cephalopods may have gained over their shelled relatives, according to Mr. Tanner. “It became a much more successful strategy to be a really high metabolism, very rapid moving animal,” Mr. Tanner said, “and they evolved into these really quite amazing things we see today. ”",0

1305,‘Mad About Mary’: How The Times Covered Mary Tyler Moore - The New York Times,"Mary Tyler Moore, who died on Wednesday at 80, had a   career in show business. But she is most remembered for two indelible sitcom roles: Laura Petrie on “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and later, Mary Richards on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ” [ Read Mary Tyler Moore’s obituary | 5 great episodes to stream ] Ms. Moore first appeared in The New York Times in 1962, during the first season of “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” which ran from 1961 to 1966. A reporter interviewed her during a brief trip to New York to   CBS executives and affiliates. (“When they saw Mary, there was quite a bit of applause and a few whistles,” a network spokesman said.) By 1965 the show was a hit and Ms. Moore was a star. The writer Joanne Stang called her the “virtually uncontested popularity queen of weekly television,” marveling that Ms. Moore “has made housewifery a highly palatable pastime. ” “I guess they simply like me,” Ms. Moore said in the article. At the time she was preparing to try to leverage her TV success into a film career, having recently signed a contract with Universal. But she was similarly   about her prospects. “If I don’t have the chemistry for the big screen, I guess I’ll look for something else to do when the ‘Van Dyke Show’ goes off,” she said. Ms. Moore did appear in films like “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “What’s So Bad About Feeling Good?” and “Change of Habit,” but it was another television show that became her defining role. “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” which Ms. Moore produced with her   Grant Tinker, debuted in 1970, arriving in an era whose social mores were signified by the groaner headline The Times used to introduce it and other new   series: “Out of the Kitchen, Ladies. ” Early coverage was similarly dismissive: “Mary Tyler Moore is caught in a preposterous item about life as an ‘associate producer’ in a TV newsroom,” Jack Gould wrote in The Times in a preview of the 1970 TV season. In his brief review of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” Mr. Gould complained that the star was saddled with “one set of bizarre happenings at a TV station’s newsroom and another in her living accommodations. ” But within a few years, The Times had reconsidered its stance. “Consistently tight writing and good acting have made this situation comedy the best of its kind in the history of American television,” Dan Menaker wrote in 1973. The following year, The Times was revealing “Why 30 Million Are Mad About Mary. ” (The answer: She is “beautiful and sexy, but not threatening. ”) As the show wrapped up its run, during which it had broken ground in prime time with its depiction of a single professional woman, an Associated Press article in The Times noted that the show “laid to rest the myth that audiences would not accept a situation comedy involving a woman, unless she was married and burned dinner at least one night a week. ” “I’m just part of it,” Ms. Moore said in the article. “But it really has affected a lot of people, all to the good. ” Ms. Moore’s career never again reached the heights of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” but she stayed busy branching out into musicals and additional,   series, and playing against plucky type in TV movies and films like “Ordinary People” and “Flirting With Disaster. ” In the twilight of her career, as the lifetime achievement awards started rolling in, she embraced her signature role in lighthearted reunion specials and in the occasional interview. In 2012, Neil Genzlinger, a television critic for The Times, watched the series finale of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” with the actress, who apologized in advance for a watery eye that had been plaguing her. “As we finished,” Mr. Genzlinger wrote, “Ms. Moore reached for the tissue box. ‘Now I am crying,’ she said. ‘It’s not just a bad eye. ’”",0
1306,"Mar-a-Lago, the Future Winter White House and Home of the Calmer Trump - The New York Times","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend, he did it in   opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump’s    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump’s   private club in Florida, where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City, is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president’s winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the property’s original owner, who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million, turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trump’s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite, and he opened up   ’s membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trump’s victory in November,    has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. “It’s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long,” said Jeff Greene, a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010, who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch, upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold, beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a scene resembling a mansion in “Sunset Boulevard” or “Citizen Kane,” two of Mr. Trump’s favorite movies. At night, the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd, among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next, the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Year’s Eve party on Saturday night, a   white menu included “Mr. Trump’s wedge salad,” a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a “breakfast buffet. ” Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump’s two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trump’s business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump’s aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump’s combative public persona  —   often on display during his campaign  —   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. “   is an environment he can control,” said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. “I watched him hold court  —   he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed. ” Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors. He described the   as “seeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious. ” Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip, he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job, Rex W. Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him “Mr. Exxon. ”) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs, which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns, the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy, the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is Mexico’s richest man. Mr. Trump his wife, Melania and their    son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (“My Way,” a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from “Fiddler on the Roof. ” Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so  —   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner’s coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important “that we keep Donald and his family safe. ” Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around, and expect it will continue. “The loser in this game is Camp David,” said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. “Once you’re at    and it’s so opulent and   the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp David’s Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely. ”",0

Is it from the outside? Kind of working on the outside and in the perimeter and working with everybody to get the Republicans to change their thinking? Or is it better off being on the inside and actually running for a Congress or Senate seat or whatever it may be? Can I do more good there? And those are the things that I am evaluating. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
1308,Austria Spearheads Balkan Frontier Defence Project,"Austria is joining forces with 15 other Eastern European countries to stem the flow of migrants northwards, as they believe the European Union (EU) has failed in its duty to protect the region’s borders. [Under the banner of the Balkan Frontier Defence Project, the countries will ensure that their police and military forces are in constant contact to ensure the vigilant protection of the national borders northwards of Greece, and repelling illegal immigrants from those borders.  Austrian Defence Minister   Doskozil (SPÖ) told Die Welt: “We do not believe that the EU’s external borders are adequately protected so far by the EU. That is why Austria, together with 15 other countries along the Balkan route and the Visegrád states, is planning a close cooperation in the framework of a new Balkan frontier defence project. “If there is a mass influx of migrants, the states involved in the border protection initiative want to be able to act quickly. In the event of a crisis, we will work towards a common situation using clearly defined contacts and a regular exchange of information between the police and military heads of the countries involved. ” To strengthen Austria’s capacity to respond, the minister is also working on a change in the law which would allow the country to send troops abroad. Currently, Austrian troops can only be dispatched for humanitarian missions, but he said the government would like to widen their scope. “Austria is ready to offer countries both inside and outside the EU, not only for humanitarian reasons but also for the protection of their borders, if these countries ask us to do so and we have sufficient capacities,” he said. The moves are being made, Doskozil said, because the amount of illegal smuggling taking place in the Balkans and the number of migrants are both still “significant”. At present, between 500 and 1, 000 migrants are arriving in Austria each week, but the minister said the situation could deteriorate rapidly at any time thanks to the fragile nature of the EU’s deal with Turkey. “We must intensely prepare now for the [Turkish] government’s reopening of the sluices in Ankara, which President Erdoğan has already threatened several times to do,” Doskozil said, adding: “Erdoğan is not a reliable partner of the EU. ” He went on to criticise the current number of illegal migrants in the EU as “too high” calling for much more to be done to bring down their numbers. “Return centres, higher penalties for asylum seekers who violate the rules, and massive cuts in illegal immigrants’ money would all be appropriate means,” he suggested, calling for an “EU repatriation summit” to be convened to discuss   action across Europe. “The previous initiatives, such as the stronger role for Frontex in repatriation, are far from sufficient,” he said. “It would be best to have a European repatriation officer of rank and name, who could take on this important issue. ”",0
1309,How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election," The Failure of Democracy
How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election By Paul Craig Roberts
 I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.
Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this:
is not endeared to the oligarchs.
 Who are the oligarchs?
Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.
The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.
The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.
The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.
Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.
The extractive industriesenergy, mining, fracking, and timberthat maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.
The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israells way.
What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes reporting and the facts on the ground.
According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.
I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillarys public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida:
Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.
I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.
I also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country.
This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote.
By controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.
And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.
That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election.
If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No glitches caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.
The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripesacademics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreignerslive in a false reality.
In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.
 Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following. Roberts' latest books are The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism and Economic Dissolution of the West , How America Was Lost , and The Neoconservative Threat to World Order .",0
1310,Donald Trump Acknowledges Not Paying Federal Income Taxes for Years - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump explicitly acknowledged for the first time during Sunday’s debate that he used a $916 million loss that he reported on his 1995 income tax returns to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years. Mr. Trump’s response  —   “Of course I do. Of course I do”  —   was the fullest the wealthy developer had provided since The New York Times reported  that he had declared the loss, and that the tax deduction could have been large enough to allow him to avoid federal income taxes for up to 18 years. Previously he had declined to comment on the documents, issuing a statement that neither challenged nor confirmed the $916 million loss. Asked directly during the debate if he would say how many years he had avoided paying federal income taxes, Mr. Trump responded, “No. ” But at the same time, he asserted that he paid “hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes,” calling it a “simple” thing. “I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too,” he said. Unless Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, releases his tax records, it is impossible to determine exactly how he has handled his taxes and what he has paid over the years. If he does not make his taxes public, he will be the first   presidential candidate in four decades not to do so. Though the issue has been overshadowed in recent days by a recording of Mr. Trump’s lewd comments about women, his refusal to release his tax returns  —   and the possibility that he had not paid federal income taxes for years  —   has emerged as a central issue in the campaign. During the debate, Mr. Trump appeared to shed some light on his approach to taxes, saying that he knew more about the tax code than any other presidential candidate in history. “I have a  . A lot of it is depreciation, which is a wonderful charge,” he said. “I love depreciation. ” But as Mr. Trump explained his own tax situation, he tried to make the case that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was among those responsible for the tax code that enabled him to get benefits. “She has given it to us,” he said. Mr. Trump also went on to invoke Mrs. Clinton’s wealthy allies. “Many of her friends took bigger deductions,” he said. “Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. ” Mrs. Clinton, though, contended that Mr. Trump provided an example of what needed to change in the tax code  —   saying he was among the people who “paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education. That is wrong. ” She proposed a tax on people who make more than $5 million, calling it the “Buffett rule. ” In Mr. Trump’s case, what is clear is that he derived remarkable tax benefits from the financial ruin he left behind in the early 1990s through mismanagement of three Atlantic City casinos, his   foray into the airline business and his   purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. “Simply put, the organization is in dire financial straits,” New Jersey casino regulators concluded after reviewing his business balance sheet woes in 1990. The 1995 tax documents, which were anonymously mailed to a New York Times reporter, were the first page of a New York State resident income tax return, the first page of a New Jersey nonresident tax return and the first page of a Connecticut nonresident tax return. They did not include any pages from Mr. Trump’s 1995 federal return. Mr. Trump was correct when he said he benefited from a provision that had been used by other wealthy families. Known as net operating loss, it allows an array of deductions, business expenses, real estate depreciation, losses from the sale of business assets and even operating losses to flow from the balance sheets of those partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations onto the personal tax returns of people like Mr. Trump. In turn, those losses can be used to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income. With a $916 million net operating loss in 1995, Mr. Trump could have avoided paying more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years. Mr. Trump appears to have embraced other elements of the tax code. In 1991, he lobbied federal lawmakers to relax tax rules that he claimed had strangled the real estate industry. And in less than two years, as part of a   budget deal, Congress passed a set of provisions sought by developers that could have helped Mr. Trump avoid large tax bills linked to his enormous debt racked up by the early 1990s, while also allowing him to spin other real estate losses into valuable offsets on his future earnings in licensing, television and other ventures. One provision allowed real estate investors with highly leveraged properties to accept forgiveness of their bank loans without paying taxes on the money, in exchange for giving up other tax benefits. Another allowed them to apply some real estate losses against other kinds of income. While details of Mr. Trump’s income taxes and any deductions are scarce, limited details are contained in government filings that have been unearthed during his campaign. For example, Mr. Trump paid more than $71, 000 in federal income taxes on about $218, 000 of taxable income earned from 1975 to 1977, according to a 1981 report assessing his fitness for a casino license. During the next two years, 1978 and 1979, he paid no taxes, the report said. Mr. Trump also avoided paying any federal income taxes in 1984, tax court records show. With his Atlantic City casinos in financial trouble in 1991 and 1993, casino commission reports show that he claimed losses that would have allowed him to avoid paying income taxes in those years. Voters in recent polls have shown interest in Mr. Trump’s taxes. A CBS   York Times poll last month showed that 59 percent of respondents said it was necessary for him to release his tax returns. Mr. Trump has said he will not release his taxes while he is facing an audit from the Internal Revenue Service. “I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, but, but as soon as my routine audit is finished I’ll release my returns,” he said. “I’ll be very proud to. ”",0
1311,Why Deep Breathing May Keep Us Calm - The New York Times,"For generations, mothers have encouraged children to take long, slow breaths to fight anxiety. A long tradition of meditation likewise uses controlled breathing to induce tranquillity. Now scientists at Stanford University may have uncovered for the first time why taking deep breaths can be so calming. The research, on a tiny group of neurons deep within the brains of mice, also underscores just how intricate and pervasive the links are within our body between breathing, thinking, behaving and feeling. Breathing is one of the body’s most essential and elastic processes. Our breaths occur constantly and rhythmically, much like our hearts’ steady beating. But while we generally cannot change our hearts’ rhythm by choice, we can alter how we breathe, in some cases consciously, as in holding our breath, or with little volition, such as sighing, gasping or yawning. But how the mind and body regulate breathing and vice versa at the cellular level has remained largely mysterious. More than 25 years ago, researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles first discovered a small bundle of about 3, 000 interlinked neurons inside the brainstems of animals, including people, that seem to control most aspects of breathing. They dubbed these neurons the breathing pacemaker. In the years since, though, little progress had been made in understanding precisely how those cells work. But recently, a group of scientists at Stanford and other universities, including some of the U. C. L. A. researchers, began using sophisticated new genetics techniques to study individual neurons in the pacemaker. By microscopically tracking different proteins produced by the genes in each cell, the scientists could group the neurons into “types. ” They eventually identified about 65 different types of neurons in the pacemaker, each presumably with a unique responsibility for regulating some aspect of breathing. The scientists confirmed that idea in a remarkable study published last year in Nature, in which they bred mice with a single type of pacemaker cell that could be disabled. When they injected the animals with a virus that killed only those cells, the mice stopped sighing, the researchers discovered. Mice, like people, normally sigh every few minutes, even if we and they are unaware of doing so. Without instructions from these cells, the sighing stopped. But that study, while literally breathtaking, raised new questions about the capabilities of other neurons in the pacemaker. So for the newest study, which was published recently in Science, the researchers carefully disabled yet another type of   neuron in mice. Afterward, the animals at first seemed unchanged. They sighed, yawned and otherwise breathed just as before. But when the mice were placed in unfamiliar cages, which normally would incite jittery exploring and lots of nervous sniffing  —   a form of rapid breathing  —   the animals instead sat serenely grooming themselves. “They were, for mice, remarkably chill,” says Dr. Mark Krasnow, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford who oversaw the research. To better understand why, the researchers next looked at brain tissue from the mice to determine whether and how the disabled neurons might connect to other parts of the brain. It turned out that the particular neurons in question showed direct biological links to a portion of the brain that is known to be involved in arousal. This area sends signals to multiple other parts of the brain that, together, direct us to wake up, be alert and, sometimes, become anxious or frantic. In the mellow mice, this area of the brain remained quiet. “What we think was going on” was that the disabled neurons normally would detect activity in other neurons within the pacemaker that regulate rapid breathing and sniffing, says Dr. Kevin Yackle, now a faculty fellow at the University of California, San Francisco, who, as a graduate researcher at Stanford, led the study. The disabled neurons would then alert the brain that something potentially worrisome was going on with the mouse since it was sniffing, and the brain should start ramping up the machinery of worry and panic. So a few tentative sniffs could result in a state of anxiety that, in a rapid feedback loop, would make the animal sniff more and become increasingly anxious. Or, without that mechanism, it would remain tranquil, a mouse of Zen. The implication of this work, both Dr. Krasnow and Dr. Yackle say, is that taking deep breaths is calming because it does not activate the neurons that communicate with the brain’s arousal center. Whether deep breathing has its own, separate set of regulatory neurons and whether those neurons talk to parts of the brain involved in soothing and pacifying the body is still unknown, although the scientists plan to continue studying the activity of each of the subtypes of neurons within the pacemaker. This area of research is in its infancy, Dr. Yackle says. It also so far involves mice rather than people, although we are known to have breathing pacemakers that closely resemble those in rodents. But even if preliminary, this research bolsters an ancient axiom, Dr. Krasnow says. “Mothers were probably right all along,” he says, “when they told us to stop and take a deep breath when we got upset. ”",0
1312,News: A Somber Moment: Cubs Fans All Over The World Are Still Too Sad About Princess Diana To Celebrate The Cubs’ World Series,"Email 
Last night the Chicago Cubs eked out a thrilling game 7 victory in the World Series against the Cleveland Indians and ended a championship drought that had lasted for 108 years. This is a historic moment to be sure, but there will be no smiling and cheering in Chicago: Fans of the Cubs are still too sad over the death of Princess Diana to do any celebrating. 
“I honestly never thought I’d see the Cubs bring home the trophy, but everyone here is still too swept up with grief over Lady Di to really enjoy themselves right now,” said Cubbies superfan Raymon Lindley, who was among the thousands of fans who gathered outside Wrigley Field following last night’s edge-of-your-seat game to light candles in memory of the late Princess Of Wales. “It would be macabre to celebrate the win in light of what happened to Princess Diana on that fateful August night in 1997.” 
Theo Epstein, the curse-breaking president of baseball operations for the Cubs, has shipped the World Series trophy overseas to Britain, where it is to be laid on the grave of the People’s Princess. While the people of Chicago are undoubtedly proud of their Cubs, no parade has been planned, as the general feeling of the city is that it would be too gratuitous at this time. 
“I just called my 91-year-old grandfather, who waited his whole life to see the Cubs win the World Series,” said longtime season-ticket holder Karen Hunter. “We spent the entire call crying about Princess Diana together. She was so young.” 
“I would give a thousand Cubs World Series wins if Lady Di could be alive for one more day,” Hunter added. 
History has been made, and the Cubs finally have their much-sought-after championship, but fans clearly still have a long way to go before they’re comfortable celebrating the historic achievement. Aside from the occasional outburst of “Candle In The Wind” by groups of bereft fans, Wrigleyville will remain a quiet and mournful place until the Cubs faithful are ready to party with their victorious hometown heroes. And it’s anyone’s guess as to when that will be.",0
1313,"Starbucks Brand Crashes After Announcement of Plan to Hire 10,000 Muslim ’Refugees’ - Breitbart","The Starbucks Coffee brand has taken a major hit since the company’s announcement that it would hire 10, 000 Muslim “refugees” in response to President Donald Trump’s temporary travel moratorium in January. [Starbucks was one of those early to criticize President Trump for putting a temporary hold on immigration from a list of seven   countries flagged by the Obama administration. In response, the coffee house giant pledged to hire 10, 000 Muslim refugees over five years in protest against Trump’s order.  But since the company issued its   statement its brand name has lost its luster with customers. Perception levels of the Starbucks brand name fell by an incredible   since its January announcement, according to a YouGov survey, as reported by Yahoo Finance. The survey measures how potential customers feel about a company’s brand and asks if they have “heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, was it positive or negative. ” In the week before the company’s January refugees announcement, 30% of respondents said they would consider spending money at Starbucks. But after the statement that number fell to 24 percent, the survey discovered. The company’s announcement immediately sparked a #BoycottStarbucks movement on Twitter and brought condemnation from coast to coast. Not long after Starbucks issued its   refugee statement, many Americans began to wonder why Starbucks is slighting the hiring of Americans  —   especially U. S. military veterans  —   in favor of refugees. Ultimately, on the heels of its refugees announcement, the company felt enough pressure to issue a second statement to explain to America’s military veterans that the company doesn’t actually hate them.

1315,"Norm Macdonald’s Often Funny, Always Fabulist ‘Based on a True Story’ - The New York Times","In May 2015, Norm Macdonald appeared on the    episode of “Late Show With David Letterman. ” He did about six minutes of   comedy, and then choked up when recalling the first time he saw Mr. Letterman perform. Finally, unsuccessfully fighting back tears, he turned toward the host’s desk and told him, “I love you. ” It was a jarring moment from the   Mr. Macdonald, and it represented a few more seconds of sincerity than you get in the 240 pages of “Based on a True Story,” his often very funny but always very fabulist “memoir. ” The book is most direct, and most convincingly   about the job of comedy. “  comedy is a shabby business, made up of shabby fellows like me who cross the country, stay at shabby hotels, and tell jokes they no longer find funny,” he writes in the introduction. Later he describes the dependable range of reaction from audiences: “They either hate you or they don’t completely hate you. ” Mr. Macdonald has always been a comic’s comic, best loved for his     which has shades of Steven Wright’s concise wordplay and Andy Kaufman’s   extended pranks. Those who aren’t comedy nerds know him best from his stint as the host of “Weekend Update” on “Saturday Night Live,” from 1994 to 1997. In “Based on a True Story,” Mr. Macdonald lists the “Top 25 Weekend Update Jokes of All Time (in no particular order),” starting with one from Chevy Chase’s tenure as host and then 24 from his own. There’s only one joke included about the O. J. Simpson trial. Mr. Macdonald feasted on the Simpson case during his time as anchor. (A compilation of the brief setups and punch lines on YouTube runs to more than 26 minutes.) When Mr. Macdonald was dismissed from that segment, the move was widely thought to have been orchestrated by the NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer, a friend of Mr. Simpson’s. (Mr. Ohlmeyer denied that his friendship with Mr. Simpson was behind the decision.) So it’s belated inside baseball for Mr. Macdonald to take on Mr. Ohlmeyer in this memoir. But it’s scathing and funny, too. In the comedian’s wicked reimagining, Mr. Ohlmeyer was upset when the O. J. jokes stopped, leaving him without material for teasing his buddy. “I’d give him the business about this whole   thing,” Mr. Macdonald has his fictional version of Mr. Ohlmeyer say. “Lay a couple of zingers on him from your Update segment. Boy, old O. J. would see red, I’m here to tell you. And the more steamed he got, the funnier it struck me. ” A memoir in the sense that it’s roughly organized by the timeline of Mr. Macdonald’s life and career, this book is absurd fiction in many of its details, even the most basic ones. “I was a hick, born to the barren, rocky soil of the Ottawa Valley, where the richest man in town was the barber,” Mr. Macdonald writes. He actually was born and raised in Quebec City. Likewise, he may have had an intense crush on Sarah Silverman during their time on “Saturday Night Live” together, but he most probably didn’t have Colin Quinn help him arrange a hit on the life of Dave Attell, a fellow comedian and rival suitor. The book is also structured around a fictional (or partly real, who’s to say) road trip to Las Vegas undertaken by Mr. Macdonald and a friend. Mr. Macdonald has spoken about his   gambling problems, though the book mostly presents them as just more outlandish material. (His best bit on the subject: “I remember a psychiatrist once telling me that I gamble in order to escape the reality of life, and I told him that’s why everyone does everything. ”) Mr. Macdonald’s   work has a philosophy behind it, which is expressed in the book this way: “A joke should catch people by surprise it should never pander. Applause is voluntary, but laughter is involuntary. ” Some of what’s here won’t be a surprise to fans. The book recycles pieces of Mr. Macdonald’s   like his claim that he was in “great shape” as an infant. At 1 year old, he writes: “I even looked good for my age. Strangers would always approach me, smiling, and they’d say, ‘Look at you, little boy, what are you, zero? ’” We’re also treated to the “moth joke,” a   Dostoyevskian setup for a   gag. (It reads more smoothly than the version once shakily delivered on air to Conan O’Brien.) The book doesn’t stray far from   and “Saturday Night Live,” and why would it? Mr. Macdonald’s one big starring film vehicle, “Dirty Work” (1998) was called “leaden,   attempted comedy” in The New York Times. Other roles have included an uncredited bartender in “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. ” Fans will know going in but others should be forewarned that Mr. Macdonald’s punch lines, cartoonish as they are, are often built on grim foundations: prison rape drug deals gone very bad a young boy whose dying wish is to kill a baby seal. It’s easy to believe that Mr. Macdonald is unusually funny while also understanding the limits of his career outside of clubs. He’s an oddball by nature who also seems to have genuinely cultivated a disregard for conventional success. This memoir’s evasive clowning is in keeping with all that. Some might hate it, but most won’t completely hate it.",0
1316,Trade Deficit Falls by 10% as U.S. Factories Benefit from Economic Stability Around the Globe,"The U. S. trade deficit shrank by nearly 10 percent in February, hinting that the economy may be growing at a faster pace than many economists expect. [The deficit fell to a seasonally adjusted $43. 6 billion, lower than the $44. 6 billion economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected. Exports rose 0. 2 percent to $192. 9 billion in February while imports declined 1. 8 percent to $236. 4 billion, the Department of Commerce said Tuesday.  The Trump administration has made the reduction of the trade deficit one of its central economic goals, describing our persistently large trade deficits as both an economic and security risk. February’s decline makes that goal easier to achieve. Exports were boosted by improving economic conditions around the globe, as well as a rise in the value of several major currencies against the dollar. A weaker dollar makes   goods less expensive for foreign buyers. Exports of goods hit their highest level on record, after adjusting for inflation. Exports of services also rose. Overall, exports are 7. 2 percent higher than they were a year ago. Imports declined as U. S. consumers imported fewer consumer goods such as cell phones and autos from abroad. A lower trade deficit is a boost to the economy and may raise   gross domestic product. More importantly, it likely means growth will be even stronger in the spring as manufacturers and service providers kick into higher gear and hire more workers to meet rising global demand. Trade deficits are not necessarily a sign of a weak economy. In a   economy, a large trade deficit can develop as rising wealth pulls in more imports. But when the economy is not growing fast, it can be an economic drag. Spending on exports subtracts from demand in the U. S. economy, benefitting foreign workers instead of Americans in need of good jobs. This can have big impacts on areas of the country where manufacturing is particularly important. Research has shown that the deindustrialization of the American Rust Belt is at least partly attributable to trade imbalances with China, for example.",0

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed on terrorism, jobs, race relations and, above all, basic issues of honesty and trustworthiness during their first presidential debate. If you missed it, let us help you catch up with a few highlights and our rigorous fact checks of the candidates’ assertions. And watch clips from the debate above. _____ 2. Houston suffered through a mass shooting. The authorities said that a heavily armed man wearing a uniform emblazoned with a Nazi symbol opened fire at random in a residential area near a mall. He injured nine people, two of them seriously, before the police shot and killed him. Officials said he was a lawyer and had experienced troubles at his firm. In Washington State, a    Turkish immigrant confessed to killing of five people at a shopping mall on Friday. His motive remains unknown. _____ 3. Nationally, there was good news and bad news. The good news: Millions of Americans have climbed out of poverty, driven partly by widespread moves to increase the minimum wage. The bad: F. B. I. figures showed homicides skyrocketing 10. 8 percent from 2014 to 2015, the largest   rise since 1968. But most of the country was far safer. The killing was largely limited to a few neighborhoods in cities like Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis, Washington and Milwaukee, all plagued by gun violence among young   males. _____ 4. Syrian and allied Russian forces intensively bombed   areas of the tormented northern Syrian city of Aleppo for the fourth day straight, ignoring accusations of war crimes and “barbarism” at the United Nations. Hundreds of people have been killed there since Thursday. Efforts to revive a   have been abandoned. _____ 5. How often do sports teams appear to make decisions based on their player’s welfare? Chris Bosh, one of the N. B. A. ’s top players, says the blood clots that cut his last two seasons short shouldn’t stop him from playing this year, but the Miami Heat’s president, Pat Riley, said Bosh’s career with the team “is probably over. ” They’ll have to pay him some $76 million over the next three seasons, but will get the chance to raise the team’s spending cap. _____ 6. Why is the fashion world obsessed with RuPaul’s “Drag Race,” a platform for those hoping to be “America’s next drag superstar”? Sure, there’s affirmation and visibility for the  . But there’s also drama, courage and sometimes unbelievably great looks. “I’ve seen every episode,” said the designer Marc Jacobs, who has also served as a judge. “It makes me laugh, it makes me cry. ” _____ 7. The admitted mastermind of the Bridgegate scheme testified for the first time about how he came up with the idea to create a catastrophic traffic jam in New Jersey to punish a Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse Gov. Chris Christie’s   bid. David Wildstein, a Christie ally, also testified about how many top Christie operatives he told. He said his exchanges with a Christie aide made it clear the mayor “needed to fully understand that life would be more difficult for him in the second Christie term than it had been in the first. ” _____ 8.

1318,YouTube Advertiser Exodus Highlights Perils of Online Ads - The New York Times,"When Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1. 65 billion, it was considered a pricey gamble, one made with the belief that an online service known for pirated videos and vapid   content could appeal to major advertisers. The bet paid off. YouTube is now one of the pillars of Google’s advertising business and the most valuable video platform on the internet. In recent years, advertisers, unable to ignore its massive audience, flocked to YouTube to reach younger people who have started to shun traditional broadcast television. But the technology underpinning YouTube’s advertising business has come under intense scrutiny in recent days, with ATT, Johnson  Johnson and other   marketers announcing that they would pull their ads from the service. Their reason: The automated system in which ads are bought and placed online has too often resulted in brands appearing next to offensive material on YouTube such as hate speech. On Thursday, the   service Lyft became the latest example, removing their ads after they appeared next to videos from a racist skinhead group. “This is beyond offensive,” a Lyft spokesman, Scott Coriell, said. “As soon as we learned of it, we pulled our advertising on YouTube. ” The pullback from advertisers strikes to the core of YouTube’s appeal. Unlike television, with specific programming during which brands choose to run their advertising, YouTube mirrors the internet’s sprawl, specializing in niche content that may not appeal to a mainstream audience but attracts engaged viewers. This provides YouTube with an enormous audience watching one billion hours of videos a day, perfect for new ad technology that minutely slices and dices an audience so that companies can target specific viewers. That technology, known as programmatic advertising, allows advertisers to lay out the general parameters of what kind of person they want to reach  —   say, a young man under 25  —   and trust that their ad will find that person, no matter where he might be on the internet. This approach plays to the strengths of tech giants like Google and Facebook, allowing advertisers to use automation and data to cheaply and efficiently reach their own audiences, funneling money through a complicated system of agencies and   networks. But more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and while Google has noted that it prevents ads from running near inappropriate material “in the vast majority of cases,” it has proved unable to totally police that amount of content in real time. And that has advertisers increasingly concerned. “The simple truth is that the same tech that allows the posting of a recipe, the joyous video of a child or the exposure of an excessive act from law enforcement allows the creation, posting or sharing of the video of a murder,” Rob Norman, the chief digital officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, wrote this week in Campaign, a trade publication. Marketers have seen programmatic advertising as a groundbreaking development in media  —   a technologically efficient way to leverage the expanse of the internet so that, for example, Pampers can reach a new mom on a local blog or an instructional video about how to deal with a newborn’s baby acne. This has opened up the whole of the internet to brands, which typically opt to remove their ads after they have appeared on unsavory sites, rather than restrict the ads to a list of preapproved locations. That is a radical departure. Not long ago, brands like Procter  Gamble were in fact funding TV shows such as “Gilmore Girls,” “7th Heaven” and “Sabrina, the Teenage Witch” because they wanted more platforms for “family friendly” content. The main concern for advertisers on the web used to be appearing next to pornography, a fear that still ranks high for some, but now seems almost quaint considering the increasing amount of content tied to terrorism, violence and hate speech. It’s not limited to YouTube  —   automated advertising has landed airline ads on news stories about plane crashes, enabled counterfeit clothing companies to flourish on Facebook and even put money in the hands of Russian cybercriminals. Most recently, it has contributed to the proliferation of   fake news and conspiracy theories. “I distinctly remember doing presentations years and years ago, and there was some stat at the time that there were a million   websites and I thought that was ” said Eric Franchi,   of Undertone, an ad technology company. “Now   to 2017, and Google’s display network alone has two million sites. It’s a lot harder to maintain brand safety today than what it was because of the sheer number of sites coming into these exchanges every day. ” That sheer scale, coupled with its reliance on algorithms rather than humans to filter out the objectionable content after it appears, has been Google’s main defense. More than two million websites are a part of its display advertising network  —   the equivalent of one for every resident of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. “What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match. We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time, and so I think we’re going to be O. K.,” Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said in an interview on Thursday with Fox Business Network. While brands have expressed concern about showing up next to unsavory photos and videos uploaded to digital platforms by users  —   like pornography on Snapchat  —   the situation with YouTube is particularly jarring. YouTube splits advertising revenue with its users, meaning advertisers risk directly funding creators of hateful, misogynistic or   content. The   model has minted stars, some of whom gain cultlike followings for edgy and inappropriate content. Last month, the platform cut business ties with its biggest star, Felix Kjellberg, known to his 54 million subscribers as PewDiePie, after The Wall Street Journal reported on crude   jokes and Nazi imagery in his comedy videos. He was part of YouTube’s premium advertising product called Google Preferred  —   a category of popular, “brand safe” videos on YouTube. The latest black eye came from the far less visible trenches of the platform, as The Times of London reported on ads from prominent brands and the British government appearing on YouTube videos posted by extremist groups. Google has pledged that YouTube will tighten safeguards against ads showing up alongside “hateful, offensive and derogatory content” while reviewing guidelines for what type of content is allowable on the platform. “While we recognize that no system will be 100 percent perfect, we believe these major steps will further safeguard our advertisers’ brands, and we are committed to being vigilant and continuing to improve over time,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in a statement on Thursday. There’s a lot at stake for YouTube and Alphabet. Search advertising is not growing as fast as it once did, and television ad budgets are still larger than total spending on digital advertising. YouTube and Facebook have made no secret of their desire for television advertising funds. Internet ad revenue in the United States, which is growing quickly, reached about $60 billion in 2015 while television accounted for about $66 billion, according to a study from IAB and PwC. James Dix, a senior media analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that YouTube accounted for revenue of about $13 billion, or roughly 20 percent of all advertising revenue on Google’s internet properties in 2016. Alphabet does not disclose YouTube revenue. “If this company is going to look for new growth at scale, it has to pull money from television,” Mr. Dix said. “Period. ”",0

  Isabelle Z. Tags: nutrients , food pairings , turmeric (NaturalNews) If you are making a conscious effort to eat nutritious food, you are already stacking the odds in your favor when it comes to your health and well-being. However, eating all the organic fruits and vegetables in the world is not going to do much for you if your body is not prepared to absorb the nutrients they contain.To be clear, eating a diet that is rich in organic produce, whole grains, and a reasonable amount of healthy fats is always preferable to a diet full of fried food, sugar and processed foods. However, if you want to maximize the benefits of your smart eating choices, you should try some of these food pairings to enhance nutrient absorption and give your health a boost. Milk and honey Your grandmother might have offered you a glass of warm milk with honey when you struggled to fall asleep as a child, and this tried-and-true combination has stood the test of time for good reason: it is a very effective pairing for your health. An amino acid found in milk known as tryptophan is used by the brain to make melatonin and serotonin, while the carbohydrates in honey can help with the uptake of tryptophan. Turmeric and black pepper The active ingredient in turmeric, curcumin, has anti-inflammatory properties, but it tends to be poorly absorbed by the body. Interestingly, the piperine found in black pepper can help boost its absorption significantly, which is why many supplements contain both ingredients. Try cooking a dish that contains generous amounts of turmeric , like curry, and add a sprinkling of black pepper. A tiny pinch of pepper can enhance your absorption of curcumin by more than 2,000 percent! Green tea and lemon If you are drinking green tea for its extraordinary antioxidant content, you might want to start adding some organic lemon juice to your cup. That's because Purdue University researchers have discovered that mixing green tea with lemon juice can significantly boost the amount of antioxidants that are available for your body to absorb. The catechins in green tea can help protect your body against cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Olive oil and tomatoes These two Mediterranean diet staples go hand in hand, and it's easy to see why. Tomatoes contain antioxidants that can protect your body from disease, and adding a small amount of healthy fat to carotenoid-rich foods like tomatoes can increase its absorption. Try making a simple salad of chopped tomatoes drizzled in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar to reap the benefits. The lycopene in tomatoes is also better absorbed when they are heated first, so take this one step further and make a tomato sauce or pizza sauce by cooking tomatoes and adding olive oil and www.herbs.news ""="""" target=""_blank"">www.herbs.news"">fresh herbs like oregano. Beans and cauliflower People who follow plant-based diets often rely on beans to get iron, but this type of iron is not as easily absorbed by the human body as iron that comes from meat sources. You can increase your body's absorption of the iron from beans by consuming a food that is rich in vitamin C at the same time, and cauliflower fits the bill quite nicely. Pair cauliflower with green beans or garbanzos to give your body an iron boost. You can also try other iron and vitamin C pairings , like strawberries with oatmeal.While all of these foods are quite healthy on their own, if you are looking to increase your intake of certain nutrients, make sure you are opting for food pairings and preparation methods that will boost absorption so you can reap the most benefits.

1320,Alien Race Colonized And Built Amazing Cities On Venus,"The Magellan spacecraft, also referred to as the Venus Radar Mapper, was a 1,035-kilogram (2,282 lb) robotic space probe launched by NASA on May 4, 1989, to map the surface of Venus. The probe burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 13, 1994. 


During its mission the spacecraft collected an enormous amount of images that have finally been published by NASA in which huge cities, artificial structures and all kinds of elements that seem to obey constructions appear intelligent affected by some kind of alien race that inhabited or colonized the second planet in our solar system.

1321,2 Friars’ Mission: Reviving a Brooklyn Church in a Religious ‘Dead Zone’ - The New York Times,"The two Franciscan friars, complete with   robes, stood behind the bar outside the    church taking cash and slinging cans of Coors and    in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Drinks in hand, over 200 people, many wearing black chokers, macramé bikini tops and denim overall shorts, crowded into the pews on a recent Thursday night, the pop of beer cans punctuating their arrival. But they were not waiting for a sermon  —   they were waiting for Josiah Wise, who goes by the name serpentwithfeet, an RB singer whose songs have heavy gospel overtones. This was not a typical church meeting, but the San Damiano Mission is no longer a typical church. On the brink of closing the church, the Diocese of Brooklyn called in the friars, Nicholas Spano, a deacon, and the Rev. Raphael Zwolenkiewicz, who are reintroducing Catholicism to the neighborhood in unconventional ways. “We’re not here to be an invisible presence, but something very tangible,” Father Zwolenkiewicz, 65, said. “Whether it’s services in the church or out in front of the church just hanging out, or even on the corner, we’ll be in our vestments and saying hello to people as they walk by. ” On the border of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, where Sunday Mass often takes a back seat to brunch and shopping, the church had seen its membership dwindle. “That area in Brooklyn, like many other areas in the Brooklyn Diocese, is undergoing a dynamic change in demographics,” the Rev. Msgr. Joseph Grimaldi, the Brooklyn vicar for the diocese, said last month. “Williamsburg is one of the largest areas that many millennials have settled in, and a good number of them are baptized Catholics, but have not really practiced their faith. ” “With 30 people, you can’t sustain a church,” Father Grimaldi said, “but in this case we came up with a novel approach. ” The friars, members of the First Order of St. Francis, took over the former Holy Family Slovak Church on Nassau Avenue in 2015. First, they changed its name to the San Damiano Mission. Then they looked around. Masses were still being celebrated when most of the neighborhood was asleep, and the oak doors were chained and padlocked much of the time. “All of our images said, ‘We’re gone and closed,’” Mr. Spano, 35, said. They replaced the oak doors with glass ones. “There’s a lot of foot traffic here Wednesday through Sunday between 10:30 p. m. and 4 a. m.,” Mr. Spano said. “To have the church not look its best at that time doesn’t help us. ” On a good Sunday, as many as 50 people now attend Mass. It is not a huge number, “but it is a difference,” he said. St. Francis of Assisi was called upon by God to “rebuild my church for it is in ruin,” Father Zwolenkiewicz said. “So it’s the same idea that we were invited to come here and to reach out to the neighborhood and people who are here, to rejuvenate and to restore part of this community. ” Mr. Spano developed proposals to turn the church into an arts hub and a focal point for the community. The friars wear their robes in public and can often be found running errands and grabbing their morning coffee in the neighborhood. Many are surprised to see the friars, they said, and some even mistake them for actors from a nearby film and television studio. They frequently attend the concerts put on by the Lot Radio station, which operates out of a converted shipping container across the street. The groups have joined forces to raise money to restore a $226, 000 pipe organ for the church by holding shows inside the mission, like the one featuring serpentwithfeet. Sabrina Tamar, 27, has lived near the mission for 10 years. “Most people weren’t aware of this at first, but there’s definitely a sense of community I feel hasn’t been in this neighborhood in a while,” she said before taking her seat at the concert. “It’s wonderful. The friars are so tolerant and welcoming. ” Other residents agreed. “The friars know religion is a dead zone in this neighborhood, so if you want people to participate, you have to not preach,” one resident, Nikki Cohen, 30, said. She said she discovered the church through the radio station and the concert series. “This is a social place,” she said, “a community place you can come and hang out. ” For Aaron Sutula, the church beckoned. Mr. Sutula, 34, attends church only on Christmas. But he said he walked by one night and the mission was empty, but its lights were on, so he stepped inside and lit a candle. “My grandfather had just died the year before,” Mr. Sutula said. “They don’t have real candles because it’s New York City, so you just hit a button and it turns on the light. But it was nice. ” The friars have also paired with a Lutheran church to offer some services to homeless people, including making showers and barbers available every other Monday at the mission. At a recent Sunday Mass, only about 25 people were in the pews. On this particular Sunday, a party at the Lot Radio the night before had kept some parishioners home from services, Mr. Spano said. Toward the end of the Mass, Mr. Spano made several announcements, including an update on the pipe organ. They hope to have it back by Easter, he said, though once the organ is reinstalled, the fog machine used for concerts will have to go.",0

1324,"Merkel says Facebook, Google 'distort perception,' demands they 'reveal algorithms'","Thu, 27 Oct 2016 08:47 UTC © Francois Lenoir/Reuters Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a broadside at internet media giants, accusing them of ""narrowing perspective,"" and demanding they disclose their privately-developed algorithms. Merkel previously blamed social media for anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right. Comment: Obviously it has nothing to do with your immigration policy. Only right wing racists would ever have a problem with that. Right comrades? ""The algorithms must be made public, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like: what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others? "" said Merkel during a media conference in Berlin on Tuesday. Comment: What we have here is a confluence of stupid. Take a politician who doesn't understand technology, give them a microphone, and listen as they embarrass themselves with hyperbolic pronouncements and decrees. ""These algorithms, when they are not transparen t, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information. "" Google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a user's liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a user's own media interests . These algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website, and comprise some of the most highly-protected trade secrets in the world, potentially worth billions. No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. Merkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating ""bubbles"" of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. Comment: Hypocrite says what? The rule with politicians is: ALWAYS INVERT. What Merkel means to say is that: large platforms allow people to get a more concise summary of news from smaller providers, which is squeezing out the larger state propaganda news agencies. ""The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users ,"" warned Merkel. ""This is a development that we need to pay careful attention to."" Comment: See what we mean. What she is saying here is: ""People shouldn't be able to choose what they want to read, we should make sure that what they read is what we (the state) wants them to read. "" Can't have all willy-nilly preference reading, now can we. The internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels. German establishment raises 'Sword of Damocles' over social media   attack on social media by Merkel and her Grand Coalition government , and while the German politician advocates diversity of views, she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions t hat are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media . Comment: Her agenda is showing. Last month, Merkel accused AfD, the recently-established anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party, which receives overwhelmingly negative coverage in most newspapers, of ""spreading their lies"" through social media, as it achieves breakthroughs in regional elections around the country. Comment: Couldn't be because of popular support? What functioning brain buys this horsehockey? This is the same kind of thinking that leads tot he belief in magical spells. What, these ""right-wing"" parties have learned the 14 words to magically turn anyone into a racist? A year ago, at the height of the refugee influx into the country, Merkel, who was first elected in 2005, was caught on a hot mic personally pressing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to clamp down on anti-migrant posts during a UN session in New York. A fortnight ago, the leader of Merkel's parliamentary CDU faction, Volker Kauder, said that social media should be fined €50,000 for failing to remove ""hate speech,"" saying that a ""Sword of Damocles"" has to hang over social media. Kauder also called for warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites, to be given to those about to go on social media. Justice Minister Heiko Maas - who said that there had been a 77 percent increase in hate crimes following the arrival of 900,000 asylum seekers - has given internet media companies until February next year to comply with EU directives on xenophobia and racism , or face legal action. Comment: You see the language game? Immigrant = asylum seeker = refugee. But those words are not the same, they are all different things. Xenophobia is the fear of foreigners, and racism is the belief that certain ethnicities have inescapable inherent traits. These words are not cognates, nor are they even within the same semantic continuum. They are bombarding you with a bunch of negative words hoping they'll stick. Why? What do they want you to think? And do you really want to think it?",0
1325,Texas Cop Fired For Feeding ‘Feces’ Sandwich To Homeless Man,"Videos Texas Cop Fired For Feeding ‘Feces’ Sandwich To Homeless Man The San Antonio officer was reported by at least two fellow officers for his attempt to feed a homeless man a feces sandwich.   A homeless man sleeps on the steps of St. Bartholomew’s Church, Tuesday, June 23, 2015 in New York. 
The San Antonio Police Department — known for its strict measures against homeless people — announced that it had fired a five-year veteran police officer after he attempted to feed a homeless man a “fecal sandwich” in May. 
According to the department’s statement, police officer Matthew Luckhurst bragged to a fellow officer about trying to feed the man human feces before his unnamed colleague reported the incident to the internal affairs in July. 
“This was a vile and disgusting act that violates our guiding principles of ‘treating all with integrity, compassion, fairness and respect,’” Chief William McManus said in a statement Friday. “The fact that his fellow officers were so disgusted with his actions that they reported him to Internal Affairs demonstrates that this type of behavior will never be tolerated.” 
In 2014, however, McManus wanted to make giving money to homeless people a crime but the idea was shelved after public outcry. 
The decision to fire Luckhurst was based on recommendations by two separate review boards which were upheld by McManus. The Associated Press reported that at least two officers reported the incidents to internal affairs. 
However, Luckhurst’s lawyer told the San Antonio Express-News, which first reported the story, that his client would appeal the decision and denied that the incident had taken place ever and his comments were a “joke.” 
According to the local San Antonio Current, the police issued more than 12,000 citations in 22 months between 2013 and 2014 related to “violations of city laws aimed at discouraging the homeless and poor from hanging out downtown or asking for donations.” 
The newspaper said homeless people were charged with aggressive solicitation — seeking donations in an intimidating manner — solicitation within forbidden zones, camping in a public place, littering, spitting, urinating or defecating in public, disorderly conduct and sitting or lying in manners obstructing the public’s right of way. 
According to Haven For Hope, there are almost 3,000 homeless people in the city, of whom 42 percent have no shelter and sleep in the streets.",0
1326,"State: Official Portraits of POTUS, VPOTUS, Cabinet Not Yet in Place - Breitbart","It is tradition, following the election of the president of the United States, that his official portrait, that of the Vice President, and those of cabinet members in various agencies are installed, replacing the portraits of the outgoing administration.

Although it is unknown why this is the case, officials at the State Department have confirmed to Breitbart News that the walls are bare for now  —   including no portrait in place of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. A spokesperson told Breitbart News on Tuesday: The State Department has not yet received the official portraits for the President and Vice President. As soon as the White House official portraits of the President and Vice President are available, the State Department Bureau of Administration will distribute the White House portraits and the official portrait of the Secretary of State to all offices as well as all posts abroad. But a report from Fox News in March reveals some of the bureaucratic issues that could be stalling portrait installations. “A dispute at a Florida VA medical facility could foretell the coming of widespread bureaucratic battles when thousands of copies of President Trump’s official portrait are sent out to be displayed in federal facilities around the nation,” Fox reported. “The portraits, in addition to ones of Vice President Mike Pence and various cabinet officials, will replace those of their predecessors, as dictated by tradition,” Fox reported. “But to some in the politically polarized bureaucracy, the prospect of President Trump’s likeness watching over them is already causing problems. ” Rep. Brian Mast ( ) hung unofficial portraits of Trump and VA Administrator Dr. David Shulkin in a VA medical center in his West Palm Beach district and they were almost instantly taken down. “I insisted that I would like to see them hung,” Mast told Fox News in an email. “The information desk called for a maintenance person who was seen helping me hang it. ” Fox reported that it is up to the General Services Administration’s publishing office to pass around the portraits and the agency had not said when the official portraits would go out   —   back in March. “Mast, a U. S. Army veteran who lost both legs to an IED in Afghanistan, felt strongly that the frames already emptied of portraits of President Obama and former VA Secretary Robert McDonald should be occupied immediately and brought his own photos of Trump and VA Administrator Shulkin,” Fox reported.",0
1327,"Mike Allen, Politico’s Newsletter Pioneer, Is Handing Over the Reins - The New York Times","SIREN: WASHINGTON TO LOSE ITS DAILY BARD AT A MOST UNCERTAIN TIME: MIKE ALLEN WILL STOP WRITING POLITICO’S MORNING PLAYBOOK COLUMN MIDCAMPAIGN, on July 11  —   A Guide to Capital Intrigue Through Entire Obama Era and Part of W. Bush’s  —   MILLENNIAL TAKEOVER: Politico Young Guns ANNA PALMER, JAKE SHERMAN and DANIEL LIPPMAN Grab the Baton  —   CHANGES IN STORE FOR A NEW ENVIRONMENT  —   Times Subscription Deal: 50 percent off for a year! DRIVING THE COLUMN If information is the lifeblood of Washington, the Politico writer Mike Allen’s Playbook forms the veins. Pumped out by email every morning, it is where the most influential political operatives in the United States send tidbits or bigger news scoops that they hope will give them the edge in the D. C. skirmish of the week, month or year (and sure, maybe settle a score or two). They do so because it’s what 100, 000 insiders, outsiders, lobbyists and journalists, governors, senators, presidents and   presidents read every morning of the week to be in the know, or, in some cases, to see their own names in print. If they say they do not look for it in their inboxes in their first waking minute, they are lying. Even if you’re not one of these addicts, it reaches you, too, because the distillation of what Mr. Allen considers the most vital news items of the day can influence the thinking of television news producers and Mr. Allen’s rival national political reporters, sometimes in a   way (especially when Mr. Allen has included their work in his list of TOP TALKERS) and occasionally in an   way (especially if he has dismissed their work as    USED NEWS). THE CONVERSATION Mr. Allen’s Playbook provides a daily sense of cohesion for a town at war with itself. Along with important news items, Playbook lists birthdays, births and swanky parties where Republicans and Democrats manage to hold hostilities in check for a couple of hours. It can also carry the whiff of   coziness, pack journalism and clubbiness that pervades our capital city, contributing to Washington’s case of acute  . But that also goes with its role as official D. C.’s village square. The central element of its success has been the frenetic mind of Mr. Allen, who is preparing to start an undisclosed media venture with his Politico colleagues Jim VandeHei and Roy Schwartz. DATA DU JOUR Monday will be the 3, 285th consecutive edition of Playbook. Mr. Allen has written all but eight (Hat Tip: Peter Cherukuri). FLASHBACK “The Man the White House Wakes Up To,” by Mark Leibovich New York Times Magazine, cover, April 2010. “He bursts in and out of parties, at once manic and serene, chronically toting gifts, cards and flower arrangements. . .. It is as if Mikey is the host of one big party, and by showing up anywhere in Washington, you have served the Playbook community and are deserving of the impresario’s thanks (or “Hat Tip” in Playbookese). . .. Allen was the first reporter hired by Politico’s founding editors, John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei, when they left The Washington Post to start the website and newspaper in 2006. He is considered a Politico ‘founding father.’   …     He speaks in quick and certain cadences, on message, in sound bites. ” Playbook reads in the clipped rhythm that Mr. Leibovich describes, with big, bold headlines, ellipses and em dashes. It separates its items with headings like DRIVING THE DAY, FLASHBACK,   and SIREN (a homage to the internet news titan Matt Drudge) and others that I’m imitating here. What can’t be imitated is the intimacy Mr. Allen has with his audience. THE MONEY, HONEY  Politico found dollars in that intimacy. Big corporations with big business pending in Washington  —   Comcast, BP, the United States Chamber of Commerce  —   take Playbook sponsorships that come in the form of paid items that are marked with asterisks and laid into the flow of the newsletter. Such arrangements, which have at times drawn media criticism for blurring journalistic lines, bring in about $55, 000 a week, an executive vice president, Mr. Cherukuri, told me. Playbook also provides the mother ship with a platform to promote itself, through the newsletter (which I mimicked at the top  —   50 percent off   journalism! ). It all makes Mr. Allen’s departure from Playbook kind of a sensitive deal for the company. ODD TIMING (?) The timing of Mr. Allen’s Playbook retirement  —   in the middle of a presidential election for the ages  —   is unexpected. But Mr. Allen told me on Friday that he agreed with Mr. Harris, the editor in chief, that “2017 effectively begins now, so this is the perfect time for the new team to get airborne. ” Mr. Allen will continue writing for Politico through the election. It does make some sense it always seemed odd that Mr. Allen, 51, would carry on in his   role while a new venture beckoned and the team forming to succeed him was eager to make a splash. Inside Politico’s sleek new offices in Arlington, Va. on Thursday, Mr. Harris asked me, “How do you replace Mike? The answer is you don’t replace Mike. ” These days, brands can be more important than the news organizations they are attached to. Can Politico replicate Mr. Allen’s success at Playbook? Mr. Harris said that it could and that if Politico’s business was to be “scalable,” a franchise like Playbook  —   now with geographically targeted versions in places like Miami and Brussels  —   cannot be built around “a singular personality. ” He added: “I’m not sure anybody else could have invented the franchise, but he’s shown other people how to do this job and how to own this space. ” WHO THEY ARE Anna Palmer, 34, and Jake Sherman, 30, frequently write together as a team  —   they helped break open the scandal that forced the resignation of Representative Aaron Schock of Illinois in 2015  —   and pitched themselves to Mr. Harris as natural   of Playbook 2. 0. (CNN Money reported they were in the running in April.) Mr. Sherman has covered Capitol Hill for Politico since 2009. Ms. Palmer has covered Congress and was a   of Politico’s newsletter specializing in lobbying, called Politico Influence. Daniel Lippman, 26, who has been helping Mr. Allen with Playbook since 2014  —   and is a peripatetic emailer and   himself  —   will assist them. SNEAK PEEK Playbook was built to meet Politico’s vow to “own the morning,” and to be “delivered by automatic email” to the BlackBerry, as it proclaimed at its start in 2007. The new version will be made for today’s smartphones, with color and items that can be shared more easily on Twitter and Facebook. A standing Playbook home page, to be introduced later, will update throughout the day. Mr. Lippman will bring continuity from Mr. Allen’s tenure. Ms. Palmer is interested in “the changing roles for women in Washington and women in politics  —   they’re chiefs of staff and leaders on the Hill, and Playbook needs to reflect that. ” Mr. Sherman says the goal is “expanding the ecosystem of Playbook.   …     We’re of a generation that is coming up and is grabbing control of power in Washington   …     the   to    who are running the town now. ” GAME CHANGE Just when Donald J. Trump and the populist forces he represents are upending Washington’s established order, the town is losing its daily bard. (“The End of Our Times!” the Bloomberg “Masters in Politics” podcast   Tammy Haddad said, only half joking.) But Mr. Allen, who will continue to practice journalism at his new company, said of his successors, “This is the perfect time for them to step in. ” MIKE ALLEN MIND MELD I can’t wait to “sleep in” until 5 a. m. BIRTHWEEK Mr. Allen turns 52 on Tuesday, June 21.",0
1328,Police: Gang of 5 Arrested for Murders of 2 Colorado High School Students - Breitbart,"Police arrested a gang of five Hispanic suspects for the brutal murders of two teenagers whose bodies were found alongside a rural Colorado road, reports say. [On March 12, the bodies of Natalie Partida, 16, and Derek Greer, 15, were found on the shoulder of Old Pueblo Road near Fountain, Colorado, a town immediately south of Colorado Springs.  By March 24, five Hispanics, at least one with gang tattoos, were arrested for the murders. The first arrest occurred on March 19 when the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office announced the arrest of Gustavo Marquez, 19, for the murders of the two Coronado High School students. Gustavo, who has a long record of violence, was charged with kidnapping,   assault,   assault, and child abuse charges. Days later, police also arrested Diego Chacon, 18, Joseph Arthur Rodriquez, 18, Marco Antonio   20, and Alexandra Marie Romero, 20, for the crime. All were booked on various charges such as kidnapping, robbery, and child abuse. Police have still not released specific details of the condition of the murdered teens’ bodies or if either of the victims was sexually assaulted. There has also been no confirmation of the immigration status of the suspects. “Since the investigation is still ongoing, I don’t want to give away some of the tactics we used, the investigative tools that assisted us, only because there still may be additional arrests forthcoming,” El Paso County Sheriff’s spokesperson Jacqueline Kirby told CBS Denver. All five suspects are expected to appear in court next week. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
1329,BREAKING: Attempted Assassination of Donald Trump (VIDEO),"November 6, 2016 210 The attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a rally in Nevada has some eerie similarities to the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. Share on Facebook 
1968 was a grim year in American history. The Tet Offensive in Vietnam made many people who were never part of the anti-war movement, question why America had entered a deadly war of attrition. In April of that same year, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was shot dead. 
Into this fray stepped Robert Kennedy, a man whose intelligence, charm, charisma and modern policies came close to putting ice over the fire that was late 1960s America. He consciously stood as an anti-war Democratic in a primary which pitted him against the party’s pro-war establishment led by Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson’s vice president. Although the lesser known Eugene McCarthy also stood as an anti-war candidate, it was Kennedy whose personal fame and personal draw, turned heads and inspired voters more than any other. 
But it was not to be. In an America drowning in blood both at home and in the jungles of Vietnam, Robert Kennedy was the victim of an assassination. In the summer of 1968, Kennedy had just won the crucial California primary and was addressing his supporters at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Just after he walked away from the podium, he was shot dead by the Palestinian gunman Sirhan Sirhan. 
The images of Robert Kennedy slouched dead on the floor become an iconic reminder that the 1960s for all of its counter-cultural optimism, was politically speaking, a very dark time for America. 
Hours ago, Donald Trump, a man who like Kennedy, challenged the pro-war establishment of his party and of Washington itself, was seemingly the victim of an attempted assassination plot. Although certain facts have yet to be revealed, what we do know is that a man making threatening gestures who is said to have had a gun was tackled by Trump’s supporters. Seconds later, security hurried Trump off state and arrested the would-be assassin. 
In spite of poor reporting from the ground, there are actually more facts at hand than there are mysteries. 
Donald Trump has been vilified and dehumanized by the western mainstream media. His supporters are described as pigs, as the great unwashed, as the talentless, heartless and the stupid. He himself is described as much worse. Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters ‘deplorable’. In a country more ill at ease with itself than at any time since the Vietnam era, these words are very dangerous indeed. 
Many sociologists postulate that the reason large sectors of the German population remained aloof and indifferent to the crimes of the fascist regime of the 1930s and 1940s, was because the victims of Hitlerism were purposefully constructed to be less than human by the state. Therefore a dead Russian, dead German Jew or dead Pole was somehow less of an issue than the death of a Hitler loving Teutonic man. 
The techniques applied to dehumanising Trump and his supporters are eerily similar. That is why, should any physical harm come to Donald Trump, the mainstream media have blood on their hands as much as any would be assassin. 
Two other things became clear. Donald Trump’s supporters warned him to leave for his own safety, they restrained the criminal, putting themselves in danger. It is fair to say, many of the brave men and women at the rally in Nevada were willing to give their lives for the man they support. This demonstrates that Trump’s supporters are not the savages that the mainstream media class them as. They are decent people who are angry at the path their country has taken and they feel a loyalty and fraternal bond with a man who speaks to them rather than at them, above them or around them. 
Hillary Clinton and her supporters in the media have put Donald Trump’s life in danger and the look on Trump’s face as he was hurried away by security, showed me a man who loves life, a man who deplores violence and a man who would not want to leave his family behind. I was tragically reminded of the scenes of Gaddafi’s assassination when he begged his executioners, ‘what have I done to you’. 
This is not a man who wants war, this is a man who wants to live in a world of peace, with all its joys, its profundities, its frivolities and its rough edges. 
I am reminded of the words spoken by Marc Antony at the end of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: 
“This was the noblest Roman of them all: All the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great Caesar; He only, in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them. His life was gentle, and the elements So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world ‘This was a man!” 
One could say the same of Trump. 
Update : The authorities have still not said whether the man in question had a gun or not, but the fact he has been released demonstrates either incompetence in terms of the investigation or that he was a hooligan rather than a would be murderer. Photos of the man emerged and as initial witnesses reported, he clearly looked deranged. 
The media has turned this election into a potentially deeply violent affair. All ready they are making the hooligan look like the victim rather than the assailant. This may well not end after the 8th of November. ",0

1332,Boom: Hillary’s private email address ‘whitelisted’ on Obama’s Blackberry,"Print 
[Ed. – Which means the Oval Office IT squad knew Hillary was using a private email address for State Department business, and knew what the address was. No IT professional looking at the metadata on her emails could fail to recognize a private, freelance server. When do these repeated bombshells become so repetitive we don’t even hear them anymore?] 
If this wasn’t enough, the way Obama’s BlackBerry is set up offers even more proof the White House knew about Clinton’s email. 
President Obama’s high-security BlackBerry used a special process known as “whitelisting” that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told Fox News – pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clinton’s private account was used for government business. … 
[T]he “whitelisting” safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission – covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. 
“Whitelisting happens by design. The IT professionals who whitelist devices at places like the White House only add the email addresses authorized by management. To do otherwise would be to violate policy in ways that could introduce threats to the system,” Bob Gourley, former chief technology officer for the DIA, told Fox News.",0

Customer Service Manager Simon Williams, who always seems to be available at short notice, told our reporter, “Everyone in the department was stock still, and I wandered amount them filming with my smartphone. “I was amazed at their ability to remain totally motionless and unfocused on other stimuli. I even filmed the maintenance people outside, tools in hand, completely immobile. “After filming for a record-breaking twenty-five minutes, I realised I’d forgotten to actually send out the email telling people to prepare for the Mannequin Challenge. “I was the only person in the building doing any activity, even if it was just dicking around because of a YouTube craze. “I’ve never felt so alone; it was like waiting for something I knew wasn’t going to arrive, if you can imagine such a thing.” In the past few weeks, the Internet craze known as the Mannequin Challenge has hit offices and gyms across the UK. Participants must strike a pose in the manner of shop mannequins and then be filmed, giving the impression that a fleeting moment has somehow been captured on film.

1338,Bernie Sanders Meets With Pope Francis - The New York Times,"VATICAN CITY  —   For a while, Senator Bernie Sanders’s Roman holiday seemed less than it was cracked up to be. Immediately after his campaign announced that he would leave the United States for a “  meeting” at the Vatican, questions arose about the wisdom of the trip. The critical New York primary was just days away. One official of the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which hosted the conference Mr. Sanders would attend, even suggested he had fished for the invitation. Most critically, there seemed to be little chance that Mr. Sanders would meet the Vatican resident whose name he frequently invokes. Pope Francis, it turned out, would not be visiting the conference of the academy, an   think tank of the Vatican. Politically, a trip to Rome without a meeting with Francis would have been a blunder, Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Fordham University who is teaching at Yale, had said on Friday. “The point is to make sure you are going to get an audience with the pope,” he said. “Anything short of an actual visit will probably be a mistake. ” Mr. Sanders continued to hold out hope. “I certainly would be delighted and proud if I had the opportunity to meet with him,” he said before leaving New York. He also had two things going for him: his host, Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, an Argentine who is the chancellor of the academy and happens to be close to Francis, and his hotel room, also close to the pope. Mr. Sanders was to stay in a   room at Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse where Francis keeps his residence. “So it won’t be difficult to find the pope,” the bishop said last week, seeming to hint at something. On Thursday, the day before the conference, a Vatican spokesman appeared to end all speculation, saying, “There won’t be a meeting with the Holy Father. ” Bishop Sánchez Sorondo dismissed the statement as “Roman gossip. ” But final word, it seemed, came Friday afternoon in the form of a handwritten letter from the pope apologizing to conference attendees for his absence. “I will keep them all in my prayers and good wishes, and send them my heartfelt thanks for their participation,” he wrote. “May the Lord bless you. Fraternally, Franciscus. ” Around 5:30 p. m. Friday, the conference’s business ended and Mr. Sanders made an appointment for dinner at the Casa Santa Marta with his foreign policy adviser, Jeffrey D. Sachs, the economist and a fellow conference participant. Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, sat with Mr. Sachs and his wife, Sonia, for a soup and buffet dinner, where they were joined by Bishop Sánchez Sorondo and Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga of Honduras, the pope’s   man and one of the Vatican’s top power players. “It was a   conversation,” Mr. Sachs said. “It was about issues of the church and its history, about Honduras and foreign policy. ” But the most important words occurred in the middle of dinner, when a personal secretary for Francis arrived with the news Mr. Sanders had been hoping for, Mr. Sachs said. If Mr. Sanders were in the foyer of the Casa Santa Marta at 6 a. m. the next day, he would be able to speak briefly with Francis as the pope headed to the airport for his Saturday trip to Greece, where the pope would be addressing the migrant crisis. So early Saturday morning, Mr. Sanders stood in the marble foyer, which looks out onto a large cobblestone drive just inside the Vatican walls. Joining him were his wife, Mr. Sachs and his wife and Bishop Sánchez Sorondo, the senator’s de facto Vatican fixer. The pope, speaking to reporters on his plane later in the day, described the meeting. “This morning when I was leaving, Senator Sanders was there,” he said, adding, “He knew I was leaving at that time, and he had the courtesy to greet me. ” No photos of the encounter were permitted, but Mr. Sachs said the senator was delighted all the same. He was beaming as he left the guesthouse, and celebrated the informal audience with a victory lap of sorts in St. Peter’s Basilica along with Mr. Sachs and the bishop, passing Bernini’s Baldacchino, a monumental bronze canopy over the papal altar, and Michelangelo’s Pietà. Aware that his every statement is parsed for deeper meaning, Francis said he was simply being polite, not political. “I shook his hand and nothing more,” he said. “If someone thinks that greeting someone means getting involved in politics,” he added, laughing, “I recommend that he find a psychiatrist!” But the candidate was excited to talk about his coveted souvenir. “I conveyed to him my great admiration for the extraordinary work that he is doing all over the world in demanding that morality be part of our economy,” Mr. Sanders told reporters aboard the plane as it rushed him back to the campaign in New York.",0

1340,BOMSBHELL: Clintons’ Fixer PROVES That Hillary’s Secret Affair Ended In The MURDER Of Her Lover,"BOMSBHELL: Clintons’ Fixer PROVES That Hillary’s Secret Affair Ended In The MURDER Of Her Lover Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Hillary and Bill Clinton have had a sort of “fixer” for the Clinton’s that paid to make problematic issues disappear for the Clintons. He has finally decided to come forward and break silence on his experience, but for the some reason the Clinton’s have refused to deny a thing that he says. Even more shocking is when you take a closer look at Hillary’s ex-lover, it appears that he was shot in the head and Hillary’s odd behavior is having many claim murder. 
Many of those paying close attention to the Clintons’ suspicious dealings and sketchy behavior over the years have long since thought that longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster was indeed having an affair with the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Well, Clinton’s fixer, Jeff Rovin, just confirmed these suspicions. 
Rovin admitted to Sean Hannity, on the record, that Hillary Clinton and Foster had indeed been having an affair for many years. 
This is especially interesting when we analyze the questionable circumstances of Foster’s death that was ruled as a suicide. Foster died of a gunshot wound to the head and a great deal of people who have analyzed the facts strongly believe that it was not a suicide at all, but rather murder. 
Rovin proceeded to run down this road without intending to when he described Hillary’s reaction to Foster’s death: 
He [Rovin] claimed to have helped scrub the office of Vince Foster to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal and covered up an alleged affair between Hillary and Foster. But Rovin told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary’s crew rummaged through Foster’s office. He also called the Hillary-Foster affair “pretty much an open secret.” 
It just seems too close to be coincidence. Miguel Rodriguez, the lead prosecutor in the case submitted a 2-page resignation",0

""В августе террористы разместили в интернете призыв начать «священную войну» против России. Вскоре после этой угрозы двое боевиков напали в Подмосковье на пост ДПС, а в Казани был арестован сторонник ИГИЛ, планировавший взрыв на одном из заводов города. Всё это - хроника жёсткой реальности сегодняшнего дня"", - полагает политик. 
""Однако факты говорят сами за себя - российские спецслужбы оперативно пресекают деятельность террористов, великолепно справляясь с необходимостью удержать ситуацию под контролем"", - отметил депутат. 
""Но очень важно понимать - сегодня всем необходимо мобилизоваться и сплотиться перед лицом общей угрозы. Граждане страны обязательно должны проявлять бдительность, чтобы российская земля горела под ногами преступников. А задача Государственной Думы - обеспечить соответствие законодательства имеющимся вызовам. На мой взгляд, необходимо поощрить гражданскую инициативу по информированию спецслужб о готовящемся преступлении, надо, чтобы вознаграждение проинформировавшему лицу было предусмотрено законом. И главное - это добиться того, чтобы каждый, кто пытается посягнуть на покой россиян, сознавал неотвратимость наказания за это"", - подчеркнул Дмитрий Савельев. Поделиться:",0

1343,"Syrian refugee with FOUR WIVES and 23 CHILDREN ‘claims £320,000 a year in benefits’","By CHARLIE BAYLISS 
The migrant, known only as Ghazia A, fled Syria last year along with his family. 
He has since resettled in Germany with his four wives and 22 of his children. One of his daughters has since moved to Saudi Arabia where she has married. 
The family could be receiving more than £320,000 a year in benefits according to a financial manager on the Employers’ Association website. 
There is no official confirmation on this figure. 
Under Islamic tradition, the 49-year-old can have up to four wives – as long as he can support them financially. 
Germany does not legally recognise polygamy, meaning that Ghazia A was forced to choose a “main wife” so the rest of the family could claim benefits. The other three wives are categorised as “friends” of the Syrian migrant. 
But a local official in the town of Montabaur described the situation as an “exemption”. 
Ghazia A now lives with his “main” wife Twasif and their five children in Montabaur, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate – while the other three wives and children have been moved into neighbouring communities up to 31 miles away. 
The man used to work in a garage and car hire service in his homeland but has not worked since resettling in Germany. 
He expressed an interest in working again but noted his commitments to his family made this difficult.

1344,Indiana YMCA Removes CNN from TVs Over Complaints About ’Fake News’ - Breitbart,"A YMCA in Indiana has removed CNN from the TVs in its wellness and exercise areas over complaints from members upset by the constant fake news the cable network airs. [The Valparaiso, Indiana, YMCA issued a statement to members that the cable news network was removed from facility TVs because too many members complained about the programing.  Debra Koeppen, the YMCA’s chief development officer, said that “Trying to please everyone” is the “No. 1 problem we have in the wellness area,” according to Chicago Tribune reporter Jerry Davich, who claims to be a member of the YMCA in question. Earlier this week, Robert Wanek, CEO of the Valparaiso YMCA, sent a message to members saying, “In order to eliminate perceived political bias associated with national news outlets, the Valparaiso Family YMCA will only be showing local news channels in the future. ” Davich asked the CEO to reveal more details about the removal of CNN from the TVs, but Wanek replied, “I cannot pinpoint the change origins, only to add that we get dozens of requests to change channels every day from numerous interest groups. ” “We just want the Y to be a haven for wellness where people come together and have a sense of belonging, gain new relationships and achieve their personal goals,” Wanek added. “We will display local news moving forward. ” Indeed, Wanek said that from this point forward only local news will be played on the TVs and all cable news networks will be banned. Reporter Davich’s article was far from a straight report on the matter, however. The reporter was an open detractor of the decision to remove CNN from the TVs, clearly stating he and some other members disagreed with the new policy. Davich insisted that CNN was a centrist network and noted that “none” of the members he talked to “agreed with the removal of CNN. ” The reporter gave readers his opinion in the very first sentence, saying, “Is the Valparaiso Family YMCA simply exercising its right to appease as many members as possible, or is the new Donald   America already flexing its muscles?” Davich’s final say on the matter was just as clear. As he wrapped up his story. the reporter complained that “the Y’s decision to remove all national news outlets from its televisions says more about its leaders than its members. You’d think this story would be just another example of fake news. Sadly, it’s not. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
1345,10 Reasons to drink lemon water on an empty stomach,"10 Reasons to drink lemon water on an empty stomach 
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: lemon water , detox , digestive health (NaturalNews) Fruit-infused water is extremely trendy right now. Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Beyonce swear by lemon water first thing in the morning. There are even entire diets based on this fruit. According to some health advocates, drinking lemon water on an empty stomach takes you one step closer to optimal health.But does swapping your morning coffee for this fashionably healthy lifestyle choice offer any significant benefit? Or is this just another health fad? Let's take a closer look at ten incredible reasons why you should start your day with a glass of lemon water. 1. Nutrient powerhouse While low in calories, lemons are loaded with health-promoting essential nutrients, including vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. 2. Boosts immune system Vitamin C plays a major role in our immune system, and lemons are loaded with it. A strong and healthy immune system will help you keep bacterial and viral infections at bay. 3. Digestion aid The citric acid in lemon interacts with enzymes and acids involved in digestion. It stimulates digestion and the secretion of gastric juice. Furthermore, lemon juice loosens toxins in the digestive tract and may help relieve symptoms of indigestion such as bloating, burping, and heartburn. 4. Detoxifies your body Every day, we are subjected to a wide variety of chemicals and toxins present in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. While our body has its own cleansing systems, it is a good idea to put less stress on your already overworked body and give these cleansing mechanisms a boost. Lemon juice stimulates the liver by enhancing its enzyme function, thus helping your body to flush out more waste materials and toxins . 5. Boosts heart and brain health Thanks to its high level of potassium, lemon juice aids in the proper functioning of the nervous system. Furthermore, it has been shown to lower blood pressure which is a major risk factor for a heart attack. 6. Promotes glowing skin Lemons are packed with antioxidants. These little free radical fighting substances help to decrease blemishes and wrinkles for a rejuvenated, radiant skin. When applied to the skin, lemons can also reduce the appearance of scar tissue and age spots. 7. Weight loss aid While lemon juice might not be a weight loss miracle on its own, its high levels of pectin fibers curb the appetite and will help you to eat less at main meals. 8. Fights inflammation Lemon water possesses strong anti-inflammatory properties to soothe a sore throat or inflamed tonsils. Additionally, it removes uric acid from the joints, which is one of the main contributors to chronic pain and inflammation. 9. Boosts energy levels Lemons energize the body and fight feelings of depression and anxiety. So instead of having a coffee in the morning why not try a glass of lemon juice instead? 10. Hydrates your body After a night of hard work, your body is dehydrated and in desperate need of water. Lemon juice provides your body with the much-needed water and electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) to rehydrate body tissue and flush out more toxins and waste materials.While lemon water seems to be the perfect drink to prevent or cure a myriad of our daily aches and pains, not all that glitters is gold. Lemon juice can be hard on teeth enamel. Therefore, it's important to dilute it with water and rinse your mouth thoroughly with filtered water after drinking lemon juice.

1346,Trump Is Deadbeating On His Campaign Debts By Refusing To Pay His Own Pollster,"The Washington Post reported: Donald Trump’s hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. 
But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump campaign’s latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767,000 that Fabrizio’s firm says it is still owed for polling. 
Trump’s decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given Trump’s history of not paying for services performed; it won’t be the last. It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. 
Donald Trump’s mentality has always been to put himself first. Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump. His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it isn’t surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign. 
Anybody who works for the Trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because Donald Trump’s version of making America great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket.

1347,Life: 6 Sizzling Noises That Only ’90s Meat Eaters Will Understand,"Email Meat noises today can’t hold a candle to these classics. 1. If you ask any meat eater to describe what it was like to be carnivorous in the ’90s, don’t be surprised if they reply with their best imitation of this iconic sizzle. 2. This. Sound. The original ’90s sizzle. The good ol’ days when this could be heard across every American grill. While it held enough broad appeal for child meat eaters to enjoy, it always had something a little naughty just for the parents to understand. No smartphones necessary to appreciate this classic griddle noise. 3. Meat eaters in the ’90s went wild when in the now-classic episode of Friends “The One Where Joey Ruins Labor Day,” Joey and Chandler fired up the grill, threw on some burgers and then…well, if you haven’t seen the episode, you won’t get it. 4. Keen listeners will know this one is straight from the summer of ’95, from the Johnson family’s burger barbecue in Orlando, FL. 5. If you’ve never woken up with this sound stuck in your head, it’s because you either weren’t around in the ’90s, weren’t eating meat then, or both. 6. The ’70s were all about hissing, and the ’80s featured their fair share of crackling. But when it came to the ’90s, sizzling was king, and no sizzling noise was more recognizable to meat eaters than this one. And we miss it every day.",0
1348,U.S. military Hackers Report Having Penetrated Russia’s Electric Grid & Communications Networks ‘Encase’,"We Are Change 
NEW: US military hackers have penetrated Russia’s electric grid, telecom network, Kremlin command systems, and are ready to hit back if the Russians try to disrupt Election Day, sources and top secret documents show. According to NBC News Corp. 
WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — NBC News disclosed the penetration in a series of reports, explaining that US efforts parallel claims, also by US officials, that Russia, China and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of US critical infrastructure.
The U.S. use of cyber attacks in the military context — or for covert action — is not without precedent.
During the 2003 Iraq invasion, U.S spies penetrated Iraqi networks and sent tailored messages to Iraqi generals, urging them to surrender, and temporarily cut electronic power in Baghdad.
In 2009 and 2010, the U.S., working with Israel, is believed to have helped deploy what became known as Stuxnet, a cyber weapon designed to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges.
Today, U.S. Cyber Command is engaged in cyber operations against the Islamic State, including using social media to expose the location of militants and sending spoof orders to sow confusion, current and former officials tell NBC News.
One problem, officials say, is that the doctrine around cyber conflict — what is espionage, what is theft, what is war — is not well developed.
The penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an all-out war in cyberspace, according to NBC News, which said it was briefed by a US intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents. At the same time, the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war, making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to US adversaries. NBC News then attempted to link its explosive report to Tuesday’s US presidential election, citing concerns of mischief by Russian hackers that would fall far short of the Armageddon-like scenario that the report implied. Instead, the network explained US election-related concerns as “cyber mischief,” which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation. The Obama administration has created a public, but unconfirmed narrative, that hackers controlled by the Russian government have stolen emails from the Democratic Party headquarters, a private computer used by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while serving as secretary of State and computers used by Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. According to the narrative, Russia stole the emails and gave the messages to WikiLeaks, which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to Tuesday’s election. Russia has denied any responsibility for the Clinton-related hacks and links between WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence have never been substantiated. Moreover, recent media reports in the United States indicate that Clinton’s private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services. The emails have proved especially embarrassing for the Clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the Clinton State Department that favored large donors to the Clinton Foundation in what appear to be “pay-for-play” schemes of selling access and influence. Moreover, the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former President Bill Clinton. Earlier this week, Fox News cited two unnamed sources claiming that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is close to recommending that Hillary Clinton be indicted for corruption while she served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
The FBI has never publicly confirmed an investigation of Clinton Foundation fundraising links to the State Department.
Instead, the FBI has limited its comments to a separate probe of whether Clinton mishandled classified information by using a private server. FBI Director James Comey closed the latter investigation without an indictment of Clinton, only to reopen it last Friday, claiming agents had discovered new emails on a computer used by the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Former federal prosecutor and New York City Mayor Rudi Giuliani has said publicly that FBI agents are in open rebellion against the US Department of Justice for attempting to quash both Clinton criminal investigations.

1349,Senators Push to Broaden Inquiry on Election Hacking - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Pressure mounted on Sunday for a broader congressional investigation of Russian cyberattacks aimed at influencing the American election, even as a top aide to   Donald J. Trump said there was no conclusive evidence of foreign interference. The effort was being led by a bipartisan group of senators, including John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader, who called on Sunday for the creation of a Senate select committee on cyberactivity to take the investigative lead on Capitol Hill. “Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,” the senators wrote on Sunday in a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who has said a select committee is not necessary. “Cybersecurity is the ultimate   challenge, and we must take a comprehensive approach to meet this challenge effectively. ” The developments served to deepen the fissures between   lawmakers of both parties who see American intelligence reports implicating Russia as the basis for additional inquiries and Mr. Trump, who continues to reject the conclusions of those reports. But the developments also put new strain on Mr. McConnell. He now faces calls from Mr. McCain and Lindsey Graham, two Senate Republicans considered well versed on national security issues, to form a select committee. If he were to reject that appeal, he would be subject to criticism that he was trying to avoid a spotlight on an issue that senators in both parties believe is worthy of more focused scrutiny. Mr. McConnell said last week that while he respects the intelligence agencies’ conclusions, the Senate Intelligence Committee is “more than capable of conducting a complete review” itself. He also acknowledged that Mr. McCain could conduct an investigation on the Armed Services Committee, an option that remains open should Mr. McConnell decide against a select committee. Those divisions, coming as the Electoral College prepares to meet on Monday to ratify Mr. Trump’s election and the   completes his cabinet choices, all but ensured that the issue would cloud the first months of Mr. Trump’s presidency, when he will be asking Congress to approve an aggressive legislative agenda. Several permanent congressional committees have already been tasked with examining various aspects of the Russian interference, which has been largely accepted as fact by most members of Congress. But in their letter on Sunday, the lawmakers argued the issue was too important and complicated for an existing committee to take on properly. “We share your respect for, and deference to, the regular order of the Senate, and we recognize that this is an extraordinary request,” the senators wrote to Mr. McConnell. “However, we believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem. ” In addition to undertaking a “comprehensive investigation of Russian interference,” the senators recommended that such a committee also develop “comprehensive recommendations and, as necessary, new legislation to modernize our nation’s laws, governmental organization, and related practices to meet this challenge. ” Select committees, which are typically created to examine a particular issue for a limited time, are rarely formed. The most prominent recent example is the House Select Committee on the attacks in 2012 on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, an inquiry that Democrats have denounced as unduly partisan. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said last week that the House Intelligence Committee would continue its own examination of Russian hacking. Mr. Schumer said in a news conference on Sunday that they intended to avoid such charges of partisanship. “We don’t want it to just be finger pointing at one person or another,” Mr. Schumer said. “We want to find out what the Russians are doing to our political system and what other foreign governments might do to our political system. And then figure out a way to stop it. ” A spokesman for Mr. McConnell, David Popp, referred to Mr. McConnell’s earlier comments and said the majority leader would be reviewing the latest letter. The letter was also signed by Mr. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, two members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that Mr. McCain leads. It follows a signed statement from the lawmakers, released last week, warning that any congressional investigation into the hacks “cannot become a partisan issue. ” Mr. Trump, for his part, has sought to paint the intelligence community’s conclusions about the matter as just that  —   a partisan attack against him. He said last week that the reports were “just another excuse” by Democrats frustrated with the election results that might be used to try to undermine his victory. Asked on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday what information Mr. Trump had received that led him to reject intelligence assessments, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers, insisted that the reports about the hacking were groundless. “Where is the evidence?” Ms. Conway asked, turning the question around. “Why, when C. I. A. officials were invited to a House intelligence briefing last week, did they refuse to go?” Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary under President Obama and President George W. Bush who has offered counsel to Mr. Trump, speculated on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the   “felt the way this information came out through newspaper stories and so on was somehow intended to delegitimize his victory in the election and that he’s reacting to that rather than ‘the facts on the ground,’ as it were. ” But Mr. Gates also said the Russian hacking was aimed at discrediting the American electoral process. “Whether or not it was intended to help one candidate or another, I don’t know,” said Mr. Gates, who also served as C. I. A. director under President George Bush. “But I think it clearly was aimed at discrediting our elections, and I think it was aimed certainly at weakening Mrs. Clinton. ” Mr. Obama, in a news conference on Friday, vowed that the United States would respond to the attack. He said that he was still weighing a mix of covert and public actions to retaliate before he leaves office. And lawmakers from both parties have proposed new sanctions to punish Russia. Speaking Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mr. McCain sought to add urgency to the matter. “There’s no doubt they were interfering and no doubt that it was cyberattacks,” he said of the Russians. “The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we have been totally paralyzed. ” Mr. McCain said that he had faith that “reality is going to intercede at one point or another” on Mr. Trump, suggesting that the   might come to agree about Russian influence. Asked on CBS about Mr. Obama’s pledge of retaliation, Ms. Conway said Mr. Trump “respects” Mr. Obama’s right to respond as he sees fit for the remainder of his presidency. But, she added, that “doesn’t mean that new President Trump will agree with it and continue it. ” “It does seem to be a political response at this point because it seems like the president is under pressure from Team Hillary, who can’t accept the election results,” she said.",0
1350,Scientists Claim That “Most Cancer Research Is Largely A Fraud”,"Share on Facebook “Everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud, and that the major cancer research organisations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them.” The above quote comes from Linus Pauling, Ph.D, and two time Nobel Prize winner in chemistry (1901-1994). He is considered one of the most important scientists in history. He is one of the founders of quantum chemistry and molecular biology, who was also a well known peace activist. He was invited to be in charge of the Chemistry division of the Manhattan Project, but refused. He has also done a lot of work on military applications, and has pretty much done and seen it all when it comes to the world of science. A quick Google search will suffice if you'd like to learn more about him. This man has been around the block, and obviously knows a thing or two about this subject. And he's not the only expert from around the world expressing similar beliefs and voicing his opinion. Here is another great example of a hard hitting quote when it comes to scientific fraud and manipulation. It comes from Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and long time Editor in Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), which is considered to be one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world. I apologize if you have seen it before in my articles, but it is quite the statement. “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine” ( source ) The list goes on and on. Dr. John Bailer, who spent 20 years on the staff of the National Cancer Institute and is also a former editor of its journal, publicly stated in a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science that: “My overall assessment is that the national cancer program must be judged a qualified failure. Our whole cancer research in the past 20 years has been a total failure.” ( source ) He also alluded to the fact that cancer treatment, in general, has been a complete failure. Another interesting point is the fact that most of the money donated to cancer research is spent on animal research, which has been considered completely useless by many. For example, in 1981 Dr. Irwin Bross, the former director of the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research Institute (largest cancer research institute in the world), said that: “The uselessness of most of the animal model studies is less well known. For example, the discovery of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of human cancer is widely-heralded as a triumph due to use of animal model systems. However, here again, these exaggerated claims are coming from or are endorsed by the same people who get the federal dollars for animal research. There is little, if any, factual evidence that would support these claims. Practically all of the chemotherapeutic agents which are of value in the treatment of human cancer were found in a clinical context rather than in animal studies.” ( source ) Today, treating illness and disease has a corporate side. It is an enormously profitable industry, but only when geared towards treatment, not preventative measures or cures, and that's an important point to consider. Another quote that relates to my point above was made by Dr. Dean Burk, an American biochemist and a senior chemist for the National Cancer Institute. His paper, “The Determination of Enzyme Dissociation Constants ( source ),” published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society in 1934, is one of the most frequently cited papers in the history of biochemistry. “When you have power you don't have to tell the truth. That's a rule that;s been working in this world for generations. And there are a great many people who don't tell the truth when they are in power in administrative positions.” ( source ) He also stated that: “Fluoride causes more human cancer deaths than any other chemical. It is some of the most conclusive scientific and biological evidence that I have come across in my 50 years in the field of cancer research.” ( source ) In the April 15th, 2015 edition of Lancet, the UK's leading medical journal, editor in chief Richard Horton stated: “The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Science has taken a turn toward darkness.” ( source ) n 2005 Dr. John P.A. Ioannidis , currently a professor in disease prevention at Stanford University, published the most widely accessed article in the history of the Public Library of Science (PLoS) entitled Why Most Published Research Findings Are False . In the report, he stated: “There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false.” In 2009, the University of Michigan's comprehensive cancer center published an analysis that revealed popular cancer studies are false, and that there were fabricated results arising due to conflicts of interest. They suggested that the fabricated results were a result of what would work best for drug companies. After all, a large portion of cancer research is funded directly by them. You can read more about that story here . There is so much information out there, and so much of it is coming from people who have been directly involved in these proceedings. There is really no shortage of credible sources willing to state that we live in a world of scientific fraud and manipulation. All of this can be attributed to the “corporatocracy” we live in today, where giant corporations owned by a select group of “elite” people have basically taken control over the planet and all of its resources. This is precisely why so many people are flocking towards alternative treatment, as well as focusing on cancer prevention. Much of what we surround ourselves with on a daily basis has been linked to cancer. Everything from pesticides, GMOs, multiple cosmetic products, certain “foods,” smoking, and much much more. This is something that is never really emphasized, we always seem to just assume that donating money to charities will make the problem go away, despite the fact that their business practices are highly questionable. That being said, so many people have had success with alternative treatments like cannabis oil – combined with a raw diet or even incorporated into their chemotherapy regimen – that we should not feel as though there is no hope for the future. The official stance on cannabis is a great example of the very practice of misinformation that I'm talking about. Its anti-tumoral properties have been demonstrated for decades, yet no clinical trials are taking place. I am going to leave you with this video, as I have done in previous articles. It provides a little food for thought. Ignorance is not the answer, although this information can be scary to consider, it’s nothing to turn a blind eye towards. Related:",0
1351,A Big Life Change Is More Planning Than Magic - The New York Times,"A big life change does not come easily. That might seem a bit obvious, because if it were easy, chances are you would have made the big life change that’s on your list of changes you would really like to make. But you haven’t. So my question for you is this: Why not? What’s stopping you from just doing it? It might be money, family obligations, fear or just feeling stuck. If you’re at all like me, you see people doing something transformative, like going to medical school at 45, because they couldn’t imagine being an accountant for 20 more years. It seems magical, like one day they just decided to make it happen. For some people (a tiny few, I suspect) it might work that way. I have found, however, that most of the time, it’s much less magical. In truth, it’s a slog. It takes years of thinking and planning. But after plenty of practice, I think I’ve figured out how to streamline things a bit. You may want to try it yourself. First, embrace the uncertainty of life. As much as we don’t like to admit it, life is uncertain. We never know exactly where it will take us. If you doubt me, go back 10 years and ask yourself where you thought you’d be now. I doubt it looks exactly like you planned. So start by being O. K. with the truth in the old saying, “People make plans, and God laughs. ” Second, be open to possibilities. Many times, we know we want to do something, but we don’t know what “it” is. Explore a bit. Brainstorm. Journal. Allow things to come up and be open to new ideas. Then, once you settle on something, it’s time to plan a bit. At this point, obstacles start to show up, particularly around money. My family first explored the idea of spending a year living outside the United States more than a decade ago. At the time, there were a bunch of reasons it didn’t make sense. Money was just one of them, but it was a big obstacle. So we kept weighing options. For you, it might be as simple as setting aside an hour a week to consider ways to move forward. Ask people who have done the thing you want to do. Use a little of that time you spend on social media for research instead. Little by little, a plan might emerge. If it doesn’t, maybe it’s not time, or it’s not the right plan. As you reach different obstacles, make sure you spend time questioning your assumptions. Maybe something you always considered true is nothing more than someone else’s opinion. Or maybe looking at it from a slightly different angle will produce a different result. Finally, as paths open, head down them. Don’t worry if you experience false starts. I can tell you there will be plenty of those, and you may only need a quick course correction. Almost all of the stories readers shared with me about doing   things involved changing plans, disappointment and lots of hard work. But almost all said that in the end, it was worth it. And one last thing. As you explore making big changes, please realize that maybe nothing needs to change. Sometimes, the permission we seek is to embrace what we have and accept that it brings us real happiness. It’s important to understand that there is nothing wrong with choosing not to change if that’s the right answer for you.",0
1352,"After Donald Trump, Will More Women Believe Their Own Stories? - The New York Times","A week ago, it would have seemed wildly unlikely to most people that Donald J.

But since the release on Friday of a recording in which Trump essentially admits he has a habit of sexually assaulting women, a series of stories involving the Republican nominee seems to be doing just that. Consider the story of the former People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, whom Trump reportedly pushed up against a wall and kissed in 2005. Stoynoff chose to move on with her life rather than speak publicly about what she says Trump did to her. Even as a   working woman, she writes that she still partly blamed herself for the assault well into this year, believing that at some level, she had surely somehow encouraged it. She could not shake the idea of her own culpability until the moment she heard Trump on tape saying he did this kind of thing as a matter of course. “I finally understood for sure that I was not to blame for his inappropriate behavior,” she wrote. Her choices and her thinking, all those years before she told her story  —   they sound familiar. Surely many women her age and older would still respond to those circumstances the way she did, with silence and shame. Certainly, Jessica Leeds, who spoke to The New York Times about an encounter in which she said Trump groped her on a plane, came of age at a time when women were taught, as she put it, “it was our fault. ” Trump’s own camp seems to be working hard to perpetuate the kind of thinking that blames the woman: Eric Trump said in August that a “strong, powerful woman” like his sister Ivanka wouldn’t allow sexual harassment to happen to her. This is not the first time that the subject of a man’s unwanted sexual overtures has emerged unexpectedly from the churning of the political process, and has then come to dominate it. Fourteen years before Stoynoff’s experience, the law professor Anita Hill testified, during Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings, that Thomas had sexually harassed her when she worked for him at, of all places, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The following year,   numbers of women swept into Congress  —   many of them, some have argued, supported by women repulsed not only by Hill’s story, but also by the sight of so many white men on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilling Hill, a black woman, about her motives and questioning her character. If Hill’s single story of sexual harassment had the ultimate effect of galvanizing women, imagine what might happen now that the issue is sexual assault  —   as numerous women have stepped forward to talk about the way Trump helped himself to their body parts. The message of Anita Hill’s experience was this: If you don’t think this is important, if you don’t think this happens to women every day, then you don’t get it. In the past few years, an insistence that women’s right to live free of sexual harassment or assault has picked up new energy, as women on campuses have fiercely taken up the cause. Last year, dozens of women stepped forward to tell their stories of being sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby, empowering other women to speak out about their own experiences, rather than remain silent for fear of being discredited. Hillary Clinton has said, using the words of current feminism, that every rape victim has “the right to be believed. ” (Trump’s supporters have used these words against her, revisiting her role as a defense lawyer in a 1975   case, even as they now deny the credibility of any of the women accusing Trump of molesting them.) But Stoynoff’s story speaks to the durability of ingrained, downright biblical ideas about women’s sinning,   ways. It also testifies to the inevitable advantages conferred by power on those who have it. So what exactly would it take for more women to feel empowered, for more men’s consciousness to be raised on the subject? Maybe this presidential election, of all things, will be another milestone. Grueling and sordid or not, it has placed matters of sex, power and gender at the center of the national conversation, not off in the peripheral space typically reserved for women’s issues in media. It is one thing to be a passive reader of the news about Cosby, or the trials endured by young women on college campuses it is another for the public to consider their electoral choices in light of those kinds of issues. Oddly enough, there is, right now, outrage about the unwanted groping of women among both Republicans and Democrats  —   different men, different victims, but same idea. Is there any bipartisan issue more relevant, or more emotional, than this one? Perhaps Trump is the ultimate gift to feminists: a grabber and bragger who has focused the world’s attention on the outrages women quietly endure on a chronic basis without notice. And perhaps we can now see the   response to Bill Clinton’s own accusers  —   subdued or defensive among liberals on account of his   politics  —   as a near miss of an opportunity, a cultural shift that could have built on the momentum of Anita Hill, but never did. The stories emerging about Trump, as well as his own words, could give women a new way of seeing their own experiences with sexual assault going forward  —   as part of a pattern of male behavior that has been noted, flagged and loudly denigrated.",0
1353,Zimbabwe Dictator Mugabe Rules Out Retirement As he Approaches 93rd Birthday,"AFP  —   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who turns 93 on Tuesday, has no plans to give up power, saying he has no “acceptable” successor in place. [“The call to step down must come from my party, my party at congress, my party at central committee,” Mugabe said in excerpts from a radio broadcast that will air this week and that were printed in the   Sunday Mail newspaper.  “But then what do you see? It’s the opposite. They want me to stand for elections. ” “The majority of the people feel that there is no replacement, a successor who to them is acceptable, as acceptable as I am,” he added. Mugabe, who has kept an iron grip on power since Zimbabwe declared independence in 1980, has repeatedly denied reports of health problems, fuelled in part by frequent trips to Dubai and Singapore. He once quipped that he would rule until he turned 100. “Of course if I feel that I can´t do it any more, I will say so to my party so that they relieve me. But for now, I think I can´t say so,” he said. But Mugabe, long known for his fiery speeches, has appeared unusually subdued in recent public appearances, speaking slowly and keeping his addresses short. In September, he read a speech to parliament, apparently unaware that he had delivered the same address a month earlier. Zimbabwe’s economy has crumbled during Mugabe’s rule, and opponents of his regime are brutally repressed by security forces. Inflation is rampant, and in recent months the country has experienced cash shortages, with the government struggling to pay civil servants. In December, however, Mugabe’s   party endorsed him once again as its candidate for 2018 elections, but rival factions in the party are already jostling to succeed him. He surprised many in the party in 2014 by naming his wife, Grace, head of its influential women’s wing, spurring rumours that she could be nursing her own presidential ambitions. And last week, Grace Mugabe, 51, appeared to dash any opponent’s hopes for succeeding him, saying voters would continue to back Mugabe even when he is dead. “One day when God decides that Mugabe dies, we will have his corpse appear as a candidate on the ballot paper,” she said. “You will see people voting for Mugabe as a corpse. ” In the broadcast, Mugabe applauded US President Donald Trump for promoting nationalist policies that he said echoed his “Zimbabwe for Zimbabweans” stance. “But he is a radical. I don’t know whether the construction of the wall between America and Mexico is feasible, a feasible proposal. It appears quite nasty. ”",0
1354,Uber Expands Self-Driving Car Service to San Francisco. D.M.V. Says It’s Illegal. - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Uber made a big splash in its hometown on Wednesday when it started offering   car service to passengers here, making San Francisco the second city in the world where the   company provides autonomous vehicles for public use. But California regulators made an even bigger splash late Wednesday when they told Uber to stop the service because it was illegal. The company, the officials said, did not have the necessary state permits for autonomous driving. “It is illegal for the company to operate its   vehicles on public roads until it receives an autonomous vehicle testing permit,” Brian G. Soublet, deputy director of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a letter to Uber. “Any action by Uber to continue the operation of vehicles equipped with autonomous technology on public streets in California must cease until Uber complies. ” Uber did not return a request for comment about the letter. The development was an embarrassing twist for Uber, which had set up its San Francisco   rollout as a big event, especially as it competes with other tech rivals to bring autonomous vehicles to consumers. The debut here, where Uber was founded and has its headquarters, was also a larger rollout in terms of size than in Pittsburgh, where the company introduced its first driverless service in September. Even before the service began in San Francisco, questions arose over whether Uber was allowed to test its driverless technology in the city. As of Dec. 8, the company’s name was not listed on the D. M. V. ’s website as having a permit to test the vehicles in the state. Companies like Google, Tesla and General Motors all hold permits to test autonomous vehicles in California. When asked, Uber said that it was compliant with all federal and state laws. In California, it said, the motor vehicle department defines autonomous vehicles as those that drive “without the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person. ” Uber said its   cars, which require a person at the wheel to monitor or control them, did not fall under that strict definition. The dispute was a reminder that Uber has not expanded its service without regulatory hassles. As it has grown, it has run into battles with the authorities worldwide, with regulators often contending that Uber had a dearth of licensed drivers, among other issues. Uber began Wednesday with Anthony Levandowski, its vice president of   technology, saying in a blog post that “the promise of   is core to our mission of reliable transportation, everywhere for everyone. ” The new driverless car service here also coincided with the debut of the XC90   car, a Volvo sport utility vehicle outfitted with lidar  —   a kind of radar based on laser beams, wireless technology and seven cameras. It was produced with Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center, the company’s driverless tech division based in Pittsburgh. For a while on Wednesday, any San Francisco passenger who requested a ride from UberX, one of the service’s cheaper options, might have been picked up by an autonomous vehicle. They would have received a notification in the Uber app, and could accept or cancel and request a regular driver. An engineer behind the wheel in each   vehicle could take over when needed. Three passengers were able to fit into the XC90 vehicles. Riders could use with a large touch screen that displayed the car’s route, as well as a rendered version of the environment the car saw through its cameras and laser guidance systems. Uber also let passengers take selfies from a camera facing the back seat, which they can email to themselves and share on social media. Uber wanted to use the expansion of the program to test routes and terrain beyond what it experienced in Pittsburgh. “We drove in the rain and other kinds of weather, and we’ve added   capabilities since we started in September,” Mr. Levandowski said in an interview, adding that Uber has faced no major issues in its testing in Pennsylvania thus far. “Now we want to see how we operate in this new environment, especially with the giant hills that San Francisco has to offer. ” Uber may have gotten more than it bargained for. Shortly after the service began, one of its Volvo XC90s ran a red light, and was caught on camera. The episode raised questions about the safety of Uber’s   technology. “This incident was due to human error,” Uber said in a statement about the video, which was posted to YouTube. “This vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers. The driver involved has been suspended while we continue to investigate. ”",0
1355,This is no ‘new cold war’; it’s far worse than that,"This is no ‘new cold war’; it’s far worse than that By Eric Zuesse Posted on November 8, 2 
It would end that way because any hot war between the two sides would terminate either in one side surrendering to the other, or else in at least one of the two sides (presumably to be started by the one that’s on the brink of defeat in the traditional hot war) nuclear-attacking the other (as being its only alternative to defeat). In other words, M.A.D. recognized and accepted the fact that for a nuclear power to attack a nuclear power with non-nuclear weaponry will almost certainly provoke a nuclear war at the moment when one of the two is losing (or about to lose) the conventional conflict to the other. Nuclear weapons are weapons of last resort, but they exist in order to prevent defeat. That is what they exist for. If Japan had had deliverable nuclear weapons, then the end of World War II would have been considerably delayed. Japan would have lost because it 
But M.A.D. is not just a physical reality but equally importantly a mutually-shared belief-system, a belief-system that becomes no longer operative if one of the two sides switches to believe that a way exists actually to win a nuclear war—in other words, to believe that conquest of a nuclear power by another nuclear power is a real possibility. During the years prior to 2006, there was an increasing though unspoken belief at the top of the US aristocracy (the people who control the US government—or at least have controlled it since 1981 ), that the United States would be able to win a nuclear war against Russia; and, suddenly, in 2006, the belief was published, and virtually no one who possessed power or influence challenged it; and, from that time forward, M.A.D. was ended on the American side, and nuclear weapons became, in the US, strategized within a new framework (called “nuclear primacy” 
After 1991, when the Warsaw Pact no longer existed, the US military alliance NATO invited into its membership all of the former states of the USSR except Russia (thereby indicating NATO’s continuing hostility toward that particular nation and the fraudulence of NATO’s peace with it), and also invited in all of the USSR’s former Warsaw Pact allies, and so NATO (a now clearly anti-Russian, no longer at all anti-communist, alliance) has come to extend right up to Rus 
Consequently, in the current US-NATO operation on and near Russia’s borders , the Alliance is starting the buildup of its traditional invasion forces. This includes even some US allies that are not in NATO . The supposed ‘justification’ for this amassing of invasion-forces on Russia’s borders is to ‘defend’ against ‘Russia’s aggression’ when (in March 2014 just weeks after the bloody US coup in Ukraine ) Russia enabled the residents of Crimea to rejoin Crimea as part of Russia, of which Crimea had been until the Soviet dictator Khrushchev arbitrarily transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 . That disagreement about Crimea is the supposed root-cause for NATO’s involvement, even though Ukraine still is not (and previously did not want to be) a member of the NATO alliance. Anyway: is the rationalization for NATO’s buildup toward what could become WW III. 
Ever since 19 February 2016, the US has been storing tanks and artillery , sufficient “to support 15,000 Marines,” in undisclosed “confidential,” Norwegian caves. Norway has a 200-mile border with Russia. CNN’s news-report on that was accompanied by a video headlined “Russia Reveals Aggressive Military Plans” . It reported that Russia’s (democratically elected, though not mentioned as such) President, Vladimir Putin, was moving troops and weapons toward Norway’s border. (How would the US respond if Russia were to be storing invasion-equipment and troops in Mexico near the US border? Would the US be moving troops and weapons near the Mexican border to protect against an invasion of America; and, if so, then how accurate would it be if Russia’s media then headlined “America Reveals Aggressive Military Plans”? Hitler’s Germany used those sorts of media-tactics, but this time Obama’s America is doing that.) Marine Corps Times headlined on October 24 th , . 
nd its greatly expanded NATO, thus now surrounds Russia not just with its tanks etc., but with its missiles and bombers, on and near Russia’s borders, and so the flight-time from launch to the nuclear-bombing (if the ground-invasion of Russia encounters defeat) will be less than ten minutes, sometimes even less than the time for Russia to get its own missiles launched in retaliation against ours; and so a US blitz nuclear attack against Russia could conceivably be an entirely one-sided war. Here is how that scenario—the end of physical M.A.D.—has actually become the objective sought by the US government (and the necessary backstory for America’s war-drills on Russia’s borders): 
In 2006, the US aristocracy published in the journal Foreign Affairs, from their Council on Foreign Relations, the first article which said that the US goal should no longer be a continuation of M.A.D., but instead “The Rise of US Nuclear Primacy” , by which the US aristocracy meant the rise of America’s ability to win a nuclear war against Russia. It established this stunning goal merely by saying that such an objective could be achieved and that it should be achieved, and by the article’s being published by the US aristocracy itself (the people who control this country), and by furthermore the US aristocracy not condemning and rejecting and repudiating it but simply letting that article stand with little to no public discussion (and no public debate) about it, much less with the chorus of public condemnations of it in the US press, such as would have happened if America were a democracy—but this nation no longer is a democracy, it has become an aristocracy , and this aristocracy had now published the “Nuclear Primacy,” article. (By contras “The Fallacy of Nuclear Primacy” . That article had no impact.) 
The Foreign Affairs article even was so bold as to assert that “US leaders have always aspired to this goal,” (nuclear primacy)—a wild and unsupported allegation that’s not much different from alleging that not only George W. Bush but all US Presidents after World War II were aspiring to have the ability to conquer Russia (and the authors were asserting that only now was this supposedly terrific ability coming within reach). It was explicit about G.W. Bush’s having this desire: “The intentional pursuit of nuclear primacy is, moreover, entirely consistent with the United States’ declared policy of expanding its global dominance. The Bush administration’ started the determined policy to achieve nuclear primacy) was so dangerous and harmful a President. His invasion of Iraq was merely a sympton of that deeper disease. 
And, so, this article about “The Rise of US Nuclear Primacy,” and “The End of,” M.A.D., was now—since it was published by the CFR and not rejected by any influential group—accepted within the US as a goal, “Nuclear Primacy,” which the US government could and should strive for. That idea, of a winnable nuclear war (winnable by the US, of course), was no longer heretical, no longer viewed as repugnant. In fact, this article had been introduced and accepted by Harvard University simultaneously in its longer form and simultaneously published by their scholarly journal International Security, wh “The End of MAD?” . (The periods are customarily removed from the acronym “M.A.D.,” perhaps in order to associate the M.A.D. concept with the pejorative term, insanity. 
destroy the world ). 
US President Barack Obama is putting the goal of nuclear primacy into place, starting with implementation of Ronald Reagan’s proposed “Star Wars,” Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system, now called the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, and technically called by the name of its current embodiment: Lockheed Martin’s, Boeing’s, and Raytheon’s, Aegis Ashore system, which Obama first made operational in Romania on 12 May 2016 . It’s designed so as to enable a surprise nuclear attack against Russia in which any missiles that Russia might be able to launch in retaliation will supposedly (if the system works 100%) be annihilated during their launch-phase. 
Obama came into office criticizing the ABM plan and pretending not to be hostile toward Russia. He deceived Vladimir Putin into thinking that Obama sincerely wanted to pursue peace and cooperation with Russia. As soon as Obama became re-elected, his verbal smiling teeth immediately became actual glaring fangs. Then, soon after his regime overthrew in a bloody February 2014 coup the Moscow-friendly democratically elected President of Ukraine, bordering Russia , Russia started in the summer of 2014 to ignore the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, because for Washington the next step (beyond Ukraine) clearly now would be Moscow and so all bets were off. The installation of the Aegis Ashore in Romania , which is one important reason why Obama lies to say that all of the Aegis Ashore facilities will be targeted against Iran—and maybe also North Korea—but never against Russia. 
The full Aegis Ashore system, which will require several such sites, is not yet operational. NATO’s PR-arm the Atlantic Council, has mentioned among the Aegis Ashore’s benefits, that for the next such site, in Poland, “Poland announced in late April that it would buy eight Patriot missile batteries from Virginia-based Raytheon Co. in a deal that could generate at least $2.5 billion in US export content.” The US government officials and their friends who have invested in Raytheon and the other ‘defense’ firms did not need to be informed of this by any PR person. They already knew of it from more reliable sources, and perhaps they even have invested in nuclear bunkers for themselves and their friends and their friends’ friends 
Also in 2006, later in that year, specifically on 18 November 2006, was published at Global Research, which is an independent Canadian online international site dealing with geostrategy, a superb summary of the connection that this plan has to America’s string of invasions in the Middle East. It’s titled “Plans for Redrawing the Middle East: The Project for a ‘New Middle East,’” 
It should be noted that in his book, “The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geo-strategic Imperatives,” Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former US National Security Advisor, alluded to the modern Middle East as a control lever of an area he, Brzezinski, calls the Eurasian Balkans. The Eurasian Balkans consists of the Caucasus (Georgia, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and Armenia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan) and to some extent both Iran and Turkey. Iran and Turkey both form the northernmost tiers of the Middle East (excluding the Caucasus4) that edge into Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
The Map of the “New Middle East” 
A relatively unknown map of the Middle East, NATO-garrisoned Afghanistan, and Pakistan has been circulating around strategic, governmental, NATO, policy and military circles since mid-2006. It has been casually allowed to surface in public, maybe in an attempt to build consensus and to slowly prepare the general public for possible, maybe even cataclysmic, changes in the Middle East. This is a map of a redrawn and restructured Middle East identified as the “New Middle East.” 
MAP OF THE NEW MIDDLE EAST 
Note: The map was prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters. It was published in the Armed Forces Journal in June 2006, Peters is a retired colonel of the US National War Academy. (Map Copyright Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters 2006). 
Although the map does not officially reflect Pentagon doctrine, it has been used in a training program at NATO’s Defense College for senior military officers. This map, as well as other similar maps, has most probably been used at the National War Academy as well as in military planning circles. 
Brzezinski’s advocacy of “American Primacy,” fits perfectly with the aristocracy’s support of “Nuclear Primacy,” and appeared eight years before it. His 1998 book was seminal also in many other ways. And, as that Nazemroaya article made clear, Brzezinski’s plan was already being put into effect by the US government, even before 2006. 
However, the person who actually made the seminal decision behind all of this, the decision to conquer Russia, was US President George Herbert Walker Bush, on the night of 24 February 1990, just before the Soviet Union ended. He was the person who decided that after the USSR and its Warsaw Pact terminated, NATO would continue that cold war until Russia has been surrounded by US allies, who are Russia’s enemies, when Russia will ultimately either surrender or else be destroyed by the US and its friends. 
Even if Russia assumes that any such nuclear war would be M.A.D., the government of the US no longer does. That’sRussia’s predicament—and the world’s . 
However, military planners in the US and its vassal nations, do not include in their calculations the world: the impacts that such nuclear winter and all the rest will have if their dream of ‘nuclear primacy’ amounts to anything more than merely the vicious hoax that it is. This fact, of their ignoring the world, is scandalous—against our military planners. They are so obsessed with ‘victory,’ that they are willing to participate in this false and potentially mega-catastrophic dream, of ‘nuclear primacy.’ 
Unless and until nuclear weapons are totally eliminated (which might never happen), their constructive function, of preventing WW III, must continue, not end as a result of ‘nuclear primacy’ and other such lies and delusions. However, the ‘news’ media, especially in ‘The West,’ are not pointing out those lies and distortions, but instead reinforcing them. 
If there is to be a WW III, it will end the world . That is the key fact, which is ignored by ‘The West’s’ military planners. 
NATO needs to end now, just as the Warsaw Pact did in 1991—when an indecent, oligarchic , ‘The West’ continued the Cold War despite the Warsaw Pact’s end, and now is making it hot.

1356,"A Materialist Analysis of Why I am Voting Green, and Why the Left Should Do the Same","shorty By Danny Haiphong E ven as the Democrats and Republicans put forward the two least popular politicians in the country, the U.S. Left “is mired in confusion as to what political direction should be taken.” Many of those who claim to be leftists supported the wars against Libya and Syria. But the Green Party has “consistently stood up against endless war, austerity, and racist state repression and for universal healthcare, education, and peace.” “The Green Party is the only choice that possesses a truly social democratic agenda.” I consider myself a Marxist. However, the term “Marxist” is merely a label. Those who ascribe to the tenets of Marxist thought must place their political affiliations within the context of the current historical moment. Anti-communism and imperialist hegemony have set back the struggle for a classless society to the point where much of the US left is mired in confusion as to what political direction should be taken to confront the challenges before us. One of these challenges is the 2016 elections. The radical left should plan on voting Green this November and building a mass movement around the demands put forward by the Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka campaign. But the corporate assault on the left’s collective consciousness has indeed made it difficult for the Green Party to grab the attention of the masses in the midst of the two-party capitalist circus. I myself argued two summers ago that the left in the United States should not bother with engaging the charade and instead take up a boycott of the Presidential elections [3] . At that point, no movement had emerged to challenge the hegemony of the Democratic Party. The 2016 elections changed this dynamic. Suddenly, the forces in front of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Black Lives Matter movement agreed that both corporate candidates were unworthy of support. “Hillary Clinton has drawn the entire ruling class into the Democratic Party tent.” The energy of these movements was channeled into the Bernie Sanders campaign. Sanders ran as a Democrat. His domestic positions on education, healthcare, and income inequality were supported by masses of young voters. Sanders eventually betrayed his base in typical Democratic Party fashion, but not before it was revealed that the Democratic National Committee had worked diligently to undermine Sanders’ ability to win the nomination [4] . The majority of Sanders supporters and sympathizers have since indicated that they will not vote for Clinton when election day arrives [5] . So why vote for the Green Party in particular? The Green Party is the only choice that possesses a truly social democratic agenda. The Green Party is no Marxist vehicle and it doesn’t attempt to be. What the Green Party does possess are dedicated, principled forces whose positions on war and peace, healthcare, and predatory capitalism threaten the US imperialist apparatus. That is why the two-party corporate duopoly finances its own corporation [6] to bar the Green Party from entrance into the Presidential debates every four years. In the 2016 elections in particular, a real chance was present to organize the 15 percent of pollsters necessary for the Green Party to participate in the corporately controlled debates. The opportunity was squandered by a left that remains weak and fractured. In the past, attempts to organize an election boycott campaign or support a communist party’s Presidential nomination would have sufficed as election strategies to steer the disillusioned populace toward movement politics. However, the 2016 Presidential election is a watershed moment in US imperial history. Hillary Clinton has drawn the entire ruling class into the Democratic Party tent. This has occurred in the midst of the greatest crisis of legitimacy the US imperial state has ever faced. “Both corporate media and capitalist enterprise supported Clinton’s bid to steer the election in her favor.” Sanders and Trump shook the foundation of the two-party corporate duopoly. The rise of Sanders and Trump made the Clinton option desirable only to the ruling class and its minions. Both corporate media and capitalist enterprise supported Clinton’s bid to steer the election in her favor. Not only did the ruling class help her take out Sanders, but it also assisted Clinton in a cover up of the recent WikiLeaks email dump. In emails written by her campaign chair John Podesta, it was revealed that the Clinton campaign planned to use the Trump campaign as right-wing cannon fodder to present Clinton as more electable [7] . Furthermore, the emails also uncovered how Clinton holds a “ public” and “private” position [8] on matters of Social Security and free trade. If left up to Clinton, Social Security retirement benefits and federal regulations of corporate activity would be swept into the dustbin of history. Additionally, the corporate media and the Democratic Party have attempted to frame Donald Trump as a racist, misogynistic pig. According to the Democratic Party, Trump represents the “Worst of America [9] .” The slander of Trump has been an easy job. Trump himself provides all of the ammo. However, the condemnation of Trump is little more than a convenient distraction when it comes from the corporate Democrats. From Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, the Democratic Party has waged endless war, austerity, and racist state repression on behalf of its corporate masters. Hillary Clinton must resort to fear-mongering around Trump because neither her party nor her class has anything to offer the majority of the US electorate. Conditions are thus ripe for an alternative political party to make a strong showing in this and future Presidential elections. The Green Party’s success could inspire the millions of people disillusioned with both choices and show that a mass sentiment against the two-party corporate duopoly does indeed exist. It is the task of communists, radicals, and revolutionaries to organize the disaffected into a class conscious organization capable of stripping power from the ruling class. No such organization exists at the moment. The Green Party doesn’t profess to be this organization, but its demands and platform are surely helpful if utilized to create the conditions required for such an organization to emerge. “If left up to Clinton, Social Security retirement benefits and federal regulations of corporate activity would be swept into the dustbin of history.” So when self-identified leftists make the claim that the left deserves better than Jill Stein [10] , the urgent need for self-criticism becomes clear. One only needs to examine conditions in the US briefly to see that oppressed and working class people deserve better than the left. Of course, the left’s current state is a reflection of the conditions from which it exists and the deep imperialist assault on the consciousness of the oppressed. However, the left has made critical errors in recent years. Many so-called revolutionary organizations have, for example, supported imperialist war in Libya and promoted the notion of lesser evil voting as cover for the Democratic Party. Green Party candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka have consistently stood up against endless war, austerity, and racist state repression and for universal healthcare, education, and peace. Yet there are some who want to claim that such a platform is not adequate or “revolutionary” enough. It is time to shed this sectarian way of thinking. Hillary Clinton will become the next President of the US. She will inherit the eight years of Obama rule which have further weakened the left. But the 2016 elections have revealed that the deep crisis of the imperialist system is beginning to intersect with popular opposition to its policy manifestations. So don’t fear Trump or organize resistance in a manner that gives the people a choice of either revolution or nothing at all. There is nothing counterrevolutionary about voting Green this November and organizing the movement on the streets around its core demands. As BAR’s Bruce Dixon noted last week, a five percent showing by the Green Party will put much needed federal funds into the control of movement organizers. A revolution is not a moment, it is a process. The crisis of imperialism will present many more moments to develop the revolutionary potential of the masses. The current opportunity to do so should not be allowed to dissipate, as the next moment could occur alongside a Hillary Clinton-led world war.

1357,"Ann Coulter: Establishment Targets Stephen Miller, the ‘Brilliant and Patriotic Genius’ Behind Trump","On Friday’s Breitbart News Daily, author Ann Coulter praised the cadre of sharp advisers and feisty defenders assembled around President Donald Trump and said, “We need more of them. ”[“I mean, there are a hundred thousand on the other side,” she noted.  She predicted President Trump would not get any pushback  —   and probably not the credit he will deserve  —   for bringing jobs back. “When he calls these companies and harangues them and makes them build their plants in America, makes them invest in America, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, they’re not going to come out and denounce Trump.

It was just three thousand jobs.’ Okay, if that’s your best argument, no problem. ” But when it comes to   issues like immigration, Coulter predicted “every single entity” would strike out at Trump, and he’ll need stalwart political fighters to man the battlements. “The media and the Democrats most of all because, like I say, this is life or death for them, and idiot Republicans who seem to think that we owe Somalis, Guatemalans, and Mexicans for the legacy of slavery, it’s the damndest thing,” she remarked, surveying the forces that will line up against Trump on immigration reform.  As an example of furious pushback, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow described MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, speaking as the voice of the centrist establishment, “going on a tear” against Marlow’s longtime friend Stephen Miller, who now serves as one of President Trump’s advisers. He characterized the attack on Miller as “dirty and dishonest. ” “I will give our opposition credit: they have figured out the most powerful nerve center, besides Trump himself, within the Trump White House,” Coulter said. “Yeah, it would be great for them to take out Trump. This is when we ought to be throwing a party for Stephen Miller and saying, ‘Congratulations! They can’t call you dumb they realize you’re a very important component. ’” “He’s brilliant,” she said of Miller. “You know, what I would like to do is go back to when you and he were growing up in L. A. and I don’t know, get ahold of the soil conditions or the water or something. The two of you  —   oh, my gosh! So patriotic, so smart. You love your country. ” “I was describing Steve Miller to some reporter recently. I was on a plane at the time, so I was writing out adjectives, and at the end of the sentence, I said, ‘I’m not just listing adjectives I’m actually pausing and thinking about each one. But the main ones are brilliant and patriotic,’” she recalled. “The same with you,” she told Marlow. “And to have that in these young kids, out of all places, Los Angeles! And then a few years later  —   well, I won’t even say her name, otherwise, she’ll just start being attacked, the opposition will figure out the other person they need to take out of the Trump White House. ”  “But oh, my gosh. Thank God  —   not taking the Lord’s name in vain I mean it literally  —   that Stephen Miller is on our side,” Coulter said. Marlow proposed that Miller’s effectiveness at moving the “    Trumpian agenda” as the reason he has been taking so much fire, even when his critics cannot pinpoint anything he did wrong. “Yes, he’s very, very bright,” Coulter agreed. “It always struck me, especially kids from Los Angeles, the very epitome of coastal elites, how seriously and genuinely Stephen Miller cared about   Americans. He’s such a perfect fit for Trump. It would just casually come up in conversation. It was driving him crazy that they were being screwed over. ” She said she did not see the Joe Scarborough rant against Miller herself but had received many emails about it. “I didn’t even know what it was about at first because they were just blistering, Tourette’  emails about how they were never going to watch Morning Joe again,” she said. “I don’t really understand it, other than I gather the opposition has figured out, ‘Danger, danger,   person who loves America! ’” “I probably don’t need to worry because every time I do worry about something on Donald Trump’s behalf, it turns out I didn’t need to worry it’s Trump,” Coulter said. “But you know, there is the White House bubble. I was just thinking, I travel a lot, I know a lot of people, and a lot of people from different walks of life. Just this week, I’ve talked to a Hollywood producer, and a union executive, and lots of cab drivers in New York City, Los Angeles, and so on, an actress, a Broadway actress and singer  —   okay, I don’t need to list them all. But it’s been amazing to me how popular the   the   ban is, and how popular Donald Trump is, and in particular with  —   I’m not a liberal I don’t think immigrants’ opinions are more important than American opinions, but it’s interesting because it’s contrary to the media narrative. Lots of immigrants in this country [are] wild about Trump, wild about the Muslim ban. ”  “I mean, out there in the middle of the country, he is more beloved than he was the day he was inaugurated. And, by the way, got a larger crowd than Obama. I don’t know if you’ve written much about that, but I have the briefing book. It was a much bigger crowd, and we should probably spend the rest of the radio interview allowing me to prove that. But I kind of think he needs a rally in Washington or someplace. Go out to America,” she advised. Ann Coulter is the author of numerous   books, most recently In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!

1358,Mike Lee: Health Care Bill ’Is Going to Fail’ - Breitbart,"Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Your World,” Sen. Mike Lee ( ) predicted the legislation scheduled for a vote Thursday that would begin the process of repealing Obamacare would fail because he argued it not only didn’t have the votes in the Senate but the House as well.  “This bill is going to fail,” Lee said. “It is going to fail because it doesn’t have enough support in the House of Representatives and it doesn’t have enough support in the Senate. ” “I’ve talked to a whole lot of people  —   enough people that I know that it is going to fall short of a majority in the House and it’s going to fall short of a majority in the Senate,” he added. “Look, if they know something that I don’t, perhaps they’ll be smiling 24 hours from now. But if they’re so confident, they’re not going to need to worry about my vote, they’re not going to need to worry about the votes of a whole lot of other people in the House and in the Senate who are concerned that this bill doesn’t do what we promise to do, which was repeal Obamacare in its entirety. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
1359,United Messes Up Again: Flies Customer to San Francisco Instead of France,"Apologizing once again, this time for accidentally flying a customer to San Francisco instead of to her actual destination of France, United Airlines cannot seem to get out from under an avalanche of public relations disasters. [United customer Lucie Bahetoukilae had purchased a ticket to fly from Newark, New Jersey, to Paris, France, but instead, found herself landing in San Francisco, California, after she was allowed to board the wrong plane, according to Fox News.  The woman, who only speaks French, told the media through a relative that the airline changed her flight’s gate at the last minute but did not inform customers via email or text, so she did not understand the announcement made over the loudspeaker system. She also said the gate change was announced only in English and not French, so she stayed at her original gate and boarded the plane that eventually arrived in California. Though her ticket said her final destination was Paris, attendants allowed her to board the plane for San Francisco, Bahetoukilae said. “If they would have made the announcement in French, she would have moved gates,” Bahetoukilae’s niece, Diane Miantsoko, told New York’s ABC 7. Even more vexing for the   woman, when she boarded the   plane, she found someone already sitting in the seat marked on her ticket. And when she showed her boarding pass to a flight attendant, she was simply put in an open seat, instead of being told she boarded the wrong plane. The mixup angered Bahetoukilae’s niece. “With everything going on this country people have to be more careful. They didn’t pay attention. My aunt could have been anyone. She could have been a terrorist and killed people on that flight,” she said. For its part, United issued an apology to the customer: “We deeply apologize to Ms. Bahetoukilae for this unacceptable experience,” United said in an emailed statement to Fox News. “When she arrived in San Francisco, we ensured she got on the next flight to Paris and refunded her ticket. Our customer care team has reached out to her directly to ensure we make this right. We are also working with our team in Newark to prevent this from happening again. ” United offered the customer a free flight and a full refund. The airline’s practices exploded in controversy in April after its treatment of passenger Dr. David Dao when police bodily dragged the man off a flight when he refused to give up his seat in an overbooking incident. The airline later settled with the passenger and made changes to its overbooking practices. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
1360,What Can You Wear on a Plane? It Depends Who’s Paying - The New York Times,"At first glance, this was a controversy   for the immediate boiling outrage of social media. United Airlines was besieged by an angry public after a gate agent refused to let two teenagers board a flight to Minneapolis at Denver International Airport on Sunday because they were wearing leggings. The outcry was swift and furious. The model Chrissy Teigen said she would fly topless the next time she flew United. The actor William Shatner snarked about pants he once wore on the set of “Star Trek. ” Calls for boycotts of United flooded social media sites. United wouldn’t back down, saying initially that the barring was justified because gate agents could ban anyone who was not “properly clothed. ” But this only fueled the bubbling controversy. Hours later, United issued a clarification, saying that the teenagers and their parents had been traveling with “pass riders,” tickets given to employees or their friends at a heavily discounted rate, and that with this comes the responsibility of a dress code. “When taking advantage of this benefit, all employees and pass riders are considered representatives of United,” read a statement that United posted late on Sunday evening. “And like most companies, we have a dress code that we ask employees and pass riders to follow. The passengers this morning were United pass riders and not in compliance with our dress code for company benefit travel. ” These are tickets that are typically left over, usable when there are empty seats on a plane. The regular paying passengers are known in the business as “revenue customers. ” While some details of this tale remain murky  —   as of right now, the family remains anonymous  —   dress codes for employees, their families and friends who are traveling on free or discounted passes have been in place for decades, although not all are strictly enforced. Both of Betty Horne’s parents, for example, worked in the aviation industry, and both for United. Her mother was a flight attendant and her father a flight engineer. Ms. Horne, 60, said she had started taking discounted flights thanks to her parents in the 1950s, and even then took great pains in the way she dressed. “As a small kid, there wasn’t that much of a problem because we were always in dresses,” Ms. Horne said. “That was just not an option. We always dressed up. In the late ’60s, early ’70s, that was when I was really concerned with whether I was meeting standards or not. ” United explicitly bans “    tops, pants and dresses,” along with “any attire that reveals a midriff,” “mini skirts,” “bare feet” and many others. Delta is far less specific, saying only this in its guide: “Just remember, Delta has a relaxed dress code for pass riders, but that doesn’t mean a sloppy appearance is acceptable. You should never wear unclean, revealing or lewd garments, or swimwear or sleepwear on a flight. ” In a statement, Delta said, “We ask our employees and their family and friends flying on pass privileges to use their best judgment when deciding what to wear on a flight. ” American Airlines says in its employee travel guide, “In general, if attire is appropriate and in good taste for our revenue customers, then it is acceptable for us as well. ” It goes on to specify that travelers are not to wear “torn, dirty or frayed clothing,” “clothing that is distracting or offensive to others” or “clothing that is vulgar or violates community standards of decency. ” It is up typically to gate agents to decide what is appropriate and what is not for those traveling on pass riders. “I have seen adults who have holes in jeans miss big international flights because the gate agent said, ‘Nope, you don’t meet our standards,’ which I thought was brutal,” said Mark Blacknell, 41, an attorney in Washington. Mr. Blacknell’s mother works for Delta, and he has taken advantage of numerous pass riders. But there is a reason for the strictness of United’s guidelines, a company spokesman said. They exist to take the decision out of the gate agent’s hands. “We have guidelines like this to help our gate agents, because we don’t want to put them in this position, to have to be making judgment calls about attire,” said the spokesman, Jonathan Guerin. “That’s what the policy is about. It’s designed to help our employees do their jobs and be efficient and get people on board. ” What seemed to be lost in the social media fury was that commercial passengers are not held to the same standard, as Delta mentioned on Twitter, ribbing its competitor. But whether this controversy will bring about a change by United remains to be seen. “We regularly review our guidelines,” Mr. Guerin said.",0

1363,Proof Hillary Clinton and her foundation are working with the Russians to destroy America,"Proof Hillary Clinton and her foundation are working with the Russians to destroy America Why isn't the FBI investigating Hillary's actual connections to the Russians? By Shepard Ambellas - November 1, 2016 
Editor’s Note: This article was originally posted back in January and links Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation to the Russians. Now, seven days out from the U.S. Presidential Election, new rhetoric has surfaced in the media which shows that the FBI has investigated Donald Trump for possible Russian connections and of course has found no ties. But the real question to ask may be: Why isn’t the FBI investigating Hillary’s actual ties to the Russians which can be found herein this article? Please share this post everywhere, make it go viral! 
Related: Rancher Dwight Hammond threatened with “bullet”: Exclusive Interview 
PRINCETON, Ore. ( INTELLIHUB ) — As it turns out there’s a lot more to the story behind the Malheur Wildlife Refuge — a whole lot more–and this article is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. 
As you may or may not know, Intellihub reported on Jan. 4, that the Hammond’s ranch and other ranch-lands surrounding the refuge sit atop a vast swath of precious metals, minerals, and uranium that’s heavily desired by not only the federal government, but foreign entities as well. 
However, at the time of the article’s publication the federal government’s full motive to seize the land was not yet known other than the fact that these elements do exist in the vicinity and are invaluable. 
Now, after further investigation, more pieces of the puzzle have been put in place and you’re not going to believe what characters are involved. 
I’ll give you a hint — one of them is currently being investigated by the FBI and is also running on the Democratic ticket in hopes of becoming the next President of the United States. That’s right, you guessed it–none other than Hillary Rodham Clinton of the notorious Clinton crime family . 
Hillary and her foundation are implicated in the dastardly scheme along with the Russian State Nuclear Energy Corporation, Rosatom, and a few dubious Canadian elite, which is where the news gets really bad. 
Rosatom is ranked #2 globally in uranium reserves and #1 globally for annual uranium extraction. The sheer power, strength, and size of the corporation is undeniable. Rostom is a major power-player in today’s world and didn’t become that way for no reason. 
You see, Rosatom wanted to expand their operations into America and needed a way in. So, in 2013, Rosatom acquired a Canadian company named Uranium One as part of a sinister side deal which involved multiple parties. Ultimately the deal opened a typically secure and closed-door, thus allowing the Russians to salt their way into Continental United States as part of a vast and extensive plan to mine Uranium ore out of states like Wyoming and Oregon. 
The deal was essentially brokered by Hillary and was ran through the Clinton Foundation using Canadian-backed contributions as a cover. With one swoop of a pen the bitch sold out the American people and one-fifth of America’s uranium resources to the Russians. 
In April of 2015, two reporters for the New York Times boldly reported how the plan worked: At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One. Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton . As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock. At the time, both Rosatom and the United States government made promises intended to ease concerns about ceding control of the company’s assets to the Russians. Those promises have been repeatedly broken, records show. […] Soon, Uranium One began to snap up companies with assets in the United States. In April 2007, it announced the purchase of a uranium mill in Utah and more than 38,000 acres of uranium exploration properties in four Western states , followed quickly by the acquisition of the Energy Metals Corporation and its uranium holdings in Wyoming, Texas and Utah. That deal made clear that Uranium One was intent on becoming “a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector with the potential to become the domestic supplier of choice for U.S. utilities,” the company declared. […] While the United States gets one-fifth of its electrical power from nuclear plants, it produces only around 20 percent of the uranium it needs, and most plants have only 18 to 36 months of reserves, according to Marin Katusa, author of “The Colder War: How the Global Energy Trade Slipped From America’s Grasp.” “The Russians are easily winning the uranium war, and nobody’s talking about it,” said Mr. Katusa, who explores the implications of the Uranium One deal in his book. “It’s not just a domestic issue but a foreign policy issue, too.” Yes, the Russians are winning the “uranium war,” thanks to Hillary. Additionally BLM documentation shows: In September 2011, a representative from Oregon Energy, L.L.C. (formally Uranium One), met with local citizens, and county and state officials, to discuss the possibility of opening a uranium oxide (“yellowcake”) mine in southern Malheur County in southeastern Oregon. Oregon Energy is interested in developing a 17-Claim parcel of land known as the Aurora Project through an open pit mining method. Besides the mine, there would be a mill for processing. The claim area occupies about 450 acres and is also referred to as the “New U” uranium claims. On May 7, 2012, Oregon Energy LLC made a presentation to the BLM outlining its plans for development for the mine. The Vale District has agreed to work with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife on mitigation for the “New U” uranium claims, which are located in core sage grouse habitat. Although the lands encompassing the claims have been designated core, the area is frequented by rockhounds and hunters, and has a crisscrossing of off-highway vehicle (OHV) roads and other significant land disturbance from the defunct Bretz Mercury Mine, abandoned in the 1960s. However, by the fall of 2012 the company said that it was putting its plans for the mine on hold until the uncertainty surrounding sage grouse issues was resolved. Once again the Whore of Babylon , Hillary Clinton, her foundation, and other members of government, have literally been caught conducting illicit, illegal, and treasonous, activities right underneath the noses of the American people and are in no way being held accountable. Moreover she has the nerve to run for president! Are you kidding me? Now Oregon Governor Kate Brown has stepped in, calling for a ‘swift’ resolution to the armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, clearly shilling for the Dems, criminally assisting them with their master plan to sellout every last bit of America’s public lands to foreign entities like Uranium One, fully eviscerating whats left of the U.S. Constitution. So there you have it–rogue criminal factions of government are operating at all levels and are actually conspiring together to allow foreign corporations to invade and mine rich American resources, including uranium, from lands owned by the people. Uranium One’s slogan is: “Success through aggressive mine and land acquisition.” 
Additionally, President Obama has signed executive orders allowing the Department of the Interior to grab publicly owned lands. Update 1:29 p.m.: World Net daily published an article back in 1998 titled “Federal Land Grab Called ‘Political’.” In the article he author points out how Utah Republican Jame Hansen authored a bill at the time known as the “Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998.” According to the report, this bill passed in June of 1998, and gave “Utah 139,000 acres of federally held land, certain mineral rights, and $50 million in exchange for all of Utah’s claims to lands within national parks, monuments, forests and federal areas” under then U.S. President Bill Clinton’s orders, further demonstration how the Clinton Crime Family has been using their vast political influence to loot some of the best assets from the Corporation of the United States, selling them for pennies on the dollar to private foreign corporations and one world bodies like the United Nations. Additionally we find this whole animal goes back the the Ronald Regan era–and possibly further. HCN.org reported back in 2004: […] President Ronald Reagan and his advisors looked across the West’s public lands and saw dollar signs. Money was something they desperately needed in 1982, as the national deficit hit $128 billion. So James Watt, then U.S. secretary of the Interior, and John R. Block, the secretary of Agriculture, earmarked 35 million acres, or 5 percent of the nation’s public lands (excluding Alaska), for the auction block. The plan to privatize public lands was met with outrage and skepticism, not only from Western liberals such as Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, but also from conservatives like Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, who objected because the states were cut out of the deal. Watt eventually withdrew Interior lands from the sale; shortly thereafter, the Forest Service’s sale lost steam, too. However unpopular the proposed sales were, they weren’t illegal. And the idea didn’t go away. The framework for selling public lands has inched forward since the Clinton administration, and now the Interior Department wants to give it a higher priority. The 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) required the Bureau of Land Management to identify lands that were “uneconomical to manage,” or that stood in the way of a community’s development. But the BLM lacked a strong incentive to identify such sellable lands: Under FLPMA, any money received from their sale would go directly into the U.S. Treasury, rather than into the agency’s own coffers. Then, in 2000, Congress and the Clinton administration passed the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), which changed how profits from BLM land sales were distributed. Twenty percent of any land-sale revenue would go toward the BLM’s administration costs, while the other 80 percent had to be used to buy private inholdings within BLM lands that contained “exceptional resources.” The act was based on a land disposal and acquisition mechanism in the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998, which was crafted to accommodate Las Vegas’ rapid expansion onto neighboring public lands. But FLTFA’s profit scheme applied only to sellable lands identified before July 25, 2000. At that time, the BLM estimated it had 3.3 million acres of sellable land, but thanks to better inventories, its estimate has since shrunk to as low as 330,000 acres. From 2001 to 2003, the BLM sold almost 11,000 acres under FLTFA. Note: We know some of the land acquired by Uranium One is in Oregon and we know there are precious metals on and near the Hammond Ranch. Put two and two together. Stay tuned for more updates and confirmation as it is becoming increasingly clear that other companies and government entities are most likely also involved. The government, alongside private companies (including foreign-owned), are in the middle of a massive criminal land grab which the mainstream media is largely ignoring, instead opting to paint those in Oregon as crazy anti-government extremists. In other words, members of the mainstream media are directly responsible for helping to allow this takeover to happen. Other Sources: Uranium prospecting in Oregon, 1956 — State of Oregon

1364,5 Must-See Shows if You’re in New York This Month - The New York Times,"Broadway shows often fold their tents at the end of the year, fearing the winter blues at the box office. But this year a few shows of note are holding on, at least for a week or two. You’ve got a few more days to catch Stephen Karam’s gorgeous “The Humans,” last season’s Tony winner for best play (ending on Jan. 15) and even fewer to jump on the exhilarating emotional roller coaster that is the sublime revival of the musical “Falsettos” (ending on Sunday). Looking further ahead, here are other notable shows and events I’d put at the top of my    list. The first of the majestic   cycle of plays written by the great August Wilson, this drama set in the 1970s (and written in 1979) was, until now, the only piece of the cycle not to be produced on Broadway. A classic Wilson ensemble drama, about a group of gypsy cab drivers in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, the new Manhattan Theater Club production is directed by Ruben   who has both appeared in and directed Wilson’s plays  —   notably the superb recent revival of “The Piano Lesson” from the Signature Theater. (In previews for a Jan. 19 opening at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.) Normally I frown on theater as a rarefied form of stargazing. But with a star as luminous as Cate Blanchett, I will grant an exception. And, of course, Ms. Blanchett, who graces this new adaptation of “Platonov,” an early Chekhov play, is not merely a movie star burnishing her reputation with a Broadway debut. During the past decade she has made regular, acclaimed appearances on the New York stage, in productions imported from the Sydney Theater Company (as is this one). An unwieldy drama about the familiar Chekhovian concerns  —   lives full of regret, stomachs bloated with vodka  —   the play has been moved from Russia in the 19th century to Russia in the late 20th century for this version by Andrew Upton, Ms. Blanchett’s husband. The esteemed Australian actor Richard Roxburgh is Platonov. (In previews for a Sunday opening at the Barrymore Theater.) I have been saving this lovable classic as a cure for the   blues. The small but enterprising Irish Rep first produced this delicious musical whimsy, with a glorious, multihued score by Burton Lane and E. Y. Harburg, a dozen years ago, with Melissa Errico as the ingénue, Sharon (she who wonders “How Are Things in Glocca Morra? ”). The seemingly ageless Ms. Errico, I am delighted to report, is unfurling her silvery soprano once again in this revival, directed by the company’s artistic director, Charlotte Moore. (Through Jan. 29 at the Irish Repertory Theater.) [Read the review] This is not a single show (as downtown theatergoers will, of course, know) but a whole feast of international theater, presented by the Public Theater at its home base and elsewhere. Along with P. S. 122’s Coil and other festivals, it has come to make January a dizzying smorgasbord of experimental theater. Highlights this year include a new production from one of my favorite companies, the imaginative 600 Highwaymen, presenting “The Fever,” which is said to be “performed in complete collaboration with the audience. ” Bring your tap shoes  —   or at least a willingness to blast your way through the fourth wall on a regular basis. (Various locations,  .) Martin McDonagh’s     was the first of his trilogy of plays set in the impoverished Irish village of the title. It returns in a   production from the Druid Theater, the company that first made a splash internationally with a pungent production that ultimately moved to Broadway. Once again the company’s longtime chief, Garry Hynes, directs. And Marie Mullen, who won a Tony Award as the embittered daughter of a manipulative terror of a mother, with the aptly monstrous name Mag, now takes on that formidable role.

1368,"Rick Perry, as Energy Secretary, May Be Pressed to Resume Nuclear Tests - The New York Times","  Donald J. Trump’s Twitter post last week that the United States must “greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability” provoked confusion and anxiety that intensified the next day when he added, in a television interview, “Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all. ” Largely unspoken in the tumult, but running just below the surface, was a deep uncertainty about the future of a cornerstone of America’s nuclear policy: its program to safeguard the nation’s atomic stockpile. A central mission of the nation’s weapons laboratories is to ensure that the country’s nuclear weapons still work if needed. To do that, the government has long relied on a program that avoids the need for underground testing, instead using data from supercomputers and laboratory experiments and inspecting the warheads. But some nuclear analysts say that the Trump administration is likely to face decisions that could upend the bomb program, leading to a resumption of testing and perhaps a new global arms race if they are mishandled. Adding to the concern is Mr. Trump’s choice of a politician with no expertise in nuclear or technical matters, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, to lead the Energy Department, which runs the nation’s   labs and the safeguards program. Mr. Perry, who will follow two highly accomplished physicists if confirmed, is far more familiar with issues involving the oil and gas industry. But weapons programs account for more than half of the Energy Department’s $30 billion budget. The United States has not conducted a nuclear test since 1992, and some weapons experts believe that it has lost ground to Russia and China as they ambitiously improve their arsenals and delivery systems. Mr. Perry is certain to receive pressure to resume   underground tests to ensure that existing weapons will function, and to help create new bomb designs, which have been   in the Obama administration. How Mr. Perry responds to that pressure could define his tenure. “Support from outside the Trump administration for testing will be robust,” said John Harvey, who from 1995 to 2013 held senior positions overseeing nuclear weapons programs in the Energy and Defense departments. “I don’t think they will be compelling in changing minds, absent a serious problem that we uncover in the stockpile,” he said. But Mr. Harvey, who does not believe testing is needed for now, fears that those influences could break the bipartisan compromise in Congress that produced the nuclear “modernization” program: an expensive effort to upgrade nuclear delivery systems  —   bombers, missiles and submarines  —   and refurbish existing weapons in the arsenal. This program ensures both that the weapons can strike an enemy if necessary and that they work as designed. “I think a strong push to do nuclear testing could upset the consensus,” he said. Since 1998, when India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests, provoking global condemnation, only North Korea is known to have undertaken tests. Some experts fear that if the United States began testing again, it would risk a new arms race by opening the door to testing for many other countries that want to improve or develop nuclear arsenals. For that reason, testing would face opposition on many fronts. “It would be unbelievably stupid of us to start testing again,” said Burton Richter, a physics Nobel laureate and emeritus professor at Stanford who has advised presidential administrations since the 1970s. Absent testing, the arsenal today is something like a 1967 Chevy that sits for decades without being driven, said Thomas Karako, a senior fellow in the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “You have to have the confidence that if you have to crank the engine, it will turn on,” Mr. Karako said. Still, people with intimate knowledge of the agency and the bomb program say that technical savvy alone will not make or break Mr. Perry’s ability to keep the stockpile in a state of readiness. Among those people is Steven Chu, who won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics and led the agency from 2009 to 2013. “Everybody has a shot,” Mr. Chu said of Mr. Perry’s chance of success. Most important, Mr. Chu said, will be the willingness of Mr. Perry and his close technical advisers to press the weapons designers and stewards to explain their plans in plain enough terms to let the secretary make good decisions. “If people are talking to a nonscientist, there might be a temptation to BS him,” Mr. Chu said. One advantage of being a scientist in those meetings, he said, was that “I refuse to be BS’ed. ” A spokesman for Mr. Perry referred questions about the former governor’s qualifications to his onetime chief of staff, Ray Sullivan. “As a former military officer and politician and governor, he dealt with a myriad of significant challenges that in many cases included unexpected or technical challenges,” Mr. Sullivan said. “At its heart,” he added, “it seems to me that this job is about managing and leading a very complicated organization and having the leadership qualities and ability to build a good team and to question that team, but lead it to a successful outcome. ” Mr. Trump and Mr. Perry attended the   football game together on Dec. 10, and Mr. Trump announced his nomination several days later. The former governor’s positions on nuclear issues remain a mystery. Mr. Richter said he had questioned “technically oriented” members of the Republican hierarchy on where Mr. Perry stands. “Is he going in with a lot of fixed ideas?” Mr. Richter said. “They say they simply don’t know about Perry. ” Mr. Perry’s spokesman, Marc Palazzo, said that the Energy nominee was “deferring addressing specific policy issues until his Senate confirmation hearings. ” The current Energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, is a highly regarded physicist who succeeded Mr. Chu. But most other secretaries have not had such credentials. Bill Richardson, whose term has generally been praised, had been a congressman from New Mexico, and United States ambassador to the United Nations and James D. Watkins was a retired admiral. James B. Edwards was a dentist turned politician who, when he resumed his practice, memorably said that he wanted to “get my hands in the saliva again. ” Then President Ronald Reagan made him Energy secretary. Some analysts say fears that Mr. Perry could fumble the nuclear program are overblown because that program is contained within the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous agency inside the Energy Department that has its own director. Franklin Miller, a principal at the Scowcroft Group who has warned that the Russians have started a new Cold War, said that dedication to the agency’s mission had always been more important than technical expertise at the top. Still, the agency has changed since the days of “shaking the desert” with underground tests in Nevada, New Mexico and elsewhere. The current way of certifying the stockpile, called   stockpile stewardship, is not only costly but also enormously complex, said John Pike, the director of the think tank GlobalSecurity. org and one of the most experienced security analysts in the field. “There’s no end of mischief they could cause for the stockpile,” Mr. Pike said, referring to Mr. Trump and Mr. Perry, and pointing to the confusion and concern that followed the Twitter post by the  . Mr. Pike was withering in his criticism of Mr. Perry’s ability to act as a knowledgeable counterweight to Mr. Trump. “Perry’s got no idea which end the bullet comes out of,” he said. “He’s not somebody who’s going to say no to the president. ” In a yearly report, the heads of the weapons labs have certified that the stockpile is sound since the   program began in the 1990s. Those certifications have all been made without underground testing. “We don’t need it now,” said Steven E. Koonin, who was Mr. Chu’s under secretary for science and now serves on the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board. He added, “That’s not to say we might not need it at some point in the future. ” Mr. Koonin said he had not detected any disagreement on the issue from senior officials in the Obama administration. But the next administration will be pressed for changes on nearly every element of policy involving nuclear weapons. Some will not call for an immediate resumption of testing, but could lead down that path. Others believe that the   approach, without testing, should be immediately  . “It’s been horrifically expensive, and I don’t think we really know for sure that our weapons are as reliable as they were when there was testing,” said Kathleen Bailey, a senior associate at the National Institute for Public Policy, a   group in Washington. There was always  skepticism among some bomb designers and senior lab officials that the purely   approach would suffice. But C. Paul Robinson, who directed Sandia National Laboratory from 1995 to 2005, said the labs fell into line once the policy decision was made. As for Mr. Perry, he was once involved in helping set up a technology transfer program between Sandia and the University of Texas, said Mr. Robinson, who worked with him on the effort and called him “a smart guy. ” “He’s a   competent guy,” Mr. Robinson said. He added that “this one gaffe that the papers keep writing about”  —   when Mr. Perry proposed eliminating the Energy Department but could not recall its name during a 2011 Republican presidential debate  —   “is certainly an aberration. ” Mr. Chu said that no judgment on the former governor’s ability to handle technical matters could be made until he had spent some time on the job. “I want Rick Perry to succeed,” Mr. Chu said. Asked if he could recall a moment when his science background had helped him make a decision as Energy Secretary, Mr. Chu did not hesitate. “All the time,” he said.",0
1369,Battle Lines Over Trump’s Lands Policy Stretch Across 640 Million Acres - The New York Times,"DENVER  —   Uranium mines around the Grand Canyon. Oil drilling rigs studding the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. New coal and timber leases in the national forests. States divvying up millions of acres of federal land to dispose of as they wish. To environmental groups, it would be a nightmare. To miners, loggers, ranchers and conservative politicians in   areas, it would be about time. Either way, Donald J. Trump’s election presages huge potential change on America’s 640 million acres of federal public lands, from the deep seas east of Maine to the volcanic coasts of Hawaii. “Into a new world,” said Bruce Babbitt, who ran the Interior Department under President Bill Clinton. In Western states, where about half of all land is controlled by federal agencies, Mr. Trump’s supporters hope the pendulum swings back from what they say are overbearing Obama administration regulations that put sage grouse and owls ahead of economic growth. Environmental groups are urging President Obama to push through   preservation projects, such as naming a new national monument in the Bears Ears area of southern Utah. And they are already preparing for battles over Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to “unleash” coal, oil and gas production  —   much of it on public land. But the unknowns and political variables are huge, too. Mr. Trump himself, while promising to push resource extraction, has also at times spoken about preserving public lands for future generations. History also suggests that changing lands policy is not so easy. President George W. Bush, a Republican, tried to change direction with new agency rules, only to be blocked by federal appeals court decisions. Automation in the timber industry means that even an expanded license to cut trees in the national forests might not restore old mill towns to their   glory. And the cost of managing federal lands, especially in fighting wildfires  —   $2. 1 billion last year, a record total, matched by the most acres burned in at least 30 years  —   continues to soar, threatening communities even as many of them look for new direction from the White House in how those lands are managed. “We have a huge and growing inventory of timber in the forests, and they’re going to decompose or burn, and nobody has addressed that,” said Robert H. Nelson, a professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and a former economic analyst for the Interior Department. “There’s bipartisan consensus that the federal lands system is dysfunctional,” he said. But the hopes, and the fears, about how that system might now change are boundless. “My big hope is that people would be able to go back to work in San Juan County and these rural areas,” said Phil Lyman, a county commissioner in southern Utah, where antigovernment feelings run as deep as the slot canyons. “You just feel like everything has been stifled with regulations. ” At the Western Watersheds Project, a conservation group focusing on the Rocky Mountain region, legal teams are on deck and ready to fight back. “We’re getting ready for an onslaught of   policy, and we’re arming up to litigate,” said Erik Molvar, the group’s executive director. “The Trump administration is going to find it very difficult to take away all of the federal laws which have been adopted over the past 40 years. ” In the   struggle for control of America’s public lands, the Obama years were a flush time for conservation groups. The administration imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the Grand Canyon and blocked new coal leases. Public lands were also adapted for new uses on Mr. Obama’s watch, notably a wave of national monuments based around cultural or historical significance, and a big expansion of solar energy on federal lands in Nevada. Conservatives who loathed those regulations  —   or new uses  —   are now hoping Mr. Trump shifts the balance decisively in their favor. Republicans in Congress have proposed bills weakening federal laws that protect wilderness, water quality, endangered species or that allow presidents to unilaterally name new national monuments. Some conservatives hope Mr. Trump will support their efforts to hand federal land over to states, which could sell it off or speed up drilling approvals. To see where change may come the quickest, look to the edges of Glacier National Park in Montana, at a quilt of rocky peaks and wetlands held sacred by the Blackfeet tribe. In March, the Obama administration capped a   fight over oil and gas drilling in the area, called the   Medicine, by canceling a Louisiana energy company’s lease on 6, 000 acres. The company, Solenex, sued. A lawyer for the company, William Perry Pendley of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, said the incoming Trump administration could simply decide that canceling the lease had been wrong. “All it would take,” he said, “is for the Justice Department to enter the case and say, ‘We’ve  . We will lift the suspension and we’ll permit the drilling to go forward. ’” This week, the Interior Department announced that a separate energy company with oil and gas leases on 32, 000 acres in the same area had voluntarily canceled them. Blackfeet tribal leaders called it a victory for cooperation among industry, conservation activists and the government. Proponents of two major oil pipeline projects are also optimistic. Mr. Trump has said he would move quickly to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which Mr. Obama blocked. The chief executive of the Texas company building the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota said he believed that   project would sail through under Mr. Trump. To see where things get more tangled, head into the damp woods of the Cascade Range in central Oregon, and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, where a long economic decline began in the late 1980s as international trade shifted timber markets to places like Canada, and automated mills eliminated tens of thousands of jobs. Those   mills are not going away even if more logs start arriving. “We really don’t have a clear and easy path to go back to the good old days when natural resource extraction was driving our economy,” said Sean Stevens, the executive director of Oregon Wild, a conservation group. “It is not as easy as just logging more,” he said. Logging industry officials said that employment could grow, but that changes at the federal level would have to be profound to make a difference. The first step, they said, would be to increase the budgets of federal land agencies like the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, something that conservative congressional representatives  —   many of them bent on budget cuts  —   might not want to hear. “Yes it’s going to cost us money, but in the long term it will save us money because we face a federal forest crisis, with millions of acres that are diseased,   and overstocked,” said Travis Joseph, the president of the American Forest Resource Council, which represents wood product companies from the Northern Rockies to California. “We have got to educate Congress and inform them that this is about an investment. ” Davis Filfred, a Navajo Nation council delegate, said he felt that time was running out for the stretches of piñon pine and red sandstone known as the Bears Ears area in southern Utah. It is rich with Native American artifacts, and tribal groups and conservationists have been urging Mr. Obama to name it as a new, perhaps final, national monument before he leaves office. Mr. Filfred drove up to Bears Ears from his home in Aneth, Utah, over Veterans Day weekend with his two sons and other members of Western tribes, and reflected on how much had already been lost there to irresponsible visitors. “They’re taking bones, they’re taking pottery,” he said. “They’re desecrating and damaging the writing on the walls. They’re tearing up the ground with their ATVs and motorcycles. It’s heartbreaking to me when I see that. That’s why I want it protected. ”",0

1371,The Surprising Science of Cease-Fires: Even Failures Can Help Peace - The New York Times,"Even if this week’s   in Syria quickly collapses  —   as most analysts expect it to  —   it could have a lasting impact on the conflict. Political science research shows that   change more than just conditions on the ground: They alter how a war’s participants weigh the benefits of fighting versus talking.   can create something like a virtuous cycle, studies have found, making future pauses more likely. Each one has a better chance of lasting longer, discouraging violations, isolating bad actors and building trust among adversaries. This cycle is not always as visible or politically urgent as the question of who is dropping bombs where on a particular day. But, over time, it can shift the participants’ calculus in ways that build conditions for peace. Page Fortna, a Columbia University professor and leading scholar on peace negotiations, says that “piecemeal” deals, though modest and rarely successful, can eventually align the incentives of groups whose demands at the moment are unreconcilable. But there is a flip side. Sometimes   can create a vicious cycle instead of a virtuous one. Distrust can deepen, the parties can move further apart, and incentives can shift to make peace even less attractive. Whether the diplomats who arranged the current   pause in Syria know it or not, they are making a     gamble. Two Notre Dame political scientists, Madhav Joshi and J. Michael Quinn, last year published a study examining 196   and peace deals from 1975 to 2011. They found something surprising: One of the best predictors of a peace agreement’s success is simply whether the parties had prior agreements, even if those earlier   failed. Not even a war’s duration or its intensity can so reliably predict a peace deal’s outcome. Neither does the poverty or ethnic diversity of the combatants. “Failures pave the way for better agreements down the road,” Professor Quinn said. Over time, participants see   as less risky. If all sides come out feeling that they at least broke even, they grow more willing to make another deal. In Syria, with the status quo so terrible, breaking even doesn’t require much. “These items could be as simple as a request that Assad refrain from calling opposition members terrorists in the press,” Professors Joshi and Quinn wrote in a Foreign Affairs article summarizing their research. “As soon as one party reciprocates, a peace process is underway. And with each successful round, just enough trust and good will may be generated to move on to the next item. ” This is trust not in the colloquial sense of proving personal integrity, but in the political science sense: Negotiators believe they understand one another’s incentives and can predict their behavior. Each side becomes more willing to make concessions, believing the other side will deliver on its end. Take, for example, Yugoslavia, where there were 91 mediated truces or   from 1989 to 2000. Of those, 35 percent lasted less than a week and 13 percent lasted exactly a week. Though each appeared to be a catastrophic failure, they culminated in the 1995 Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnian war that was a subset of the larger conflict, as well as later deals. We are already seeing possible hints of this in Syria. The tempo of   is increasing, with the terms expanding and the outside actors investing more political capital. Those gains are slight and the process of building trust is still fragile, so it remains unclear whether the cycle will catch. Stephen B. Long, a professor at the University of Richmond, found in a 2014 paper looking at hundreds of cases from 1948 to 1998, that if   violations are consistently punished with some form of retaliation  —   strong enough to hurt, but not to escalate  —   then everyone learns he is better off complying. Eventually all sides have less reason to fear they’ll be betrayed, and grow more confident entering otherwise risky   or peace talks. This is among the reasons that the Korean Peninsula, though still in a formal state of war, has not had   fighting in decades. Each side has proved, in countless    exchanges, that it will punish any transgression by the other side, freezing a conflict that had killed a million people. The virtuous cycle takes hold when, after enough rounds, each side concludes that its adversaries will probably follow the terms of any agreement. Everyone profits if the terms of the   are carried out, so everyone acts to enforce it. This was often how multiparty wars like Syria’s broke from the cycle of   conflict, Professor Fortna said. This can take years. One paper suggested that the cycle does not truly take hold until a   lasts for eight weeks that is a bar that Syria has yet to clear. But research papers that describe the dynamic are peppered with examples  —   Burundi, Nepal, the Philippines, Northern Ireland  —   that seemed unsolvable until they were suddenly solved. If the great hope is that Syria’s warriors can learn to trust and cooperate, then the great danger is that they will instead learn to distrust and reject. If   violations are punished inconsistently, combatants perceive cheating as less risky. So while every transgression does not need to be punished, it’s important that all sides be held to a similar standard for what will provoke retaliation, and how severe. If groups believe that everyone else is likely to cheat, they have a strong incentive to cheat as well. By the same token, if groups come to see the other side as unreliable or unpredictable, they have little reason to enter into any deal. Over successive rounds, each side could bring less to the table or be less willing to follow through on its promises  —   further convincing one another that talks are not worthwhile. This happened in Angola, where a civil war killed half a million people from 1976 to 2002. The United States and the Soviet Union saw it as a Cold War battleground, and both intervened. They pushed their Angolan proxies to keep fighting, which destroyed trust on the ground  —   a worrying lesson as Washington and Moscow now find themselves on opposite sides in Syria. Whether Syria slips into a virtuous cycle or vicious one, Professor Fortna said, depends in large part on the United States and Russia. Civil wars are much likelier to end in peace if they have a mediator, often a powerful outside country, according to research by the political scientist Donald Rothchild. That mediator can impose stopgaps, such as temporary   that open up space for negotiation. And the mediator makes both sides more willing to take risks for peace, because they trust that the other side will be punished if it fails to keep its word. The   state of war between Israel and Egypt, for example, ended only when the United States brokered the 1978 Camp David accords. President Jimmy Carter offered billions in aid to both countries, altering their strategic calculus to make peace more attractive  —   and implicitly threatening Washington disapproval if either party backed out. Mediation can take subtler forms, such as Norway’s role in hosting the 1990s   talks: The neutral setting reduced the political costs. Syria has no such mediator because the only two viable candidates  —   the United States and Russia  —   are engaged in the war. Nor is either likely to allow another party, such as the United Nations, to get in the middle. Professor Fortna argued that interim United   agreements like this week’s could eventually move them into a sort of   role. Though this is politically distasteful in Washington for appearing to put Moscow on equal strategic and moral footings, it is probably necessary. But this would require both powers to demonstrate something they have yet been unable to: the ability to extract concessions from their allies on the ground in Syria. Only then could the United States and Russia trust each other’s ability to follow through on their most important promises. That would surely take multiple rounds to accomplish, and would be only a step toward peace. This can look like failure because it is so incremental.

1375,"Raptors Escape Past, Ousting the Heat in Game 7 - The New York Times","TORONTO  —   As the Toronto Raptors assembled their lead in the third quarter, Air Canada Centre began to fill with an unmistakable sense that this team was not merely overpowering the Miami Heat. No, the Raptors were also escaping their past. All the   exits. All the blown chances. All the disappointments. On Sunday afternoon, the Raptors turned the most significant basketball game in franchise history into a citywide celebration, defeating the Heat,   in Game 7 of the teams’ Eastern Conference semifinals. Kyle Lowry scored 35 points with a sore elbow, and DeMar DeRozan added 28 with a sprained thumb. “I know one thing,” Coach Dwane Casey said. “Our guys compete. ” Nothing about this game was easy for the Raptors  —   not against the likes of Dwyane Wade, not after seven games, not with so many   bodies. But for the first time in the team’s   existence, the Raptors are bound for the conference finals. Their series with the Cleveland Cavaliers will start Tuesday night at Quicken Loans Arena. “We ain’t satisfied,” Lowry said. “That’s just our mentality. ” The Raptors erupted in the third quarter, building their lead possession by possession. To 11 when DeMarre Carroll sank a  . To 14 when Bismack Biyombo got inside for a dunk. To 16 when Lowry drove to the rim for layup. The Heat trailed by as many as 28 in the fourth. “They wore us down,” Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Toronto beat us, fair and square. ” Wade and Goran Dragic scored 16 points each for the Heat, who were greeted by light snowfall when they left their hotel for the game. About a   before tipoff, flurries gave way to hail. It was springtime in Canada, and the conditions  —   at least symbolically  —   favored the Raptors. (For the record, it did not snow in Miami for Game 6.) Thousands of fans filed into Jurassic Park, an outdoor viewing party on a block next to the arena. If people here were excited about the game, about this national event, then they were also opening themselves up to the possibility of more frustration, more misery, more sadness. The ghosts of postseasons past have haunted this franchise. Seven previous trips to the playoffs. Six   flameouts. It has been particularly impossible for Toronto to forget 2001, when it came within seconds of advancing to the conference finals. But Vince Carter, after attending his college graduation ceremony that morning, missed a shot at the buzzer, and the Philadelphia 76ers escaped with a Game 7 win in the conference semifinals. That was 15 years ago. The Raptors finally seized another opportunity. “This organization deserves it,” DeRozan said. This was a physical series that featured nearly as many injuries as missed shots. Both teams had long ago lost their starting centers  —   the Raptors’ Jonas Valanciunas to a sprained right ankle, the Heat’s Hassan Whiteside to a sprained right knee. Others played on, through jammed thumbs and bruised wrists, through the toll of a   series that manifested itself in bandages and braces. In Game 6, with his team hoping to extend the series, Spoelstra went small by starting Justise Winslow, a   forward, at center. Spoelstra sought to generate more offense, and he instructed Winslow to set screen after screen along the perimeter, drawing Biyombo, his primary defender, away from the basket. The Heat ran away with the win. Ahead of Game 7, Casey expressed cautious optimism that his players would make the necessary adjustments. He wanted his defenders to focus on the ball, to contain Wade and Dragic and at least slow their dribble penetration. Casey advised his players to stop worrying so much about the coming screen. “Too many times, we’re looking to see where the screens are coming from,” Casey said, adding, “We have to do a good job of locking into the basketball. ” The arena practically shook when DeRozan scored the first points of the game on a midrange jumper. The crowd roared when Wade picked up his second foul and took an early seat. Neither team was particularly efficient, however, and this surprised no one after two weeks of turnovers and empty possessions. On Sunday, the Raptors and the Heat combined to miss nine of their first 10   attempts. DeRozan, though, was assertive. He scored 11 points on 12   attempts in the first quarter. Toronto took a   lead into the second half. As the game wore on, others emerged for the Raptors. Biyombo finished with 17 points, and Patrick Patterson had 11 points and 11 rebounds. “I thought tonight we played big,” Casey said. “If you’re going to do that, you’ve got to make sure you plant your feet in the lane and do what you do. ” Late in the fourth quarter, with the final seconds melting away on the Heat’s season, a happy mob formed in front of the Raptors’ bench. Coaches embraced. Players exchanged  . But back in the locker room, a dose of reality awaited: scouting reports on the Cavaliers, one for every player. “It’s another step for us,” Casey said. “But we’re not there yet. ”",0
1376,"With 100th Straight Win, Connecticut Women’s Team Redefines Dominance - The New York Times","STORRS, Conn.  —   One year ago, on the night after Super Bowl Sunday, Geno Auriemma sat alongside three stalwart seniors and momentarily imagined a coaching life without them. “I start to blink because I look out there and start to think that these three are not going to be there next year,” Auriemma, coach of the Connecticut women’s basketball powerhouse, said after a solid road victory over   and   South Carolina. He also appeared to be blinking away a tear or two at the thought of losing those three players: Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. That moment of emotional reflection for Auriemma, who is better known for biting sarcasm, came after a 60th consecutive victory, to which the Huskies predictably added 15 more on the way to their fourth straight (and 11th overall) national championship. Not many, including Auriemma, would have bet the mortgage on the streaks  —   both in games and titles  —   lasting much longer. But on Monday night, in a   and expectant Gampel Pavilion, the Huskies made it an even 100 straight victories, swarming that same South Carolina team,   to cross the   threshold. The Huskies did it behind their   forwards, Gabby Williams and Napheesa Collier. Williams scored 26 points and grabbed 14 rebounds while Collier added 18 and 9. “Continuing what they’ve done for so many years,” said Williams, referring to past iconic Huskies, several of whom, Stewart included, watched from the stands. It starts to sound ridiculous, but the Huskies,   this season, have not lost since November 2014 (in overtime at Stanford). If not for that loss, they’d be working on a streak of 148 straight. Even Auriemma sounded at a loss to explain this. He settled on “it was meant to be” after weeks of insisting that he and his players never talked about No. 100. Against the   and No. 6 Gamecocks, the subject was unavoidable. And after 12 successive blowouts in an American Athletic Conference in which the Huskies have gone   since its formation, the prospect of stiffer competition was preferable. With an eye on bigger game, the N. C. A. A. tournament, Auriemma said: “The   streak isn’t all theirs. They carried the streak across the finish line. But if they win the national championship, it’s all theirs. ” It’s not as if the act of breaking records is new to his program. A previous record   winning streak (surpassing the U. C. L. A. men’s record established from 1971 to 1974) was bested by the current run last month. There is no doubt that a potential fifth straight national title, and 12th over all, are numbers more appealing to Auriemma. But triple digits in consecutive wins represents another symbolic groundbreaking and powerful statement in the continued and collective excellence of a women’s sports team. Only once had Auriemma’s program come this close to 100  —   a   winning streak that stood at 99 when an upstart St. John’s team won at Gampel in February 2012, before Connecticut’s departure from what was then a highly competitive Big East Conference. “Senior night, packed house at Gampel, as always,” Kim Barnes Arico  —   then the St. John’s coach, now in her fifth season at Michigan, where she has built a     team  —   said in a telephone interview. With St. John’s trailing by 2 points in the final seconds, Barnes Arico decided during a timeout to try for the win rather than overtime in such a challenging environment. Shenneika Smith  —   “she hadn’t made a 3 in weeks”  —   sank the winning shot. On the bus ride home, Barnes Arico’s cellphone rang. “It’s Geno, calling to congratulate me after what had to be a crushing loss,” Barnes Arico said. Auriemma had been supportive of her efforts to elevate the St. John’s program, which is why, she said, “I can’t help but applaud what he’s doing there, going for 100 straight, just incredible. ” That said, she was “holding off” on reaching out, or rooting for either side on Monday, given her ties to South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley. Barnes Arico has coached   and   U. S. A. Basketball teams with Staley, a   Olympian and, like Auriemma, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member. “Either way, such a great story,” Barnes Arico said. Staley’s team  —   as have most ranked teams  —   presented Connecticut with its usual handicap of a size disadvantage, with their    star, A’ja Wilson, and the    center Alaina Coates. But the Huskies countered with Williams, only   and Collier,    —   both quick jumpers who play bigger than they are. After Wilson helped keep the Gamecocks within   at the half, the Huskies limited her to 5   points. They took control late in the third quarter and were never threatened in the fourth. “You can’t let your guard down  —   UConn is going to make you pay every time,” Staley said. In surmounting every obstacle on a schedule   with   opponents, Auriemma rapidly developed a cohesive Core Four to replace the Big Three of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, who were the top three picks in last year’s W. N. B. A. draft. “We have no preseason   but we have four really good players, and every time we need something, one of them comes up with something,” Auriemma said, referring to the juniors Williams and Kia Nurse, and the sophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Collier. If this wasn’t supposed to be a season of extended dominance, the question entering Monday night had evolved. Would the Huskies ever lose? “It’s not if,” Auriemma said, “it’s just when. ” But if not Monday night, or sometime this season, just when? Next season, Connecticut is planning to suit up Azura Stevens, a    transfer from Duke who many believe would have been UConn’s best player this season. The Huskies will add Megan Walker, rated by some as the nation’s No. 1 high school recruit. They will return six of their seven rotation players, the exception being Saniya Chong, who shares the   position with the freshman Crystal Dangerfield. With no formidable opponent left on the conference schedule, and victories over many of the   teams already recorded, an inquiring mind wants to wonder whether the Huskies might in a couple of years be on the doorstep of 200.",0
1377,Will a No-Fly Zone Help the People of Aleppo?,"Email 
Media coverage has recently been saturated with distressing scenes showing the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, where aerial bombardment has led to a heavy loss of civilian life. The severity of the crisis instinctively makes us want to help – scores of protesters gathered outside the seat of the British prime minister on Saturday holding signs calling on the government to “Save Aleppo” and impose a “No-Bomb Zone Now”. While the anger is understandable, the way it is being channeled reflects a circumscribed policy debate – there are other options than a No-Fly Zone, which should be avoided as it would harm rather than help efforts to alleviate the suffering of Syrian civilians. 
In any area of policy, the mainstream debate revolves around policy alternatives that reflect establishment divisions. For example, in economics, ‘there is no alternative’ to neoliberalism, at least there wasn’t until Keynesianism was rediscovered by some elites after the 2008 crisis. The debate over what is to be done over Syria revolves around two policy alternatives: the hawks, including likely next U.S. president, Hillary Clinton, advocate a NFZ and the doves, including the current U.S. administration, maintain that the sanctions regime should be increased. This effectively reflects a division within the establishment on how to proceed. Serious policy alternatives are not discussed. In particular, discussion of increasing aid and support to refugees, surely the most obvious way of directly helping civilians in Syria, and what the UN has called on industrialized countries to do , is curious by its absence. 
This circumscribed debate does not logically follow from its supposed pretext – stopping civilian loss of life. In fact, a NFZ is a policy that would unavoidably lead to civilians dying. Enforcing a NFZ means destroying air defenses, which are located to defend cities – i.e. they are located in areas where there are many civilians. Even the flagbearer for the hawks, Hillary Clinton, has admitted privately that with a No-Fly Zone “you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians”; such intervention will “take a lot of civilians”. This realization would seem inconsistent with the often-used humanitarian pretext, but it makes sense given Hillary Clinton’s recent admission that her top priority in Syria is removing Syrian President Assad. 
There is a clear parallel with the imposition of a NFZ in Libya, which prolonged the conflict and worsened the situation for civilians. NATO bombing directly led to scores of civilian deaths and facilitated the overthrow of the regime by rebel militias that have killed, and are continuing to kill , thousands. Particularly repugnant was the ethnic cleansing of black people , including through public lynching . In a 2013 paper , Alan Kuperman, a Harvard academic, argued that NATO intervention extended the war by a factor of 6 and increased the death toll 7 to 10 times; given that Libya is now a failed state, torn apart by warlords, we can safely say that these estimates were too conservative. President Obama privately calls the situation in Libya a “ shit show ”. Only last month a report from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament found that the humanitarian justification was an insufficient pretext and based on falsehoods, the supposedly limited intervention led “ineluctably” to regime change, and that the (British) government, and by implication other participating Western powers, did not seriously consider diplomatic alternatives to military action. 
Regardless, the mantra of Western foreign policy is “it will be different this time” – unlike all recent Western military interventions this one will be limited, successful and won’t leave a worse humanitarian situation in its wake. Although, if the dire humanitarian situation in Aleppo necessitates immediate action, then why are there not equally loud calls for action for civilians facing similar situations? U.S. bombing in Manbij and Kobane in Syria and Ramadi and Fallujah in Iraq has resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and flattened entire neighbourhoods ; more than a third of US and UK backed Saudi airstrikes in Yemen have hit civilian sites, including schools , hospitals , weddings and funerals . 
Talking about this is not meant as a distraction or relativization; the fact that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are engaged in similar activities does not make the bombing of Aleppo less objectionable. However, it does raise questions about the motives of those pushing so hard for a no-fly zone. If western foreign policy actors, and their allies in press, were motivated by humanitarian concerns, then surely stopping these atrocities should appear on the policy agenda – especially given that the action required is easier and does not risk war with Russia. 
If humanitarian considerations were really the important factors in the foreign policy debate, then there would be discussion on the legitimacy of aerial bombardment of cities and towns, given that this invariably leads to civilian deaths. International agreements have been successful in making chemical and biological weapons illegal, a prohibition which is generally followed ( though not always ). The first well-publicized use of aerial bombardment, the Nazi bombing of Guernica in 1937, caused righteous, popular outrage. Tragically, however, its use became normalized during the Second World War and a ban on aerial bombing of cities was not included in the post-war international settlement. The fact that this seems so hopelessly idealistic reflects the fact that it is geopolitics, not humanitarian considerations, that govern international relations and foreign policy discussion; human suffering is nothing more than a useful pretext for whatever actions you want to take in order to secure geopolitical advantage. The U.S. and its allies want to remove Syria from Russia’s orbit, so therefore the dictator there must go, but airstrikes to support the dictator in Yemen are fine, because the dictator there is a friend of close U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. 
There is an added complication with the NFZ in Syria in that it marks a return to Cold-War era brinkmanship and possible armed confrontation with Russia. The logic of brinkmanship runs that to make geopolitical gains, one must escalate to a level that will make the other side back down, partly by convincing your enemy you are ready to commit irrational acts. There is an inherent danger in this game: both states are nuclear armed and the consequences of a spiral of escalation could be devastating . 
Syria hawks, or what close Obama aide Ben Rhodes called the “ pro-stupid shit ” caucus, argue that a NFZ will lead Russia to effectively back down: for example, Clinton argued that it will “give us leverage in our conversations with Russia”. (Interestingly, in the exchange this quote from Clinton indicated the war goal: a NFZ will make Russia “put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track” – i.e. Russia will be forced to accept regime change.) After all, despite the panic in the press, Russia is actually a feeble successor state to a superpower, and would come off worse in a direct conflict with the preeminent might of North America, or so the logic runs. 
However, ‘dovish’ Western foreign policy actors point to the danger that advanced Russian materiel support to Syria poses to the enforcement of a NFZ. Unlike other recent U.S. military adventures, enforcing a NFZ in Syria could lead to significant, and politically unpalatable, American casualties – pilots will be shot down. This realization means that saner establishment figures are opposed to a NFZ. For example, U.S. Army General Carter Ham, who oversaw the NFZ in Libya, said a NFZ is a “violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel”. 
Instead, relative doves like current Secretary of State John Kerry advocate intensifying the sanctions regime against Syria and Russia. Again, this does not seem to be seriously about helping civilians. A leaked UN report has revealed that the existing Western sanctions regime is preventing humanitarian aid and creating a humanitarian disaster that threatens to rival that caused by the Oil-for-Food program in Iraq during the 1990s. The history of sanctions tends to show that the costs are borne by civilians, and a Petersen Institute study of all sanctions incidents since WWII shows that sanctions failed to achieve their goals in about ⅔ of cases, and are even less successful when applied against enemies and autocrats. 
So, what is to be done? What should people in the West and globally push for to help the people of Syria? Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any quick fixes – the situation in Syria is complex and involves diverse actors, with competing interests. Immediate relief to the refugees fleeing the conflict should be a priority. In terms of foreign policy, campaigning for de-escalation and diplomacy against constant militarism remain the best solutions for the Syrian people, and humanity generally.",0
1378,Re: The List Of Establishment Republicans That Say They Are Voting For Hillary Clinton Is Staggering,"The List Of Establishment Republicans That Say They Are Voting For Hillary Clinton Is Staggering By Michael Snyder, on August 1st, 2016 
Who would have ever believed that so many big names in the Republican Party would publicly pledge to vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election? All throughout the primaries and the caucuses, the Republican establishment expressed tremendous disdain for Donald Trump, but they were unable to derail his march to the nomination. Now that we have reached the general election, some of the biggest names in the GOP are actually taking the unprecedented step of crossing over to the other side and are publicly announcing their support for Hillary Clinton. This shows that many of these individuals were only “Republicans in name only” to begin with, and it also demonstrates the lengths that the elite are willing to go to in order to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. 
One of the latest big Republican names to publicly support Hillary Clinton is Sally Bradshaw. CNN is describing her as “Jeb Bush’s top adviser”, and she has gone so far as to completely remove herself from the Republican Party because of Donald Trump… 
Jeb Bush’s top adviser, Sally Bradshaw, has left the Republican Party to become an independent, and says if the presidential race in Florida is close, she’ll vote for Hillary Clinton. 
Bradshaw, who’s been close to the former Florida governor for decades and was senior adviser to his 2016 campaign, officially switched her registration to unaffiliated. She told CNN’s Jamie Gangel in an email interview that the GOP is “at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist — a misogynist — a bigot.” 
“This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president,” Bradshaw said. 
Bradshaw has been working for the Bushes ever since the 1988 presidential campaign, and she never would have made such a bold move without the approval of the Bushes. 
Needless to say, the Bushes absolutely hate Trump, and they have a vested interest in seeing him lose the election. There are some that believe that Jeb Bush is already lining up for another run in 2020, and Donald Trump has to lose in order for that to be possible. 
In addition to Sally Bradshaw, another prominent friend of the Bush family has also recently announced that he is going to be voting for Hillary Clinton. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was at the center of the storm during the financial crisis of 2008, and not too long ago he announced his intentions in the Washington Post … 
“ When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump ,” Paulson wrote in The Washington Post last week . “I will not cast a write-in vote. I’ll be voting for Hillary Clinton , with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world. To my Republican friends: I know I’m not alone.” 
Does Henry Paulson actually believe that Hillary Clinton can “bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world”? 
I find that difficult to believe. 
But apparently he intends to try to persuade as many of his fellow Republicans as possible to vote for Hillary Clinton, and a whole bunch of other establishment Republicans have already lined up behind her. 
These are just some of the big Republican names that the Washington Post says have already committed to voting for Hillary Clinton… 
Richard Armitage , deputy secretary of state and adviser to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush 
Brent Scowcroft , chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board and adviser to three previous GOP presidents 
Alan Steinberg , regional EPA administrator 
Kori Schake , National Security Council and State Department aide 
Doug Elmets , former Reagan spokesman 
Jim Cicconi , former Reagan and George H.W. Bush aide 
Charles Fried , former U.S. solicitor general under Reagan 
Robert Kagan , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, former Reagan State Department aide and adviser to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney 
Max Boot , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to GOP presidential candidates 
Peter Mansoor , retired Army colonel and former aide to David Petraeus 
Larry Pressler , former three-term Republican senator from South Dakota 
Arne Carlson , a former two-term Republican governor of Minnesota 
Robert Smith , former judge on New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals 
Mark Salter , former top adviser to John McCain 
Mike Treiser , former Mitt Romney aide 
Ben Howe , editor at RedState.com 
As I have said all along, the establishment will do whatever it has to do to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. 
If that means voting for Hillary Clinton and encouraging others to do the same, that is precisely what they are going to do. 
And if more insidious means are necessary, the establishment definitely has plenty of tricks up their sleeves. Politics in America is a very, very dirty game, and if you have ever been deep inside a national campaign you know exactly what I am talking about. 
At this point, even Donald Trump is raising concerns about the integrity of the upcoming election. On Monday, he told a rally in Ohio that he is “afraid the election is going to be rigged” … 
Donald Trump said he’s afraid the general election in November will be rigged, but didn’t elaborate on the comment at a rally in Ohio Monday afternoon. 
“ I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest ,” the Republican nominee for president said, in remarks that did not mention the controversy generated by his comments about the parents of a slain U.S. soldier. 
In my opinion, Donald Trump has legitimate reasons to be concerned. We have already seen the elite spend millions upon millions of dollars to try to defeat him, and virtually all of the big money on Wall Street is lining up behind his opponent. Many patriotic, conservative and faith-oriented Americans are really hoping that Trump can win and move this nation in a positive direction, but the truth is that he is facing overwhelming odds. 
Ultimately, it is probably not going to matter too much who wins this election, because America is on the verge of a time of chaos unlike anything we have ever seen before. No matter who the next president is, we are going to see civil unrest, rising crime, political scandals, governmental shaking, major economic and financial problems, and geopolitical events will continue to spiral out of control. 
And the establishment is going to do everything it possibly can to make sure that the next president is not Donald Trump. If you go to just about any major news website on the Internet these days, there will be a negative story about Donald Trump featured very prominently, and it is usually accompanied by some sort of positive story about Hillary Clinton. 
In the end, one of the biggest stories that will come out of the 2016 election will be the fact that the American people got to see how far the elite are willing to go to keep someone that is not “in the club” from becoming president. 
The establishment absolutely loathes Trump, and they are willing to move heaven and earth to try to stop him. 
Hold on tight, because the next three months are going to be very, very interesting. 
It is nice to see people are standing behind the candidate that won. Not! 
I am not surprised. Liars, Liars, Pants on fire. 
Everyone of them probably pledged to support the candidate that got the nomination. Now they are going against him because he is so crude? You renege on your word and you are nothing. Because your word is like a contract. No one wants to deal with liars. Hilliary also has a reputation and it isn’t good about lying. I suggest that is what will make or break the candidate going for election. Whether or not they are publicly lying or not. Tatiana Covington 
They’re scared to death! greanfinisher . 
I really don’t blame them as he gives me the creeps too. P>Hopkins 
Why? greanfinisher . 
The man is unstable, unpredictable and impresses me as being an immature delinquent inside a man’s body. Imagine imploring the Russians to divulge whatever information that they gathered concerning the Clinton e-mails. Even before that, there was the episode in which his campaign manager man- handled a female reporter, and left gouge marks in her arm. Even during his rants and raves, he succeeded in not only alienating the women, but the minorities as well.

If anyone has regard for facts, then they simply cannot vote pro-Trump. Clinton is no prize by any stretch of the imagination, but she’s light years ahead of Donald when it comes to honesty… and YES, I realize that she’s seen as the ultimate liar. But Donald has consistently lied so, so very much more. And he’s made a name in politics solely by taunting and bullying. 
I tried so hard to stay with him, to vote party line rather than personality, but the whole juvenile “Little Marco” garbage was just unacceptable, and he’s only become more and more childish and bratty since then. You don’t reward bratty, childish, talentless hacks by voting for them, even IF they claim to be the party you’ve supported your whole life. P>Hopkins 
Party is irrelevant. You are seriously comfortable with Hillary putting up to 5 people on the SCOTUS?

What’s outrageously funny, is that the crud the establishment GOP has been pulling for decades, while systematically selling out their constituency and what Republicans are supposed to stand for, is, that’s what drove folks to Trump in the first place, and now, they think people are that gullible to buy more of the same, with their MSM smear tactics.

Those in the oligarchy typically donate nothing destined for the public good. Rather, virtually all of them have set up the so-called ‘foundations’ which are used primarily for money laundering and tax avoidance purposes. The Clinton Foundation is a prime example of such. Yes, all of these foundations are required by law to donate a certain percentage to charity, but it’s paltry compared to the disproportionate monetary gains involved. Even worse, the donations are mostly directed towards .operas, art museums, symphonies, and theaters – where they spend their leisure time fraternizing with other wealthy benefactors. In addition, some donations are routed towards elite prep schools and Ivy League universities (such as Yale, Princeton, Harvard) which do not have a reputation for educating poor young people. Whatever amount of sugar coating that may be applied, those are obviously not charities as most people understand the term. iris 
I disagree. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but I’m fairly educated and know plenty of other educated people, who don’t want another blatantly liberal politician in the office. At least there’s a possibility that Trump won’t further what’s been destroying our country for decades, literally. 58 million innocent citizens, is one good example. iris

Here’s how the gun confiscation will probably go: People keep expecting the gun confiscation to be an above board program where police go door to door removing guns from homes. They think martial law will be announced on the evening news with troops rolling into town and setting up on street corners. Those days are long gone and they just don’t work that way anymore. When it happens (as in NOW) it will be low profile, subtle and in stages to avoid the backlash (which everyone is waiting to see overt evidence before they fight back). Martial law won’t be declared but will be activated, most likely under an innocent sounding name. Evacuating people to “shelters” will be the ruse to imprisoning the masses. Gun confiscation will be silent and also under the guise of something else but the unstated purpose will be gun confiscation. That’s how they operate which is why they can say things like “Nobody said they want to round up ALL the guns (sure they will leave us with a few .22 cal rifles)”. Mass vaccinations would be a good one or an outbreak where large numbers of people will have to be quarantined. They definitely will not be doing things like this in a way that would trigger a mass response so you can forget waiting for them to signal the roundup is about to begin. greanfinisher . 
Obviously the gun confiscatin’ cronies are beginning the ruse now. At the moment, those on the ‘proposed’ ineligibility list for firearms are those with troubled dating, family problems, those on any prescription, veterans, Social Security recipients, those on the so-called ‘terror list’ (that should cover a cool 100 million people—-or more), those suffering depression (and whatever else they can dream up), etc.etc.etc. Guest’s the Name

Trump has not alienated one single intelligent patriotic woman that I am aware of; certainly not in my family. Those women “alienated”are feminist progressive communists already in the Hillary camp, and would never switch from evil for any reason.

r ght krinks 
With every passing day I come more and more to the conclusion that the Republican Party is and always has been the party of the rich. I always thought this notion was FDR propaganda, until now. Only the Rich are upset at Donald who will deport their cheap labor and tax their cheap products made with third world slaves. 
Don’t worry though. In order for The Donald to win it will take a public not susceptible to the avalanche of Donald Hate sure to come his way. Fat chance of that. The Public are by and large gullible, illiterate morons. One point that proves this. All of the polls point to Hillary with a slight lead. How can this be? The Donald has a much higher percentage of Republican vote than Hillary has of Democrat votes (The hard core Bernites won’t vote for her. Did you see the half empty arena last week and the ads for paid seat fillers to go with the White Noise Machines to drown out the boos?). The Donald leads with Independents nearly 2 to 1. How do these numbers add up? Of course they don’t and yet the public is too stupid to figure the polling scam out and be outraged. jaxon64 
Agreed–especially about fear of losing their cheap labor from illegals here and cheap labor for their corporations by off-shoring jobs. The Donald hate is so prevalent it is ridiculous. Just this morning before 8 AM I saw revolving hate ads against Trump when I turned on Roku/Pandora for some morning music–one pop-up ad despicably talking about old, nude photos of Ivana Trump. Then I check my yahoo email account and the entire background of the sign-in screen is an anti-Trump “I’m with Her” ad. It’s going to take a strong and knowledgable mind to withstand the billion dollar Hillary/Wall Street assault on Trump-and I don’t think the average American is that aware of the manipulation and propaganda they are being assailed with. krinks 
He could circumvent all of this by keeping illegal immigration and Off Shoring on the menu every time he speaks. This issue is one that majority agrees with even about 1/3 of Democrats. What the hell happened to the party of Big Labor that having more labor is a bad thing? krinks

Yes, our tax dollars are probably paying for at least some, if not many, of the anti Trump ads. However, even if they aren’t, the Bilderberg meeting probably included a vote for vast amounts of money to be poured into a smear campaign against him and for Hillary, by way of various world banks. That issue and Brexit, probably took up most of the meeting. They will do everything in their power to make sure the DonkiPhant stays in power, because that suits their plans for now. We are moving inexorably toward a one world economic, political and religious system, in fulfillment of prophecy, and this planned chaos may be the perfect scenario for a possibly very charismatic figure to take center stage under the promise of “world peace and safety”. I will vote, but regardless of what happens, (and I believe it’s rigged), God will still be in control. He is just and true. This world’s system is a shell game. 
I trust Trump more than Hillary, but even if he won, it’s probably too late for the U.S. to continue, with our semblance of sovereignty and freedom. The football games will continue, the fast food joints will supersize for an extra dollar, etc., but we’re going downhill too fast to stop, imo.

With Trump, everything has a price tag. He can certainly be bought off by the RNC, but the price tag will be high. They will develop a story line about how he is bowing out for the good of the GOP, and the good of the country, and the Trump brand will increase in value.

The old regime is broken. In practice, there’s actually 6 major parties now. 
Republicans split three ways: Establishment with the right-wing progressives, the Populists-Nationalists under Trump, and the Constitutionalists headed by Cruz and Lee. 
Democrats split into three: Liberals, now being pushed out of the party, and has no discernible leader (best thought leader for this new paradigm is Sargon of Akkad, a blogger that occasionally posts here), the Statist’s and porgressives under Hilary Clinton, and the Usurpers (insurrectionists, radicals, SJW’s, Gaystopo, etc) under Obama. 
Then there’s the smaller parties that still wait for good leadership to move them up in the ranks: Libertarians, Soylent Green’s, etc. 
And finally, there’s folks who don’t want to get involved with anyone’s $#%&. They want to live a good life, provide for their own, defend their homes, and not bother with the extremes. I want to be counted with these guys and am working on it.

Even with chaos in our midst (when have we not had it, ask the baby butchered in the womb about chaos and murder 3000 times per day in the USA alone), it matters very much who is elected. God meant it so. He commanded us to stand fast in this world and occupy it as our home until He returns. We must care passionately who wins this election and those other offices up for the vote. 
God raises up imperfect men to do that which seems not possible. Those who do not “like” Mr. Trump do need to first look at themselves and how imperfect we are. Mr. Trump is certainly no different. Each of us has a checkered life and past to some degree. Mr. Trump doesn’t need this and must ask himself, along with his family, if the danger, stress,and fatigue is worth it. 
Perhaps the single most important thing the next President will do is to nominate several Supreme Court Justices. One seat is open now and 5 could be opening in the next 4 years. Think of what that might mean to Roe v. Wade, 2nd Amendment and other issues. 
Those RINO’s who shout they will vote for Mrs. Clinton are insiders who want to continue to be so. They are one reason for the sin sick problems in our Federal government.

^^^False. This shows that only the most ghastly and abominable gas bag this era has ever created caused good people to obey their consciences by doing what MOST good Americans are doing, and that is making certain Donald-the-RINO never gets into the White House. 
“Does Henry Paulson actually believe that Hillary Clinton can “bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world”?”

“the establishment will do whatever it has to do to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.”

““I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,” the [orange buffoon] said.”

He knows by absolutely, positively EVERY metric and by EVERY source that he will NOT be good enough to win sufficient idiots’ votes, so he is planting the lie in advance that if he loses, it was a a rig-job. The Wednesday after he loses, he’ll follow up with, “Yeah, I didn’t wanna win anyway”. The man is beyond transparent. 
“No matter who the next president is, we are going to see civil unrest, rising crime[…] “ 
^^^True, and he has already commanded his band of zwastika-armbanded flying monkeys flunkies to riot and destroy on his behalf if he doesn’t get his way. That “man” is too much of a child to have made it this far. 
“[T]he establishment is going to do everything it possibly can to make sure that the next president is not Donald Trump.” 
^^^Let us all pray that they can do enough then. Individual voters can only do so much, and we individual voters are revving up for a November win for America. Clinton is no prize, but unless or until the GOP comes to its senses and allows an electable candidate, we’re stuck with HRC as the only viable anti-Donald.

The “negative stories” about Donald are unfortunately just Donald’s own failings, they aren’t journalistic hit pieces, they are just his own actions coming back to bite him… I say GOOD.

As for“positive” stories about Clinton, well, those filled with the most bigotry will see an article penned about her being cleared by the FBI and consider that a positive press… well, no, again it’s just factual press stories about her, and point of fact it is hard to find *truly* positive press about her. She simply $uxx a lot less than Donald. 
“The establishment absolutely loathes Trump” ^^^Well, the Establishment hates him a lot less than individual voters do. He’s even polling poorly in The Rust Belt states. He’s approaching a double-digit deficit in post-DNC polls. Besides, Donald has financially contributed to the biggest names on the Left Establishment, not the least of whom being the Clintons.

Take Robert Kagan, for example: a Big Government interventionist neoconservative married to Obama’s appointee to European and Eurasian affairs, Victoria Nuland, of “F the Eu” Fame, the once State Department liar for U.S. meddling and Spin regarding the Ukraine, a resume equally dubious – a loose-cannon, Ivory Tower War Hawk who is in line for Hillary Goldman Clinton’s state department. . Leopold B. Scotch 
“Robert’s brother, Fred, is with the hawkish American Enterprise Institute, and his sister-in-law, Kimberly, is the head of the Institute for the Study of War, which is largely funded by defense contractors. The Kagans work to encourage military action, both through their positions in government and by influencing the public debate through think-tank reports and op-eds. It is a family enterprise that mirrors the military-industrial complex as a whole, with think tanks coming up with reasons to increase military spending and providing “expert” support for the government officials who actually promote and implement the policies. Defense contractors, meanwhile, benefit from the largess and kick back some money to the think tanks, which then develop new reasons to spend still more on military procurement.” 
Hmmm, good to know, thanks. GV

It says a lot about the character of these people that they would recommend a multiple felon and pathological liar to be POTUS. Just how shallow a character do you need for this? FVS 
On the other side of the scale I’m sure Wikileaks is loaded and ready to go. Assange has openly said he dislikes the Clintons. If anybody thinks that the DNC emails is the worst they have store for Hillary they are naive and stupid. There are more leaks coming and I’d bet both the frequency and the potential for damaging Hillary will increase the closer we get to the election. 
Equally naïve would be to think Trump won’t turn the debates I to an indictment of MSM bias. I can hear it now: MSM Clinton shill: Blah, blah, blah in naked accusatory tone… Trump: Instead of asking that stupid biased question why haven’t you asked Mrs. Clinton about … (insert any one of Hillary’s documented lies). Trump then stops and starts directly at the phony moderator as the silence turns to indictment. FVS 
These idiots still don’t grasp that the ground swell of Trump’s support came because he exposed that these ash wipes have been in bed with the Democrats all along. Neither do they grasp that their opinions no lo ger carry any weight. If it did Jeb would have been the nominee. But he isn’t is he? iris

Let everyone know when you get more republicans’ names who are wolves in sheep’s clothing. This identifies them as definitely on the side of the NWO. All of them are traitors and should be put on trial. I’m sure they are involved in the Clinton Foundation money scandal and are afraid if Trump gets in they will all be found out for the traitors that they are. greanfinisher .

1379,High School Assistant Principal Resigns After Cursing at Pro-Life Student Activists - Breitbart,"The assistant principal of a Pennsylvania high school has resigned after a video of him berating   student activists went viral.[  Assistant principal Zach Ruff, who was filmed berating and cursing at      activists, resigned the day after a petition defending Ruff circulated online with more than 50, 000 signatures. Ruff was placed on administrative leave on April 21 after the video of his interaction with the young activists went viral. “You can go to hell where they are too,” he said pointing at pictures of aborted children. “They’re not children! They’re cells!” “Listen here, son, alright? I am as gay as the day is long, and twice as sunny. I don’t give a fuck what you think Jesus tells me about what I should and should not be doing,” Ruff barked. “You’re acting very immaturely. I’m 16 and you’re yelling at me,” one of the teens responded. The school said Ruff resigned from his position in a news release. “Dr. Ruff has acknowledged that the demonstrators had a right to be on a public sidewalk,” the news release said. “He acknowledged that his conduct cannot be defended or condoned, and he deeply regretted his actions as displayed on the video. This school district will not interfere with the rights of anyone to express themselves. ” “In reviewing the video Dr. Ruff knew that the conduct he displayed was not representative of who he is and was not representative of the kind of educational leader he prided himself on being,” the news release added.

1381,Met Office promises ‘gloomiest sky for 70 years’,"November 14, 2016 
Meteorologists were today said to be ‘cautiously optimistic’ that the skies over much of Britain would tonight be the gloomiest in living memory. ‘You might think a grey sky is a grey sky is a grey sky,’ said weather watcher Ron Webster. ‘But I assure you there are grey skies and there are grey skies. Tonight will be a real eye opener, not that that will make a lot of difference.’ 
Called a ‘Supergloom’, the phenomenon occurs whenever there’s something worth seeing in the night skies over England. ‘A good view of the ISS, a meteor shower, a comet, some planets in alignment. You can guarantee that if there’s anything remotely interesting happening above our heads, atmospheric conditions will combine to create this impenetrable blanket of murk.’ 
Sure enough, tonight’s sky-full of dull coincides with a full moon that would have appeared slightly larger and brighter than usual, had anyone not in an aircraft been able to see it. (Keen photographers wishing to record the spectacle have been advised to download a shot of any full moon and ‘blow it up a bit’.) 
But for fans of the overcast like Ron Webster, tonight’s damp, dismal and funereal sky will be something to behold. ‘I’m literally over the moon,’ he said, ‘and any other celestial phenomena.’ Share this story...

1382,Bloodshed predicted in US after elections,"Bloodshed predicted in US after elections 26.10.2016 Preliminary analysis of results of the US presidential elections shows that the chances of America's remaining calm after 8 November make up only 5%. Most probably, the hottest events will take place on the elections day. According to the first scenario, there are three options of the development. The first one is that Trump wins, however the Democrats will steal votes to claim victory. In case it happens, mass protests, violence, bloodshed and a lot of problems connected with the law may be expected, the Natural News wrote. The second one is that Obama declares results invalid, asserting that the Russians have influenced the voting, which is the most probable outcome of the elections and it will definitely generate unrest. The third one is that the Democrats recognize Trump's victory and agree upon peaceful change of power. However, even in case Obama and Clintons admit their defeat and agree that Donald Trump is the next president, mass riots may spark everywhere. It is noted that Obama can make use of it to declare the martial law and suspend Trump's coming into power, accusing him of all the sins. It is also possible that Clinton wins the elections, but her adversaries will dispute validity of the results. This scenario is quite problematic, as it may face violence which will promptly turn into a military coup or revolt of the armed citizens, a march to Washington and dethronement of the corrupt power regime.

1383,Trump: A people’s ‘new world order’ taking shape?,"Trump: A people’s ‘new world order’ taking shape? By Eric Walberg   Eric Walberg 
A populist wave that began with Brexit in June became a tsunami as Trump’s cyclone hit Washington Tuesday night, leaving the capital in a shambles. His is a story straight out of Grimm’s fairytales. the peasants rose up. The phony civility of the neoconservative nightmare that Americans (and the world) have endured for years is cracking. 
Trump’s victory is pure protest by the masses. Exciting, but disturbing, as Trump is just another billionaire. He will be sure to look after his own, but then again, maybe he can stare them down. Fortunately, there is the Republican Congress and Senate to provide stability as the upstart get his feet on the ground. The weakened Democrats will have to fight extra hard after years of complacency under the nice, liberal Obama. 
For critics of media control by the Israel lobby in the US, and the sham elections where money rules, the victory shattered this paradigm. “Though the ‘Masters of Discourse’ control the entirety of world media, and they decide what people may think and say from Canada to Hong Kong, only you, American citizens, can defeat them. Trump has a great quality making him fit for the task: he is impervious to labels and libels. He had been called everything in the book: anti-Semite, racist, women hater, you name it. And he still survived that flak. Such people are very rare,” writes Israel Shamir. 
Almost all presidents since Jimmy Carter have campaigned as outsiders. Reagan, Bill Clinton, Bush jr, Obama. But they were all seasoned politicians and all disappointed. 
President Trump—think: Governor Ventura 
There is a precedent of a boorish outsider, made famous and pilloried in the media, who catapulted into the political world. His name is Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler who served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. He was the first member of the Reform Party to win a major government position, now in the Independence Party of Minnesota. 
He surprised everyone with a sober, uncorrupt term in office, reforming taxation and constructing the METRO Blue Line light rail in Minneapolis–Saint Paul. He shattered the Republican-Democratic stranglehold and no one suffered. Trump has shattered it again. He makes a path open to a third party or independent candidate in the future. 
Trump’s trump card 
Trump’s final ad, a 2-minute masterpiece of populist rhetoric infuriated the ADL for hinting the obvious: the forces of international finance that have their own agenda for the US, behind our backs, and whose agent is/was Hillary Clinton. He depicted a “global power structure” that is “bleeding America dry” with horrible trade deals that enrich elites and open the gates to mass immigration. 
The people behind this globalist takeover include George Soros, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen and Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, with the implication that Clinton is their minion. “The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure. We’ve seen this first hand in the WikiLeaks documents, in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,” charged Trump. 
That jab alone was worth more than all of Hillary’s millions spent on ads attacking him for peccadilloes. Now the intelligent Republicans are waking up. Trumps’ words are branded in their minds. That alone makes the election historic. 
The ADl’s slander of Trump—this ad touches on images and rhetoric that anti-Semites have used for age—merely alerted Americans to the emptiness of the ‘anti-Semitic’ slur. If something is true, pointing it out is not bigotry. 
Senior House deputy whip Dennis Ross of Florida lauds Trump for his known ability as negotiator. “Sure, he might toss out statements like ‘build a wall,’ or ‘no Muslims,’ and say something sensational. But then he knows how to give in a bit and come up with a solution.” 
House Speaker Paul Ryan publicly disowned Trump during the campaign, and now has to eating crow. The closest modern comparison of an outsider president and a speaker of the same political party may be the fractious relationship during the late 1970s between Democrats President Jimmy Carter and House Speaker Tip O’Neill. Carter’s team didn’t have an appreciation for how the system worked in Washington and struggled to advance his agenda. 
New American ball game 
The Republican win in the Congress and Senate, with a Republican president, offers a chance to produce meaningful change. Will Trump develop more concern for the environment and work to help the millions of poor Americans who put their trust in him? He has a huge responsibility to repay his voters and give hope for reconciliation with his opponents. There is much soul searching to be done now, on both sides of the divide in American political life. 
The election represents a call to action for people to fight hard to save the environment, rebuild a county falling apart, and demand a responsible US foreign policy. 
Democracy only works when we all take part. People are awakening from their Wall St induced sleep. Look for a new ‘Occupy Wall St’ and peace campaigning. 
That’s the bright side. Trump’s policies on the Middle East and Iran are confused and incoherent. Let’s hope that his friendship with Vladimir Putin portends realism, and the ability and intent to change the US imperial mindset that plagues the world. The French are just as furious with the same scenario there. Trump’s victory makes a victory for the Front National’ s Marine Le Pen more likely. “The American people—free!” Le Pen tweeted as Trump’s count reached the threshold of victory. 
It also gives energy to Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Protest candidates throughout Europe have gained votes and seats in many countries, and entered government coalitions in 11 Western democracies, including in Austria, Italy and Switzerland. 
This wave of protest is gathering momentum. The American people have the chance now, and the responsibility, to help shape where Trump will take his ‘revolution.’ Whether he can work with his foreign counterparts to create a people’s ‘new world order’, not the one Bush Sr. promised in 1991 and that Bush Jr. failed to achieve. Foreign policy has too long been off limits, done by elites behind closed doors. 
Government has to listen to the people now, after years of passivity and policies shaped by the elite. Trump made serious promises to revitalize American. People will now hold him to them.

1384,FBI Horrified As Spy Says Russia Has Been Supporting And Cultivating Trump For Years,"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 11:48 am A ""veteran"" spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was ""shock and horror."" Share on Twitter Print This Post 
A “veteran” spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” 
The report alleges that Trump and his “inner circle” have accepted a regular “flow of intelligence from the Kremlin and that Russian intelligence claims to have “compromised” Trump on his visits and could “blackmail him”. 
David Corn at Mother Jones reported: 
Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer’s conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.” 
The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos—some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says. 
In August, Corn reports, the FBI asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he “continued to share information with the FBI” which he says made it clear there was a “pretty substantial inquiry going on.” 
If this report is accurate, the spy’s information confirms what Senator Harry Reid says intelligence experts and FBI Director James Comey already shared with him regarding “explosive information” regarding ties and coordination between Donald Trump and Russia. 
This report also rings true given report about the Trump server repeatedly being connected to Russia, including Trump’s server possibly communicating with a Russian bank. 
It also makes sense given the many ties to Russia within Trump’s own campaign and indeed Trump’s own rhetoric regarding NATO and Russia. Trump changed the Republican Party platform’s pro-Ukraine proposals and talked about weakening NATO, both of which mirrored Putin’s wish list. NBC reported Monday evening that the FBI is in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump’s ex-campaign manager’s connection to Russia. 
Donald Trump has already been busted for reading Russian propaganda at his rallies, as Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald uncovered an instance of Trump reading propaganda directly from Putin at a rally in Pennsylvania. 
Eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the Russians have been hacking into American emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election, “The Russians have been obtaining American emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of them—falsifying them—in hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election. The big question, of course, is why are the Russians working so hard to damage Clinton and, in the process, aid Donald Trump?” 
The answer to why Putin is trying so hard to defeat Clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her. Unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is no pushover. According to former U.S. officials, Putin sees Clinton as a “forceful proponent of ‘regime change’ policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival.” 
Trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the Kremlin. He’s been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy, he is easily flattered and easily manipulated. It’s also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him – see the Billy Bush bus tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault. Trump is easy bait. 
The fact that the FBI Director felt compelled to announce something about Hillary’s emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aide’s emails and even then he wasn’t sure what they said or even if they were duplicates, but he chose to keep this explosive information about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia under wraps is very disturbing. 
This isn’t a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the FBI follows about ongoing investigations. This is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate. But the fact that they come from different sources and that Trump willingly staffed his own campaign with Russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak — these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions.",0
1385,‘I Guess I’m Having an Aleppo Moment’: Gary Johnson Can’t Name a Single Foreign Leader - The New York Times,"It was, in Gary Johnson’s own words, another “Aleppo moment. ” During a town   interview on MSNBC on Wednesday night, Mr. Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, was asked by the host Chris Matthews to name his favorite foreign leader. Mr. Johnson, appearing flustered, was at a loss to come up with a name. He grasped at a former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, who has been critical of Donald J. Trump, but was unable to remember his name without help  —   or the name of any sitting leader of a foreign country. “I guess I’m having an Aleppo moment,” he said. Mr. Johnson was referring to a remarkably similar episode earlier this month when, during another interview on MSNBC, he was asked how he would deal with the continuing situation in Aleppo, the ravaged Syrian city at the center of that country’s refugee crisis. “What is Aleppo?” Mr. Johnson said at the time. Mr. Matthews, who was interviewing Mr. Johnson and former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, his running mate, live at the University of New Hampshire, appeared to stall to give Mr. Johnson more time after the candidate repeated the initial question, looking slightly panicked. “Any one of the continents, any country, name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to, anybody,” Mr. Matthews said. Mr. Johnson exhaled loudly. “Mine was Shimon Peres,” Mr. Weld interjected. Mr. Matthews clarified that he was looking for someone who was still alive. He then named various countries and continents  —   Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia  —   in an apparent attempt to jog Mr. Johnson’s memory. Mr. Johnson then made the “Aleppo moment” comment, indicating that he was having trouble coming up with Mr. Fox’s name. “But I’m giving you the whole world!” Mr. Matthews shouted, interrupting him. Mr. Weld eventually supplied Mr. Fox’s last name to Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Matthews, apparently having given up on the presidential candidate, asked the eager Mr. Weld to name his own favorite foreign leader, looking to conclude a painful exchange that felt significantly longer than the 50 seconds or so that it lasted. Mr. Weld paused for half a second. “Um, Merkel?” he said, referring to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “Can’t argue with that,” Mr. Matthews said, as the crowd applauded.",0

But her opinion of Sulzberger wasn’t very high: “But Arthur is a pretty big wuss so he’s not going to do a lot more than that. Hillary would have to be the one to call.” 
Tanden believed that Clinton also needed to get more minority and women reporters in her corner to keep her campaign afloat. Advertisement - story continues below 
“He also thinks the brown and women pundits can shame the times and others on social media,” she concluded. “So cultivating Joan Walsh, Yglesias, Allen, perry bacon, Greg Sargent, to defend her is helpful. They can be emboldened. Fwiw – I pushed pir to do this a yr ago.”

1387,Ireland Reconsiders Its Constitutional Ban on Abortion - The New York Times,"DUBLIN  —   An assembly of Irish citizens convened by Parliament is considering changes to one of the most divisive policies in the country: the   ban on abortions, which has been enshrined in Ireland’s Constitution since 1983. The group, a   Citizens’ Assembly led by Mary Laffoy, a Supreme Court judge, does not have the power to change the law. But its mandate from Parliament  —   to examine the full range of medical, legal and ethical issues surrounding abortion  —   suggests a willingness to revisit the ban, one of the most stringent in the Western world. Over the last three months, the assembly has received more than 13, 500 comments from the public  —   more than 1, 000 of which have been published online so far. It pored over these submissions at the Grand Hotel Malahide over the weekend, along with testimony from experts, and is scheduled to issue a report later this year. Abortion was already illegal in Ireland before 1983, but the Eighth Amendment gave “the right to life of the unborn” equal status to “the right to life of the mother” under the Constitution. The amendment was enacted through a voter referendum, and can be altered  —   or abandoned  —   only via another referendum. Several highly publicized cases since then have contributed to and reflected a shift in the public’s mood, however. In 2012, a    woman, Savita Halappanavar, died from septic shock while having a miscarriage, after a hospital denied her an abortion that might have saved her life. And last year, a United Nations committee ruled that Ireland had violated a woman’s rights by forcing her to travel abroad for an abortion even though severe congenital defects had been diagnosed in the fetus. Legal uncertainty over how to define “the unborn” has long dogged the amendment, and the assembly was seen as one response to the panel’s criticisms. It is common for women in Ireland to travel to countries such as Britain and the Netherlands for abortions. Figures from Britain’s National Health Service showed that more than 3, 400 women gave Irish addresses to British abortions clinics in 2015. That said, Ireland remains a conservative society, and the Roman Catholic Church opposes any change in the law. “We believe that every unborn child, irrespective of his or her medical condition or the circumstances of his or her birth, has the right to be treated equally before the law,” the bishops’ conference said in a statement. Submissions posted online expressed a wide range of views, with many of them offering deeply personal perspectives. Leslie Spillane, a woman in her 20s from Cork, in southwestern Ireland, wrote that several of her friends had traveled abroad to terminate their pregnancies. “These friends of mine are also the lucky ones, they have been able to borrow the money for the travel, and they have had friends they could tell,” she wrote. “Abortions happen, everyday. Making them illegal doesn’t stop woman needing, or wanting them, or inflicting them on themselves  —   there will always be coat hangers, broken bottles, painkillers, stairs to fall down, fists to hit, medicines to swallow. ” In a phone interview, she said that “even if you don’t agree with abortion, it’s not morally acceptable to force your views onto others. ” Defenders of the law were equally adamant. “Abortion, in our firm belief, is the taking of human life irrespective of the stage of pregnancy,” wrote Kathleen Gleeson and her husband, Raymond Gleeson, from County Kerry, in southwestern Ireland. Valerie Marjoram, a woman in her 30s in County Kildare, just west of Dublin, described herself as a feminist who opposed abortion on religious grounds. “I find it appalling that a certain brand of feminism would put more effort into obtaining the legal sanction of murdering one’s own child than fighting for the right to carry a child to term without losing one’s pay, career path, promotion, college place,” she said in a phone interview. “The fact that abortion is legal in any country has led to a culture of selfishness where even life can be rescheduled if it happens at the ‘wrong time. ’” The Eighth Amendment has been subject to legal and political challenges over the years. In 1992, Ireland’s highest court upheld the right to an abortion if the mother’s life is at risk, including from suicide, but how to interpret that right remains in dispute. In 1992, voters approved an amendment to the Constitution to allow women to travel abroad for abortions and to receive information about abortion services abroad. And in that year, and again in 2002, voters rejected amendments that would have removed the threat of suicide as grounds for a legal abortion. Conor O’Mahony, a lecturer in law at University College Cork, says the continued contentiousness reveals problems with the wording of the ban. “The Eighth Amendment doesn’t work as a means of regulating abortion, whether you are coming from the   or abortion rights perspective,” he said in a phone interview. “And the evidence I would give you is that neither side has ever been happy with how that amendment has been interpreted and applied over the years. ” He said that public opinion had been gradually shifting in favor of legalizing abortion  —   particularly in cases involving severe fetal abnormalities or rape  —   but predicted that the debate would continue for years even if a referendum was to take place in the near future. Gerard Whyte, a professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, said in a phone interview that it would be unwise to simply repeal the amendment, as some   advocates seek. “If there is no constitutional protection for the unborn, then there is a problem and we’re into uncharted territory,” he said. “I’m simply warning about a situation whereby people decide to repeal the Eighth but don’t add anything else. ”",0

1389,Indian counter-terror experience useful for Russia,"terrorism , india , russia Opinion Indian Army soldiers leave the site of a gun battle in Pampore, on the outskirts of Srinagar, Kashmir. Source:AP 
The Indian experience in fighting against terrorism can be useful for Russia, while the Western experience is narrowly focused. Cooperation with New Delhi on this issue, therefore, is more important than such a dialogue with the West, said Yuri Nagernyak, General Director of “Humanism, Progress and the Rule of Law” Fund, an international foundation for the promotion of culture, science and education. 
“I think that the Indian direction, in terms of fighting against terrorism in Russia, is extremely important, and I dare say, more important than trying to organize such cooperation with Western countries,” he said during a Moscow-Delhi video bridge, organized by the MIA Russia Today. 
Nagernyak said Russia and India were connected by “deep interests”, and a common vision of the future, which make them “close partners”. 
Kadakin: Russia with India. Terrorism is greatest human rights violation 
Thus, “relations between the two countries, regardless of how the political situation develops, always remain at the highest level,” he explained. 
“In this sense, in cooperating with India, in terms of the fight against terrorism, we can, firstly, be sure that this cooperation will be real, and not merely declarative. Secondly, we can be confident in the stability of this cooperation. Third, and much more important, it seems to me, exchanges between our two countries will give us much more than cooperation in this sphere between Russia and the West,” believes Nagernyak. 
The reason for this, he said, is particularly because India is faced with different directions of terrorism. 
“The Indian experience in counter-terrorism , and terrorism in many of its different forms, is really beneficial to Russia, while the experience of the West – is actually a very narrow experience,” said Nagernyak. 
Andrey Kazantsev, Director of the Analytical Centre of the Institute of International Studies, MGIMO (University) MFA Russia, also noted that, “for Russia and India there exists a common interest in stabilizing the situation in such a wide region that includes Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia”. He believes “different formats of Russian-Indian dialogue need to be developed on this aspect of cooperation.”

1391,Senate Republicans Open Fight Over Obama Health Law - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it. The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law, a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence, who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature health care law, has created online insurance marketplaces, offered new protections to people seeking health insurance, and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. “The American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country,” Mr. Pence said, “and we are determined to give them that. ” He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law, but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance, however, and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, playing off Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan, said repealing the law would “make America sick again. ” Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats’ being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday, the Senate took the first step, agreeing to take up a budget resolution, or blueprint, that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law, it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days, and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead, both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law, which has become deeply enmeshed with America’s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to “be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster,” and added, “Don’t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. ” Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would “fall of its own weight. ” Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Republican who is one of Mr. Trump’s top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team, said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. “We have to make sure we keep reminding America, we are repealing it because it failed, we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it,” Mr. Collins said. “And that was a key piece of Donald Trump’s campaign. ” But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law, they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. “There will naturally be a reasonable transition period,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. “You can’t adopt new reforms all at once. ” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, noted that it had taken six years to get into “the ditch we find ourselves in now. ” “When your truck or car is in a ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch,” Mr. Cornyn said. “And sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. ” To that, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, parried that when a car goes into a ditch, “the first thing I don’t do is dismantle the car. ” “That doesn’t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation,” she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year, Republicans would “regret that they came out so fast out of the box. ” He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. “If you are repealing, show us what you’ll replace it with first,” Mr. Schumer said. “Then we’ll look at what you have and see what we can do. ” Later, Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump, “It’s his and their responsibility, plain and simple  —   name calling isn’t going to get anything done. ” He added, “They really need to calm things down a little. ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. “The point is, in 2017, we don’t want people to be caught with nothing,” he said. “We want to make sure that there’s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. ” Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the Republicans’ rollback effort. In reality, the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a “pep rally” for Affordable Care Act defenders, in the words of an attendee, Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. The gathering, which could be Mr. Obama’s last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat, had a     air, with numerous Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Johnson, sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the president’s words. Mr. Obama, for his part, did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law, but warned Democrats against “rescuing” Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said, “He acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the American people. ”",0
1392,The Plenary Meeting of Iraqi Sunnis ended by stressing on unanimity and unity against threats,"Email Final statement of the conference stressed on brotherhood and peaceful coexistence.

1393,"A Young Mother’s Solitary, Uphill Struggle - The New York Times","Without warning, Tyrell Williams’s mood shifts from gleeful to morose. Consumed by his action figures one moment, Tyrell, 4, will abruptly set them down, start sobbing and complain to his mother how much he needs his father. “Obviously I want to cry with him, but I don’t,” his mother, Myasia Williams, 23, said. “I stay strong and I just speak to him. I say, ‘Daddy’s away and he loves you. He misses you very much. ’” She will not explain to him that his father, who is also named Tyrell Williams, is in prison. That conversation must be between father and son, reserved for a future date. Mr. Williams is serving time for attempted murder and is set to be released in 2041. Mrs. Williams said his crime has not changed her love for him, though it has caused her to lose relationships with other people in her life who question why she is loyal to a man behind bars. They don’t understand the depth of the love she has for him, she said. They met while attending Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan. She noticed his kindness toward her friends. Once they began dating, she felt a sense of belonging she had never experienced. “At the time we met, I was at a rough place when it came to my family, and his family came to me with open arms,” she said. “They really took care of me. ” Mr. Williams was arrested in 2011. He spent the next few years out on bail and the couple spent even more time together, and she gave birth to Tyrell Jr. Mr. Williams was convicted in July 2015. That October, the couple married at the Rikers Island jail complex. The ceremony was held in a small room, under the supervision of two corrections officers. Another inmate and his wife served as the witnesses. “After we said, ‘I do,’ we only got five minutes to sit there and talk to each other,” Mrs. Williams said. “I was not happy at all. But I was happy I got married. ” Mrs. Williams, alone raising their son, had limited career options. When she became pregnant, she dropped out of high school and thought that Mr. Williams would provide for the family. “When he got taken away from us, I could have been more prepared,” she said. “Instead, I have to start all over in my life. ” To improve her job prospects, Mrs. Williams enrolled in test preparation classes at the Next Generation Center for the high school equivalency diploma exam. The center is operated by the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. A year ago, the organization used $400 from the Neediest Cases Fund to help Mrs. Williams buy winter clothing for herself and Tyrell. Mrs. Williams and Tyrell live in the Bronx in an overcrowded apartment shared with six other relatives. Finding work has not been as easy as Mrs. Williams had hoped. She has a temporary job at a postal office in Flushing, Queens. She said she needed a college degree to have more career options, so she is working toward a practical nursing certificate at Mildred Elley, a   career and technical college. She feels guilty whenever she has to leave Tyrell in the care of her sisters or godparents when heading off to school or work, especially at times where he pleads with her not to leave him like Daddy did. “I always talk to him and try to explain to him ‘This is what I’m doing,’” she said. “‘I’m doing this so you can have your own room, you can have this, you can have that.’ I don’t know if he’s too young to understand, but I know he’ll eventually understand. ” Mrs. Williams said she lived by her phone, and talked to her husband almost every day. The thought of not being able to answer is its own source of stress. “If I miss a call, I miss a chance to speak to him,” she said. “And if I’m at work or at school, Tyrell can’t talk to him. ” Once every few months, Mrs. Williams and Tyrell Jr. travel by bus, to the Clinton Correctional Facility to visit Mr. Williams. The journey takes six hours one way to nearby Plattsburgh, and then they must take a cab. Their son recognizes police officers, Mrs. Williams said, but doesn’t grasp that they are visiting a prison. She hopes that her husband will be able to appeal and one day be granted an early release. Then they can make a life for themselves in Central New York. The family spent some time in Syracuse while Mr. Williams was awaiting trial. He has relatives there. “I loved it,” Mrs. Williams said. “It’s different. You come outside and everyone wants to say hi and give you a smile. When you come here, and have a smile on your face, it’s ‘What are you looking at? ’” She has another dream as well, and this one might never be realized. “I want more kids, but I don’t want to have them while he’s in there,” Mrs. Williams said. “That’s not going to work. I’m not having a child in that situation. I feel guilty for even having my son, knowing that eventually something was going to happen. ” Motherhood, in addition to her long hours of work and school, is already a lot to juggle, and she admits, despite her best efforts, she doesn’t always do so with aplomb. But she says she won’t stop trying. ”I’m trying to get it together,” Mrs. Williams said. “It’s not together at all. ”",0
1394,7 Notable Debuts at Art Basel Miami Beach - The New York Times,"  galleries are making their debut at Art Basel Miami Beach  on Thursday, out of some 600 dealers who applied for the fair and 269 who were accepted. The lineup is determined after much debate on the merit of each and how individual galleries contribute to the overall balance of the show. The New York Times asked Noah Horowitz, the fair’s director, to highlight several newcomers. The sprawling fair is divided into multiple sectors, which can help visitors make sense of its size. Galleries is the main event, intended for top dealers from around the world. Nova is for works done in the last three years. Positions displays   projects and is intended to be an incubator for new talent. Survey tackles historical projects, while Public stages outdoor sculptures and installations in Collins Park. Owned by Mara McCarthy, the daughter of the noted contemporary artist Paul McCarthy, this is one of the galleries fueling the rapid ascension of the Los Angeles art scene. Its program, strong in artists of the 1960s and ’70s, is part of a trend, Mr. Horowitz said: “Younger galleries looking at the past. ” The Box is focusing on Barbara T. Smith, 85, an important feminist figure on the West Coast who pioneered   and sexuality related performance art. The collective gallery she and her fellow artists founded in the early 1970s,   was the site of “Shoot,” the notorious Chris Burden performance piece in which he had himself shot in the arm with a rifle. “Barbara Smith is a legend, and her work has great resonance,” Mr. Horowitz said, though he added that she perhaps was not a household name for collectors. “This is what Survey does so well, provide a place for rediscovery. ” The gallery will show video and sculptures related to her work “Field Piece” ( ). For the original installation, a field of tall resin forms, Ms. Smith asked participants to experience the work naked. Founded by Emmanuel Di Donna, a former Sotheby’s executive, the Upper East Side dealer specializes in Surrealist and Modern art, as well as other postwar works. Not only is this Di Donna’s first showing at Art Basel Miami Beach, it is the gallery’s first art fair. “He’s a great example of a young but superserious,   dealer,” Mr. Horowitz said, using the industry term for works that have been previously bought and sold. “He does formidable research on these shows. He’s someone we think will be on the scene for many years to come. ” The mix of works includes “La Joconde” (1967) an    bronze by the Belgian Surrealist René Magritte, and “Femme, oiseau, étoiles” (1942) a work in gouache, charcoal and pastel by the Catalan Surrealist Joan Miró. Also on hand is a sculpture by the   Italian Fausto Melotti, “La rivoluzione dogmatica” (1969) made of brass and fabric.   art is always a strong component of Art Basel Miami Beach, given the fair’s proximity to Central and South America and Miami’s distinct Latin flavor. “We try to emphasize great projects coming from the region,” Mr. Horowitz said, and there are 31   galleries exhibiting this year. Simões de Assis Galeria de Arte was founded in 1984 by the architect Waldir Simões de Assis Filho, who has an unusual family connection to the fair: His son, Guilherme S. de Assis, participated in the Positions sector last year with his SIM Galeria. The father’s gallery, participating in its first international art fair, has made a specialty of secondary market work by South American artists, and this year will feature 16 works made from the 1930s to the 1950s by the Uruguayan artist Carmelo Arden Quin ( ). Quin, who lived in Paris for much of his life, made geometric works, often on irregularly shaped canvases, and is considered an influential modern painter of the type Survey highlights. Vigo is a    gallery in London’s West End, founded by Toby Clarke and Thomas Williams, that shows a variety of contemporary artists, including Derrick Adams and Leonardo Drew. For the Miami Beach fair, the gallery is exhibiting more than two dozen drawings and paintings by the Sudanese artist Ibrahim   including the ink on paper “Study of a Boy’s Head” (1960) and “Illustration no. 2 for Tayeb Salih’s novel Maryoud” (1977). Mr.   known for a gestural approach to works often done in a limited palette of black and white, is a former politician and diplomat who was imprisoned without charges in Sudan in 1975 and has taken inspiration from his time in jail. Two years ago, Mr.   became the first African artist to have a retrospective at Tate Modern in London, a show that featured more than 100 works. “He’s having an amazing moment of discovery,” Mr. Horowitz said. “Now he’s really in the international consciousness. ” And the   match of dealer and painter is significant, he said. “A London gallery showing an African artist demonstrates that Survey is quite the global program. ” The city of Bologna does not have a big presence on the international fair scene  —   that tends to be a role filled by Milan or Rome  —   but Galleria d’Arte Maggiore has developed a strong reputation for showing   masterworks across a wide spectrum, from Paul Klee to   Basquiat. It was founded in 1978 by Franco and Roberta Calarota and it is now being run by their daughter, Alessia. “It’s a real family affair,” Mr. Horowitz said. For its first Miami Beach appearance, the gallery is focusing exclusively on the Italian painter Giorgio Morandi (1890 —  1964) who became an icon largely after his death for his paintings of deceptively simple tabletop scenes. He imbued clusters of vases and bottles with metaphysical heft. A solo show of his work was presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2008. “Anything to do with the Morandi estate, it starts and ends with Maggiore,” Mr. Horowitz said. “They have access to an extraordinary cache of material. ” Given the sometimes cacophonous nature of   contemporary art, the Maggiore booth may provide a respite for visitors to the fair. Four of the paintings in the booth have the title “Natura morta” (“still life”) and were done between 1940 and 1960. “It’ll be a beautiful slow presentation in a hectic fair,” Mr. Horowitz said. This is a young gallery showing new works. The show’s title, “Shanghai: A New Ballardian Vision,” has a literary slant and refers to the dystopian urban vision of English novelist J. G. Ballard (  “Empire of the Sun”) who grew up in the Chinese city. The installation will include works by Aaajiao (the nom d’art of the new media artist Xu Wenkai) the painter Cui Jie, and Liu Shiyuan, who works in photography among other media. Ms. Cui’s fantastical oil paintings of imagined buildings, including “Building of Eagles” (2014) are among the works on display. Mr. Horowitz said the gallery’s founder, Leo Xu, a curator and writer, had“risen to the fore of the next generation of Chinese gallerists,” noting that he had exhibited at Art Basel Hong Kong show since it began. (Leo Xu Projects has also participated in Frieze New York and other international fairs.) “It’s a wonderful example of how our presence in Hong Kong has helped us cultivate relations with these Asian galleries,” Mr. Horowitz said. “We don’t take them for geographic reasons  —   it’s just that great things are being done in China right now. ” Hong Kong is known for being a hub of the art trade, but not so much its production or display. Edouard Malingue Gallery has been participating in Art Basel Hong Kong, and for its first Miami Beach outing is mounting a show of the video artist Wong Ping. Mr. Wong is known for   animations that touch on what the gallery’s website calls “repressed sexuality, personal sentiments and political limitations. ” Mr. Wong is also a Hong Kong native. “It’s nice to see a Hong Kong artist,” Mr. Horowitz said. “There’s not an infinite pool of them. A local scene is developing there that goes beyond merely the commercial aspect of a market center. ” Of “Jungle of Desire” (2015) the main work in this solo presentation, Mr. Horowitz said, “Our committee totally loved this video. ” The gallery is also exhibiting a work in the Public sector, which is displayed outdoors in Collins Park, in front of the Bass Museum of Art. Eric Baudart’s “Atmosphère” (2016) is a tank filled with peanut oil that, powered by a fan, will ripple and move. “It’s great to see a new gallery not only do a booth, but contribute an ambitious project to another sector, too,” Mr. Horowitz said.",0

They expected her to stay,” a source said. Hall’s relationship with NBC soured when the network canceled her   morning show “Today’s Take,” which she   with Al Roker, to create a slot for Kelly. Hall found out she was being ousted minutes before she went on air last Friday. “She was devastated to get the news. It was almost an Ann Curry moment live again on TV. It was surreal,” another insider told us. Staffers have been buzzing about Andy Lack’s decision to replace “Today’s” first black female anchor with Kelly. “Tamron doesn’t know Megyn, but of course it’s insulting. Her show was beating Kelly Ripa and ‘Nightly News’ would rate well when she would fill in for Lester Holt. It was a very tense few days for everyone. There was a lot of crying,” the source added. “Tamron never wanted this fight, but she was ready for it. No deal would stop her from standing up after Roker posted their successful ratings [on Twitter]. ” Read the rest of the story here.",0
1397,Toxic cloud continues to spread over Iraq six days after ISIS sets fire to sulfur mine,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:08 UTC © Thaier Al-Sudan / Reuters Smoke rises from a sulfur factory after Islamic militants set fire to it releasing toxic smoke over the area at south of Mosul, Iraq, October 21, 2016. A sulfur mine and stockpile set ablaze by Islamic State terrorists has produced a huge toxic residue cloud, along with some apocalyptic scenery. The fire, set near Mosul, was aimed at slowing down Iraqi troops attempting to retake the city. The Al-Mishraq sulfur plant and mine were set on fire last Thursday, Iraqi commander Qusay Hamid Kadhem told AFP. At least two civilians in nearby villages have reportedly been killed from sulfur dioxide exposure, and 1,000 others have been treated for breathing problems. Comment: Mishraq: ISIS torches sulphur plant, 1,000 suffer breathing problems According to scientists, the sulfur dioxide emission is ""significant"" and alarming. The large sulfur dioxide cloud has been spotted by The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura spacecraft and the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) on Suomi NPP. It has been seen spreading cross northern and central Iraq. The sulfur dioxide emission is comparable to what typically takes place during a large volcanic eruption. The same sulfur field was on fire for one month in 2003, with scientists estimating that 21 kilotons of toxic sulfur dioxide were emitted daily during that time period. ""After nearly a month of burning, the 2003 fire had released roughly 600 kilotons of sulfur dioxide - so much that it was the largest non-volcanic release of sulfur dioxide we had ever observed with satellites,"" said Nikolay Krotkov, an atmospheric scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center.",0
1398,"In N.F.L. Betting, Patriots Are Closest to Being a Sure Thing - The New York Times","A lot of different things could happen in the N. F. L. conference championship games on Sunday. But oddsmakers are pretty sure what is likely to happen. The New England Patriots will beat the Pittsburgh Steelers by about 6, and the Atlanta Falcons will defeat the Green Bay Packers by 4 or 5 in a   affair. One of the truisms of gambling is that it is difficult for a team to be a great bet week in and week out. That’s because the more a team wins and covers the spread, the higher its spread will be the next week and the week after that. Eventually, most teams congregate close to . 500 against the spread for the season. That makes this season for the Patriots all the more remarkable. Despite being favored in 15 of 16 games by as many as 17 points, the Patriots finished   against the spread, earning a tidy profit for those who bet them blindly. That was the best record in the league. It seems hard to remember, but in Week 1, the Patriots were   underdogs to an Arizona Cardinals team that had impressed last season. Part of that gap was no doubt attributable to the status of quarterback Tom Brady, who was sitting out the first game of his   suspension for his role in the scandal involving the deflation of footballs. The unheralded backup Jimmy Garoppolo was up to the task, though, and the Patriots won in an “upset” that later events proved wasn’t so much of one. The Cardinals finished   . Favored in every game for the rest of the season, the Patriots won 14 of 16   games and covered the spread in 13 of them. The only time they did not was in Week 12, at the Jets, when the spread was 9½ and they won by 5. The Patriots more than made up for that four weeks later when they faced the Jets at home and were stuck with their biggest spread of the season, 17 points. Bettors reluctant to lay so many points were burned when the Patriots romped to a   win. By the time of the playoffs, the bookmakers were well aware of the Patriots’ tremendous record and posted a huge number, 16 ½, for their game against the Houston Texans. The line seemed somewhat insulting to Houston, which, after all, had won its division and beat the Oakland Raiders in the   round. But the Patriots covered again, winning by 18. Before you mortgage your house to bet on every Patriots game next season, be aware that trends like these seldom last more than a year. Last season’s best team against the spread, the Minnesota Vikings, at   did post a winning record again this season, at  . But the Cincinnati Bengals, who were    in 2015, staggered to a    record against the lines this season. N. F. L. games this season averaged a total of 45. 6 points scored. So the bookmakers’   of 51 on the Patriots game indicates they expect it to be somewhat high scoring. But it should be nothing compared with the   game, which has a whopping   of 61 points. That’s the highest   ever for a playoff game, Bookmaker. eu reports. The previous high was 59. 5, for the     round between the New Orleans Saints and the Detroit Lions. (They scored 73 and went over.) The highest   total came in 2000 between the Rams and the San Francisco 49ers. That total closed at 61. 5, and the teams combined for 58 points, just going under. “Bettors perceive these teams as two of the most potent,   teams in the league, and they witnessed them score 65 points in a Week 8 shootout,” Scott Cooley of Bookmaker. eu said. He also noted that “football rules have changed to enable more scoring. ” He added: “The quarterbacks and pass catchers are protected in a way they weren’t in the past. We are also seeing more pass interference calls with the new rules that cater to the offense. ” Big   totals are often not big enough. OddsShark reports that of the 10 highest totals in history, eight ended up going over. In general, totals for college and N. F. L. games have been creeping up every year as   offenses increasingly dominate. The Falcons led the league in scoring at 33. 8 points per game, and the Packers were fourth at 27. 0. The two teams have gone over in all three of their playoff games this season. If the game ends   regardless of who wins, we’ll have the biggest surprise of the season.",0

In a complete 180, Hillary Clinton is now the Presidential candidate that is talking about a US election that is rigged… courtesy of the FBI . 
It so enjoyable watching the neo-liberal left, Hillary Clinton crime syndicate, scramble to divert attention away from justice finally being carried out against her entire corrupt group of grifters. 
Was it not just a few weeks ago that the Clinton campaign was blasting Trump comments on elections rigging. 
Hello shoe, meet the other foot…Here is Hillary Clinton alluding to an FBI vote rigging operation… 
“It is pretty strange, it’s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information, right before an election.” 
“In fact it’s not just strange, it’s unprecedented and it is deeply troubling.” 
It’s not strange at all. You broke the law multiple times, over multiple instances. 
With all the pay-to-play Clinton Foundation evidence and Libya illegal war funding ISIS activity overseen by “her”, we subscribe to the view held by these baseball fans who held up a large “Hillary for Prison” sign during the World Series Postgame Show.

1400,"I Lived in a 38-Person Co-Op in San Francisco, and so Can You","I Lived in a 38-Person Co-Op in San Francisco, and so Can You The joy and practice of learning to share By Tommy Alexander / thebolditalic.com Community living is blossoming in 21st-century San Francisco. This trend exists at the confluence of diverse historical narratives: the free-love and experimental ethos of the hippie movement, the casual opulence of the city’s Victorian-era homes and the earnest audacity of start-up culture. These are co-ops where programmers and cooks rub shoulders with artists and teachers, where the phrase “love and gratitude” is used as a casual valediction, and where globally minded innovators are working to develop replicable models for urban shared living. I live in a 13-person co-op in a big old house near the apex of Ashbury Street. Up here in the fog between the hills and the sky, we are sharing a fundamental human experience: a sense of belonging and collaborative meaning-making that can be difficult to find in modern urban society. These choices may seem unconventional, but they have enabled us to forge a meaningful, creative and affordable existence amid the hectic, electric bustle of our context. My housemates and I share food, resources and vision. We cook together; we clean together; and we meet regularly to discuss our mutual stake in this community. Some of us work nine-to-five office jobs; some of us work on nights and weekends; and others work primarily from home — so we use Slack, the messaging app, to stay on the same page. We keep records of logistical information on a Google Drive, and we manage our common-pool funds in a shared bank account. We make group decisions using a combination of consensus and do-ocracy . There are jams and sharing circles as well as neighborhood-focused events, potlucks, talks and the occasional party — and we must communicate thoughtfully with each other to make sure that everyone’s needs are met. These choices may seem unconventional, but they have enabled us to forge a meaningful, creative and affordable existence amid the hectic, electric bustle of our context. I’m aware that the concept of communal living carries cultural baggage. When I speak to friends and family who haven’t experienced anything quite like this, they invariably draw comparisons to communes and college dorms. Those are communities, too, but the vast spectrum of human collectivism is far more multifaceted than these few common examples might imply. It is natural to process new phenomena in terms of what we know, but it is also important to understand that each community is a unique collection of individuals. I’ve met a great many bright, passionate and reasonable people who have elected to pool resources with each other, and it looks a little bit different each time. There is no singular “type” of person that benefits most from shared living. Each day, I awoke with a visceral sense of belonging. As for me, I arrived in San Francisco in June of 2015. I had just landed my first full-time writing job out of college. I grew up in hot, flat San Jose in the sprawling, suburban shadow of “the city,” and some yearning part of me had always identified more with the foggy peninsula than the sunny valley. I was coming here alone, and I knew that I wanted to move in with a group of people. I answered a Craigslist ad, filled out an online application and underwent a series of casual phone interviews — and there I was on the doorstep of a 24-person co-op that spanned the lower two floors of a four-story walk-up on the north side of Alamo Square. For the first few weeks, I felt that my social capacity was being worn down to a nub: there were so many new faces; there was so much happening all the time; and I was always a step behind. The people were warm and welcoming, however, and their home became my home. Within the month, the lease was up, and the community disbanded due to a difference in vision between the two cofounders. The members were variously scattered across the city and the East Bay. I joined a wave of 38 people who were moving into a 10-bedroom, four-story Victorian mansion around the block. The founders called it Chateau Ubuntu, for the Bantu word that roughly translates to “I am human because you are human.” On July 1, I found myself sleeping in a bunk bed in a large third-floor master bedroom with five other people, four chandeliers and a fireplace topped by a marble relief of three nude nymphs. I lived in that room for nine months — a gestation — and my experience became a fascinating journey through the building blocks of humanity. I discovered that community is a synecdoche for society, and that any human system is just a web of agreements. I learned what it takes to keep a co-living unit afloat amid the various logistical necessities of city living: the rent, the utilities, the food, the facilities and how to facilitate the needs and wants of 38 unique individuals. I radically challenged my preconceptions about sharing space, time and resources. I fell deeply in love, and I found confidence in my art. Each day, I awoke with a visceral sense of belonging. To the uninitiated, a 38-person community living so densely in a single home often comes across as mad. In the act, however, it felt as though nothing could be more natural. There were deep and frustrating downsides, of course: high membership turnover, too little privacy and some unresolved interpersonal tensions. We were rarely able to wrangle a meaningful consensus, with so many people constantly in and out. Yet the physical closeness, coupled with a culture of radical acceptance, fostered perhaps the most warm and loving community of humans that I have ever experienced. For every serious meeting or disagreement, there was a “cuddle puddle,” a “gratitude circle,” an impromptu jam session or a big shared meal. Eventually, I burned out on the sheer density of Chateau Ubuntu. I needed a smaller and less socially absorptive environment in which to create more intention around my work, my art, my life and my love. I needed space to think. Along with a few friends, my partner and I left Chateau Ubuntu to cofound a new, smaller community: our current home, Chaortica . We remain connected to a colorful coalition of other communities in the greater Haight-Ashbury area and beyond, including Ubuntu and the flagship house of the Embassy Network. We’ve tapped into the Fellowship for Intentional Community , a global directory of shared-living communities that includes communes, eco-villages, co-ops and collectives of all stripes. We don’t have it all figured out, but we are working together and collaborating on our dreams. Indeed, we cannot ever expect this to be perfect. As with any team, relationship or government, an intentional community is a constant practice, not a steady state. Certainly, some of the communities that take root in San Francisco are more ephemeral than others. There are ventures that fold within a year, and there are cooperatives that raise children in their midst. I’ve not encountered a house here that did not experience at least some small occasional turnover, but this does not mean that we are building sand castles. There is such a vast, wild richness to the spectrum of human experience, and each person whom I’ve met has taught me something about myself. When we come together across disparate backgrounds, we inform and expand each other’s humanity. I posit that community living can be just as empowering as living alone but that it is always an exercise in adaptation. It works only with empathy, humility and a mutually assured foundation of healthy, open communication. One might argue that these practices are essential to the future of our species on a crowding , warming planet of 7.4 billion people . Cities are denser and pricier than ever, and we must learn to share — on a personal and civilizational scale — in ways that we have scarcely imagined. I do not mean that we all need to live in co-ops and communes, but I do contend that it is worthwhile for each of us to reconsider how much we can trust one another. I hope that we can all take the principle of collectivism as a nugget in and of itself rather than a subordinate component of gentrification, for collaboration is not a limitation. The solution to density is trust, not fear. Sharing is easier when we parse our wants from our needs. Life is more meaningful together.

1401,This Is How Putin Celebrated Trump’s Election Win,"Several people were victorious after Tuesday’s election – Donald Trump, the Republicans of America, and apparently Vladimir Putin. It appears that the president of Russia is ecstatic to work alongside business mogul turned statesman Mr. Trump. 
Via ViralThread 

It’s well known that American-Russian relations are pretty grim right now. Within the past few months, Russia has practiced nuclear evacuation drills and launched airstrikes on the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo. It seems as if we’re entering a second Cold War, however president-elect Trump is hoping to change all of that.

President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton also hoped to repair the relationship between the two old foes. Sadly however the conflicting ideologies between the Putin and Obama Administrations got in the way. Putin has previously pleaded Obama to come together with Russia. On Independence Day, he claimed: “The history of Russian-American relations shows that when we act as equal partners and respect each other’s lawful interests we are able to successfully resolve the most complex international issues for the benefit of both countries’ peoples and all of humanity.” Try as he might though, Obama hasn’t budged.

Just a few month ago, Obama claimed: “I’m not confident that we can trust the Russians or Vladimir Putin, which is why we have to have to test whether or not we can get an actual cessation of hostilities that includes an end to the kinds of aerial bombing and civilian death and destruction that we have seen carried out by the Assad regime.”
Difficulty surrounding stances on Ukraine and Syria are the main culprits for this distrust. So when Putin learned that he may have another shot at a healthy relationship with America (and Trump), he decided to celebrate.
Putin celebrated Donald Trump’s win in the election with the hope of a stable relationship with America. Trump spoke about repairing the relationship with Russia in his campaign, something Putin took note of. In the clip below, it’s clear that Trump will deal with Putin in a completely different way than Obama.
At a foreign ambassadors meeting in Moscow, Putin expressed his satisfaction with the election, where he congratulated both the American people and president-elect Trump. Putin also told the ambassadors that he was hopeful for future prospects between the two superpowers, America and Russia, especially when it comes to efforts in Syria.

Following his speech, Putin clinked glasses of champagne with the ambassadors in celebration. With the tensions between America and Russia growing at an alarming rate, the world has a watchful eye on what actions Mr. Trump will take when he finally enters the Oval Office.

1404,Break Up the Democratic Party: It’s Time for the Clintons and Rubin to Go – and Soros too. - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
In the week leading up to last Tuesday’s election the press was busy writing obituaries for the Republican Party. This continued even after Donald Trump’s “surprising” victory – which, like the 2008 bank-fraud crash, “nobody could have expected.” The pretense is that Trump saw what no other politician saw: that the economy has not recovered since 2008. 
Democrats still seem amazed that voters are more concerned about economic conditions and resentment against Wall Street (no bankers jailed, few junk mortgages written down). It is a sign of their wrong path that party strategists are holding onto the same identity politics they have used since the 1960s to divide Americans into hyphenated special-interest groups. 
Obviously, the bottom 95 Percent realize that their incomes and net worth have declined, not recovered. National Income and Federal Reserve statistics show that all growth has accrued to just 5 percent of the population. Hillary is said to have spent $1 billion on polling, TV advertising and high-salaried staff members, but managed not to foresee the political reaction to this polarization. She and her coterie ignored economic policy as soon as Bernie was shoved out of the way and his followers all but told to join a third party. Her campaign speech tried to convince voters that they were better off than they were eight years ago. They knew better! 
So the question now is whether Donald Trump will really a maverick and shake up the Republican Party. There seems to be a fight going on for Donald’s soul – or at least the personnel he appoints to his cabinet. Thursday and Friday saw corporate lobbyists in the Republican leadership love-bombing him like the Moonies or Hari Krishna cults welcoming a new potential recruit. Will he simply surrender now and pass on the real work of government to the Republican apparatchiks? 
The stock market thinks so! On Wednesday it soared almost by 300 points, and repeated this gain on Thursday, setting a DJIA record! Pharmaceuticals are way up, as higher drug prices loom for Medicaid and Medicare. Stocks of the pipelines and major environmental polluters are soaring, from oil and gas to coal, mining and forestry, expecting U.S. environmental leadership to be as dead under Trump as it was under Obama and his push for the TPP and TTIP (with its fines for any government daring to impose standards that cost these companies money). On the bright side, these “trade” agreements to enable corporations to block public laws protecting the environment, consumers and society at large are now presumably dead. 
For now, personalities are policy. A problem with this is that anyone who runs for president is in it partly for applause. That was Carter’s weak point, leading him to cave into Democratic apparatchiks in 1974. It looks like Trump may be a similar susceptibility. He wants to be loved, and the Republican lobbyists are offering plenty of applause if only he will turn to them and break his campaign promises in the way that Obama did in 2008. It would undo his hope to be a great president and champion of the working class that was his image leading up to November 8. 
The fight for the Democratic Party’s future (dare I say “soul”?) 
In her Wednesday morning post mortem speech, Hillary made a bizarre request for young people (especially young women) to become politically active as Democrats after her own model. What made this so strange is that the Democratic National Committee has done everything it can to discourage millennials from running. There are few young candidates – except for corporate and Wall Street Republicans running as Blue Dog Democrats. The left has not been welcome in the party for a decade – unless it confines itself only to rhetoric and demagogy, not actual content. For Hillary’s DNC coterie the problem with millennials is that they are not shills for Wall Street. The treatment of Bernie Sanders is exemplary. The DNC threw down the gauntlet. 
Instead of a love fest within the Democratic Party’s ranks, the blame game is burning. The Democrats raised a reported $182 million dollars running up to the election. But when from Russ Feingold in Wisconsin and other candidates in Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania asked for help. Hillary monopolized it all for TV ads, leaving these candidates in the lurch. The election seemed to be all about her, about personality and identity politics, not about the economic issues paramount in most voters’ minds. 
Six months ago the polls showed her $1 billion spent on data polling, TV ads and immense staff of sycophants to have been a vast exercise in GIGO. From May to June the Democratic National Committee (DNC) saw polls showing Bernie Sanders beating Trump, but Hillary losing. Did the Democratic leadership really prefer to lose with Hillary than win behind him and his social democratic reformers. 
Hillary doesn’t learn. Over the weekend she claimed that her analysis showed that FBI director Comey’s reports “rais[ing] doubts that were groundless, baseless,” stopped her momentum. This was on a par with the New York Times analysis that had showed her with an 84 percent probability of winning last Tuesday. She still hasn’t admitted that here analysis was inaccurate. 
What is the Democratic Party’s former constituency of labor and progressive reformers to do? Are they to stand by and let the party be captured in Hillary’s wake by Robert Rubin’s Goldman Sachs-Citigroup gang that backed her and Obama? 
If the party is to be recaptured, now is the moment to move. The 2016 election sounded the death knell for the identity politics. Its aim was to persuade voters not to think of their identity in economic terms, but to think of themselves as women or as racial and ethnic groups first and foremost, not as having common economic interests. This strategy to distract voters from economic policies has obviously failed. 
It did not work with women. In Florida, only 51 percent of white women are estimated to have voted for Hillary. It didn’t even work very well in ethnic Hispanic precincts. They too were more concerned about their own job opportunities. 
The ethnic card did work with the blacks (although not so strongly; fewer blacks voted for Hillary than had showed up for Obama). Under the Obama administration for the past eight years, blacks have done worse in terms of income and net worth than any other grouping, according to the Federal Reserve Board’s statistics. But black voters were distracted from their economic interests by the Democrats’ ethnic-identity politics. 
This election showed that voters have a sense of when they’re being lied to. After eight years of Obama’s demagogy, pretending to support the people but delivering his constituency to his financial backers on Wall Street. “Identity politics” has given way to the stronger force of economic distress. Mobilizing identity politics behind a Wall Street program will no longer work. 
If we are indeed experiencing a revival of economic class consciousness, who should lead the fight to clean up the Democratic Party Wall Street leadership? Will it be the Wall Street wing, or can Bernie and perhaps Elizabeth Warren make their move? 
There is only one way to rescue the Democrats from the Clintons and Rubin’s gang. That is to save the Democratic Party from being tarred irreversibly as the party of Wall Street and neocon brinkmanship. It is necessary to tell the Clintons and the Rubin gang from Wall Street to leave now . And take Evan Bayh with them. 
The danger of not taking this opportunity to clean out the party now 
The Democratic Party can save itself only by focusing on economic issues – in a way that reverses its neoliberal stance under Obama, and indeed going back to Bill Clinton’s pro-Wall Street administration. The Democrats need to do what Britain’s Labour Party did by cleaning out Tony Blair’s Thatcherites. As Paul Craig Roberts wrote over the weekend: “Change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.” [1] Otherwise the Democrats will be left as an empty shell. 
Now is the time for Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and the few other progressives who have not been kept out of office by the DNC to make their move and appointing their own nominees to the DNC. If they fail, the Democratic Party is dead. 
An indication of how hard the present Democratic Party leadership will fight against this change of allegiance is reflected in their long fight against Bernie Sanders and other progressives going back to Dennis Kucinich. The past five days of MoveOn demonstrations sponsored by Hillary’s backer George Soros may be an attempt to preempt the expected push by Bernie’s supporters, by backing Howard Dean for head of the DNC while organizing groups to be called on for what may be an American “Maidan Spring.” 
Perhaps some leading Democrats preferred to lose with their Wall Street candidate Hillary than win with a reformer who would have edged them out of their right-wing positions. But the main problem was hubris. Hillary’s coterie thought they could make their own reality. They believed that hundreds of millions of dollars of TV and other advertising could sway voters. But eight years of Obama’s rescue of Wall Street instead of the economy was enough for most voters to see how deceptive his promises had been. And they distrusted Hillary’s pretended embrace of Bernie’s opposition to TPP. 
The Rust Belt swing states that shifted away from backing Obama for the last two terms are not racist states. They voted for Obama twice, after all. But seeing his support Wall Street, they had lost faith in her credibility – and were won by Bernie in his primaries against Hillary. 
Donald Trump is thus Obama’s legacy. Last week’s vote was a backlash. Hillary thought that getting Barack and Michelle Obama to campaign as her surrogates would help, but it turned out to be the kiss of death. Obama egged her on by urging voters to “save his legacy” by supporting her as his Third Term. But voters did not want his legacy of giveaways to the banks, the pharmaceutical and health-insurance monopolies. 
Most of all, it was Hillary’s asking voters to ignore her economic loyalty to Wall Street simply to elect a woman, and her McCarthy-like accusations that Trump was “Putin’s candidate” (duly echoed by Paul Krugman). On Wednesday, Obama’s former Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul tweeted that “Putin intervened in our elections and succeeded.” It was as if the Republicans and even the FBI were a kind of fifth column for the KGB. Her receptiveness to cutting back Social Security and steering wage withholding into the stock market did not help – especially her hedge fund campaign contributors. Compulsory health-insurance fees continue to rise for healthy young people rise as the main profit center that Obamacare has offered the health-insurance monopoly. 
The anti-Trump rallies mobilized by George Soros and MoveOn look like a preemptive attempt to capture the potential socialist left for the old Clinton divide-and-conquer strategy. The group was defeated five years ago when it tried to capture Occupy Wall Street to make it part of the Democratic Party. It’s attempt to make a comeback right now should be heard as an urgent call to Bernie’s supporters and other “real” Democrats that they need to create an alternative pretty quickly so as not to let “socialism” be captured by the Soros and his apparatchiks carried over from the Clinton campaign.

1405,USA Election,"Leave a reply 
Djwhal Khul here. Tashi Delek. 
Alright. This week has quite a few different influences astrologically and then of course the elections in the United States of America. So we have quite a few things sort of bouncing around. If I were to look at it just energetically, it goes up, down, up, down, up, down. 
So there is quite a bit happening and everything begins to calm down for the end of November 7 a little bit but then on November 8 , it actually calms out quite a bit. 
So what happens between now and the final outcome will be the Will Of The People and literally, again from a spiritual perspective, it is decided by all of Humanity. It is not just an election in a local spot. 
So the mass consciousness plays a role in determining how the future will play out in all areas of life. So the focus for this week is peace, no matter whom shall become the holder of any office anywhere that the focus shall be for Peace. That Peace is first and foremost. So keep Peace in your prayers. Try to live from a peaceful center. Sing your Oms or whatever else you want to put vibrationally in the ethers, maybe songs about Joy and Peace and Love and we’ll see what happens next. 
Alright Dear Ones. As always, thank you and my love to you.

1406,Carrie Fisher Put Pen and Voice in Service of ‘Bipolar Pride’ - The New York Times,"She was all there, all the time: exuberant in describing her mania, savage and tender when recalling her despair. And for decades, she gracefully wore the legacy of her legendary role as Princess Leia, worshiped by a generation of teenage girls as the lone female warrior amid the galactic male cast of the “Star Wars” trilogy. In her long, openhearted life, the actress and author Carrie Fisher brought the subject of bipolar disorder into the popular culture with such humor and   detail that her death on Tuesday triggered a wave of affection on social media and elsewhere, from both fans and fellow bipolar travelers, whose emotional language she knew and enriched. She channeled the spirit of people like Patty Duke, who wrote about her own bipolar illness, and Kitty Dukakis, who wrote about depression and alcoholism, and turned it into performance art. Ms. Fisher’s career coincided with the growing interest in bipolar disorder itself, a mood disorder characterized by alternating highs and lows, paralyzing depressions punctuated by flights of exuberant energy. Her success fed a longstanding debate on the relationship between mental turmoil and creativity. And her writing and speaking helped usher in a confessional era in which mental disorders have entered the pop culture with a life of their own: Bipolar is now a prominent trait of another famous Carrie, Claire Danes’s character Carrie Mathison in the Showtime television series “Homeland. ” “She was so important to the public because she was telling the truth about bipolar disorder, not putting on airs or pontificating, just sharing who she is in an     way,” said Judith Schlesinger, a psychologist and author of “The Insanity Hoax: Exposing the Myth of the Mad Genius. ” In a characteristic riff, answering a question about the disorder from the audience at the Indiana    last year, Ms. Fisher said: “It is a kind of virus of the brain that makes you go very fast or very sad. Or both. Those are fun days. So judgment isn’t, like, one of my big good things. But I have a good voice. I can write well. I’m not a good bicycle rider. So, just like anybody else, only louder and faster and sleeps more. ” She then grabbed the mike and sang, in   voice, “Oh manic depression   …     oh how I love you. ” That last line is a reminder too, that in Ms. Fisher’s lifetime, even the name of the condition had evolved, to bipolar from what was once more commonly known as manic depression. Ms. Fisher has said that she was first given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at age 24 but did not accept it until five years later. In time, she spoke often about her lifelong struggles with both addiction and bipolar disorder and her desire to erase the stigma of mental illness. She wrote her 1987 novel, “Postcards From the Edge,” after a stint in rehab after a   drug overdose. It was during her autobiographical   stage show, “Wishful Drinking,” that she first posited the idea for “Bipolar Pride Day. ” Like the disorder itself, the wave of attention that occurred during Ms. Fisher’s life had its excesses. Through the 1990s, research scientists  —   many of them supported by drugmakers  —   expanded the definition of the disorder, describing “ ” and permutations like bipolar II and “hypomania. ” By the 2000s, doctors were diagnosing the condition in groups of people who had never been identified before, mostly young children  —   leading to thousands of children being unnecessarily treated with strong psychiatric drugs. In recent years, that overheated enthusiasm has finally begun to run its course. “I remember being at a psychiatric association event where Carrie Fisher was interviewed, and people were beginning to talk about the imperialism of bipolar,” how the diagnosis was expanding beyond its bounds, said David Miklowitz, a professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. He added, “I think doctors are much more careful now, in being sure they’re diagnosing the real thing. ” The American Psychiatric Association’s latest diagnostic manual discourages applying the label to young children. Ms. Fisher’s vivid prose, wicked humor and striking performances inevitably led many people, including herself, to wonder whether bipolar mania fuels creativity. “My experience is that it does spur creativity and insights and the ability to express connections you see but could not otherwise express,” said Terri Cheney, author of the   memoir “Manic. ” “But normalcy is so much preferable, being able to remember what I did  —   I tend to forget manic episodes. ” Scientists, scholars and writers have speculated for years about the connection between madness, and in particular mania, and artistic wizardry. The painters Edvard Munch and Vincent van Gogh, among many others, have been posthumously diagnosed with bipolar disorder. “There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness and terror involved in this kind of madness,” wrote the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison, a prominent proponent of this connection. “When you’re high, it’s tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. ” But the debate remains contentious, and given the vagueness of so many diagnoses, not to mention the devastating effect of depression or psychosis on discipline and concentration, it is unlikely to be settled anytime soon. “The case has really been built on sand,” Dr. Schlesinger said. “It’s been oversold. ” She added, “Every course of bipolar is different, there is no one progression, no one symptomology, no one cure, so the effects are very individual. ” All the more reason that one particularly outspoken, charismatic and large personality could project so much toughness and vulnerability at the same time. Ms. Fisher learned to live a public life at a very early age, as the child of celebrities and with her early stardom. In an interview with CBS this year, she said she liked being Princess Leia, understanding that “it’s a great role for women. ” But, she added: “I’m not really one of those actresses like Meryl Streep. Those actresses travel outside themselves and play characters. And I’m more of an archaeologist. I play what I am. ” Ms. Fisher’s advocacy, visibility and public   was made for the era of online  . For good and bad, in part because of Ms. Fisher’s example, the language of bipolar and mental disorders has swept into the shared popular culture, seeding online support groups, punctuating texted exchanges  —   “so OCD”  —   and becoming featured in dimensions of movies and TV shows like “Monk” and “Homeland. ” Paul Cumming, a longtime advocate in San Diego who works for a company that helps people with mental disorders find housing, said, “The power of celebrity was best shown by Carrie that by being public, and funny, she demystified our diagnosis and showed by example we can live well and thrive. ”",0
1407,‘Pro-Life’ Sen. Joe Manchin Poses in Support of Planned Parenthood,"Sen. Joe Manchin  —   who has claimed in the past to be    —   appears now to be supporting abortion industry giant Planned Parenthood. [Thank you for standing with Planned Parenthood, @Sen_JoeManchin! #StandWithPP pic. twitter.   —   PP South Atlantic WV (@PPSATWV) April 19, 2017,   The West Virginia Democrat appeared in a photo, tweeted by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic West Virginia, standing behind a poster that states, “I stand with Planned Parenthood. ” The tweet immediately drew the ire of national   leaders who in the past have counted Manchin among members of Congress who support the rights of the unborn. “Sen. Manchin used to call himself   but this is the last straw,” said Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, adding that her organization “will work tirelessly in the months ahead to make sure West Virginians know of this profound betrayal of the unborn and their mothers. ” The national director of Priests for Life, Father Frank Pavone, also reacted, telling Breitbart News: “Would that Sen. Manchin spoke plainly about what ‘standing by Planned Parenthood’ means! Instead of following the bad example of his Democratic colleagues, who want to support abortion without talking about abortion, Sen. Manchin should stay on the   path and tell his constituents what Planned Parenthood actually does and doesn’t do. ” Pavone added that his organization’s StopAbortionNow. org campaign would inform West Virginians of Manchin’s change in position. “West Virginians supported President Trump last November and will face a choice next year as to whether to   Sen. Manchin,” Pavone continued. “We have already communicated through Priests for Life to all the churches of West Virginia that Planned Parenthood needs to be defunded and that they need to let Sen. Manchin know where they stand on this before they make their voting decisions in the midterm elections. ” As a candidate for the presidency, Republican Donald Trump outlined four policy commitments in a letter to   leaders: As the Charleston   reported, Manchin has raised about $235, 000 for his 2018   campaign in the first quarter of the year, but only $7, 900 is derived from sources within his home state. “Sen. Joe Manchin,  . Va. has received more money from individual donors in Texas ($95, 600) Washington D. C. ($33, 000) New York ($32, 300) Massachusetts ($22, 500) Virginia ($19, 700) Maryland ($10, 700) and Connecticut ($10, 400) than West Virginia,” states the report. Dannenfelser observed that Planned Parenthood is “the nation’s largest abortion business. ” “It is an enormous mistake both morally and politically for Sen. Manchin to side with Planned Parenthood,” she added, continuing, “In more than nine times out of ten, Planned Parenthood resolves pregnancy with abortion. They are clearly an     business  —   yet taxpayers are forced to fork over nearly $554 million each year to their coffers. Where does Sen. Manchin stand on this injustice? Last month, he voted to force states to fund the abortion giant through Title X grants. That was only a day after new footage was released showing a former Planned Parenthood abortionist describe the force needed to dismember a    unborn child struggling to survive in the womb. ” Planned Parenthood performs at least 300, 000 abortions every year. The group has been using political muscle to bolster its image in the wake of videos released that led to allegations it sells the body parts of aborted babies for a profit. The allegations led to multiple congressional investigations. Ultimately, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Select Investigative Panel have referred Planned Parenthood Federation of America, several of the largest Planned Parenthood affiliates in the country, and three of their business associates in the fetal tissue procurement industry, to the FBI and U. S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. “The Democratic Party is, no doubt, putting pressure here on a senator who has in many instances been an exception to the rule and has taken   positions,” Pavone said. “I urge him to resist this pressure, to be honest with himself and his constituents,” he added, “and to let the people of West Virginia know the facts about Planned Parenthood so that they, in turn, can let him know whether they think he should support this criminal,   enterprise, which is more a political machine than a health organization. ” A recent Marist poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 40 percent of those who say they are “ ” and 41 percent of Democrats.",0
1408,NY Attorney General Will File Lawsuit to Protect Abortion if AHCA Passes Senate - Breitbart,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Friday that he would file a lawsuit against the American Health Care Act to protect abortion rights. [“I hope the Senate will stop it, it’s bad public policy,” Schneiderman said in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. “It doesn’t protect people with   conditions it’ll cost millions of people healthcare. ”  “But, if they pass the bill in the form the House passed it,” he said, “it is unconstitutional. It includes an unconstitutional attack on women’s rights to reproductive health services, including abortion. ” Schneiderman called the AHCA “bad public policy” and “unconstitutional” in its current state after the House passed it Thursday. “In a tricky way, [it] tries to wipe out Planned Parenthood,” he said. “It’s an effort to kill off Planned Parenthood, which would impose an undue burden on women’s   rights. ” “We are beseeching the Senate to make sure this never becomes the law of the land,” Schneiderman added. Several Republican Senators warned that they would not pass the AHCA in its current state and would instead write their own bill. “We cannot pull the rug out from under states like Nevada that expanded Medicaid, and we need assurances that people with   conditions will be protected,” Sen. Dean Heller ( ) said in a statement. President Trump, however, says he is “so confident” that the Senate will pass the AHCA even before the Congressional Budget Office releases their analysis estimating the law’s cost and impact on the nation.",0
1409,Hate Hoax: Black Teen Arrested for Posting Fake KKK Threats - Breitbart,"Officials at a Maryland high school were alarmed when   students began to receive threats on social media apparently from a member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). But now, police are saying the threats came from another black student at the school. [Students were frightened after receiving a tweet from what appeared to be a KKK Twitter account from a user named “KoolkidsKlanKkk” that warned, “We’re planning to attack tomorrow. ”  Arundel High School officials reported the tweets to the Anne Arundel County Police Department and also noted that the language of the tweet was reminiscent of language used on a racial petition signed by “Kool Kids Klan” that had previously been passed around the school. Police computer teams reportedly tracked the account to a      student at the school. The girl was apprehended and slapped with a juvenile citation for disruption of school activities. She was then released into her parents’ custody, according to CBS Baltimore. After the initial fright, parents expressed gratitude to authorities for identifying the threat so quickly. Anne Arundel County Public Schools Superintendent George Arlotto released a statement after the arrest: I want to thank Police Chief Tim Altomare, State’s Attorney Wes Adams, County Executive Steve Schuh, and their staffs for their thorough and expeditious work to identify a suspect in the online post that threatened violence at Arundel High School this week. The anonymity of the internet provides a murky and complex disguise for many who want to threaten the safety and security of our communities. Our partners in the Police Department and county government peeled back that disguise quickly in this case, in the process reassuring parents, students, and staff that our schools are safe places in which to educate our children. After the incident was settled, school officials said they discussed a social media policy but decided not to make any changes or announce any new ideas just yet. “Our teenagers in our society  …     live on electronic devices,” School system spokesman Bob Mosier said. “That electronic device use has many, many, many positive ramifications to it. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0

1411,Truth Is The Enemy Of The State      :," Truth Is The Enemy Of The State By Bob Livingston
November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" Personal Liberty "" - There is a saw that comes from Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice that the truth will out. But not if government has its way.
Thats because truth is the enemy of the state. The state, meaning the apparatus of government, is the system that controls the American people.
Most people believe they control the political system through elections. Little do they know that the government and the corporate state own and control the state and the people. In other words, the system is rigged, as Donald Trump says . The system must keep this information invisible and it does so through constant conditioning of the public mind.
Now consider what has happened and is happening to Julian Assange. Consider Edward Snowden.
Assange created WikiLeaks in 2006, exposing, among other things, malfeasance in the conduct of Bush the Lessers War on Terror. Progressive Democrats loved Assange then.
But by 2010, with George W. Bush out of power and Barack Obama continuing old wars and starting new ones, the truths that were being outed by WikiLeaks were hitting too close to home. WikiLeaks got its hands on a treasure trove of State Department and Pentagon emails and documents being dispatched across the globe.
I wrote at the time in  A war on the truth , that what WikiLeaks was revealing was:
the result of a secretive, unaccountable and over-powerful government; a perfidious empire that seeks to rule the world by guile, cunning or force, if necessary. And the response by the United States government and by authorities in some of the U.S.s puppet states  like Great Britain, which arrested Assange, and Sweden, which brought spurious charges of rape against him  demonstrate the length the ruling elites will go to suppress the truth.
Truth is the enemy of a totalitarian regime. Fooling, lying, spying: That is the way of the totalitarian regime. Fooling, lying to and spying on friends and enemies, and even worse, its own citizens.
Just before I wrote that, we now know, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was contemplating various ways to shut WikiLeaks down. During a November meeting, sources say, Clinton suddenly blurted out, Cant we just drone this guy?
According to sources present at the meeting:
The statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, walking around freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States. Clinton was upset about Assanges previous 2010 records releases, divulging secret U.S. documents about the war in Afghanistan in July and the war in Iraq just a month earlier in October, sources said. At that time in 2010, Assange was relatively free and not living cloistered in in the embassy of Ecuador in London. Prior to 2010, Assange focused Wikileaks efforts on countries outside the United States but now under Clinton and Obama, Assange was hammering America with an unparalleled third sweeping Wikileaks document dump in five months. Clinton was fuming, sources said, as each State Department cable dispatched during the Obama administration was signed by her.
Clinton and other top administration officials knew the compromising materials warehoused in the CableGate stash would provide critics and foreign enemies with a treasure trove of counterintelligence. Bureaucratic fears about the CableGate release ultimately proved to be well founded by Clinton, her inner circle and her boss in the White House.
Efforts to shut down WikiLeaks included an American intelligence-initiated operation to entrap Assange in a phony rape charge. The U.S. government also pressured PayPal, VISA and MasterCard to shut down donations to WikiLeaks. The Swedish bank handling Assanges legal defense fund was pressured by the U.S. government to freeze the account. The firm hosting WikiLeaks website was pressured to shut the site the down.
Now WikiLeaks is revealing widespread corruption, vote rigging, media manipulation and other damning evidence against the Democrat Party, Hillary Clinton and her minions. WikiLeaks and Assange are prying the lid off the propaganda machine and exposing the corrupt system.
In response, U.S. intelligence (an oxymoron) initiated another effort to entrap Assange in a sex-related scandal; this time by connecting him with a phony dating site and alleging he solicited sex with an 8-year-old girl.
John Kerrys State Department pressured Ecuador to cut off Assanges internet connection. There is a new move afoot to figure a way to pry him out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and turn him over to U.S. authorities, where he will no doubt disappear into the bowels of indefinite detention.
Only the power of propaganda keeps the people from overthrowing the U.S. government by force. So truth is the enemy of the state and the state will do everything it can to suppress it.
Thats not surprising. What is surprising is the vast number of people on both sides of the political spectrum outside of government who see truth seekers and truth disseminators like Assange, Snowden and Bradley Manning as enemies rather than friends of liberty.",0
1412,Many Americans still trying to decide on shiniest turd,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Lucas Wilde Many Americans still trying to decide on shiniest turd 
Millions of American voters are still stuck as to which piece of shit they should plump for. 
America usually has a nationwide election of some kind every four years but, instead, this year marks the first ever Shiny Turd Competition. 
“I just can’t decide,” said American fence-sitter, Simon Williams. 
“One of the turds has an okayish record in public office but did some fairly dodgy stuff regarding emails, and the other turd represents the frustrations of the people but is also in the habit of wiping itself on women. 
“I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place or, more literally, one turd and another turd.” 
Fellow voter, Elizabeth King, said, “I’m concerned about the effect that each turd will have on America’s relationship with Russia. 
“One of the turds wants to essentially merge with Russia’s shiniest turd in order to make some kind of mega-bastard-turd, and the other turd wants to put on some kind of firework display where it and Russia essentially fight each other until they blow up the earth.

1414,"Donald Trump, Matteo Renzi, Shinzo Abe: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times","Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • Tensions between China and Donald J. Trump are escalating even before the   takes office. A   editorial in the overseas edition of People’s Daily, the official organ of the Communist Party of China, denounced Mr. Trump for speaking with Taiwan’s president, while Mr. Trump posted messages on Twitter that stepped up pressure on Beijing. The Taiwanese appear to be cautiously embracing his attention. _____ • Mr. Trump is meeting with a broadened range of candidates for secretary of state, including a former ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman. Top NATO officials begin two days of meetings today in Brussels, their last before Mr. Trump, who has expressed ambivalence about the organization, takes office. Mr. Trump added a former rival to his Cabinet, naming the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, above, to oversee efforts to lift American cities. Here’s the latest on the transition, including former Vice President Al Gore’s meeting with Mr. Trump and an effort by hundreds of scientists to persuade Mr. Trump that   climate change is real. _____ • “We must never repeat the horror of war. ” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s announcement that he will visit Pearl Harbor, the Hawaiian naval base Japan attacked in World War II, effectively reciprocates President Obama’s May trip to the Japanese city of Hiroshima, where the U. S. dropped a nuclear bomb to end the war.  Ashton Carter, the U. S. defense secretary, is in Japan to meet with Defense Minister Tomomi Inada and Mr. Abe. _____ • Rebels who have lost much of their grip in the Syrian city of Aleppo must withdraw completely or be killed as “terrorists,” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said. He also said that the American secretary of state, John Kerry, had already submitted a proposal for the routes and timing of the fighters’ departure, and that Russia and the United States would opens talks in Geneva almost immediately. _____ •   movements across Europe are among the winners after a constitutional referendum in Italy failed and the country’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, resigned. Britain’s Supreme Court began what is expected to be four days of hearings on the government’s efforts to retain a free hand in organizing the exit from the European Union. The verdict is expected later in January. • Europe’s political disruptions have created new potential for volatility, but in the short term markets are up. Oil rose to its highest level since July 2015, and the Dow Jones industrial average reached a record high. • Masayoshi Son, the    Japanese investor who bought Sprint in 2013, has made two ambitious moves in a bid to make his  SoftBank Group the future’s most important technology business. • Shares in Duet Group rose on news of an offer of about $5. 4 billion from Li   the Hong Kong billionaire whose proposed deals in Australia have raised concerns about foreign investors. • Uber is getting serious about artificial intelligence, acquiring Geometric Intelligence, an A. I. company, and launching an   lab for A. I. research. The   company wants a hand in how the computers behind   vehicles think and make decisions on the road. • Japan will release October wage data, seen as crucial in judging the progress of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic programs. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Thousands mourned in India after J Jayalalitha, the influential chief minister of southern Tamil Nadu state, died after suffering a heart attack on Sunday night.

The business of offering quick cash for personal items has been criticized for exploiting the poor. But some say the spheres that hang outside pawn shops are meant to symbolize St. Nick’s generosity, evoking the bags of gold he is said to have used to save three sisters from being sold into slavery. Another theory is that the spheres originated with the Medicis, the powerful Italian bankers who sponsored artists during the Renaissance. Golden circles appear on their family crest. That may explain how New York City’s power brokers came to admire St. Nick. “The religion the world wants today,” a guest at a banquet devoted to the saint said in 1900, “is a religion like that of St. Nicholas, that lays the hands of brotherly love upon the crying needs of our helpless brethren. ” Kenneth R.

1415,"The Corruption of Bill Clinton, Inc.","Aide lays out how the former president raked in tens of millions of dollars through a series of deals while Hillary was Secretary of State in a memo unearthed by Wikileaks By Khaleda Rahman Daily Mail October 28, 2016 The latest hacked email released by WikiLeaks details how one of Bill Clinton’s closest aides helped rake in tens of millions for the former president while his wife was serving as Secretary of State. The 12-page memo was sent by Clinton’s former aide Doug Band in 2011 to him, his daughter Chelsea, several board members of the Clinton Foundation and its lawyers as well as it’s then special advisor John Podesta. Published on Wednesday by Wikileaks, after a hack of thousands of emails from Podesta’s account, it details how Band helped run what he called ‘Bill Clinton Inc.’ Band and another aide helped secure $66million from ventures, including speaking fees, according to the memo. 
He wrote that using his role as the president of his own consulting firm Teneo, Band worked to raise funds for the Foundation and Clinton personally. Band also wrote that he helped obtain ‘in-kind services for the President and his family – for personal, travel, hospital, vacation and the like.’ ‘Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo to support and raise funds for the Foundation,’ Band wrote. ‘This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally.’ Under a section called ‘For-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e. Bill Clinton, Inc)’ Brand said he and another aide, Justin Cooper brought Clinton all four of his advisory arrangements at the time. These yielded more than $30million in personal income – with a further $66million to be paid out over the next nine years should he continue with them. One of these roles was serving as honorary Chairman of Laureate International Universities, a chain of for-profit colleges, which paid Clinton $3.5million a year from 2010 until 2015 when the contract ended and his wife started her run for president. Band also mentioned that neither he nor Cooper was compensated for the work. They were not paid a fee or percentage of the income, but only received their Foundation salaries. Band also said that Teneo was responsible for negotiating a number of speaking fees for Clinton, including $1.15million from Ericson and $900,000 from UBS.",0
1416,New Photos Cast Doubt on China’s Vow Not to Militarize Disputed Islands - The New York Times,"When President Xi Jinping of China visited President Obama at the White House last September, he startled many with reassuring words about his intentions for the Spratly Islands, a contested area where the Chinese government has been piling dredged sand and concrete atop reefs for the past few years and building housing and runways on them. “China does not intend to pursue militarization,” Mr. Xi said, referring to the area as the Nansha Islands, a Chinese name for what most of the rest of the world calls the Spratlys in the South China Sea. The most recent satellite photographs suggest a different plan. The photos, collected and scrutinized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a   research organization, show the construction of what appear to be reinforced aircraft hangars at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, all part of the disputed territories. There were no military aircraft seen at the time the photos were taken. But a summary of the center’s analysis suggests that the hangars on all three islets have room for “any   in the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. ” A larger type of hangar on the islets can accommodate China’s   bomber and   refueling tanker, a   transport aircraft and a KJ200 Airborne Warning and Control System plane, the center said in its analysis. While China may assert that the structures are for civilian aircraft or other nonmilitary functions, the center says its satellite photos strongly suggest otherwise. Besides their size  —   the smallest hangars are 60 to 70 feet wide, more than enough to accommodate China’s largest fighter jets  —   all show signs of structural strengthening. “They are far thicker than you would build for any civilian purpose,” Gregory B. Poling, director of the center’s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said on Monday in a telephone interview. “They’re reinforced to take a strike. ” The largest hangars, 200 feet wide, are “more than enough for strategic bombers and refuelers,” Mr. Poling said. If those planes were deployed, they would greatly complicate China’s disputes with the Philippines and other nations, and add a level of military risk to the United States’s “freedom of navigation” patrols through the area. Even before the hangars appeared, it was clear to independent military analysts that China’s intention was to use the islands to flex military might in the area. “We knew from the day they started building those runways,” Mr. Poling said. For China to assert a more benign purpose, he said, would be “like saying you’re building a mansion, but only living on the first floor. ” Evidence of the military hangars emerged a month after an international tribunal at The Hague sharply rebuked China over its behavior in the South China Sea, including its assertion of expansive sovereignty and construction of artificial islands. The tribunal’s ruling was a response to a landmark case brought by the Philippines, which called it an “overwhelming victory. ” Infuriated, China said it would ignore the ruling. Some analysts cautioned that the hangars were not a response to the ruling and had likely been under construction for some time. “The foundations may have been laid months ago,” said M. Taylor Fravel, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of its Security Studies Program. Mr. Fravel said the hangars are not necessarily inconsistent with the Chinese president’s assertions. “China has given itself the option to use these reefs as military facilities, but has not decided yet to what degree it is going to use them,” he said. “It creates the option for a robust defense of those places or even a power projection. ”",0

1418,Yes! Foods may fight acne - The New York Times,"This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life’s opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. Acne can be an embarrassing problem that seemingly no amount of expensive creams and ointments can resolve. But research suggests that in some cases, what you put in your mouth may be as important as what you put on your skin. “I’ve had a lot of patients who get their acne under control just by changing their diet,” said Dr. Daniel J. Aires, a researcher and dermatologist at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City. Dr. Aires said that over the years there have been many studies on the link between various foods and acne, and the strongest evidence can be summarized in three takeaways: ■ Avoid sugary and starchy foods that have a high glycemic index, meaning they cause blood sugar levels to rise rapidly. ■ If you eat dairy products, avoid   dairy varieties. ■ Eat plenty of very colorful plants and produce. Some of the most compelling evidence comes from research looking at the relationship between acne and high glycemic foods like sugar, white bread, white rice, pasta and other simple carbohydrates. Highly processed and refined carbohydrates tend to have little or no fiber and generally cause blood sugar levels to spike. (Related: How to form healthy habits in your 20s) Dr. Aires pointed to a study published in July in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that found that diets containing a lot of high glycemic foods were strongly linked to acne. Some small clinical trials have found that cutting back on these foods can help to reduce acne lesions in teenagers and young adults. Scientists aren’t sure why, but one reason may be that high glycemic foods not only cause blood sugar levels to rise but also prompt the release of various hormones, such as insulin,   and growth hormone, which can exacerbate acne. Other research has pointed to a link between dairy products and acne development. But multiple studies have found that it is   dairy in particular that causes problems. Dr. Aires said the underlying reason might also be hormones. “Milk has a lot of growth factors in it which, in general, may be promoting acne,” he said. “My guess is that those get more concentrated when you take out the fat. ” He tells his patients who eat dairy products to avoid the   options. “If you’re going to eat cheese, eat the regular cheese,” he said. Finally, Dr. Aires, who is also the director of the dermatology division at the University of Kansas Medical Center, also recommends that people eat foods with high levels of polyphenols, which are plant compounds that help to lower inflammation. Polyphenols tend to be found in deeply colored foods like berries, green tea,   olive oil, herbs, dark chocolate, green vegetables and red wine. So in summary, eat a diet full of real, whole foods without too much sugar or refined carbohydrates  —   and eat plenty of plants and vegetables, Dr. Aires said. “Lots and lots of vegetables,” he added.

1419,Trump Says He Did Not Ask Comey to Back Down on Investigating Flynn - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump on Thursday said he did not ask former FBI Director James Comey to back down on investigating   Security Adviser Michael Flynn. [“No. No. Next question,” he said at a joint White House press conference, in response to reports that said Comey wrote a memo alleging that he did.  In his first press conference since he fired Comey, Trump defended his decision to do so, saying he thought it would actually draw bipartisan praise.  “When I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision. Because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side, not only the Republican side, that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey,” he said.  Democrats had slammed Comey’s “poor” handling of the Clinton email investigation as recently as this month, but then later decried his firing as an attempt to stymie the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the elections and any collusion with Trump’s campaign.  Trump said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had recommended Comey’s firing due to his “very poor” performance at a Senate hearing earlier this month.  “That was a poor, poor performance,” Trump said. “So poor, in fact, that I believe  …    that’s why the deputy attorney general went out and wrote his very, very strong letter. ” He referenced Comey’s misstatement that Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin had forwarded “hundreds and thousands” of emails to her husband Anthony Weiner, when FBI officials said it was only a “handful” of emails.  “I thought that was something that was terrible. We need a great director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. It’s special,” he said.  “We’re going to have a director who’s going to be outstanding, I’ll be announcing that director very soon. And I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very, very, very thrilled. Trump also vigorously denied there has been any collusion and said he respected Rosenstein’s decision to appoint Robert Mueller as a special counsel to take over the investigation.  “I respect the move but the entire thing has been a witch hunt,” he said.  “There is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself and the Russians, zero. ”  Trump said the issue is dividing the country and he wanted to get to work running the country.  “We look forward to getting this whole situation behind us so that, when we go for the jobs, when we go for the strong military, when we go for all of the things that we’ve been pushing so hard and so successfully, including health care,” he said.  “We need health care. We need to cut taxes. We’re going to cut taxes. If I get what I want, it’ll be the biggest tax cut in the history of our nation. And that’s what I want. It’s going to bring back companies. It’s going to bring back jobs. We lost so many jobs and so many companies,” he added.  “There was no collusion. And everybody, even my enemies, have said there is no collusion,” he said. “So, we want to get back and keep on the track that we’re on, because the track that we’re on is  . And that’s what we want to do is we want to break very positive records. ” ",0
1420,Migrant Crisis Summit: Libya Demands €800 Million To Stop Smuggler Boats,"European and North African countries met in Rome Monday to discuss the migrant crisis, which saw more than 150, 000 migrants land on Italian shores in 2016 and thousands killed in dangerous conditions on the Mediterranian Sea. [The European Union already backs Libya’s government with €200 million worth of support to tackle people smugglers  —   who provide the unseaworthy craft which carry thousands of migrants north into the waiting arms of European coastguards and volunteer ‘rescue’ missions  —   but now the country is requesting more.  Libya’s fragile,   “unity government” has now asked for an additional €800 million worth of equipment for their patrol efforts including ships, helicopters,   vehicles, and radar. The Italian government is already providing Libya with ten patrol craft, to be delivered before the summer. The Libya Herald reports Libyan Prime Minister Fayez   flew to Rome with a “shopping list” of demands, including the call for more money and equipment, in the wake of some 20, 000 having made the crossing this year alone. An estimated 3, 000 migrants were rescued in the Mediterranean in just the past weekend. The new agreement struck Monday with Italy and other European nations agreeing to help Libya patrol her coast and keep the smuggler boats from setting off was short on actual detail or a plan to improve the situation, but instead showed a will, said the Italian interior minister. Democratic party minister Marco Minniti said of the meeting: “Naturally we haven’t resolved the problem because it’s clear no one has the definitive solution to the problem in their pockets. “But we have common will. And this common will has a common objective: to not chase or suffer illegal migration but govern it. ” Austrian interior minister Wolfgang Sobotka praised the movement with Libya, telling press: “We have to do everything we can to stop the illegal migration across the Mediterranean” reports Kronen Zeitung. The spending of British and European money in Libya has come under considerable criticism this year, as the poor conditions of migrant camps set up in the country courted criticism. Future spending may see camps established in other North African nations. While a not insignificant amount of money, the €800 million now discussed will be dwarfed by coming European contributions if a new “African Marshall Plan“ an aid package designed to boost African nations, is put into place. President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani said if the bloc doesn’t start pumping cash into the continent immediately, “20 million Africans are going to come to Europe in the coming years”.",0
1421,White House Pushes ‘Alternative Facts.’ Here Are the Real Ones. - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the White House had put forth “alternative facts” to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd. She made this assertion  —   which quickly went viral on social media  —   a day after Mr. Trump and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had accused the news media of reporting falsehoods about the inauguration and Mr. Trump’s relationship with the intelligence agencies. In leveling this attack, the president and Mr. Spicer made a series of false statements. Here are the facts. In fact, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intelligence agencies during his transition to office and has questioned their conclusion that Russia meddled in the election to aid his candidacy. He called their assessment “ridiculous” and suggested that it had been politically motivated. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about him, Mr. Trump alleged that the intelligence agencies had allowed a leak of the material. “Are we living in Nazi Germany?” he asked in a post on Twitter. Aerial photographs clearly show that the crowd did not stretch to the Washington Monument.  An analysis by The New York Times, comparing photographs from Friday to ones taken of Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, showed that Mr. Trump’s crowd was significantly smaller and less than the 1. 5 million people he claimed. An expert hired by The Times found that Mr. Trump’s crowd on the National Mall was about a third of the size of Mr. Obama’s in 2009. The truth is that it began to rain lightly almost exactly as Mr. Trump began to speak and continued to do so throughout his remarks, which lasted about 18 minutes, and after he finished. There is no evidence to support this claim. Not only was Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd far smaller than Mr. Obama’s in 2009, but he also drew fewer television viewers in the United States (30. 6 million) than Mr. Obama did in 2009 (38 million) and Ronald Reagan did in 1981 (42 million) Nielsen reported. Figures for online viewership were not available. Neither number is correct, according to the transit system, which reported 570, 557 entries into the rail system on Friday, compared with 782, 000 on Inauguration Day in 2013. In fact, similar coverings were used during the 2013 inauguration to protect the grass. The coverings did not hamper analyses of the crowd size. The Secret Service said security measures were largely unchanged this year. There were also few reports of long lines or delays.",0

1424,Medical Study Shatters the Theory that Cannabis Acts as a Gateway Drug,"Waking Times 
Research reveals that cannabis may, in fact, serve as an effective exit drug for persons suffering from alcoholism or addiction to illicit or prescription drugs. A survey conducted by researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC) found that addicts may benefit from using cannabis as a substitute to more dangerous and health-destroying substances, especially alcohol and prescription drugs. Cannabis may be a step towards fighting addiction. 
“Research suggests that people may be using cannabis as an exit drug to reduce use of substances that are potentially more harmful, such as opioid pain medication.” ~ Zach Walsh, Researcher and UBC Associate Professor of Psychology 
The UBC study was conducted using a 414-question survey that was offered to medical cannabis patients. The survey gathered information about medical conditions and symptoms, patterns of medical cannabis use , cannabis substitution and barriers to access to medical cannabis. 
Collecting surveys from 472 adults, all of whom used cannabis for therapeutic purposes, the researchers found that: 
“Substituting cannabis for one or more of alcohol, illicit drugs or prescription drugs was reported by 87% of respondents, with 80.3% reporting substitution for prescription drugs, 51.7% for alcohol, and 32.6% for illicit substances.” 
The research also revealed that the use of medical cannabis may be able to help with depression, PTSD and anxiety in some sufferers. The researchers felt that it was not effective in treating symptoms of bipolar disorder and psychosis. The findings were published in the academic journal Clinical Psychology Review. 
The study also found that, according to evidence, “cannabis use does not appear to increase risk of harm to self or others.” ( Source )

1425,Review: ‘The Americans’ History Suddenly Feels Less Retro - The New York Times,"If you love a good spy story, no doubt Tuesday you’ll tune in for the latest in a gripping serial about Russian operatives using duplicity and “kompromat” to undermine American democracy. But once you’re done watching the news, might I suggest “The Americans”? Yeah, it’s a cheap joke. But if television’s best drama finally gets the buzz it deserves because evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election served as viral marketing  —   well, as Comrade Trotsky once said, “The end may justify the means as long as there is something that justifies the end. ” If you’re new to the series (the first four seasons are on Amazon Prime) it follows Elizabeth and Philip Jennings (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) married K. G. B. agents posing as travel agents in suburban Virginia during the Reagan era. While raising two American children, they’ve donned fabulous wigs, ferreted out military secrets and killed innocents in service of the fading Soviet empire  —   all to a     soundtrack. When the first season, in 2013, had Elizabeth and Philip bug the home of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, it seemed outlandish enough. A writer who suggested a successful   to help install Russia’s preferred United States presidential candidate would have been laughed out of the room. In the light of today’s headlines, this Cold War drama feels newly relevant  —   but also almost comfortingly  . In the 1980s of “The Americans,” the    lines are at least clear. Ronald Reagan denounced the “Evil Empire,” whereas President Trump’s top adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, has been quoted comparing himself to Lenin. But the series’ nuanced depiction of espionage as grinding emotional labor is still enthralling. Season 5, which begins Tuesday on FX, finds the Jenningses’ entanglements deepening. Their teenage daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor) having learned that her parents are spies, is being groomed for the family business. She’s also dating the son of their neighbor Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) who happens to be an F. B. I. agent. (Philip also has a   grown son, who unbeknown to Philip is wending his way to America for a surprise family reunion.) Philip and Elizabeth, meanwhile, have been assigned to befriend a Soviet defector who consults for the United States Agriculture Department. There’s a grain shortage in the Soviet Union, and the Russians suspect American sabotage. This is hardly the first time these spies have had to create false intimacy: They’ve made friends and betrayed them, had sex with contacts  —   Philip even married an F. B. I. secretary (Alison Wright) under another identity. Love, in “The Americans,” is a kind of biological weapon. Over four seasons, “The Americans” has used relationships as a window into geopolitics. For Elizabeth and Philip, whose very marriage was arranged by the state, there is no boundary between family and service. That’s become true for Paige as well. Season 5’s   story line inverts this dynamic by framing the Soviet Union as a kind of vast, dysfunctional family. If Mother Russia can’t put food on the table, her children are bound to start asking questions. Sometimes, as with Elizabeth  —   the more militant of the couple  —   the impulse will be to defend and rationalize. Philip, on the other hand, loves his homeland, wants to believe in it, but can’t deny the evidence. The Soviet Union is a massive country, he says: “Why can’t we grow enough grain ourselves?” He’s a little like Paige  —   growing up, realizing his parents are complicated and imperfect. “The Americans” has always had a   melancholy, partly because of the historical setting. We knew, after all, that Elizabeth and Philip, even if they were America’s enemies, were fighting for a doomed cause. But how doomed was it? The election scandal, Russia’s muscle flexing in Europe and, well, whatever is going on between Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump, inevitably make the series play differently. For instance, when “The Americans” began, one would have assumed things would end badly for the Jenningses. They still might. Communism did fall, after all. But Mr. Putin was a K. G. B. officer, and he landed on his feet. And the series’ premise was based partly on the case of the Russian sleeper agent Anna Chapman, who was arrested and deported from the United States in 2010. She’s resurfaced as a model, posting glamour photos with nationalist and   captions on Instagram. “The Americans” is scheduled to end after its sixth season. Maybe it can write Elizabeth and Philip a   epilogue, now that it turns out there are second acts in Russian lives.",0
1426,Klukowski: Nuclear Option Restores Constitutional Balance,"Thursday’s nuclear option vote restores 200 years of Senate practice, going far beyond Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to restore the proper constitutional balance for Supreme Court and federal court appointments. [On April 6, the U. S. Senate voted   to extend Senate Democrats’ own precedent to guarantee that Supreme Court nominees can be confirmed with a   vote of 51 out of 100 senators. As an immediate result, Gorsuch was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice Friday morning by a bipartisan vote of   but the benefits to the Republic will last for decades.  Article II of the Constitution vests the power to appoint judges jointly between the president and the Senate. From the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 until 1987 (same digits, but in a different order) judicial nominations followed a particular pattern. The president takes the lead by nominating anyone he wants. Then the Senate either approves or disapproves of that choice by an    confirmation vote. Their roles were always different. The president would consider every aspect of a nominee, including whether the nominee reflected the president’s philosophy on how to understand the Constitution, the law, and the role of the courts in America’s democratic republic. The Senate’s role was more limited. The Senate does not pick the nominee instead it was a check on the president so that, as Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist Papers No. 76: To what purpose then require the   of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration. In other words, the Senate would ensure that the president did not choose someone on an improper basis, such as because that person was a family member, or a good friend, or perhaps the president owed the nominee money. In practical terms, that means the Senate traditionally looked to three objective criteria to determine if a nominee was fit for office: education, experience, and character. So long as a judicial nominee satisfied those requirements, the Senate would respect the president’s prerogative. That was why Justice Antonin Scalia —  whose seat Gorsuch will now fill —  was confirmed in 1986 by a vote of   despite his   record of being very conservative. But then the very next year, something unprecedented happened when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork, who might have been even more qualified for the Supreme Court than Scalia or Gorsuch, as extremely qualified as those two men were. (Bork was a former U. S. solicitor general, Yale law professor, one of the greatest legal scholars in all of American history, and a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit.) Democrats took control of the Senate in the 1986 midterm elections, and it had become an article of faith in that party to protect sacred cows leftists were getting from a liberal Supreme Court that they could not get through the ballot box, like abortion on demand, racial preferences, and militant secularism. In 1985, Attorney General Ed Meese declared that the official constitutional philosophy of the Reagan administration was originalism: In our democratic republic, the only legitimate way for unelected, politically unaccountable judges to interpret the law (and especially the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land) was according to the original meaning of its provisions, leaving it to the American people alone to decide whether the Constitution or lesser laws need to be changed or amended. Reagan and Meese made good on that philosophy when Reagan elevated Scalia to the Supreme Court. With Bork —  who was even more conservative than Scalia —  nominated to the Court, the Left saw the possibility of an eventual Supreme Court majority that would destroy their   march to achieve their agenda without earning the votes of the American people. Consequently, Sen. Ted Kennedy ( ) led the charge to destroy the unbelievably   Bork, purely because Bork was an unapologetic conservative who openly explained his judicial philosophy. The   Senate voted down Bork’s nomination. That seat on the Court eventually went to Anthony Kennedy. Several years later it almost happened again. Justice Clarence Thomas was narrowly confirmed,  . Republicans tried to restore the constitutional balance. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed   in 1993, despite being as clearly very liberal as Scalia, Bork, and Thomas were clearly conservative. In 1994, Stephen Breyer was confirmed  . But Democrats would have none of it. When the very   Samuel Alito was nominated, he was confirmed in 2006 by a vote of  . To avoid a   this new baseline started to impact how Republicans voted on Democratic nominees, as seen in the confirmation votes of Sonia Sotomayor ( ) and Elena Kagan ( ). But the Left did not stop at the Supreme Court during these years. When George W. Bush was elected president, Senate Democrats in 2001 narrowly controlled the Senate   and began refusing final floor votes on Bush’s nominees to the federal courts of appeals. As an example, they refused to vote on the nomination of John Roberts to be a judge on the D. C. Circuit appeals court. The American people did not tolerate this, and gave Republicans control of the Senate in the 2002 midterms. Now in the minority, Democrats decided to  . One   senator, Chuck Schumer ( ) persuaded most of his colleagues to begin filibustering nominees they did not support, even when some Democrats were willing to join with the Republican majority to confirm them. Roberts got through to the D. C. Circuit anyway, but others —  like Miguel Estrada, another nominee to the D. C. Circuit —  were blocked. As Republicans continued to gain seats in the Senate, Democrats considered taking things to still another low. They decided against filibustering Roberts’s nomination to the Supreme Court, but tried to do so on Alito. But that was a bridge too far for many Democrats at the time, which is why cloture was invoked on Alito   even though many of those Democrats who voted for cloture then voted against his final confirmation on the    vote, resulting in  . Finally with Gorsuch, Schumer led Democrats to claim the role of   of federal judges, merging filibusters with final confirmation votes. If a Republican president nominated someone whom Democrats would not have nominated (which presumably would be the case 100 percent of the time) Senate Democrats would not only vote against final confirmation, but also vote against cloture, regardless of qualifications. Under the historical standard, President Donald Trump’s nomination of Gorsuch is a  . Education? Undergraduate degree from Columbia, law degree from Harvard, and even a doctorate from Oxford. Experience? Law clerk for the U. S. court of appeals and for the Supreme Court, then a partner at a prestigious law firm, also U. S. deputy associate attorney general, then finally a federal judge for more than ten years on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Character? Impeccable honesty and integrity, as well as being a good husband, father, and member of his community, and known to be a gracious, humble, and respectful gentleman. Because it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture, for the first time in American history putting cloture and final passage on the same level created a   threshold for confirmations, meaning that without 60 votes for both, a nominee would be filibustered. Unless Republicans would consistently hold a   supermajority on the Senate, it became possible that a vacant Supreme Court seat could conceivably remain unfilled for a full presidential term. Critics insist that Schumer’s hypocrisy here was shameless, because during the Obama years, when Democrats narrowly held the Senate, for a while Republicans followed the Democrats’ new standard, and filibustered a couple of President Barack Obama’s nominees. Crying   indignation, in 2013 Sen. Harry Reid ( ) Dick Durbin ( ) Pat Leahy ( ) and Schumer created a parliamentary ruling that the filibuster rule, Senate Rule XXII, did not apply to any presidential nominees, except that the ruling did not explicitly cover the Supreme Court. During this time, Schumer gave a passionate speech about how preventing an    vote on judicial nominees was profoundly undemocratic, and an assault on the constitutional order. So Democrats created that precedent on November 21, 2013, one that did not address the Supreme Court simply because there was no Supreme Court vacancy at the time. During the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton’s running mate and Senate Democrats publicly declared that when they won the White House they would immediately extend their ruling to cover the Supreme Court. Consequently, jaws dropped when Schumer declared with righteous indignation that denying a minority the right to filibuster by insisting on an    vote was profoundly undemocratic, and an assault on the constitutional order. This was the same time that Senate Democrats made clear that virtually every senator who opposed Gorsuch’s confirmation would also oppose cloture, solidifying a   threshold for judicial nominees from Republican presidents. This ultimate   and the warping of the constitutional framework was the last draw, which is why on Thursday Republicans ended the madness. They highlighted the fact that this was purely a response to what the Democrats had done, by phrasing the procedural issue as whether “the precedent of November 21, 2013,” applied to Supreme Court nominations. By a vote of   senators issued a “judgment of the Senate” that the Democrats’ own rule applies here, abolishing the remaining judicial filibusters. Now the Republic goes back to where it stood for roughly 200 years. Elections have consequences. When the American people give the presidency and the Senate to opposing parties, they have the choice of picking comprise candidates (if there is such a thing these days) or of keeping seats open. When the American people speak with one voice to give the same party control of both the White House and the Senate, then it should be no surprise that they are able to get judges who reflect that unified philosophy on the federal judiciary at every level —  including the Supreme Court.

1427,America Votes Against Empire,"There’s no way to sweep this under the rug: the American people have voted to end the empire. The entire imperial apparatus lined up behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to become president. Former CIA Director Mike Morrell even publicly endorsed Clinton and called her opponent an “unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.” 
But it was ultimately Donald Trump who prevailed in the election. Trump spent the entirety of his campaign attacking the foreign policy of George W. Bush and one of its chief advocates, Clinton. First Trump took down former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the primary by slamming the Iraq War and Jeb’s ambivalence surrounding it. Then he used Clinton’s support for the Iraq War and regime change in Libya to call her “trigger happy” and dangerous.
The Clinton campaign struck back saying Trump did not support American exceptionalism, to which Trump responded by essentially agreeing and explained his foreign policy was more realist . Trump said he only endorsed using military force if American interests and security were actually under threat.
Trump’s realism and Clinton’s history of aggression and interventionist positioning led to a neoconservative exodus from the Republican Party. The neocons uniformly opposed Trump from the beginning and before long they all endorsed Clinton. By election day, almost all of the 2003 Iraq War architects and cheerleaders supported Clinton or at least said they would not vote for Trump.
Robert Kagan, a leading neoconservative and co-founder of The Project For A New American Century, even took a role advising and fundraising for Clinton. He also helped write a foreign policy document with Clinton’s likely nominee for secretary of defense Michèle Flournoy called, “Expanding American Power.” 
Don't understand why people are surprised by neocon support for Hillary against Trump. Many neocons endorsed Clinton in 92. @maxboot

In the final debate, Clinton said she would launch an air war against Russia and the Syrian government to establish a No Fly Zone in Syria, then accused Trump of being a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin for not supporting it. Trump coolly responded that he thought it would be good for the country and world if America and Russia got along.
The contrast could not have been clearer and the American people made their choice to begin disentangling ourselves from foreign quagmires and focus our energy on our own country.

1428,Coffee shop customer feels good about leaving a $20 tip.,"Topics: Tips , coffee bar , tall coffee   
Seattle, WA - Contemplating how utterly thrilled the staff of the local coffee shop must be, 32-year-old Brandon Reenberg felt good about himself Monday for leaving a remarkable tip. 
Sources confirm Mr. Reenberg had a vague, poorly concealed smile on his face as he was casually stuffing a $20 bill into the tip jar, after paying only $4 for his large cup of cappuccino to go. 
""I feel amazing about doing this,"" Reenberg said when asked to comment. ""These people are heavily underpaid, and I'm pretty sure they don't get tips that big that often, given the average order price at that miserable place. They probably thought I'm a fantastic customer. I might have even made their day."" 
At press time, the coffee shop benefactor is reportedly having second thoughts after realizing it was, like, a 500% tip he left there. Make Alice Malice's  ",0

1430,Analyst: Why Turkey Opening Border to Millions Migrants into Europe is a Good Thing,"Home | World | Analyst: Why Turkey Opening Border to Millions Migrants into Europe is a Good Thing Analyst: Why Turkey Opening Border to Millions Migrants into Europe is a Good Thing By Gazi 25/11/2016 11:28:20 
ANKARA – Turkey – The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday has vowed to throw open Turkey’s borders to illegal migrants after the European Parliament voted to back a freeze in membership talks with Ankara, and have reneged on a visa deal that was promised by the EU a few months ago. 
With all these broken promises, Turkey is fully justified in opening the floodgates into Europe once again, where the Schengen zone is an effective unguarded corridor not only for illegal migrants, but drugs, arms and other contraband. 
This mass deluge of human traffic into Europe will be good for the United Kingdom’s Brexit stance, as an estimated 5 – 10 million migrants will push their way from Turkey directly into the European heartland, causing further unrest and problems for the EU, which has already been inundated with millions of migrants from South East Asia, Syria, and Africa. 
The open border with Greece, all the way up to the Black Sea will once again be open to traffic, and as more millions come, news will spread and even more migrants will make the journey. 
Turkey’s stance should be applauded in the destruction of the EU, as there will be limited capacity or enthusiasm for even more migrants. 
The numbers of migrants could easily increase to 20 million or 50 million migrants within a year or so, depending on the efforts of the Turks and their open door policy, as well as the forced reception within EU countries residing in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. 
Most migrants will naturally gravitate towards the leading EU nations of Germany and France, however there could be an increased bottleneck scenario occurring around Calais as some try to reach the UK. 
The Turks must be fully commended in their push for the destruction of the EU, and the increase in sentiment for Brexit, however it is the Schengen zone created by unelected eurocrats which will be their own undoing..a beautiful and just end to the masochistic EU, who engineered their own destruction through their own socialist utopian dreams.

1431,"Survey Shows Social Isolation, Sexual Rejection, but Much Sympathy for Transgender Americans - Breitbart","People who try to live as members of the opposite sex damage their chances for normal romance and sex, according to a large new survey of attitudes towards transgender issues. [Just four percent of normal heterosexual Americans said they would be “very open” to dating a “transgender person,” and only a third would be willing to tell their parents about the relationship, according to the survey by YouGov. com.   The four percent number comes from a sample which excluded the one or two percent of heterosexual Americans who say they’ve had relations within the last 12 months with a woman or a man who is trying to change sex.  The February survey of 2, 191 adults also showed that transgender people are often unwelcome in the much smaller gay and lesbian communities, which together comprised only 5 percent of the survey. Only eight percent of lesbians and just 10 percent of the gay men say they did have sex with a transsexual in the prior 12 months. Just   percent of gay men who have not had a relationship with a transsexual said they would be “very open” to dating a transgender man, and only 47 percent of them would be willing to tell their parents, said the survey. Almost   of lesbians said they are “very open” to a relationship with a man who is living as a woman. The poll forcefully underlined the sexual unattractiveness  —   and the painful social isolation  —   facing most men and women who try to switch their sex, despite the glamorous coverage from many major media outlets, even including fashion and style magazines.   The sexual rejection, however, was accompanied by sympathy from many Americans. For example, the survey showed that 66 percent of sexually normal people were “very” or “somewhat” open to friendship with a person trying to change sex. Only 29 percent said they would oppose a friendship, according to YouGov, which declined to say who funded the expensive survey.  The survey’s results match complaints by many of the few people who are trying to live as members of the other sex. “The disappointing but unsurprising results [of the survey] reveal a sad truth about the transgender rights movement: Cultural acceptance has tended to lag behind formal recognition,” said Samantha Allen, a reporter at The Daily Beast who is living as a woman. The commonplace rejection of transsexuals is frequently described or shown on YouTube. For example, the British Mirror newspaper videotaped the rejection of three American transsexuals in 2015: Hoping on finding a boyfriend, [Claire] reveals that she doesn’t like telling people the truth and is desperate for an [expensive genital surgery] operation. She says: “In a lot of ways, I don’t like telling a guy. Once I tell him all respect goes out of the window. “Straight guys just can’t get over you having the male parts. “Once I’ve had or get the surgery, I think it will change a lot for me because right now if I meet a straight guy and he doesn’t know  —   we can’t get physical if I don’t tell him. “And then if he finds out, things just get so complicated, I can’t even begin to explain. ” Many people who are trying to change their sex also blame their exclusion on unfair social attitudes that need to be changed by civic pressure or government action. “We, as a society, have not created a space for men to openly express their desire to be with trans women,” Allen said, echoing the progressive claim that heterosexual males’ sexual preferences can be swayed by civic endorsement of transsexuality. The demand that male and female heterosexuals learn to sexually desire transsexuals reflects a key demand of the “transgender ideology”  —   that government should pressure ordinary Americans to fully accept other people’s claim about their maleness or femaleness, regardless of biology.  This political ideology was pushed by officials working for former President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice. “Transgender men are men  —   they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women  —   they live, work and study as women,” Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civic regulation division, claimed in a May 2016 press conference. The ideology is built on the political claim that people can easily change their “gender identity” and so become members of the opposite legal sex  —   even without biological changes. That political claim is based on two more claims  —   that a person’s “gender” can be different from that person’s sex, and that peoples’ sex (and sexual preference) is “socially constructed” by social rules, not by biology, according to progressives. This transgender ideology has some sympathy from roughly   of Americans, but Obama has admitted twice that his push for “transgender rights” hurt Hillary Clinton’s 2016 race. Also, far fewer than one percent of Americans try to live as members of the opposite sex. In contrast, conservatives cite science and human experience when arguing that “gender” does not exist, and that a person’s sex is determined by their biology, which also deeply impacts their character across a wide range of masculine, feminine and   characteristics. For example, say conservatives, young female “tomboys” are still girls, regardless of their appearance or behavior. In February, President Donald Trump boosted the conservative argument by ditching an   rule which directed schools officials to enforce the “gender identity” claims of “transgender” children on normal children, regardless of the children’s’ privacy or their parents’ wishes. Since Obama’s departure, the push by transsexuals for sexual acceptance consists of social pressure, often via Hollywood, and often aimed at lesbians.  This push is especially   among some transsexual men who wish to sleep with lesbians. But many lesbians decline to sleep with men who have intact male genitalia, even if the men say they’re women. Sexual activists scornfully describe this rejection by lesbians as  “the cotton ceiling” As one   transsexual argued on Youtube:  So the cotton ceiling is a term that was coined basically referring to the idea that a transwoman’s identity as a woman would be respected within the lesbian community up until the point when a romantic or sexual relationship was being considered, at which point the lesbian would say “Sorry, not interested in transwomen,” which means that it you don’t regarded transwomen as women, regardless of their operative status [intact male genitalia] you don’t actually think of transwomen as women at all   …     At the end of the day, if your reason for not dating any transgender person is because of their   that doesn’t mean you’re not transphobic  —   because you are.  “You can unlearn your own prejudices [against sex with transsexuals] —   it just takes time and effort,” said Riley Dennis, a biological male who is living as a woman while preferring to sleep with women. Denis argues that a person’s “genital preferences” for   genitalia should be stigmatized like sexism because it prevents lesbians from dating people who claim to be women while still keeping male genitalia. “Some women have penises,” Denis claims.  But the heterosexual rejection of transsexuality is deep. When Bruce Jenner renamed himself “Caitlyn,” the popularity of the female name fell more than 400 places, right off the list of the top 1, 000 favorite names. The burden of trying to change sex  —   drugs, hormones, surgery, social exclusion, money, unemployment and much else  —   is so great that many people reverse their transgender attempt and try to live as a normal person, even after being mutilated by   surgery.    Nationally, the claim that government should enforce the gender ideology is having a large impact on civic society’s rules for helping males and females preserve their complementary, equal and overlapping private and public lives. For example, the   push has attacked the nation’s   social rules for   bathrooms and shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys,   curricula and university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women’s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children’s sexual privacy.

1432,House Democrats Conceal 2016 Election Autopsy from Public - Breitbart,"House Democrats this week buried a report analyzing the party’s failings in 2016 from the party’s members, Politico has revealed. [After a five month wait, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney ( ) presented his findings to lawmakers at a   event at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) headquarters Thursday night. The report detailed both the reasons behind Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the presidential election and the party’s failure to win back control of Congress.  However, the report was only accessible to the roughly   lawmakers who attended, while members were not allowed to take copies of the report and could only view it under the supervision of DCCC staff. During the report’s presentation, Maloney reportedly focused on how the Democratic machine raises money and its spreading of resources, rather than their political messaging or policy positions. The report also recommended that the DCCC improve its research methods and tighten its media operation, as well as employ a more diverse range of political consultants. It did not single out any particular figure for criticism. Some Democrats criticized the secrecy surrounding the report, suggesting it made Maloney’s findings look worse than they actually are. DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly denied the claims, and said: “Like any healthy organization, the DCCC always works to evolve and grow after each election cycle, and we were happy to have Congressman Maloney as part of that effort this year. ” “This analysis is based on strategic information about our organization and meant for internal purposes, not public consumption,” she continued. Meanwhile, revelations from a recent book analyzing Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign suggest that her campaign was dogged by infighting, poor organization, and lack of any convincing message. A report following the 2016 election found that Clinton had ample financial resources, spending a total of $1. 2 billion on her failed campaign.

1433,"Number of Refugees Admitted into U.S. Increased by Nineteen Percent in May, Slightly Fewer Are Muslim - Breitbart","The number of refugees admitted into the United States increased 19 percent in the month of May to 3, 969, which was 653 more than the 3, 316 admitted in April, according to the Department of State’s interactive website. [Slightly fewer of these refugees were Muslim.  One thousand one hundred and ten Muslims were admitted to the United States as refugees in May, 19 fewer than the 1, 129 admitted as refugees in April. Muslims as a percentage of all refugees admitted declined from 34 percent in April to 28 percent in May. During the 4 months and 11 days of the Trump administration, 38 percent, or 6, 243 out of 16, 261 total refugees admitted, were Muslim. During FY 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration, 45 percent, or 38, 555 out of 89, 994 total refugees admitted, were Muslim. The percentage of all refugees admitted from the seven Middle Eastern countries whose residents were temporarily banned from obtaining travel visas to the United States under President Trump’s first travel ban executive order (EO 13769) has declined slightly from 43 percent (36, 722 out of 84, 994 total refugees) in FY 2016 to 38 percent (6, 181 out of 16, 261 total refugees) during the first 4 months and 11 days of the Trump administration. (Those seven countries were Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen.) Most of the decline in refugees from these seven countries is due to a significant drop off in Syrian refugees, from 14. 8 percent of total refugees in FY 2016 (12, 587 out of 84, 994) to 9. 8 percent (1, 603 out of 16, 261) in the first four months and 11 days of the Trump administration. That drop off in Syrian refugees is accelerating in each successive month of the Trump administration. “The number of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States under the federal refugee resettlement program has declined for the fourth consecutive month,” Breitbart News reported earlier this week. In February, the first full month of the Trump administration, 673 Syrian refugees were admitted into the country. In March, that number fell to 282. The decline continued into April, when 226 were admitted and the number admitted so far in May has declined further to 156. All told, since January 21, President Trump’s  first full day in office, a total of 1, 603 Syrian refugees have been admitted into the United States, according to the State Department’s interactive website. News of the increase in total refugees in May, a fact not changed by the decline in Syrian refugees, appears to confirm the report  last week in the New York Times that officials in the State Department have told the voluntary agencies that the number of refugees admitted to the United States will nearly double from the rate of 830 per week to about 1, 500 per week for the last four months of FY 2017. The Times report was further confirmed by The Huffington Post, which reported on Monday that “The United States appears to be resuming its longstanding efforts to resettle refugees after the program was derailed and almost completely upended abroad for several months. ” U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services “has begun to expand its interview schedule in the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year,” public affairs officer Marilu Cabrera told HuffPost in a statement on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security is working with the State Department to plan for a “further expansion” through the end of fiscal year 2017, she added. The upsurge in refugees has perplexed critics of the federal refugee resettlement program, most of whom strongly supported Trump during the presidential campaign on the basis of his campaign promises to suspend the Syrian refugee program and tighten refugee vetting procedures. “[I]t does appear that the resettlement contractors are getting excited that it will flow with gusto soon since they are rehiring staff they let go shortly after Trump put out his first Executive Order,” Ann Corcoran wrote at Refugee Resettlement Watch on Wednesday. “The Republicans in Congress funded the US Refugee Admissions Program [in the budget passed in May for the balance of FY 2017] at a level for 75, 000 refugees to be admitted by September 30th (the last day of this fiscal year) and Trump signed it! . . . [T]he President has the power to set the ceiling in “consultation” with Congress. If Trump wanted to take them on he could ask for a rescission of those funds to admit the numbers he wants —  which he said would be under 50, 000!” Corcoran continued. “Every day that the White House is silent on the stunning news we heard last week says to me that the White House agrees with the 75, 000 admissions this year,” she said: Why do the Republicans in Congress want to keep the pipeline going? It is because most of them work for their big business donors and the Chamber of Commerce to guarantee a steady supply of cheap immigrant labor! Adding insult to injury, your tax dollars support refugee families through the welfare system because wages are too low! You pay for the importation of the labor and for the laborers’ support once here! It is really quite a difficult obstacle for us (who wish to see the USRAP reformed) to overcome —  big businesses and global corporations pushing cheap labor in conjunction with   ‘religious’ charities (paid by taxpayers!) claiming this is all about humanitarianism while essentially acting as ‘head hunters’ for big business. As Breitbart News reported  previously, “It is unclear if the State Department made this upward adjustment with the knowledge and approval of President Trump. ” One possible explanation is that Obama holdovers in the State Department and at USCIS at DHS, in combination with a recent State Department appointee who was, prior to the election, a Trump critic, have joined forces to undermine Trump’s refugee policies. In March, for instance, the Daily Caller reported that “Brian Hook, a Trump critic and former Bush administration official, is currently serving as the State Department’s director of policy planning. ” Foreign Policy magazine previously reported that Hook was Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s favorite for the role and a department spokeswoman confirmed to TheDC Thursday that Hook got the job. The director of policy planning is a key position responsible for running the department’s internal think tank, which is home to the secretary of state’s speechwriters. Hook previously served in the Bush administration in several roles, including as assistant secretary of state for international organizations, and later served as a foreign policy adviser for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign. The State Department official also   the John Hay Initiative, a neoconservative group that organized a letter of over 100 Republican foreign policy experts who would refuse to back Trump. Eliot Cohen, another   of the John Hay Initiative, has been a strong critic of the Trump administration. It is unclear, however, what, if any, influence Hook has had on the recent changes in the State Department’s Refugee Admissions Program policies.",0
1434,"How Deep Will 2016’s Blue Wave Be? Progressives Push Candidates, Issues Up and Down Political Ladder","$23 How Deep Will 2016’s Blue Wave Be? Progressives Push Candidates, Issues Up and Down Political Ladder   Steven Rosenfeld / AlterNet Jason Morrison / CC BY-NC 2.0 
As the 2016 election closes, progressives are on the frontline of the latest rallying cry by Democrats Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine, President Obama and the rest of the party’s leaders to sweep Republicans out of office up and down the political ladder.It’s no secret the Clinton campaign, its surrogates and state party operations have built and unleashed a giant ground game, registering voters and urging them to turn out, with five times as many paid staffers as the GOP. But a parallel track is unfolding in progressive circles, where collectively, groups like Democracy for America, Progressive Democrats of America, Our Revolution and others are pushing, promoting, fundraising for and urging their ranks—even those who don’t like Clinton—to elect scores of other candidates and vote on statewide ballot measures to move a progressive agenda. 
“I think there is growing confidence that we can win the presidential election. So that’s not new,” said Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America, which has endorsed 125 candidates . “What we have been focusing on are the down-ballot races, the U.S. Senate races that up until recently haven’t started getting a lot of attention. But also on city council races and state legislative races.”“On November 8, we can measure how successful the progressive political revolution has been,” said Shannon Jackson, executive director of Our Revolution , which grew out of Bernie Sanders’ campaign. “We have 105 progressive champions we are supporting. We have 31 different ballot races we are behind. We’re calling, we’re texting, we are organizing online. We are doing e-mails. We are assisting through our fundraising. We want to make sure they have the tools available to them so they can succeed.”In some cases, mainstream Democrats and progressive groups are supporting the same candidates and taking the same stances on ballot measures, such as pushing for health care reforms, raising the minimum wage and enacting campaign finance reform. But in other cases, the progressives are further to the left, embracing all forms of marijuana legalization, repealing the death penalty and opposing charter school expansion and anti-union right-to-work ballot measures. Donna Smith, executive director of Progressive Democrats of America , gave two examples illustrating these parallel tracks. 
“PDA is intensely focused on electing Doug Applegate in California’s 49th Congressional District, where defeating Darrell Issa would be an added bonus,” she said, referring to a Republican who has repeatedly sought to undermine President Obama. “Applegate is a strong progressive who has been attacked by Issa on his progressive stands as highlighted by the PDA endorsement questionnaire. We have put substantial resources into that race.”“We are also backing Nanette Barragan, CA CD-44, where even in a relatively safe Democratic district we must push to make sure we elect the most progressive candidate with a solid, respected track record,” Smith continued. “Across the country we have focused on other congressional races where we can make real inroads and where we can still see hope for the policy agenda Sen. Bernie Sanders so brilliantly articulated during the presidential primary. The challenge has been to overcome some voter fatigue in areas where the coverage of the presidential contest has overshadowed many of these critical congressional races.” The open question for progressives like Smith, who want to see the political landscape reshuffled to the left, and also for the Clinton campaign, which is urging Democrats to retake congressional majorities and governors’ mansions, is how much attention will voters pay to down-ballot races? With Election Day quickly approaching, these groups are making every effort to engage them. This goes beyond the fundraising bonanza Paul Ryan unleashed when he groused that a Democratic Senate majority would put Sanders in the Senate Budget Committee chairman’s seat, which DFA and Our Revolution seized on to raise several million dollars online for their candidates. DFA, for example, is pushing its Washington and Colorado members to pay attention to their state senate races, because picking up one or two seats would shift the legislative majority from red to blue. “If you can get people volunteering and taking action to support a candidate for local state legislature, those votes will trickle up,” said Sroka, referring to the likelihood that people working hard for local races would end up supporting the federal candidates. “Also, there are some progressive Democrats who aren’t super excited about the presidential race, and so that’s okay.”“We want to make sure that there’s a space for everyone in the fight to November,” he continued, “because frankly, we need everyone’s help. So focusing on the Senate race in North Carolina, as one example, is another one that until recently folks weren’t focusing on [nationally]. We were paying attention to it, because it’s a place where people could take action, have a meaningful role and help the ticket as well.”Sroka said DFA and Our Revolution are coordinating, explaining that DFA has more on-the-ground experience and a better grassroots network at this stage of the campaign, while Our Revolution is more of an online community. Jackson agreed, saying many Sanders supporters needed to pause after the Democratic Convention but rejoined the fray after Labor Day. Raising $2 million in 72 hours after Ryan’s remarks showed how potent these progressives remain, injecting needed funds into dozens of races.“We want to make sure they have the tools available to them so they can succeed,” Jackson said. “From [U.S. House candidate] Zephyr Teachout in New York, from [U.S. House] candidate Pramila Jayapal out in Washington, from coast to coast. However you measure it, we are going to see progressive champions winning seats from school board to state senate to U.S. representatives and senators.” It’s hard to dissect all the factors that prompt voter registration and turnout. But registration for the 2016 election has closed in many states, with the number of registered voters across America breaching the 200 million mark for the first time. Meanwhile, ballots cast in early voting by registered Democrats are outpacing Republicans in many states at a comparable period before the 2012 election, according to media reports from Florida , North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and Arizona .“When we look at the early voting numbers, we go, hmm. Something definitely is going on. Something different from the past. But it’s very much on a state-by-state basis,” Sroka said. “What we do know is whether it is Florida or North Carolina or Nevada, Democrats are taking advantage of the organization structure they have on the ground this year in a significant way.” 
  
“That kind of success… is a reflection of grassroots power,” he continued. “To get those kinds of numbers we are seeing with early voting takes contacts for volunteers, or contacts from the campaign. It’s reflective of the kind of ground game that the Democrats may have over Republicans looking at the country overall.”That ground game isn’t just coming from what’s called the coordinated Democratic campaign—the presidential and state party effort. In Nevada, big multi-ethnic unions like the Culinary Workers have been pushing voter registration for months and are now focusing on get-out-the-vote efforts. In California, the National Nurses United union and Sanders have been pushing a ballot measure requiring state government health programs pay the same price for drugs as the federal Veterans Administration, which would cut costs. That’s not the only health care proposal pushed by Our Revolution. Colorado will vote on creating a statewide single-payer system.Down-ballot candidates and statewide initiative measures often don’t get as many votes as the presidential campaign; people just skip them if they’re not sure, which means they can pass or fail by smaller margins. Jackson said he did not know the latest polling on all of the statewide measures pushed or opposed by Our Revolution. But on those where he did review recent surveys, Jackson said it looks like many progressive positions are going to win.That appeared to be the case with the California drug-pricing measure, another California proposal to repeal the state’s death penalty, measures in California and Washington calling for overturning the Supreme Court’s Citizens United campaign finance decision, the medical or recreational marijuana legalization measures (outside the South), minimum wage hikes in Maine and Washington, and opposing charter school expansion in Massachusetts. Our Revolution is also pushing an automatic statewide voter registration proposal in Alaska, where any resident who receives an annual oil industry dividend from the state—including 50,000 Native Alaskans—would be on voter lists.So while the mainsteam media coverage is centered on the Clinton campaign and its enlarged focus to retake the Senate and shrink Republican majorities in the House and state capitals, the efforts of progressive groups, working inside and outside of traditional Democratic circles, may determine how deep and wide 2016’s blue wave will be.",0

1436,Donald Trump: Democrats ‘Phony Hypocrites’ for Protesting James Comey Firing - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump said Democrats were “phony hypocrites” after protesting his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. [“Dems have been complaining for months  months about Dir.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said during the press briefing that the administration was anxious for the investigation’s completion. “We encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us and we can continue to see exactly what we’ve been saying for nearly a year: There’s no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,” she said.",0
1437,Want to See ‘Hamilton’ in a City Near You? Buy a Subscription and Wait Two Years - The New York Times,"“Hamilton” is about to hit the road. And, more than a year before it arrives in many cities, theaters around the country are trying to convert the hunger for tickets into subscriptions and memberships. In many cities, theaters are encouraging potential patrons to subscribe to their   seasons, even though “Hamilton” won’t arrive until the following season, with the promise that those who subscribe now  —   and then renew  —   will be guaranteed “Hamilton” tickets and can lock in their chosen subscription seats. The strategy is   because the theaters acknowledge that some tickets will ultimately be available for sale to nonsubscribers. Given the widespread publicity over the scarcity of tickets to the Broadway production of “Hamilton,” though, many theatergoers appear unwilling to risk facing a   show in their hometowns. “In my 38 years of being involved with selling tickets for various activities, I don’t believe there has ever been this kind of ‘but how do I get  ’ conversation,” said Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. “Hamilton” is scheduled to be at the Kennedy Center for 14 weeks in the summer of 2018 on Wednesday, the center started selling tickets for its   season, with the promise that anyone who subscribes that season, and renews next, will be guaranteed tickets. The effort to goad people into subscribing for two years to get tickets to the show prompted criticism in The Washington Post from a blogger, who called it a “quite high entrance fee,” and from a letter writer, who criticized what she called “extortionist prices. ” Ms. Rutter said there would be tickets available for purchase to nonsubscribers, but that it only made sense to reach out to try to bolster subscriptions first. “People have accused us of gouging, but it’s not gouging  —   if you want to be first in line, the best way to do that is to be a subscriber,” Ms. Rutter said. The strategy is already proving a significant boon to theaters where “Hamilton” will be staged  —   some are nonprofits, and some are commercial enterprises, but all depend on subscriptions or memberships as important elements of their budgets. Many arts groups have hard times sustaining subscription bases as consumers gravitate toward more à la carte and   planning for their cultural activities. “We live and breathe by the subscription model,” said Lauren Reid, chief executive of the theater unit at Key Brand Entertainment, which brings shows to 40 stages in North America through its Broadway Across America subsidiary. Ms. Reid said she had never seen as high a level of consumer awareness about a new show as for “Hamilton” consequently, she added, every theater expecting “Hamilton” is “teasing” it early to promote subscriptions. “The bottom line is ‘Hamilton’ is really good for our industry,” she said. “It’s an event, and it’s a cultural moment, and it’s unusual that we have an opportunity like this to highlight something special. ” The tactic is working. In Chicago, the first city outside New York where “Hamilton” will be seen (starting on Sept. 27) Broadway in Chicago has sold out its fall subscription package for the first time, according to Lou Raizin, the organization’s president. The company has not yet started selling tickets to nonsubscribers  —   and there will be many such tickets available, because the show plans to stay in Chicago as long as sales are healthy. But, Mr. Raizin said: “We believe there will be very strong demand. You’d have to be hiding under a rock not to have that opinion. ” In San Francisco, where “Hamilton” is expected to run at the SHN Orpheum Theater for 21 weeks, starting next March, SHN, which operates two locations in the city, expects to have 40, 000 members enroll for its   season, up from the usual 20, 000 to 23, 000. “‘Hamilton’ has been an incredible driver for membership sales,” said Greg Holland, SHN’s chief executive. Also noteworthy, Mr. Holland said, was that 80 percent of the new membership buyers were   visitors to the company’s website. In Iowa, Des Moines Performing Arts has said that “Hamilton” will come for an unspecified length of time at unspecified dates during the   season, but that has been enough to cause a spike in subscriptions to the coming season. “We’ve more than doubled the number of new season tickets purchased compared to a year ago, and our renewal rate is shooting up to the levels we always aspire to,” said Jeff Chelesvig, the center’s president and chief executive. “Our goal is 11, 000 subscribers, and I have no doubt we’ll plow through that. ” The lead producer of “Hamilton,” Jeffrey Seller, said he was aware that theaters were using the promise of a future production of the show to market   subscriptions. “I’m O. K. with it  —   it’s good for the theater in general,” he said. “The only thing I don’t want anyone to say is that if you don’t buy a subscription, you won’t be able to get a ticket, because there will be single tickets. They won’t sell out through subscriptions. ” The Broadway production of “Hamilton,” which has been essentially sold out since it opened last August, is expected to continue to run for years. The show is planning to visit other cities through two additional productions: the one that will open in Chicago this fall and stay there indefinitely, and the one that will begin in San Francisco next March and then tour. Thus far, tour stops, often without specific dates or duration, have been announced for Atlanta Boston Costa Mesa, Calif. Des Moines Houston Las Vegas Los Angeles Portland, Ore. Seattle Tempe, Ariz. and Washington. “Hamilton” is also planning a fourth production, in London, but that has not yet been officially announced.",0
1438,Misdirected Coalition Strike Kills 18 Partner Forces in Syria,"WASHINGTON (AFP)  —   A coalition air strike accidentally killed 18 members of a     alliance fighting the Islamic State group near a key town in northern Syria, the   coalition said Thursday. [Tuesday’s strike occurred south of Tabqa, a strategically important town on the Euphrates River next to a dam and military airport, and close to the IS stronghold of Raqa.  “The strike was requested by the partnered forces, who had identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position,” a coalition statement read. “The target location was actually a forward Syrian Democratic Forces fighting position. ” SDF troops backed by coalition air power and other military assistance have been fighting for control of Tabqa since last month. The town is considered an important waypoint ahead of the main offensive for Raqa, the IS group’s last bastion in Syria. In its own statement, the SDF described the incident as a “painful accident” resulting from a “mistake. ” “The accident caused a number of deaths and injuries. The general command of the Syrian Democratic Forces is coordinating with international coalition forces to investigate the incident and uncover the reasons and conditions that led to this accident. ” The coalition offered its “deepest condolences” to the members of the SDF and their families. “The coalition is in close contact with our SDF partners who have expressed a strong desire to remain focused on the fight against ISIS despite this tragic incident,” the coalition statement said. Officials were assessing the cause and would “implement appropriate safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future,” the statement added. The SDF is a local   force that the   coalition is supporting with arms, air strikes, training and advice as they fight IS.",0
1439,"The Western Banking System Is Totally Broken, Totally Insolvent And Totally Corrupt (VIDEO)","By: The Voice of Reason | Provided that you are someone who doesn’t rely on the mainstream media for anything more than entertainment, and you get your actual “news” elsewhere, then you already know that, “[T]he Western central banking franchise system is totally broken, totally insolvent, totally corrupt,” and it’s been inviting the return of a Gold Standard for some time. More than likely, you also already know that it won’t be a United States Gold Standard that global financial system defers to when the U.S. Dollar finally takes it’s last gasp of air before dying on the operating table. The entire financial system of the Western banking system and the U.S. Dollar were built upon a debt-based monetary system, and the debt saturation process has run its full course. The days of the U.S. Dollar are numbered, and anyone who has followed the work of Dr. Jim Willie for even a short while, should already know that. However, Because of his sarcastic manner, and the informal atmosphere in which Dr. Willie often conducts his interviews, sometimes it can be difficult to understand (or take seriously), the points he is making. So, for anyone looking to better understand the basis of some of Dr. Willie’s more recent forecasts, the article below is written by Dr. Willie himself, and it contains all the details one could ask for that support the positions he has often discussed during many of his most recent prior interviews. The interview is about three weeks old, but it’s also his most recent. During the interview, just a few of the topics include how recent geopolitical and economic events have begun to severely fracture NATO, and how post-Brexit the European Commission is becoming largely irrelevant as a governing body. With respect to the death of the U.S. Dollar, Dr. Willie discusses how the Chinese will launch new short term RMB notes backed by gold, causing even more countries to abandon the U.S. Dollar when settling foreign trade debts. Then, to facilitate the U.S. Dollar’s transition from the slow precipitous decline we’ve seen in recent years, into a complete collapse, Dr. Willie explains how we should expect the IMF to soon back it’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR’S) with gold, in conjunction with the Saudi’s abandoning the PetroDollar for good. Stay tuned at the conclusion of Dr. Willie’s technical analysis below, for another good look into the death of the Dollar, in a full-length documentary titled, “End of An Empire: America Destroyed From Within /Death by Bank-ism.” Dr. Jim Willie Writes: The Western central bank franchise system is totally broken, totally insolvent, and totally corrupt. It invites the Gold Standard return. The entire financial system is built upon a debt-based monetary system. The debt saturation process has run its full course. The central bank heads have been covering the sovereign debt for the last five years, having rendered their balance sheets as ruined. Debt is at obscene levels, like $19.7 trillion for the USGovt. No debt limits are in place anymore, a signal that most likely it has already defaulted. A hidden game is underway, with control lost to the creditors, even as they attempt to salvage their debt holdings. The major central banks continue to manage badly the great game, where money is fake phony and a farce. A titanic battle is underway, where the Eastern nations are discarding their USTreasury Bonds, and doing so in tremendous volume while they set up the many platforms and pieces to the Gold Standard. The US Federal Reserve monetary policy of hyper-inflation has failed to revive the US Economy, failed to legitimize the debt securities, failed to halt the financial corruption, and failed to stem capital destruction. The official monetary policy has only succeeded in preventing the failures of almost all big Western banks. They are all insolvent, mostly supported by narco money laundering in the hundreds of $billions. The Eastern super-powers are leading a campaign to put aside the US$-based financial system, isolate it to the sidelines, while arranging a new system. The Gold-based system will be complete with its currency, sovereign debt securities, transfer systems, global offices, and debt rating agencies, maybe even debit cards. The East strives to install the Gold Standard as the remedy to the ongoing global financial crisis. The West has made exactly no movement toward solution, remedy, or enforcement against bond. Four graphs display the broken unfixable bizarre situation. Graph 1 – BALANCE SHEET DESTRUCTION Central bank balance sheets could take decades to normalize, so the conventional thinking goes. Their balance sheets will never return to normal. Most assets of toxic paper are far more worthless than junk bonds. A normalization process would require at least 50 years of more financial repression and deep corruption. A massive global debt writedown of sovereign bond is coming, on the back end of the Global Financial RESET. Think paradigm shift of the most disruptive type while power shifts eastward. The risk of war rises. The big Western banks find themselves in an impossible Catch-22 situation. The markets are addicted to QE and its destructive money hyper inflation. Federal Reserve policymakers have acknowledged that their $4 trillion balance sheet will not shrink any time soon. Also, Bank of England officials talk of crisis fighting tools as semi-permanent fixtures. In Asia, the Bank of Japan has developed a new monetary policy framework that features admitted infinite QE. The financial crisis the balance sheet volume to GDP ratios for the Bank of England and USFed have peaked at around 25%, the highest level ever recorded. Uncharted territory has been entered. The USFed balance sheet ratio to GDP previously reached 23% in 1940 during World War II. The Bank of England ratio approached 20% in the 1730s during the South Sea Bubble scheme, 1816/17 during the Great Re-coinage, the 1830s/1840s following other wars, and in the immediate aftermath of WW2. In every scenario above, the central banks managed to unwind their balance sheets. But then the great unwinding took decades, up to 60 years in some cases. This time is different. No economic growth is anywhere remotely on the current horizon, nothing sufficient to unwind the tremendous debt burden. This is where the conventional analyst turns stupid, even locked in fantasy. They assume the GDP growth has been around 3% in recent years, when it has been closer to minus 4% or minus 5% each year since 2008 in a fierce recession with strong feedback loops. We are not on the verge of economic expansion, which can relieve the balance sheet toxicity, but rather a financial reform to sweep away the USDollar and to render its USTreasury Bonds as near worthless paper. The next chapter will be centered upon the Gold Standard, first in trade payment, next in bank reserves, finally in currencies.

1440,Marvel Comics Presents 'The Inhumans' in IMAX Theaters,"Marvel Comic fans will be excited to hear that Marvel Entertainment, Disney|ABC, and IMAX Corporation has announced their unprecedented agreement to premiere the new ABC series, “The Inhumans” in IMAX commercial theaters. This will mark the first time that a live-action television series debuts in this way. The series will be shown in a two-week window, with its first two episodes slated to air in the late summer of 2017.
Marvel Comics is producing their first two episodes in conjunction with ABC studios. “The Inhumans” was filmed entirely with IMAX digital cameras. Following the premiere on the big screen, ABC will release the weekly series in the fall.
Who are The Inhumans? The Inhumans were first introduced into the Marvel Comics, in 1965, by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. During the Kree-Skrull War, which occurred millions of years ago in Earth time, the Kree alien species set up a station on Uranus. As they worked on the station they noticed life on Earth had genetic potential. The Kree started experimenting with humans by splicing Eternals DNA into Cro-Magnons.
The Krees’ goal was two-fold; they wanted to stop their own evolutionary stagnation, as well as create a powerful mutant race of soldiers, to help them fight the Skrulls. Though they were successful in their experiments, the Kree abandoned it.
However, their test subjects, the Inhumans, survived and formed their own society. They thrived in seclusion and developed advanced technology. After experimenting with the mutagenic Terrigen Mist, they found that although they acquired various powers, the mist also caused genetic damage and deformities.
The Unspoken was once the leader of the Inhumans but was dethroned by the current king, Black Bolt. Bolt’s royal family consists of Maximus the Mad, Triton, Medusa, Karnak, Gorgon, Crystal, and their dog Lockjaw. Moreover, Medusa and Crystal were members of Marvel Comics, Fantastic Four and Crystal also teamed with the Avengers. “The Inhumans” will surround the never been told story and epic adventures of Black Bolt.
ABC’s Other Marvel Comic Series “The Inhumans” marks the latest series to join the ABC network lineup. Unfortunately, last season, the network canceled “Agent Carter,” after two seasons. They also passed on a spin-off of “Agents of SHIELD.”
However, Marvel Comics is teaming up with Hulu on one of their other comic book-based series, which is in development. Other projects include the upcoming “X-Men” spin-off of “Legion,” on FX.
IMAX Marks Its First Debut With ‘Marvel’s The Inhumans’ Marvel Comic’s presentation of “The Inhumans” was originally slated for release in 2018, as a movie, rather than a series. However, it was pushed back to 2019, to make room for the Marvel Comic movie, “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” before it was pulled from the schedule, in April 2016.
IMAX is setting an unprecedented first, by hosting the premiere of the Marvel Comics television series. The reason being, IMAX is financing the pilot. Co-chairman of Disney Media Networks Ben Sherwood stated:
This unprecedented alliance represents a bold, innovative approach to launching great TV content for a worldwide audience. It highlights Disney|ABC’s unrelenting commitment to finding new and creative ways to showcasing our very best programming and increasing global engagement and reach.
After the series premiere in IMAX theaters, Marvel Comics’ “The Inhumans” will move to ABC for the remaining six episodes.

1441,Comment on Philippines Voids Building Permit Of Trump Tower In Makati City by Shirley Barnett,"adobochron 7 Comments A rendering of the Trump Tower in Makati City, Philippines 
MAKATI CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) – When completed by the end of 2016, the Trump Tower in the Philippines will be among the country’s tallest buildings . But the Trump name may disappear from this upscale residential building. 
Launched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization. It will be managed by Century Properties Management Inc. To rise at 250 meters above ground, the 56-story building is designed by award-winning international architectural firm Broadway Malyan. 
“It’s really just an iconic, modern building, very tall, very chic, something that really symbolizes everything that a Trump project means,” said Eric Trump, son of Donald, and executive vice president of development and acquisition. 
It is located at the corner of Kalayaan Avenue and Salamanca Street in Makati City. 
But today, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued an executive order canceling the building permit of the Trump Tower. 
Duterte called Donald Trump and his organization “persona non grata” for the Republican presidential candidate’s recent comments about the Philippines. 
It will be recalled that in one of his campaign speeches, Trump lumped the Philippines with other countries with terrorism links, calling for the banning Filipinos from immigrating to the United States. Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. 
“If we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,” Duterte said. 
Asked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, “I will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.”

1442,"As Obama Heads to Vietnam, Current Events Overshadow History - The New York Times","HANOI, Vietnam  —   When Bill Clinton landed in this   capital 16 years ago, the first American president to visit since the end of the Vietnam War, his mission was to put that conflict behind him, and the trip was among the most remarkable of his presidency. When President Obama arrives here early Monday, his task may be a bit less dramatic, but is in many ways far more ambitious. These two countries, bedeviled by decades of misunderstandings, violence and wariness, now have the chance to create a partnership that seemed unlikely even three years ago. Since then, China’s expansion in the South China Sea has deeply shaken a new Vietnamese government. While the leadership here has not let up on its repression of its people  —   the police have beaten protesters in demonstrations over an environmental disaster  —   it now appears more interested in playing one superpower off against the other, perhaps even giving the Pentagon some rotating access to key Vietnamese ports. It would not be an alliance neither side seems ready for that. But it could throw Beijing off balance in the daily shadowboxing over who will dominate one of the world’s most strategically vital waterways. “It does show how history can work in unpredictable ways,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser who spent time over the past two years luring Myanmar out of its shell. “Even the worst conflicts can be relatively quickly left behind. ” In many parts of Asia, Mr. Obama’s strategy of focusing on the region is still more of a slogan than an operational plan. He has been drawn back into Middle East conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. But in this part of Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, he seems on the verge of the kind of progress Mr. Clinton could only imagine during that first visit, only 10 months before the Sept. 11 attacks changed America’s priorities. Slurping noodles in a shop in Ho Chi Minh City at the end of that trip, Mr. Clinton wondered aloud to a reporter whether the Communist leaders in Vietnam were really willing to turn away from their traditional link to China. It turned out they were not. But now the Chinese, who hindered American efforts during the Vietnam War, are making things easier for the United States. For years, the Communist Party leadership in Vietnam, headed by Nguyen Phu Trong, ignored Chinese activity off the country’s coast even as its deeply nationalistic population became increasingly alarmed. But in 2014, China placed a   drilling rig to explore for oil and gas right off Vietnam, and Mr. Trong, the party’s general secretary, could not even get his phone calls to Beijing returned. He registered his protest by visiting Mr. Obama in the Oval Office last year, an unsubtle signal to the Chinese that Vietnam had other options. But with a military leadership still full of veterans of the American War, as it is known here, the warming of ties has proceeded at a deliberate pace. Ahead of Mr. Obama’s visit, a parade of American officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Daniel Russel, the State Department’s most senior Asia hand, have been showing up in Hanoi. Their goal has been to get enough human rights guarantees from the Vietnamese to allow for the lifting of sanctions on arms sales to Vietnam and perhaps the return of American military units to its shores for the first time since the chaotic helicopter evacuation from Saigon that is seared in the American memory. For most Vietnamese, half of whom are under 30,   and increasingly savvy about the world around them, those memories have little meaning to their lives or ambitions. Poll after poll shows that improved ties with the United States are highly sought. And they demonstrated their power when they took to the streets in recent weeks over a huge fish kill, believed to have resulted from a spill by a   steel plant. The government crackdown that followed was not exactly part of the game plan before Mr. Obama’s arrival. Mr. Obama is making his first visit late in his presidency he has already been to Myanmar twice. But unlike Mr. Clinton and President George W. Bush, he arrives without the burden of having to explain what he was doing during the war by the time he turned 18, Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, had fallen. For Mr. Obama, the trip has its political sensitivities. On the campaign trail, Republicans will almost certainly cast it as another stop on an    “apology tour. ” During his visit in November 2006, Mr. Bush avoided any notion of an apology in part by avoiding most Vietnamese. His attention was focused on the Iraq war, then in its worst phase, and the trip was overshadowed by questions of whether the United States was entering another quagmire. (“We’ll succeed unless we quit,” Mr. Bush said when pressed on the comparisons.) Mr. Obama has made clear that pragmatism outweighs other factors when it comes to maneuvering around Beijing. From a practical viewpoint, a decision to lift the arms embargo against Vietnam would have minimal effects  —   the Vietnamese military still likes Russia’s   prices for arms  —   but it would be symbolically important. “The delicate balance is that we need to have both a constructive relationship with China and the ability to be firm on some issues,” Mr. Rhodes said in an interview. Then there is the question of the reception Mr. Obama will receive. He is more popular here and in Europe than he is at home. His aides are clearly hoping for a welcome more like the one Mr. Clinton received in November 2000. Mr. Clinton spoke to students, took in the sights, went shopping and spent hours in a rice field outside Hanoi, sifting the dirt for the remains of a downed American pilot alongside the pilot’s sons, who had accompanied the president. Mr. Obama’s schedule is very light on the war, and very focused on the future. After meetings on Monday with the country’s leadership, he will spend Tuesday with dissidents and then deliver a speech. Then he will head to Ho Chi Minh City, landing at the airport that was once the hub of the American military effort, and will meet with entrepreneurs. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will hold a forum with members of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, a signature effort of his to strengthen ties with a remarkably young population throughout the region.",0
1443,"Jerusalem Unity Day: Republicans, Democrats Join Forces To Celebrate Israel’s Eternal Capital - Breitbart","WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Over 25 Jewish organizations and Republican and Democratic lawmakers convened at the U. S. Capitol Visitor’s Center on Wednesday to mark and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jerusalem Day and reaffirm that Jerusalem is Israel’s eternal capital. [Jerusalem Day is a national holiday in Israel that celebrates the country’s reunification of Jerusalem following the Six Day War of 1967. Jerusalem Day this year is officially celebrated on Tuesday, May 23, when President Donald Trump will be visiting the city. The Capital Hill event, dubbed Jerusalem Unity Day, was held six days before.  Martin Oliner,   of the Religious Zionists of America, organized Wednesday’s event. He told Breitbart News, “I’ve brought 25 Jewish organizations together from all over a full plurality of disparate Jewish organizations that often don’t agree, but we’ve come here for unity. ” He said, “We’re here to thank God and we’re here to thank Congress for the wonderful relationship that we have together. The U. S.  relationship is stronger than ever. We want to keep it strong and we’re here to really celebrate this wonderful miracle that has occurred. ” He said he believes it’s “critical” that Trump moves the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “This has been our home, our capital for 3, 300 years since King David founded it. We have been praying to come back to Jerusalem for over 2, 000 years our generation had the pleasure of having that happen during their lifetime. So I feel extraordinary and that’s what we are here to celebrate today. ” “As VP of the Orthodox Jewish Chamber of Commerce, one of the   of the event with Martin Oliner, I came to join with other   and over 25 senators and congressmen who came to show support,” Odeleya Jacobs told Breitbart News. “The event created an awareness of the great miracle that God did by reuniting Jerusalem to all of Israel and proclaiming Jerusalem the eternal capital of the Jewish people. ” Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) who has already visited several location in Jerusalem for the potential embassy move, said, “And for me, what better time to finally follow through with our promise if we relocate the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem” than next week when Trump is in the Holy Land. “I think there’s a lot of risk if we don’t follow through with our word to move the embassy to Jerusalem,” DeSantis said. He added that many of the Arab states respect “strength and decisiveness. ” He noted that some in the Arab world might not like that Trump follows through on his word, “but, man, they are going to respect it. ” “Look, I think at this point, not recognizing Jerusalem as the unified and indivisible capital of Israel actually hurts the peace process,” he continued, “because I think Palestinian Arabs still believe that somehow Israel is a transient country that will eventually be wiped off the map. So moving the embassy there is a great statement to say Israel is here to stay. And if you want to act destructively, fine. But we are not going to play these games and act like we don’t know where the Western Wall is located. ” However, DeSantis noted, “I’m not necessarily predicting that that’s going to happen, but I think if you’re ever going to do it, with all the celebrations that are going to be going on next week, just think of how much energy this would add to that not only in Israel, but here in the United States, for the millions and millions of Americans who would like to see this happen. ” A   poll conducted by Smith Research found that in the absence of a solid vow to move the U. S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, Trump’s approval rating among Jewish Israelis has dropped by 23 percentage points since he took office in January. Vice President and Dean of Touro College Dr. Robert Goldschmidt told Breitbart News he came from New York “to celebrate a milestone anniversary with the salute to the reunification of Jerusalem, which I think is a historic event for people of all faiths and all creeds. ” Rabbi Marc Volk, executive director of the National Council of Young Israel, told Breitbart News, “Jerusalem is the holy center of Eretz Israel, the State of Israel, and moreover the world. We know that so many individuals across the spectrum of religious life invariably go to the Kotel, the Western Wall, to offer prayer. ” Volk added, “The Kotel, the Western Wall, is a remnant of the Holy Temple that once stood in Jerusalem. We believe Jerusalem is part of Israel. ” Among lawmakers present at Wednesday’s event were Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Ed Royce ( ) Sen. Ben Cardin ( ) Sen. John Barrasso ( ) Rep. Steny Hoyer ( ) Rep. Ileana   ( ) Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) Rep. Lee Zeldin ( ) Rep. Eliot Engel ( ) and Rep. Brad Schneider ( ). Sen. Ben Cardin said, “Israel is at great risk right now. We know that there are so many forces around the world that are trying to comprise the legitimacy of Israel. We see that in the effort of the Palestinians to take the negotiations with Israel to the United Nations rather than direct negotiations. We cannot let that happen. ” He added, “there is no separation between the United States and Israel. We are Israel’s only clear ally and friend and we must make sure that remains solid, bipartisan and that we will stand by Israel. ” Cardin also blasted the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against the State of Israel. He stated, “The support for Israel should be guaranteed in this year’s budget. Funding the memorandum of understanding, funding the Iron Dome, funding the technology that makes Israel safer and the United States safer. ” He said America must stand by the Jewish state to ensure support for Israel remains strong and bipartisan. Senator John Barrasso blasted the United Nations’ abuses against Israel. “We, as a Senate, say it is time to get rid of what you are doing at the United Nations. ” Rep. Brad Schneider began his speech by saying, “b’ruchim habayim,” which in Hebrew means “welcome” and “blessed are those who come. ” Schneider said the “permanent” unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel “depends on the bipartisan support in this body. ” He told those gathered that he came to Wednesday’s event “to make sure Jerusalem remains the undivided capital of Israel. ” Rep. Tom Suozzi ( ) told the crowd that he introduced House Resolution 328 on the House floor on Wednesday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem “and for other purposes. ” HR 328 was cosponsored by Rep. Francis Rooney ( ) who served as the former ambassador to the Vatican under President George W. Bush’s commission. “I want you to know that I’m 100 percent on the team,” Suozzi said. “I’ll do whatever I can do be a strong defender of Israel through thick and thin. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.",0
1444,Trump Immigration Policies Pose Conflict for Police in ‘Sanctuary Cities’ - The New York Times,"President Trump’s sweeping new immigration policies  —   which include efforts to shine a harsh national spotlight on cities that released undocumented immigrants who went on to be accused of serious crimes  —   are sharply increasing the legal and political risks confronting local law enforcement officials. As Mr. Trump ratchets up the pressure on   sanctuary cities through what some advocates are denouncing as a “  ” campaign to force them to work more closely with federal immigration authorities, police and sheriff’s departments are being caught in a crossfire. In Denver, Sheriff Patrick Firman, who runs the local jail, has long received one set of instructions from the   city government and local advocates. The city attorney warned him against detaining anyone without a warrant. The American Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue him if he did. Immigrants’ rights groups applied the added deterrent of local political pressure. So Mr. Firman’s department began doing what many law enforcement officers around the country have learned to do: balance contradictory requests. When the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency wants to deport one of his inmates, the jail sends a fax notifying ICE before the inmate is about to walk free  —   leaving it to federal agents to show up and make an arrest. But the fax is not necessarily sent with a great deal of advance notice. In the case of Ever Valles, 19, a Mexican national awaiting trial for car theft, the Denver jail’s fax was sent in the middle of the night in late December, 10 hours after Mr. Valles posted bail but less than a   before he walked free. ICE was nowhere to be seen. Last Friday, Mr. Valles was charged with a much more serious crime: murdering a man at a light rail station in a robbery gone awry. Now, Mr. Firman is in the eye of a political storm that highlights the precarious position confronting many law enforcement officials. Immigration officials accused Mr. Firman of ignoring their detainer request. “Had the officer for ICE been sitting at the fax machine, waiting for it to come in, it still would not have been enough time for us to come and get him,” said Shawn Neudauer, an ICE spokesman. The Fox News host Bill O’Reilly declared that Mr. Firman and Denver’s mayor had “blood on their hands. ” Angry messages quickly began flooding the sheriff’s department and its social media pages. Mr. Firman declined to be interviewed. Officials at the jail, which releases about 100 people a day and receives three to five detainer requests a week, say they try their best to cooperate with immigration officials and to notify them in a timely manner, despite calls from local advocates not to communicate with the agency and to release undocumented immigrants through a side door to elude federal agents. The Trump administration hopes the firestorm will help shift public opinion in cities that have vowed to protect their undocumented populations. Yet, the attacks on Mr. Firman do not acknowledge the confusing and often conflicting rules that have led to complaints by the law enforcement agents. United States appeals courts have ruled that federal detainer requests are not a substitute for a warrant or for the probable cause required to get one. “You can’t just pick up the phone and say, ‘Please hold an individual,’” said Jonathan F. Thompson, executive director of the   National Sheriffs’ Association. When federal officials began issuing detainers in 2008 under a pilot program called Secure Communities, most jurisdictions treated the requests as mandatory. But after American citizens were mistakenly held, filed suit and won costly damage awards, some jurisdictions stopped cooperating. More confusion occurred when cities and states adopted their own policies spelling out when to turn over undocumented immigrants. As compliance with detainers dropped sharply, the Obama administration ended the program and introduced a new one allowing local jurisdictions far more leeway to decide when to cooperate. But that has caused even more confusion among law enforcement officials, when what they want is clarity about their obligations, Mr. Thompson said. He said his members were relieved this week when Mr. Trump reinstated the Secure Communities program. But Mr. Thompson said the rules surrounding federal detainers were still “a work in progress. ” It remains to be seen how the reinstated program will avoid the same legal setbacks that took the program down under President Obama. “We’re all trying to figure out how to do that as quickly as possible,” Mr. Thompson said, mentioning a meeting he and some of his members had recently with Mr. Trump. Recent clashes between local and federal officials have only muddied the waters. In New York City this week, ICE officials publicly assailed the city government after an undocumented Salvadoran teenager with suspected ties to a violent gang, Estivan Rafael Marques Velasquez, was released from Rikers Island despite a federal request for assistance with his deportation. “Honoring a detainer request is not about politics,” Thomas R. Decker, director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE in New York, said in a news release. “It is about keeping New York citizens safe. ” But the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, vigorously defends that policy, adopted by the City Council in 2014, under which only those accused of 170 serious felonies  —   such as arson, robbery or homicide  —   can be turned over to immigration enforcement agents. And in a radio interview last month, the mayor suggested that turning local police into a deportation force would make the city more dangerous because fewer people would report crimes or cooperate with investigations. “If so many of our fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented feared to communicate with the local authorities because they thought they might be deported, we couldn’t run our city,” he said. The case of Mr. Velasquez, 18, who has been arrested six times since 2014 on charges that remain sealed because he was a minor at the time, highlights how quickly public opinion can shift if an undocumented immigrant commits a serious crime. A trenchant New York Post headline  —   “ ‘Sanctuary City’ Law Let Gang Member Walk Free From Rikers”  —   lit up social media as Trump supporters across the country railed against New York’s defiance. The prospect of more such cases being publicized has rattled New York officials. “I don’t think that litigating this in the public sphere is the best path forward,” said Nisha Agarwal, the city’s commissioner for immigrant affairs. Mr. Velasquez  —   known to city officials as Steven Marquez  —   was involved in a clash last year between youths outside Queens County Criminal Courthouse witnesses told investigators they heard gunshots. He was charged with felony weapons possession, which would have made him eligible to be handed over to ICE under New York City’s policy. But he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor,   weapons possession. He served less than a year at Rikers Island, where investigators noted that he had a tattoo associating him with the Salvadoran gang  . On Feb. 16, he was released from jail. Hours later, he was rearrested by federal agents at a Queens apartment, according to ICE, whose agents say it is far more dangerous to arrest someone on the streets than in jail. To highlight the additional risks they say they must take in sanctuary cities, ICE agents make a point of issuing news releases that criticize jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with deportations. That kind of   warfare is almost certain to escalate. This week, the Department of Homeland Security ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release weekly reports of crimes committed by immigrants who were the subjects of detainer requests that went ignored. Some sanctuary cities view the move as beyond the pale. “This is a shaming list, a scarlet letter that the federal government is going to put on jurisdictions around the country,” said Dennis Herrera, San Francisco’s city attorney. “We welcome an open and honest discussion about immigration and crime, because numerous studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be incarcerated than   individuals. ” But Mr. Thompson, of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said the effort was merely meant to illuminate the constraints under which law enforcement agencies are operating. The new directive “wasn’t written in a way to shame anyone,” he said. “It was written in a way to give the department a handle on, ‘Why can’t these criminal aliens be held? Is it state law or local law preventing a sheriff from cooperating? ’”",0

I see the same potential and value in all forms of life. I don’t see humanity as any better or worse than any other species and if I were to attribute ""genius"" to anything it would be to the spirit that binds with the human body. I don’t think she took it that way but her response was emotive as it was, no point in adding to it. She feels how she feels, I do how I do.

1446,SYRIA: Heavy Fighting as Rebels Storm Aleppo in Desperate Offensive,"Reality check media SYRIA: Heavy Fighting as Rebels Storm Aleppo in Desperate Offensive 
Hundreds, possibly thousands of fighters attacking along with dozens of suicide bombers in a desperate bid to prevent Syrian army from wrapping up the battle of Aleppo before Hillary presumably takes over in January Originally appeared at Middle East Eye 
Car bombs and rocket fire shook Aleppo on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege by the Syrian government, which launched a counteroffensive under cover of air strikes, trying to retake areas they had lost to rebels the day before, activists and state media said. 
The government said it had pushed back an attack on the south and west of the city, but the rebels and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said rebels had taken control of an entire suburb in the southwest corner of Aleppo, VOA reported. 
The offensive, launched on Friday, aims to break through a three-month encirclement of the battered city's eastern districts, where more than 250,000 people live without access to food or humanitarian aid. 
""In just a few days, we will open the way for our besieged brothers,"" rebel commander Abu Mustafa told AFP from the frontline district of Dahiyet al-Assad, on the southwestern outskirts of Aleppo. rebels_battle_to_break_siege_of_aleppo_as_government_counter_attacks_middle_east_eye.png 
Fighting and air strikes pounded nearly all of Aleppo's western outskirts, with the most intense clashes reported in the districts of al-Zahraa and Dahiyet al-Assad. 
Yasser al-Youssef of the Noureddin al-Zinki rebel faction said opposition fighters opened a new front in al-Zahraa on Saturday with a massive car bombing. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said rebels and allied militants have unleashed a barrage of rocket fire and at least 10 car bombs since their assault began. 
The Britain-based group said two days of fighting had killed at least 30 government forces and allied fighters as well as 26 Syrian rebels, but it did not give a toll for foreign militants battling alongside the opposition. 
At least 21 civilians, including two children, have been killed in rebel bombardment since Friday morning. 
Syrian state news agency SANA said rockets fired by opposition groups on Saturday wounded six people including a child in two government-held districts. 
The offensive has seen more than 1,500 rebels from the provinces of Aleppo and nearby Idlib amass along a front stretching for 15km down the city's western edges. 
Their aim is to work their way east through a sprawling military complex, then to the district of al-Hamdaniyeh to break through government lines. rebels_battle_to_break_siege_of_aleppo_as_government_counter_attacks_middle_east_eye.png 
Fighting on Saturday was so fierce around al-Zahraa and Dahiyet al-Assad that the explosions and gunfire could be heard across Aleppo's eastern half, AFP's correspondent there said. 
""There have not been clashes this intense in al-Zahraa since 2012,"" when opposition fighters seized Aleppo's east, said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. 
He said the pro-government forces’ counterattack on Saturday had managed to recapture several positions in Dahiyet al-Assad, where rebels had scored a major advance. 
An AFP correspondent who visited the district saw deserted streets and extensive damage to buildings battered by air strikes and artillery fire. 
Syria's second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the country's five-year civil war that began with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300,000 people. 
Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment, including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage. 
Last week, Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian truce"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave the east, but few did so. 
Russia, whose intervention in September 2015 with air strikes in support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces was seen as a game-changer, says it has not bombed Aleppo since 18 October. 
The Observatory said on Saturday that Russian raids have been battering Aleppo's western battlefronts, but it confirmed that the halt to Moscow's aerial bombing of the city itself was holding. 
The Russian military said on Friday it had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorisation to resume the raids. 
But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin ""considers it inappropriate at the current moment,"" adding that the president thought it necessary to ""continue the humanitarian pause"" in Aleppo. 
The United States on Friday accused the government of using starvation as a weapon of war - a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. 
Rejecting Kremlin claims that attacks on Aleppo have stopped, a US official told AFP that ""the regime has rejected UN requests to deliver aid to eastern Aleppo - using starvation as a weapon of war"". 
Aleppo's front line runs through the heart of the city, dividing rebels in the east from government troops in the west. 
It lies at the crossroads of key transport routes, making it a strategic prize for both sides and a potential bargaining chip for both opposition and government forces if UN-brokered peace talks are resumed.",0
1447,Is This The End For Hillary Clinton?,"We Are Change 
Hillary Clinton hasn’t been the most favored candidate. In fact, she is one of the most disliked candidates to ever run for president. Election day is just on the horizon, and as this presidential race draws to a close, the indictment of Hillary Clinton seems increasingly more likely with every new scandal that comes around the corner.

On Wednesday, a Fox News report revealed two sources with “intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations” had stated, that the probe of the Clinton Foundation would continue to be ongoing after the election. However it is not certain as to whether this will result in an indictment yet. Fox News redacted the earlier claim stating that this would indeed lead to an indictment. These sources also told Fox News anchor, Bret Baier, that this investigation was being treated as ‘very high priority’, with ‘a lot of’ evidence having been gathered, even before the Wikileaks revelations , which have revealed the absolute highest levels of corruption from within the Clinton Campaign.
These sources also stated that they’re “looking into possible pay-for-play interaction between secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the foundation” and that this investigation has been “going on for more than a year.” The FBI have interviewed individuals who are suspected to be linked with this activity.
In an article published by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, it was stated that:
“Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said.”
We are uncertain as to what these recordings entail, but it’s evident that their contents must be of substantial importance, as it was concerning enough to contribute to the reopening of the Clinton Foundation investigation.
Meanwhile, The FBI have also discovered new, not duplicated, emails that they believe to have come from Hillary’s server. However, it is currently unknown as to whether they contain classified information. These emails were discovered whilst combing through former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop—after a sexting scandal involving a 15-year-old girl.
With an “avalanche of new information coming every day,” this investigation will have wide-reaching implications for the Clinton Foundation. Appearing more intensive and expansive than we ever could have imagined. The reopening of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation has also show Trump to have gained support in the polls, appearing almost even with Clinton in most polls, while the L.A Times shows Trump to have a 4 per cent lead.
Despite attempts on behalf of Department of Justice officials to shut this investigation down, a report from the Wall Street Journal states FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe refused to close the case, calling it a “validly predicated investigation” while discussing this with other DOJ officials. The FBI investigation into the Clinton campaign is now running parallel to the reopened criminal investigation into Hillary’s private email server, which she created violating State Department regulations.
With an onslaught of evidence confirming the Clinton campaign’s deceit and rampant corruption, it is highly unlikely that they’ll come out of this ordeal unscathed. If she were to be elected, there are a large number of possible charges Hillary could be facing whilst in the White House. Including perjury, obstruction of justice, bribery, pay-for-play, and undoubtedly many more.
Earlier today, in a morbid turn of events, batch 30 of the Wikileaks Podesta emails revealed the sadistic past times of the Podesta brothers, having been invited to a ‘Spirit Cooking’ dinner with performance artist Marina Abramovic. The grotesque nature of Clinton’s inner circle really is the gift that keeps on giving. From raunchy sexting to ritual sacrifice, this election cycle has divulged the darkest, more abhorrent secrets held by this crooked campaign. If there is any justice left in the world, it is morally essential that Hillary Clinton and her mob go down, to prison, as well as hell.

1448,Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up),"Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up) Posted on Home » Silver » Silver News » Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up) No, this is not a post about some new Chinese law firm. Instead, it’s just an update on the gold and silver markets which, while refusing to go further down, aren’t making much progress to the upside, either. From Craig Hemke, TFMetalsReport : Today’s message: A few more slightly positive US economic datapoints and these are likely enough to make a December FF rate hike a fait accompli. Again, though…and I can’t stress this enough… we have traced out a pattern that is remarkably similar to last October and November in the run up to the most recent FF rate hike. And what happened beginning the very next day? Well, by now you know the story. The week of the October 2o15 FOMC produced a high trade in the Dec15 contract of $1183. As the Fedlines were digested later that week, it became clear that the Fed was going to raise the FF rate at the December 2015 meeting come hell or high water. And they did. However, take a close look at how gold traded in the days and weeks between the Oct15 FOMC and the December rate hike. Price fell from $1180 to $1050 in about five weeks but note that it bottomed well in advance of the actual “news” of the FF rate hike. This 10+% drop was fueled by a near panic level liquidation of the Specs at the Comex. How bad was it? From the CoT survey of 10/27/15, just one day before that fateful FOMC and Fedlines, the Large Specs in gold were NET long more than 157,000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short nearly 166,000. Just five weeks later, the NET position of the Large Specs was down to only 10,000 contracts with the Commercial position reaching an alltime low of just 2,911 contracts NET short. We even speculated at the time that there were some days, intraweek, where the Gold Commercials were actually and historically NET LONG. Well now compare last autumn to our current situation. Just as back then, a FF rate hike is a near certainty at the FOMC in December. However, as you know, the anticipatory move in gold began a few weeks ago with the beatdown and purposeful break of both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages in late September. Take a look at the current chart and compare it to the one posted above: In 2015, we had the October FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Before price turned, we slogged through 5-6 weeks of consolidation and CoT improvement before the blast higher began. In 2016, we had the September FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Price is attempting to bottom and turn while the CoT improves, but it doesn’t seem ready just yet to begin moving consistently higher. In 2015, the turn in gold began once the actual rate hike took place. The rate hike and forecast for 3 or 4 more in 2016 led to dollar strength, which led to Chinese devaluations, which led to emerging market crises, which led to equity selloffs and the gold price was already 5-10% off its lows by late January before the real fun began with the USDJPY falling 10% in early February. Are we headed down that same path again? It certainly appears so as the first major salvos of Chinese yuan devaluation were fired last week: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-20/dear-janet-china-devalues-most-august-yuan-tumbles-lowest-sept-2010 And, just as in 2015, the CoT is certainly undergoing a makeover, too. From the survey of 9/27/16, the Large Specs in gold were NET long 292,000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short 325,000. As of last Tuesday and just three weeks later, the Large Specs were down to 180,000 NET long for a reduction of 38% and the Commercials were NET short 203,000. To be sure, these are still hefty positions but much more “bullish” than the levels seen through the past summer. And now check the full long-term chart. You can see again the similarities between now and last fall. Also be sure to note, however, that the trend has clearly changed and that price is pointed higher. So while we must still deal with the consolidation for a while longer…the Ying and Yang mentioned in the title of this post…it is clear to me that the trend remains higher and that the now-expected FOMC FF rate hike will be simply another “sell-the-rumor, buy-the-news” type of event for gold and silver. This current period of relative quiet should be used to prepare for the next leg UP, not some sort of new bear market where paper prices are sharply falling. Use your time wisely and continue to prepare/stack accordingly.

1449,Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence,"Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything Image Credits: flickr, cali4beach . 
Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? 
All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , “voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.” Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
“If anybody can sit there and say they don’t think this is a contentious election, then they aren’t paying much attention,” Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are “soft targets” that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … 
“There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn’t have 15 or 20 years ago,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. “ What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that’s certainly concerning.” 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … 
“We don’t want to lose an election because you know what I’m talking about,” Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. “Because you know what? That’s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .” 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
“I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,” Moynihan said. “You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.” 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesn’t look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats don’t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… 
“It’s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,” Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book “ Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,” previously told The Christian Science Monitor. “Voting was very, very dangerous. I don’t think anyone’s suggesting that we’re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.” 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles",0
1450,Menendez: ’Not Sure’ What Message Is Sent Commuting Manning While Raising Concern About WikiLeaks and Election - Breitbart,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Senator Robert Menendez ( ) reacted to the commutation of Chelsea Manning’s sentence by stating, “at a time that we are seriously questioning what Russia did, as it relates to our recent elections, and the role that WikiLeaks  …    has played in that regard, I’m not sure what type of message we send here. ”  Menendez said, “I don’t know why he did it, and so, I look forward to hearing his reasoning, because I just heard about it. But the reality is I have serious concerns about equivocating sentences when national security’s at stake. What happened here is that, literally hundreds of thousands of documents were released. It put national security at risk. It put individual operatives at risk. It put our national interests at risk with other countries. And at a time that we are seriously questioning what Russia did, as it relates to our recent elections, and the role that WikiLeaks  …    has played in that regard, I’m not sure what type of message we send here. And, so, I’m really surprised that the president took this action and I have concerns about what message we send about ultimately revealing sensitive national security documents. ” He further wondered, “[W]hat message do we send for the next person who thinks that they can get a treasure trove of documents released because something inspires them to do so and the consequences that flow from that?” And “if at the end of the day, you think you can do that, and then have your sentence commuted, I’m not sure that we send the right message. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
1451,Two Candidates. Two Speeches. One Cliché After Another From Clinton and Trump. - The New York Times,"It was a historic night that called for soaring rhetoric and unvarnished authenticity. Instead, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump delivered victory speeches on Tuesday that leaned heavily on campaign clichés  —   in many cases, the same ones. On the page, anyway, the ideological and stylistic chasms that separate them start to dissolve in a sea of overlapping oratorical devices, similar phrases and at times identical word choice. Are their speechwriters out of juice? Or is the hackneyed phrase just too irresistible? We identified the passages that sounded the most alike: TRUMP: Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another. CLINTON: Now you are writing a new chapter of that story. It’s a country, not a book. But this speechmaking construct won’t die. Mrs. Clinton tries to infuse the familiar trope with the concept of inclusivity. Mr. Trump just trots out the same old wooden metaphor. _____ TRUMP: This is not a testament to me, but a testament to all of the people who believed real change . .. CLINTON: Tonight’s victory is not about one person . .. So we all owe so much to those who came before and tonight belongs to all of you. It’s not really about me, it’s about you! But let’s be honest: it’s really about them. This   device is a clever way to claim a mandate without sounding  . Mr. Trump makes the most direct claim of humility. Mrs. Clinton makes a richer historical reference to previous barrier breakers. _____ TRUMP: And our country will never, ever back down. CLINTON: Our history has moved in that direction, thanks to generations of Americans who refuse to give up or back down. There’s no backing down from this bromide. _____ TRUMP: I’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s eyes. CLINTON: And I learned about those persistent problems and the unfinished promise of America that you’re living with. Ever since Bill Clinton found the most economical way to say it in 1992, speechwriters have striven to complicate the sentiment: “I feel your pain. ” _____ TRUMP: This election isn’t about Republican or Democrat, it’s about who runs the country. The special interests or the people. CLINTON: We want a government that listens to the people, not the power brokers . .. Everyone is a populist in 2016, even residents of Fifth Avenue and Chappaqua, N. Y. _____ TRUMP: Our campaign received more primary votes than any G. O. P. campaign in history. CLINTON: The first time in our nation’s history that a woman will be a major party’s nominee. Everyone wants to make history.

1452,’Dilbert’ Creator Scott Adams to Stop Donating to Alma Mater UC Berkeley - Breitbart,"Dilbert creator Scott Adams announced in a blog post that he will stop donating to this alma mater, UC Berkeley, in the aftermath of the riots that erupted on campus last week in response to a scheduled event featuring Breitbart editor MILO. [Adams, who earned an MBA degree at UC Berkeley, announced that he is terminating his support of the public institution over concerns that he wouldn’t “feel safe or welcome on campus. ”  Speaking of Hitler, I’m ending my support of UC Berkeley, where I got my MBA years ago. I have been a big supporter lately, with both my time and money, but that ends today. I wish them well, but I wouldn’t feel safe or welcome on the campus. A Berkeley professor made that clear to me recently. He seems smart, so I’ll take his word for it. I’ve decided to side with the Jewish gay immigrant who has an   boyfriend, not the hypnotized   in black masks who were clubbing people who hold different points of view. I feel that’s reasonable, but I know many will disagree, and possibly try to club me to death if I walk on campus. Adams writes that a Berkeley professor “made it clear” to him that he wouldn’t be welcome on campus due to his political beliefs. In July 2016, Adams regularly placed a disclaimer at the bottom of his blog posts which claimed that his endorsement of Hillary Clinton was made out of concern for his personal safety. Note: I endorsed Hillary Clinton  —   for my personal safety  —   because I live in California. It isn’t safe to be viewed as a Trump supporter where I live. My politics don’t align with either candidate, but backing Clinton reduces my odds of dying at the hands of my fellow citizens. (And yes, I am 100% serious. It just happens to be funny by coincidence.) Adams frequently praised President Trump during his run for the White House and was one of the few public figures who predicted his victory.",0

[The campus carry legislation is contained in House Bill 630, which is sponsored by state Rep. Jered Taylor ( ).  The Missourian reports that HB 630 would remove numerous “  zones” around the state, including those in “child care centers, public universities and churches. ” This means child care workers with concealed carry permits would be able to have a gun at hand to protect children, permit holders would be able to keep a gun with them on campus to defend their lives and the lives of fellow students, and   could be armed to fend off an attack during church services around the state. State Rep. Jon Carpenter (  City) was taken aback by  efforts to roll back “  zones” and asked, “Is this for show or is this for real?” Rep. Taylor responded, “I want individuals to be able to choose whether or not they carry a gun to protect themselves and others if the need were to arise. ” He added, “Criminals know where the   zones are.

In dem daraus entstandenen preisverdächtigen Politiker-Porträt, das Cumhuriyet-Redakteur Aydiner Korkut mit einem Stück bunter Seife auf einem Fladenbrot-Packpapier verfasste, finden sich mehrere aufschlussreiche Aussagen des HDP-Abgeordneten Erdal Ozbilgin zur Presse- und Meinungsfreiheit sowie zur aktuellen Menschenrechtslage in der Türkei.

""Vor ein paar Jahren hatte er eine Anfrage meinerseits noch aus Zeitgründen abgelehnt."" Dass dieses Interview nun doch zustande kam, sei daher allein Erdogans Verdienst.

1456,Swedish Finance Minister Admits ’Big Problems’ with Economy After Migrant Influx,"Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson has admitted Sweden has “major problems” as a result of the population growth brought on by mass immigration. [Earlier this week, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKL) admitted, by 2020, municipalities face a funding deficit of 40 billion Swedish Krona (£3. 5 billion) to finance services like hospitals and nursing homes.  “Demographic trends show that, with more children and more elderly people, the need for local government services is expected to grow significantly faster than the tax base,” says Annika Wallenskog, chief economist at SKL. Andersson told Swedish Television News (SVT) that “it is quite obvious that we have big problems” as a result of the demographic changes aggravated by mass migration. The Socialist minister stressed the country must hire more staff and build more facilities, and said politicians cannot afford to promise any tax cuts. Sweden’s National Audit Office announced in November that it believes the government “underestimates public spending”. In a piece published by Dagens Nyheter, the office remarked: “”If the government’s forecasts are realised, Sweden will be required to make significant reductions to welfare, and municipalities significant cuts by 2020. “If local government wants to be able to meet the needs of the increased population that is projected, it will have to increase expenditure by 50 billion Swedish Krona beyond what is in the government’s forecast for 2020. ” Granting citizenship to 60, 343 people last year, Sweden saw a record number of new nationals in 2016. The largest share of ‘new Swedes’ hail from Somalia. As a result of its high rate of immigration, Sweden recorded more than 2. 3 million people with a foreign background at the end of the year. The nation’s open borders policy has not been without controversy, however. In February, Breitbart London reported that many libraries in Sweden were refusing to stock Kurdish economist Tino Sanandaji’s “sincere and   analysis” of the country’s immigration policy, alleging the contents were “contrary to human rights”.",0

1458,"Mike Pence ""gay conversion therapy saved my marriage""","By Fink | Leave/Read Comments Vice President-elect Mike Pence claims that a 1983 conversion therapy saved him. 
Indianapolis, IN — In a surprise announcement today, Indiana Governor and Vice President-elect Mike Pence said that gay conversion therapy saved his marriage. The controversial Republican, who was elected the 50th governor of the Hoosier State, has been a long-time proponent of a “Biblical view” on homosexuality and as a member of Congress stated that the legislative branch “should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a ‘discrete and insular minority’ entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.” 
“It[gay conversion therapy] was instrumental in helping me overcoming certain urges,” said the Vice President elect in an interview with Fox News. “With God’s help, and the work of many of his therapists, I was able to seek the straight path when I was a younger man. If it wasn’t for that, I would have never been able to marry.” 
Conversion therapy is psychological treatment or spiritual counseling designed to change a person’s sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual. Such treatments are controversial and are a form of pseudoscience. However many orthodox and fundamentalist Christians believe that it does work, citing numerous examples of success. In more ancient times prior to 1981, conversion therapies in the United States and Western Europe included ice-pick lobotomies, chemical castration and various hormonal treatments. Efforts were largely concentrated on men, as female homosexuality was generally viewed as “hot.” This split along gender lines was due American’s general stupidity. 
Many of Mike Pence’s classmates at Indiana University said the young Pence struggled with “identity issues.” 
“Oh Mike was always a well-groomed sharp dresser,” said University of Chicago Professor James Badwater who was a dorm roommate of Mr. Pence in 1983. “He was private and kept to himself. He had a large collection of Men’s fitness magazines and listened to Wham! continually. He got into the conversion thing the next year, and then immediately married Karen [Mike Pence’s wife] the following year. It’s going to be great to have our first gay Vice President.” 
It’s unclear how this news will impact the Donald Trump administration, if at all, however many GOP insiders maintain that this demonstrates the incoming administration’s commitment to diversity and the “widening” of the party’s platform to be more inclusive of what have traditionally been party outsiders.",0
1459,The Yale Review Did Not Endorse Hillary. The Reason Why Is Hilarious,"Posted on October 27, 2016 
The editorial board at the Yale Review gave the most curious non-endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this election season has yet seen – and with a lesson that most of the Republican political complex and especially nominee Donald Trump should learn, quickly, if he wants to keep himself out of even more legal trouble. 
In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.” 
This year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. 
In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. 
The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. 
Tax-exempt organizations like The Yale Record and the Donald J Trump Foundation must obey certain rules to keep their tax-exempt status – rules that the Trump Foundation has been flouting for its entire existence. Trump’s been using his private foundation – which is funded almost entirely by the donations of other people – to purchase the political support of different groups throughout his campaign , among other more personal purchases like a $20,000 painting of himself , in clear violation of the tax-exempt rules. 
Trump’s foundation has already been suspended from operating in New York for not having the right certification to solicit donors . Such a flagrant disrespect for the laws of the land and of the spirit of “charity” reveal just what kind of man Donald Trump is – a greedy narcissist with no regard for the well-being of others. So take this non-endorsement to heart and applaud their respect for the rules governing tax-exempt organizations. OccupyDemocrats, however, is under no such restrictions, and we heartily encourage you to help shatter the glass ceiling and make former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton our next president. ",0
1460,Trump’s Strike on Syria Has All Sides Asking: What Next? - The New York Times,"President Trump’s decision to strike Syria has upended assumptions about American military involvement in the Middle East, angering adversaries and raising hopes among allies that it signals a new willingness by the United States to deploy force to help its friends and punish its foes. “People are jubilant in the Gulf right now,” said Mohammed Alyahya, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council who is from Saudi Arabia. “What is clear is that Trump understands what American power can change and is willing to use it. ” The swift decision, by a president who had previously shown no interest in entering conflicts like Syria’s, set Mr. Trump apart from his predecessor’s far more cautious approach to the war. The missile strikes on a Syrian airfield inflicted only minor damage and are unlikely to change the dynamics of a complex conflict that rages on local, regional and global levels. On the ground, it pits an array of rebel groups against the Syrian president, Bashar  . Supporting the rebels are nations like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who oppose Mr. Assad and his ally, Iran. The war has also entangled Russia and the United States, and sent shock waves through Europe, which streams of Syrian refugees have fled to. But Mr. Trump’s decision to launch quick strikes raised questions about whether it would give the involved powers pause as they pursue their objectives in a war that seems to have no end in sight. Russia and Iran, who back the Syrian government, have responded angrily to the strikes, while allies who criticized President Barack Obama’s cautious approach have welcomed the change. Some allies renewed their calls for a leadership change in Damascus, although officials in the Trump administration did not portray the strikes as the start of a broader campaign. “A lot of this is an emotional response, but nothing about this strike suggests that the fundamentals of the Syria conflict have shifted,” said Noah Bonsey, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group. As president, Mr. Obama sought to differentiate himself from his predecessor, George W. Bush, by limiting direct American involvement in Middle Eastern wars. That angered some allies. Israel, Saudi Arabia and others accused him of overlooking aggressive moves by Iran in order to clinch a deal to limit its nuclear program. And Persian Gulf states and Turkey were irate when he did not enforce his own “red line” on the use of chemical weapons in Syria by using force against Mr. Assad after an attack in 2013 that killed more than 1, 000 people. Now, many who felt that Mr. Obama’s caution gave a green light to Mr. Assad’s brutality are lauding Mr. Trump for his forcible response to this week’s chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, a town in northern Syria. “Everyone here in Khan Sheikhoun is happy. It is revenge for the families of the victims,” said Yasser Sarmini, a rebel fighter who was in the town at the time of the strike. “Trump is more frank and earnest than Obama. He promised and fulfilled his promise. ” In Turkey, which has long backed Syrian rebels in their effort to topple Mr. Assad, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a rally that he supported the attack but wanted further action. “I want to say we found this positive as a step taken against the war crimes the Assad regime has committed with chemical and conventional weapons,” Mr. Erdogan said. “Is it enough? I don’t reckon it is enough. ” He called for the establishment of “safe zones” inside Syria, an idea considered but ultimately rejected by the Obama administration. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, went further, calling in a televised speech for a leadership change in Syria. “This regime should be removed from Syria right away,” he said. “The best way to do this is to establish the interim government, an interim government without Assad. ” In Israel, which has kept its distance from the war raging across its northern border, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes sent a clear message against the spread of chemical weapons. “Israel fully supports President Trump’s decision and hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regime’s horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere,” he said. But Mr. Trump’s actions could complicate the pursuit of other American priorities, including defeating the Islamic State. Russian officials, who have denied that the Syrian government has retained any chemical weapons, condemned the American attack and suspended their agreement with the United States over the use of Syrian airspace, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday. Russia has argued that the deaths in Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday occurred when a bomb hit a chemical weapons facility belonging to the rebels. So far, Mr. Trump has not clarified whether Thursday’s strikes were a   response to the chemical attack or the start of more direct American involvement. He had previously spoken of cooperating with Russia against the Islamic State, and his spokesman, Sean Spicer, said just last week that Mr. Assad’s staying in power was “a political reality that we have to accept. ” Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Lebanon, said, “It’s too early to call this a game changer, because we don’t know what the next step will be  —   or if there will be a next step. ” Ms. Yahya said she had learned of the strikes in the company of Syrian dissidents in Washington, where some applauded and others stayed silent. “There were a lot of mixed emotions,” she added. “They were worried about what this means, yet at the same time incredibly relieved and happy that someone is finally standing up for them against Assad. ” Some analysts said that even if the strike did not represent a major blow to Mr. Assad’s military abilities, it could be a deterrent by signaling new American assertiveness in the conflict. In Iran, the attack, and the swiftness with which it was executed, caught the establishment by surprise. Most in the crowds at Friday Prayer said they had heard of the attack only through social media. State television broadcast the reaction of the Foreign Ministry hours after the strike. Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, predicted that the country would take the news seriously. “They will choose not to be confrontational towards the U. S. and the West,” Mr. Ghorbanpour said. “Iran will continue to support Bashar   but not at all costs. ” The strikes did not appear to have significantly degraded the ability of Mr. Assad and his allies to wage war. A correspondent in Syria for Rossiya 24, the main   Russian satellite news channel, filed video from Al Shayrat airfield. The barrages of Tomahawk cruise missiles destroyed nine airplanes and littered a runway with shrapnel, among other damage, the reporter said. He posted a photograph on Instagram of at least one warplane that he said had not been damaged. Talal Barazi, the governor of Homs Province, which includes the air base, said by telephone on Friday that five people in the military and two civilians had been killed in the strikes. “What happened today is biggest evidence that the U. S. and its allies are the biggest supporters of the Daesh terrorist,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. While chemical attacks draw the world’s attention, most of the more than 400, 000 people who have died in the Syrian civil war have been killed with conventional weapons whose use has not piqued Mr. Trump’s ire, leaving some observers skeptical that the strikes would change the war’s course. “I feel the ecstasy of revenge now,” said Malek   an antigovernment activist who recently fled to Turkey. “I don’t feel the strike will change anything. Unless Bashar goes, nothing will change. ”",0
1461,“Birth of a Nation” Bombs,"Posted on October 31, 2016 “Birth of a Nation” Bombs Chris Roberts, American Renaissance, October 29, 2016 Are whites fed up with white-guilt films? 
The results are in: The new Birth of a Nation is a box-office disaster. Its ticket sales are going to fall several millions of dollars short of the cost to make and market the film–maybe as much as ten million dollars short . This is excellent news for white America. Birth of Nation glorifies black-on-white violence at a time when black-on-white violence is on the rise , and the anti-white vitriol from groups like Black Lives Matter has never been more mainstream . 
The financial failure of Birth of a Nation is even better news when you consider the success of other recent films that cultivate white guilt and glorify black violence. In 2012, Django Unchained , another story of a black slave killing white southerners, made well over 150 percent of its production costs. In 2013, Twelve Years a Slave nearly tripled its production costs, and The Butler , the story of a sad black servant in the White House, did even better. 
Have American moviegoers lost interest in movies that tell them to feel guilty about their history? If so, the reason must surely be the rising disgust among whites at always being cast as the villains of history, and I suspect Donald Trump has had something to do with this. Win or lose, Mr. Trump has sparked a sense of pride in whites, and that affects many things, including movie-going habits. 
Think back to 2012 and 2013, when anti-white films were box office bonanzas. That 24-month period may well have been the lowest point for whites in American history. Politically, the implicitly white Tea Party movement disintegrated, and Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama despite winning as much of the white vote as Ronald Reagan had decades earlier. Meanwhile, the number of journalists and commentators being purged for “racism” was higher than ever: John Derbyshire, Jason Richwine, Robert Weissberg, Jack Hunter, Frank Borzellieri, Pat Buchanan, Leif Parsell, Peter Brimelow, Paul Gottfried, and Thomas Bertonneau all lost jobs. 
The white world outside of politics was not looking good either. The catastrophic waste of our wars in the Middle East had become obvious to anyone. Perhaps not by coincidence, the heroin epidemic in New England was starting and the white suicide rate was rising. The university system was becoming more and more aggressive with its theories of “white privilege,” microaggressions, and gender fluidity–and there seemed to be no one fighting back. The longstanding trends of black dominance in music and sports continued, and America seemed on its way to becoming this hemisphere’s South Africa . 
In such a world, why not laugh along with black actor Jamie Foxx when he joked about enjoying killing all the white people in Django Unchained ? When the theory of “white privilege” is all but doctrine, blockbusters naturally vilify whites. 
People often make their conditions worse. Frustrated young men often compound their problems by watching pornography. Frustrated jobless people often compound their problems by drinking too much. A few years ago, white America only hastened its cultural and political dispossession by going to the theater and watching The Butler . 
Things are different now. The George Zimmerman trial, the Michael Brown shooting, and Black Lives Matter have helped many whites shed their last feelings of guilt. At the same time, Donald Trump has arrived almost like a modern version of the “ redeemers ” who helped end Reconstruction in the South. All this helps whites give “ black grievance porn ” the cold shoulder. 
In any case, blacks and whites have always watched different movies. From about 1915 until the early 1950s, the “ race film ” industry produced no fewer than 500 movies that touted an “all black cast,” or an “all-star Negro cast.” Oscar Micheaux was a major black producer in his day, but the only whites who know about him now are dorky cinephiles. Blacks didn’t want to watch Clark Gable or Joan Crawford, and when they went to a “race film” they could sit anywhere they liked in the theater. The original (and excellent) Birth of a Nation , about the Civil War and southern resistance to Reconstruction, was boycotted by the NAACP , but a boycott by blacks was mostly symbolic. In the 1970s, blacks gorged themselves on “ blaxploitation ” films, while whites occasionally watched one out of curiosity. 
Today, playwright and film-maker Tyler Perry is overwhelmingly popular with blacks–he made $130 million in 2011, making him the highest paid man in entertainment that year–but many whites have never even heard of him. Who honestly thinks there are many blacks who watch contemporary white films such as Interstellar or The Lord of the Rings or Gravity ? 
Only in recent and unfortunate times have large numbers of whites watched movies made by black film makers like Spike Lee who are openly contemptuous of whites. Let us hope this has finally come to an end.",0
1462,Anti-Trump PAC files complaint against FBI for interfering with election,"Print 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint Friday against FBI Director James Comey with the Department of Justice, alleging interference with the 2016 presidential election. 
The coalition, an arm of the Keep America Great PAC, filed the complaint with the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility, after Comey announced to Congress that because of new emails discovered on Huma Abedin’s electronic devices relevant to the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the agency would review those emails and assess their relevancy to the investigation . 
For Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the announcement is evidence that Comey, a registered Republican, is attempting to undermine Clinton’s chances of taking the White House. 
In a statement, Dworkin submitted: 
It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed numerous complaints with federal agencies about figures connected to the 2016 election. 
On Monday, the group filed a complaint with the FBI against Donald Trump himself for allegedly violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In other words, the group thinks Trump has called for voter intimidation and suppression on a national level. 
Earlier in October, the group also filed a complaint against the Trump campaign and political strategist Roger Stone, saying both were involved with WikiLeaks and also a “foreign government” behind the hacks that lead to the release of emails from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair. 
Podesta referred to the FBI’s Friday announcement as “extraordinary.” 
“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,” Podesta said . “The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.” 
In July, after the FBI came to a conclusion on Clinton’s private email server and said that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with criminal charges, the Clinton campaign praised Comey as a “well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bush’s Deputy Attorney General.” 
Brian Fallon, press secretary for the Clinton campaign, shamed Republicans in September , particularly GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley , for “trying to bully the FBI into serving partisan interests.”

1465,"Now the European Union Wants ""Build A Wall"" – With Russia","Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis has taken a leaf out of   Donald J. Trump’s book, announcing a   euro border fence to “ensure credible control of [the] eastern border of the European Union”. [EurActiv reports that the €30 million project will be funded largely from the European Union (EU) budget, to which the UK contributes a net £200 million every week.  Skvernelis claims the fence, which will be erected against the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, will “first of all, ensure our economic security” while “also solving issues when it comes to illegal migration”. Far from being disappointed by the project, Russian state media reports Kaliningrad’s governor as being eager to secure contracts for the building materials which the   project will require. The Baltic republic is not a popular destination for migrants, with asylum seekers resettled there from camps in Greece and Turkey complaining that state benefits are not so generous as in Germany or Sweden and attempting to escape to wealthier EU members. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė has predicted an increase in the number of migrants taking alternative routes into western Europe now that the EU signed a controversial six billion euro deal to stem the flow from Turkey. The Turkey deal has been a partial success in terms of reducing overall numbers, but the transfer arrangements it included have seen more than three times as many migrants forwarded to the EU as have been returned to Turkey, and the Turkish president looks set to terminate it if his own EU membership bid is not accelerated. “One should not be afraid to say that Europe has to be closed, at least temporarily, especially for economic migrants,” Grybauskaitė told broadcaster LRT. “The protection of the EU’s external borders should be the European solution. ” Lithuania’s announcement on the fence comes as the United States’s incoming president denounced the migrant crisis as a “catastrophic mistake” on the part of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, congratulating the British public on their decision to leave an EU which he sums up as “basically a vehicle for Germany”. Prior to Trump’s election victory, Merkel’s foreign minister commented that “building walls is a very bad idea  —   no matter who pays for them”.",0

On this episode, we keep the focus on the massive, nationwide #PrisonStrike that began on September 9th and which we covered in our last episode. 
First, we play a clip from On The Media with Azzurra Crispino, our guest from last week. Azzurra is media co-chair for the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC), a branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Austin Community College and Co-Founder of Prison Abolition Prisoner Solidarity , an organization dedicated to supporting prisoners and prison abolition efforts. In the clip, she asks whether mainstream media is complicit in violence within prisons because they only cover prison resistance when it turns violent, ignoring non-violent resistance like the current strike. Kumars and Roqayah discuss this point and brainstorm ways to get around this sad reality.
Next, Kumars interviews “D”, the incarcerated strike leader from South Carolina who we spoke to in our last episode. Kumars gets an update from D about conditions on the ground where he is, and the repression he and others have faced as they keep their strike alive. Importantly, D discusses the lasting changes in terms of prisoner consciousness and solidarity he already sees, and discusses next steps for this movement which will not end until prisons as we currently know them cease to exist.

1467,David Letterman: ’Makes Me Sick’ that Soulless ’Goon’ Trump is President,"  icon David Letterman says he’s sick knowing that President Donald Trump is representing America on the world stage. [“I’m disappointed that this man is representing me and my country,” Letterman said in an interview with GQ magazine this week. “It makes me sick. ”  The former late night mainstay, who retired from CBS’ Late Show in 2015 after 33 years of hosting, said there is “no reason to regret” having Trump on his show as often as he did. “He was just a big, wealthy dope who’d come on and we would make fun of his hair. I would refer to him as a slumlord,” he said. One month before Election Day, Letterman called Trump a “damaged human being” who should be “shunned. ” In March, Letterman said the president is “insulting to America. ” Doubling down on personal insults, Letterman now says Trump is a soulless “goon. ” “But now, this goon  …     I don’t know,” the    comedian told GQ. “He’s demonstrated himself to be a man without a core, a man without a soul. Is there a guy in there?” Acknowledging that he would like to interview Trump once more, Letterman said he just wants to ask the president a single question. “I would love to have 90 minutes with him in a TV studio, just to talk to the guy,” he said. “I would just like to say, ‘All right, Don: What the f*ck happened? ’”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson",0
1468,"Leonard Cohen, Epic and Enigmatic Songwriter, Is Dead at 82 - The New York Times","Leonard Cohen, the Canadian poet and novelist who abandoned a promising literary career to become one of the foremost songwriters of the contemporary era, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 82. Mr. Cohen’s record label, Sony Music, confirmed the death on Thursday night but provided no details on the cause. Adam Cohen, his son and producer, said Mr. Cohen had died “with the knowledge that he had completed what he felt was one of his greatest records. ” His final studio album, “You Want It Darker,” was released in October. “He was writing up until his last moments with his unique brand of humor,” his son said. Over a musical career that spanned nearly five decades, Mr. Cohen wrote songs that addressed  —   in spare language that could be both oblique and telling  —   themes of love and faith, despair and exaltation, solitude and connection, war and politics. More than 2, 000 recordings of his songs have been made, initially by the   singers who were his first champions, like Judy Collins and Tim Hardin, and later by performers from across the spectrum of popular music, among them U2, Aretha Franklin, R. E. M. Jeff Buckley, Trisha Yearwood and Elton John. Mr. Cohen’s   song may well be “Hallelujah,” a majestic, meditative ballad infused with both religiosity and earthiness. It was written for a 1984 album that his record company rejected as insufficiently commercial it was popularized a decade later by Jeff Buckley. Since then, some 200 artists, from Bob Dylan to Justin Timberlake, have sung or recorded it. A book has been written about it, and it has been featured on the soundtracks of movies and television shows and sung at the Olympics and other public events. At the 2016 Emmy Awards, Tori Kelly sang “Hallelujah” for the annual “In Memoriam” segment recognizing recent deaths. Mr. Cohen was an unlikely and reluctant pop star, if in fact he ever was one. He was 33 when his first record was released in 1967. He sang in an increasingly gravelly baritone. He played simple chords on acoustic guitar or a cheap keyboard. And he maintained a private, sometime ascetic image at odds with the Dionysian excesses associated with rock. At some points, he was anything but prolific. He struggled for years to write some of his most celebrated songs, and he recorded just 14 studio albums. Only the first qualified as a gold record in the United States for sales of 500, 000 copies. But Mr. Cohen’s sophisticated, magnificently succinct lyrics, with their meditations on love sacred and profane, were widely admired by other artists and gave him a reputation as, to use the phrase his record company concocted for an advertising campaign in the early 1970s, “the master of erotic despair. ” Early in his career, enigmatic songs like “Suzanne” and “Bird on the Wire”  —   quickly covered by   performers  —   gave him visibility. “Suzanne” begins and ends as a portrait of a mysterious, fragile woman “wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters,” but pauses in the middle verse to offer a melancholy view of the spiritual: Mr. Cohen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. Wearing a bolo tie and his trademark fedora, Mr. Cohen, in his acceptance speech, dryly made light of the fact that none of his records had ever been honored at the Grammys. “As we make our way toward the finish line that some of us have already crossed, I never thought I’d get a Grammy Award,” he said. “In fact, I was always touched by the modesty of their interest. ” Leonard Norman Cohen was born in Montreal on Sept. 21, 1934, and grew up in the prosperous suburb of Westmount. His father, Nathan, whose family had emigrated to Canada from Poland, owned a successful clothing store he died when Leonard was 9, but his will included a provision for a small trust fund, which later allowed his son to pursue his literary and musical ambitions. His mother, the former Masha Klonitzky, a nurse, was the daughter of a Talmudic scholar and rabbi. “I had a very messianic childhood,” Mr. Cohen would later say. In 1951, he was admitted to McGill University, Canada’s premier institution of higher learning, where he studied English. His first book of poetry, “Let Us Compare Mythologies,” was published in May 1956, while he was still an undergraduate. It was followed by “The   of Earth” in 1961 and “Flowers for Hitler” in 1964. Other collections would appear sporadically throughout Mr. Cohen’s life, including the omnibus “Poems and Songs” in 2011. A period of drift followed Mr. Cohen’s graduation from college. He enrolled in law school at McGill, then dropped out and moved to New York City, where he studied literature at Columbia University for a year before returning to Montreal. Eventually, after a sojourn in London, he ended up living in a house on the Greek island of Hydra, where he wrote a pair of novels: “The Favorite Game,” published in 1963, and “Beautiful Losers,” published in 1966. “Beautiful Losers,” about a love triangle whose members are devotees of a   Mohawk Indian Roman Catholic saint, gained a cult following, which it retains, and eventually sold more than three million copies worldwide. But Mr. Cohen’s initial lack of commercial success was discouraging, and he turned to songwriting in hopes of expanding the audience for his poetry. “I found it was very difficult to pay my grocery bill,” Mr. Cohen said in 1971, looking back at his situation just a few years earlier. “I’ve got beautiful reviews for all my books, and I’m very well thought of in the tiny circles that know me, but I’m really starving. ” Within months, Mr. Cohen had placed two songs, “Suzanne” and “Dress Rehearsal Rag,” on Ms. Collins’s album “In My Life,” which also included the   title song and compositions by Bob Dylan, Randy Newman and Donovan. But he was extremely reluctant to take the next step and sing his songs himself. “Leonard was naturally reserved and afraid to sing in public,” Ms. Collins wrote in her autobiography, “Sweet Judy Blue Eyes: My Life in Music” (2011). She recalled his telling her: “I can’t sing. I wouldn’t know what to do out there. I am not a performer. ” He was “terrified,” she wrote, the first time she brought him onstage to sing with her, in 1967. Mr. Cohen released his first album later that year, after being signed to Columbia Records by John Hammond, the celebrated talent scout who also signed Mr. Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. The record began with “Suzanne,” which was already being performed by folk singers everywhere thanks to the popularity of Ms. Collins’s version. It also included three other songs of great impact that would become staples of Mr. Cohen’s live shows, and that numerous other artists would record over the years: “Sisters of Mercy,” “So Long Marianne” and “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye. ” His second album, “Songs From a Room,” released early in 1969, cemented his growing reputation as a songwriter. “The Story of Isaac,” a retelling of the biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac, became an anthem of opposition to the war in Vietnam, and “Bird on the Wire” went on to be recorded by Joe Cocker, Aaron Neville, Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. In 1971, Mr. Cohen released “Songs of Love and Hate,” which contained the cryptic and frequently covered “Famous Blue Raincoat,” but after that his production began to tail off, and his live performances became less frequent. He released three more albums during the 1970s but, amid bouts of depression, only two in the 1980s and one in the 1990s. The quality of his songs remained high, however: In addition to “Hallelujah,” future standards like “Dance Me to the End of Love,” “First We Take Manhattan,” “Everybody Knows” and “Tower of Song” date from that era. Mr. Cohen, raised Jewish and observant throughout his life, became interested in Zen Buddhism in the late 1970s and often visited the Mount Baldy monastery, east of Los Angeles. Around 1994, he abandoned his music career altogether and moved to the monastery, where he was ordained a Buddhist monk and became the personal assistant of Joshu Sasaki, the Rinzai Zen master who led the center. During the remainder of the decade, there was much speculation that Mr. Cohen, rather than merely taking a sabbatical, had stopped writing songs and would never record again. But in 2001, he released “Ten New Songs,” whose title suggests he wrote it while in the monastery. It was followed in 2004 by “Dear Heather,” an unusually upbeat album. In 2005, Mr. Cohen sued his former manager, Kelley Lynch, accusing her of defrauding him of millions of dollars that he had set aside as a retirement fund, leaving him with only $150, 000 and a huge tax bill and forcing him to take out a new mortgage on his home to cover his legal costs. The next year, after Ms. Lynch countersued, a judge awarded Mr. Cohen $9. 5 million, but he was unable to collect any of the money. The legal battles may have soured Mr. Cohen’s mood, but they did not seem to damage his creativity. In 2006, he published a new collection of poems, “Book of Longing,” which the composer Philip Glass set to music and then took on tour, with Mr. Cohen’s recorded voice reciting the words and Mr. Glass’s ensemble performing the music. In 2008, Mr. Cohen hit the road for the first time in 15 years for a grueling world tour, which would continue, with a few short breaks, through 2010. He was driven, he acknowledged, at least in part by financial necessity. “It was a long, ongoing problem of a disastrous and relentless indifference to my financial situation,” he told The New York Times in 2009. “I didn’t even know where the bank was. ” Combined with a pair of CDs and accompanying DVDs recorded in concert, “Live in London” and “Songs From the Road,” the constant touring, before audiences often larger than those he had enjoyed in the past, clearly eased Mr. Cohen’s financial problems. Billboard magazine estimated that the 2009 leg of the tour alone earned him nearly $10 million. Over that   period, Mr. Cohen performed nearly 250 shows, many of them lasting more than three hours. He seemed remarkably fit and limber, skipping across the stage, doing   bends and occasionally dropping to his knees to sing. The shows were not without incident: During a show in Valencia, Spain, in 2009, he fainted, and early in 2010 one segment of the tour had to be postponed when he suffered a lower back injury. He recovered, however, and in 2012 he released “Old Ideas,” his first CD of new songs in more than seven years, and embarked on another marathon tour. That pattern of extensive touring and recording continued into the decade. In 2014, for instance, Mr. Cohen released a CD of mostly new material, “Popular Problems,” as well as a     set called “Live in Dublin. ” Mr. Cohen never married, though he had numerous liaisons and several   relationships, some of which he wrote about. In addition to his son, Adam, his survivors include a daughter, Lorca, who like Adam is from his relationship with Suzanne Elrod, a photographer and artist who shot the cover of his 1973 album, “Live Songs,” and is pictured on the cover of his critically derided album “Death of a Ladies’ Man” (1977) and three grandchildren. Mr. Cohen was buried in Montreal on Thursday after a traditional Jewish memorial service. To the end, Mr. Cohen took a sardonic view of both his craft and the human condition. In “Tower of Song,” a staple of live shows in his later years, he brought the two together, making fun of being “born with the gift of a golden voice” and striking the same biblical tone apparent on his first album. “The changeless is what he’s been about since the beginning,” the writer Pico Iyer argued in the liner notes for the anthology “The Essential Leonard Cohen. ” “Some of the other great pilgrims of song pass through philosophies and selves as if through the stations of the cross. With Cohen, one feels he knew who he was and where he was going from the beginning, and only digs deeper, deeper, deeper. ”",0
1469,US General: Warplanes Will Kill Fleeing ISIS Fighters Around Mosul,"Iraqi Govt Warns Civilians Against Fleeing Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This 
According to Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigan, the commander of US air forces in the Middle East, the anti-ISIS coalition is now planning on carrying out airstrikes against any fleeing ISIS fighters around Mosul, trying to prevent escape from the massive city with aerial surveillance and targeted strikes. 
This appears to be a response to growing concerns, both within the region and internationally, that the fall of Mosul will mean thousands of seasoned ISIS fighters popping up elsewhere around the world, destabilizing the Middle East and Europe. 
Preventing them from escaping Mosul, however, raises a major concern that the relative lack of US intelligence on who it is targeting, and determination to shoot first and ask questions later is going to lead to US warplanes attacking groups of fleeing civilians that they come across. 
The “solution” to this appears to be preventing civilians from fleeing the city as well, despite it being an open combat zone that will likely be facing months of combat. Iraqi officials are now said to be warning Mosul civilians not to try to escape, insisting they will be safer if they stay put. 
Staying put in a city during an invasion is far from safe, but suggests US warplanes are going to be particularly indiscriminate in targeting people fleeing Mosul. In the recent offensive against the ISIS city of Manbij, US warplanes killed hundreds of civilians they “mistook” for ISIS, and Mosul is a much larger city with a lot more people to be mistaken for ISIS.

1470,College Forces Mandatory Microaggression Sessions on Faculty After Prof Accuses Student of Plagiarism,"College Forces Mandatory Microaggression Sessions on Faculty After Prof Accuses Student of Plagiarism November 2, 2016 
College is now a politically correct joke . 
Suffolk University’s interim president said Tuesday that the college will hold mandatory microaggression training for all faculty in response to an outcry last week after a Latina student wrote a viral blog post saying she was the victim of a professor’s racial bias. 
What did this racial bias involve? 
Tiffany Martinez.said an unidentified Suffolk sociology professor handed back a paper she had written and in front of the class and told Martinez, “This is not your language,” insinuating that Martinez had plagiarized. 
Martinez posted a photo of the paper on her blog, showing where the professor appears to have written “please go back and indicate where you cut and paste.” The professor had circled the word “hence” in the paper and wrote, “this is not your word.” 
“In this interaction, my undergraduate career was both challenged and critiqued,” the student wrote. “It is worth repeating how my professor assumed I could not use the word “hence,” a simple transitory word that connected two relating statements. The professor assumed I could not produce quality research.” 
Most college students, regardless of whether their ancestors originated from southern Europe or not, do not tend to use hence in a sentence. Hence, it's the sort of word that professors seize on and suspect that what they are seeing is cut and paste material. Tiffany's interaction has happened thousands of times with students regardless of race. 
But Tiffany is lucky enough to be a privileged minority. Which means that she can't be treated like everyone else lest she whine about it and a flood of social justice crybullies descend on Suffolk U. 
Kelly, the interim president, also sent a note to the school on Friday after the Buzzfeed article was posted. 
“The truth is that all of us here at Suffolk should be concerned about any student feeling this way,” Kelly wrote in her Tuesday blog post. She said the school has experienced an outpouring of support for Martinez from other students, faculty and staff. 
Privilege. This is what it looks like. 
Scholars and Rogues fights a last stand against the decline and fall of journalism by stating the obvious . 
In short, what we have here isn’t merely iffy reporting on an academic dustup. It’s a microcosm of what has happened to journalism in modern America. These headlines are certain to entice Web surfers to click, and if the “reporters” can so easily be suckered into outrage then how can we possibly expect a rational reading by the average product of the American ed system, which has been stripped of all pretense at teaching critical thinking. 
The result: an emotionally pitched, unsubstantiated claim of injustice has been instantly transformed into cold, hard fact. 
Well yes. 
Meanwhile here's a sample of Tiffany's writing. You can decide whether she organically used hence in a sentence. 
A Declaration of Self Love 
I’m familiar negotiating who I am to please others. Some may call me inauthentic, I call this self-protection. However, I have burned through my shields. Too tired to be exhausted, this continuous disguise has faded. It’s time I accept myself and no longer sacrifice self-love for overall acceptance. 
The crybullies of the self-esteem generation can never get enough of loving itself and hating everyone who interferes with its boundless appetite for self-love.",0
1471,Texas Mulls Bill to Replace U.S. History Exam with Citizenship Test,"Last week, the Texas House approved a bill that would require public school students to pass a U. S. citizenship test as a high school graduation requirement. It would also eliminate the state’s current U. S. history   exam. [Not everyone agrees this is such a great idea.  The patriotic sounding House Bill 1776 proposes administering the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services test to Texas high schoolers even though the tool is designed for prospective U. S. citizens as part of the naturalization process. While the bill does not address how, if any, material would be covered, it requires all test questions be given in a multiple choice format. Students must answer at least 70 percent of the questions correctly to pass. The actual citizenship test requires applicants to successfully answer six out of 10 questions culled from a list of 100 total questions on U. S. history and government. It is not a multiple choice test, according to the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Random samples from the U. S. citizenship practice test ask questions like “What is the supreme law of the land? ,” “What is one right or freedom from the First Amendment? ,” “Who makes federal law? ,” “Why did the colonists fight the British? ,” Why does the flag have 50 stars? ,” What ocean is on the West Coast of the United States? ,” and “Where is the Statue of Liberty?. ” It also asks for the names of the President during the Great Depression and World War II plus the name of the President now. H. B. 1776 proponents support replacing the state’s U. S. history    (EOC) exam better known as the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) which they assert is too long and contains too much information to be mastered in one school year. Breitbart Texas reached out to H. B. 1776 lead author Representative Trent Ashby ( ) but he did not respond to our emailed questions inquiring specifics about the bill. However, in an   for the Lufkin News, he defended dumping the U. S. history STAAR: “The elimination of the U. S. history    exam is part of a national movement to do away with a test that fails to address the most fundamental aspects of American citizenry. ” It remains unclear what are those fundamental aspects he references. Should H. B. 1776 become law it will apply to students who enter the ninth grade during the   school year although it is not a grade   test. Opponents question the validity of a   civics test crafted for prospective citizens and not students. Also, at a time when many decry   testing, some fear requiring a U. S. citizenship test opens the door to another standardized test. State Board of Education (SBOE) member Pat Hardy voiced strong concerns that a U. S. citizenship test only measures “rote memorization” of rudimentary facts. A veteran social studies teacher and social student coordinator, Hardy urged her district representatives to vote against H. B. 1776 in a letter. In part, she wrote: To replace our 11th grade EOC with the   citizenship test promoted by H. B. 1776 would in no way help us ensure that our students are prepared with the knowledge and skills they will need to participate meaningfully in our democracy and in our government in future years. Hardy emphasized that the grade 11 U. S. History STAAR requires students to know content and to apply it, also testing “students’ ability to think critically which is a 21st Century skill. ” She underscored that students only take two social studies STAAR tests during their   school years  —   both in grades where U. S. history is taught, which might be applauded given in 2015, the “Nation’s Report Card” showed a meager 18 percent of eighth grade public school students as “proficient” or above in U. S. history, while only 23 percent were proficient in civics, Breitbart News reported. Texas public schools concentrate on U. S. history in two parts  —   grades eight and 11  —   covering colonial times through 1877 and from 1877 to the present. The state standards, the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) say: “The student will demonstrate an understanding of issues and events in U. S. history. ” Breitbart Texas spoke to SBOE chairwoman Donna Bahorich who pointed out she always encourages people to look at the state’s eighth and 11th grade social studies standards and then peruse corresponding grade level released STAAR test questions. “I think parents and the general public would be pleasantly surprised by the quality of what is being asked of our students to learn. It’s not rote memorization of facts. ” Bahorich said students are asked to think critically about important concepts fr0m our nation’s founding to the present which she said “our courses address but the citizenship test certainly doesn’t represent that. ” In the Lufkin newspaper Ashby insisted H. B. 1776 “helps to promote fundamental knowledge that is critical to engaged and productive citizenry. ” So did state Representative Bill Zedler ( ) who, in 2015, proposed H. B. 829 to add a U. S. citizenship test to the state’s high school graduation requirement. The bill fizzled. The Texas State Teachers Association opposed  it, doubting more students would become   and participate in politics. They worried the bill would result in more teaching to the test. However, Ashby’s bill may have more legs since he folded a version of it into House Bill 515, which slashes nine other STAAR tests, including the one for the eighth grade social studies course that covers U. S. History to 1877, replacing it with the citizenship test. The Texas Senate received H. B. 1776 and H. B. 515 last Friday. Two years ago, Arizona became the first state to pass a law requiring students to take a U. S. citizenship test to graduate from high school. Today, 15 states mandate this test.

1472,New York Today: The Race to Recycle - The New York Times,"Updated, 10:34 a. m. Good morning on this temperate Tuesday. Apparently, we could all up our recycling game. First, less than half of what we could recycle ends up in our city’s recycling programs, according to a report published last month by the city’s Independent Budget Office. Second, much of what we do try to recycle gets thrown into the wrong bins. “This makes recycling more expensive, and it makes what’s actually recyclable less valuable,” said Daniel Huber, an environmental analyst with the budget office. For those New Yorkers who have successfully avoided taking the trash to the curb, a quick primer. The Sanitation Department has three main streams for the city’s unwanted stuff  —   one for garbage destined for a landfill, one to recycle paper, and one to recycle metal, glass and plastic. According to the July report, which used Sanitation Department data from 2013, only about a quarter of aluminum cans  —   one of the most valuable recyclable metals  —   makes it into the right bin. And only around 5 percent of our plastic cups, plates and utensils goes to the right place. We do the best job recycling glass, but as it turns out, that’s one of the least valuable types of commodities, Mr. Huber said  —   far less useful than recycled metal and paper. So what can we do to make recycling less painful for us and more efficient for those processing it? “Being more diligent about making sure stuff doesn’t end up in the wrong recycling stream is the key one,” Mr. Huber told us. Think twice about where your child’s dirty diapers and juice boxes are thrown. Before the    season, recycle last year’s notebooks. (And even electronics.) Don’t scavenge. And take the time to understand what newer recycling categories are being accepted around the city, Mr. Huber added. You can learn more about what programs the city is working on in your neighborhood here. Here’s what else is happening: Could be better, could be worse. Skies will stay mostly cloudy today, with a small chance of showers before lunchtime and a high near 80. And if the gray has gotten you glum, don’t fret: We’re about to hit a sunny streak, which will last through the weekend. • A Turkish gold trader, charged with conspiracy to violate the U.

1473,"MS-13 Gangs Involved in Northern Virginia Murders, Say Police","FAIRFAX COUNTY, Virginia  —   Alleged “gang activity” is responsible for murders in the northern region of Virginia, according to Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler. [Investigators are suspected to be pointing to the   transnational criminal gang after police found remains in the Holmes Run Park. Police reported finding other human remains in the past connected tied to   gang activity.  “I can just assure you that this is gang activity,” Roessler told the media during a news conference, according to WTOP News. Police have not yet identified the remains, and investigators are awaiting autopsies to be completed, according to Roessler. Just two years ago, police discovered two bodies in the Holmes Run Park. Officials tied the remains to the   gang, Roessler said. “This problem is horrible,” Roessler told the media. “This is four murders in this park. Obviously, we’ve had other murders in the region in the past few weeks. This is getting out of control, and we need to stop it. ” Roessler, though, refused to name the specific name of the gang linked to the most recent remains, saying “not going to advertise for gangs. ” Last month, Breitbart News reported the Springfield, Virginia murder of a teenage girl, in which four illegal immigrants were arrested for their involvement, with police being led to the   gang. Most recently, Breitbart Texas reported on 13   gang members who were indicted on murder charges for their involvement in the deaths of seven individuals. 10 of the   gang members were illegal immigrants. As Breitbart Texas’    has reported, the   crime syndicate is comprised primarily of illegal immigrants living in the U. S. from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. The United Nations classifies the   gang as an international street gang, which is loosely affiliated with the Mexican drug cartels, as they both conduct illegal immigrant smuggling into the U. S. and operate human trafficking rings. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.",0

1475,He Turned His Home Into a Reality Television Show - The New York Times,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? The Times’s technology columnist discussed the tech he’s using. As a technology columnist, what devices and apps do you use to do your job? I’m not sure I’ve arrived at any great system, and I’m always changing things around. At the moment, for phone calls, I use Skype in conjunction with a program called Call Recorder, because it’s the easiest way I know to record calls. When I’m doing    interviews, I use DropVox, an app that records and saves audio to the cloud drive Dropbox. For notes, I use Workflowy, a fantastic online outlining program that I’ve found easier to use than most other notes apps. My primary work computer is an amazing 5k iMac desktop, but I spend more than half of my computing time on my phone, an iPhone 7. Which is your favorite product and why? I really like my iPhone they’ve caused lots of problems, but on the whole, I think we’re better off with smartphones than without. And yet I wouldn’t say any of these are really my favorites. Technology occupies a weird space in my life. I love it more than anything for its potential, but I’m always disappointed in its failure to live up to what’s possible. My phone has changed everything about my life, much of it for the better, and yet I find myself hating it often  —   it can be buggy, the battery life is dismal, I miss the headphone jack, etc. The comedian Louis C. K. has a funny routine about how we’re all ungrateful about tech. I’m that guy, unashamedly. Last year, you wrote about how the presidential election underlined the embarrassing shortcomings of email. What do you use to overcome the misery that is email?  Email is just terrible. I use Google’s Inbox app, which has some nice features to automatically sort email, but I still find email a huge chore. More and more of my communications are moving to other channels  —   Slack, mobile messaging, Twitter DMs, encrypted apps like Signal, and after last year’s   email hacks, I’ve even started to make more phone calls. The sooner we can all get off email the better. What new tech product are you currently obsessed with using at home? What do you and your family do with it?  This is going to sound weird, but I’m a strange person. I have two kids, ages 6 and 4, and for the last few years I’ve been mourning their loss of childhood. Every day they get a little bit older, and even though my wife and I take lots of photos and videos of them, I can’t shake the feeling that we’re losing most of the moments of their lives. So last summer, after some intense lobbying of my wife, I did something radical: I installed several cameras in my living room and dining room to record everything we did at home for posterity. In other words, I created a reality show in my house. In practice, it works like this: The cameras are   and connected to servers in the cloud. Like security cameras in a convenience store, they are set to record on a constant loop  —   every video clip is saved for a few days, after which it’s automatically deleted, unless I flag it for   keeping. Yes, this system sets up a minefield of potential problems. We turn off the cameras when we have guests (it’s unethical and, depending on where you live, possibly even illegal to record people without their consent) and we don’t spy on each other. There are also security concerns. I’m not going to disclose the brand of the cameras I used because I don’t want to get hacked. The safety of    devices is generally not airtight. And yet I’ve found these cameras to be just wonderful at capturing the odd, beautiful, surprising, charming moments of life that we would never have been able to capture otherwise. Every time the kids say something hilarious or sweet, or do something for the first time, I make a note of the time and date. Later on, I can go and download that exact clip, to keep forever. I’ve already got amazing videos of weeknight dinners, of my wife and I watching the news on election night, of my son learning to play Super Mario Brothers, and my kids having a dance party to their favorite music. When I’m 80 and the robots have taken over, I’ll look back on these and remember that life was good, once. O. K. How old do you think a child must be to get that first smartphone?  My kids are way too young for their own phones. And so far, they don’t seem to have much interest in phones other than to take photos and, more recently, to play Pokémon Go. For them, iPads hold more interest. In general, our policy for devices isn’t based on time but quality. If my kids are going to use their iPads, I want them to use them for experiences that aren’t totally bad for them. So, for instance, we’ve put curbs on how much they can use YouTube, which they use to watch the most garbage videos (usually of other kids playing with toys). But for other stuff  —   games, for instance  —   they’re allowed to play for an hour or two on the weekends. I really haven’t thought much about when I’ll get them their own phones. It’s a looming crisis  —   I know it’s unavoidable, and I’ll probably give in when they’re around 11 or 12, but I’m sure going to hate the feeling of losing them to their gadgets. Of course that’s probably how they feel about me and my phone.",0
1476,Middle Eastern Writers Find Refuge in the Dystopian Novel - The New York Times,"Basma Abdel Aziz was walking in downtown Cairo one morning when she saw a long line of people standing in front of a closed government building. Returning hours later, Ms. Abdel Aziz, a psychiatrist who counsels torture victims, passed the same people still waiting listlessly  —   a young woman and an elderly man, a mother holding her baby. The building remained closed. When she got home, she immediately started writing about the people in line and didn’t stop for 11 hours. The story became her surreal debut novel, “The Queue,” which takes place after a failed revolution in an unnamed Middle Eastern city. The narrative unfolds over 140 days, as civilians are forced to wait in an endless line to petition a shadowy authority called The Gate for basic services. “Fiction gave me a very wide space to say what I wanted to say about totalitarian authority,” Ms. Abdel Aziz said in a recent interview. “The Queue,” which was just published in English by Melville House, has drawn comparisons to Western classics like George Orwell’s “1984” and “The Trial” by Franz Kafka. It represents a new wave of dystopian and surrealist fiction from Middle Eastern writers who are grappling with the chaotic aftermath and stinging disappointments of the Arab Spring. Five years after the popular uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and elsewhere, a bleak, apocalyptic strain of   literature has taken root in the region. Some writers are using science fiction and fantasy tropes to describe grim current political realities. Others are writing about controversial subjects like sexuality and atheism, or exhuming painful historical episodes that were previously off limits. In a literary culture where poetry has long been the most celebrated medium, writers are experimenting with a range of genres and styles, including comics and graphic novels, hallucinatory horror novels and allegorical works of science fiction. “There’s a shift away from realism, which has dominated Arabic literature,” said the   novelist Saleem Haddad, whose new book, “Guapa,” is narrated by a young gay Arab man whose friend has been imprisoned after a political revolt. “What’s coming to the surface now is darker and a bit deeper. ” Science fiction and surrealism have long provided an escape valve for writers living under oppressive regimes. In Latin America, decades of fascism and civil war helped inspire masterpieces of magical realism from authors like Gabriel García Márquez and Isabel Allende. In Russia, the postmodern novelist Vladimir Sorokin has published disturbing and controversial futuristic novels that surreptitiously skewer the country’s repressive government. Dystopian themes are not entirely new in Arabic fiction. But they have become much more prominent in recent years, publishers and translators say. The genre has proliferated in part because it captures the sense of despair that many writers say they feel in the face of cyclical violence and repression. At the same time, futuristic settings may give writers some measure of cover to explore charged political ideas without being labeled dissidents. “These futuristic stories are all about lost utopia,” said Layla     of a collection of   Spring writing titled “Diaries of an Unfinished Revolution. ” “People really could imagine a better future, and now it’s almost worse than it was before. ” In the turbulent months after the uprisings, when the promises of democracy and greater social freedom remained elusive, some novelists channeled their frustrations and fears into grim apocalyptic tales. In Mohammed Rabie’s gritty novel “Otared,” which will be published in English this year by the American University in Cairo, a former Egyptian police officer joins a fight against a mysterious occupying power that rules the country in 2025. Mr. Rabie said he wrote the novel in response to the “successive defeats” that advocates of democracy faced after the 2011 demonstrations that ended President Hosni Mubarak’s   rule. While there are parallels to   Egyptian society, setting the story in the near future allowed him to write more freely, without drawing explicit connections to Egypt’s current ruler, he said in an email interview translated by his Arabic publisher. Nael Eltoukhy, whose darkly satirical 2013 novel, “Women of Karantina,” takes place partly in a   Alexandria in the year 2064, said he felt that a futuristic farce was the best way to reflect the jaded mood in Egypt. “In Egypt, especially after the revolution, everything is terrible, but everything is also funny,” he said in an interview. “Now, I think it’s worse than the time of Mubarak. ” Gloomy futuristic stories have proved popular with readers, and several of these novels have been critical and commercial hits. “Otared” was a finalist for this year’s prestigious International Prize for Arabic Fiction. Publishers say the books have caught on with the public in part because they distill a collective feeling of frustration. This new body of   literature shows a sharp tonal shift from the ecstatic outpouring that arrived immediately after the Arab Spring, when many writers published breathless memoirs or dug out old manuscripts they had stashed away for years. Celebrated Egyptian novelists like Ahdaf Soueif and Mona Prince wrote firsthand nonfiction accounts of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square. The Syrian novelist Samar Yazbek published diaries she kept during the Syrian uprising. A new generation of writers drew inspiration from the stunning scenes of citizens rising up together against entrenched dictatorships. “There was something about the experience of the revolution where suddenly you had a voice, and your voice had weight and it had meaning,” said Yasmine El Rashidi, an Egyptian journalist whose first novel, “Chronicle of a Last Summer,” about a young woman’s political awakening in Cairo during and after Mr. Mubarak’s rule, will be published in the United States next month. In the years since the revolution, that optimism has withered, and the authorities have cracked down on creative expression across the region. In Saudi Arabia, the poet Ashraf Fayadh was sentenced to death last year for his verses, which religious authorities called blasphemous. After an international outcry, his sentence was reduced to eight years in prison and 800 lashes. In Egypt, under the strict rule of President Abdel Fattah   the government has shut art galleries, raided publishing houses and confiscated copies of books it views as controversial. Last year, customs officers seized 400 copies of “Walls of Freedom,” about Egyptian political street art, and charged that the book was “instigating revolt. ” “We are concerned now with what we publish,” said   Rizk, director of Dar   Egypt, an Arabic publishing house. “If something is banned, it does create commercial problems. ” Despite explicit protections for free speech in Egypt’s 2014 Constitution, the authorities have targeted individual writers and artists. The novelist Ahmed Naji is serving a   prison sentence for violating “public modesty” with sexually explicit passages in his experimental novel “The Use of Life. ” Many fear that his imprisonment will lead to more  . “The Arab Spring and the revolution broke people’s fears and gave them the initiative to express themselves,” said Ms. Abdel Aziz, whose novel, “The Queue,” was published in Arabic in 2013. “Now we are back to oppression. ” Ms. Abdel Aziz, 39, earned a master’s degree in neuropsychiatry in 2005 and now works part time at a center in Cairo that counsels victims of torture and violence. She has published two   collections and several nonfiction books on sensitive subjects like torture and the human rights violations committed by Egyptian security forces. But after Mr. Mubarak’s fall, writing a factual account felt like an inadequate way to capture the surreal experience of ordinary Egyptians who lived through the uprisings and subsequent crackdowns, she said. Instead, she aimed to write a universal story that reflected what was unfolding around her but transcended geography and current events. She started writing “The Queue” in September 2012. The novel follows a young salesman, Yehya, who was shot during a failed uprising. Yehya is denied medical treatment and forced to wait in an endless line to petition The Gate for a permit to have surgery. As he grows weaker, the line only gets longer, stretching on for miles. Ms. Abdel Aziz uses coded language for loaded political terms and events throughout the novel, which was translated by Elisabeth Jaquette. The 2011 uprising against Mr. Mubarak is called “the First Storm. ” A later civilian revolt that ended in bloodshed is referred to as “the Disgraceful Events. ” Ms. Abdel Aziz worries about the growing scrutiny Egyptian writers and activists face. About a dozen of her friends are in prison, she said. She has been arrested three times for taking part in demonstrations and protests. But she feels that living in fear is futile. “I’m not afraid anymore,” she said. “I will not stop writing. ”",0
1477,Researchers Confront an Epidemic of Loneliness - The New York Times,"BLACKPOOL, England  —   The woman on the other end of the phone spoke lightheartedly of spring and of her 81st birthday the previous week. “Who did you celebrate with, Beryl?” asked Alison, whose job was to offer a kind ear. “No one, I  …    ” And with that, Beryl’s cheer turned to despair. Her voice began to quaver as she acknowledged that she had been alone at home not just on her birthday, but for days and days. The telephone conversation was the first time she had spoken in more than a week. About 10, 000 similar calls come in weekly to an unassuming office building in this seaside town at the northwest reaches of England, which houses The Silver Line Helpline, a   call center for older adults seeking to fill a basic need: contact with other people. Loneliness, which Emily Dickinson described as “the Horror not to be surveyed,” is a quiet devastation. But in Britain, it is increasingly being viewed as something more: a serious public health issue deserving of public funds and national attention. Working with local governments and the National Health Service, programs aimed at mitigating loneliness have sprung up in dozens of cities and towns. Even fire brigades have been trained to inspect homes not just for fire safety but for signs of social isolation. “There’s been an explosion of public awareness here, from local authorities to the Department of Health to the media,” said Paul Cann, chief executive of Age UK Oxfordshire and a founder of The Campaign to End Loneliness, a    group based in London. “Loneliness has to be everybody’s business. ” Researchers have found mounting evidence linking loneliness to physical illness and to functional and cognitive decline. As a predictor of early death, loneliness eclipses obesity. “The profound effects of loneliness on health and independence are a critical public health problem,” said Dr. Carla M. Perissinotto, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. “It is no longer medically or ethically acceptable to ignore older adults who feel lonely and marginalized. ” In Britain and the United States, roughly one in three people older than 65 live alone, and in the United States, half of those older than 85 live alone. Studies in both countries show the prevalence of loneliness among people older than 60 ranging from 10 percent to 46 percent. While the public, private and volunteer sectors in Britain are mobilizing to address loneliness, researchers are deepening their understanding of its biological underpinnings. In a paper published earlier this year in the journal Cell, neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology identified a region of the brain they believe generates feelings of loneliness. The region, known as the dorsal raphe nucleus, or D. R. N. is best known for its link to depression. Kay M. Tye and her colleagues found that when mice were housed together, dopamine neurons in the D. R. N. were relatively inactive. But after the mice were isolated for a short period, the activity in those neurons surged when those mice were reunited with other mice. “This is the first time we’ve found a cellular substrate for this experience,” said Dr. Tye, an assistant professor at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at M. I. T. and a senior author of the paper. “And we saw the change after 24 hours of isolation. ” John T. Cacioppo, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and director of the university’s Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience, has been studying loneliness since the 1990s. He said loneliness is an aversive signal much like thirst, hunger or pain. “Denying you feel lonely makes no more sense than denying you feel hunger,” he said. Yet the very word “lonely” carries a negative connotation, Professor Cacioppo said, signaling social weakness, or an inability to stand on one’s own. The unspoken stigma of loneliness is amply evident during calls to The Silver Line. Most people call asking for advice on, say, roasting a turkey. Many call more than once a day. One woman rings every hour to ask the time. Only rarely will someone speak frankly about loneliness. Yet the impulse to call in to services like The Silver Line is a healthy one, Professor Cacioppo said. On a recent afternoon, Tracey, a Silver Line adviser, listened as a caller in his 80s embarked on a nostalgic trip down his list of favorite films. The next caller serenaded Tracey with “Oh What a Beautiful Morning,” on his harmonica. Once the harmonica player had hung up, a call came in from an    man with an avalanche of memories to share: dogs he had owned, boats he had captained, London during the blitz. Tracey, a former nurse, listened patiently for 30 minutes. “It can be really fascinating when people talk about things like London during the bombing,” she said after the call ended. “It’s important to remember the rich lives people have led. ” Silver Line workers leave it up to the caller to mention whether they are feeling lonely. Still, the advisers are trained to listen for signs of unhappy isolation, and gently lead the conversation accordingly, perhaps offering to link the caller to a Silver Line Friend, a volunteer who makes weekly phone calls or writes letters to those who request it. Sophie Andrews, chief executive of The Silver Line, said she was surprised by the explosion of calls shortly after the service began operating nearly three years ago. The Blackpool call center now receives some 1, 500 calls a day. Ms. Andrews said she was most concerned not about those who called The Silver Line, but those who were too depressed by their isolation to pick up the phone. “We need to raise awareness with the people who are the hardest to reach,” she said. Professor Cacioppo lauds efforts like The Silver Line, yet he warns that the problem of loneliness is nuanced and the solutions not as obvious as they might seem. That is, a   line can help reduce feelings of loneliness temporarily, but is not likely to reduce levels of chronic loneliness. In his research, Professor Cacioppo has shown that loneliness affects several key bodily functions, at least in part through overstimulation of the body’s stress response. Chronic loneliness, his work has shown, is associated with increased levels of cortisol, a major stress hormone, as well as higher vascular resistance, which can raise blood pressure and decrease blood flow to vital organs. Professor Cacioppo’s research has also shown that the danger signals activated in the brain by loneliness affect the production of white blood cells this can impair the immune system’s ability to fight infections. It is only in the past several years that loneliness has been examined through a medical, rather than psychological or sociological, lens. Dr. Perissinotto, the University of California, San Francisco geriatrician, decided to study loneliness when she began to sense there were factors affecting her patients’ health that she was failing to capture. Using data from a large national survey of older adults, in 2012 Dr. Perissinotto analyzed the relationship between   loneliness and health outcomes in people older than 60. Of 1, 604 participants in the study, 43 percent reported feelings of loneliness, and these individuals had significantly higher rates of declining mobility, difficulty in performing routine daily activities, and death during six years of  . The association of loneliness with mortality remained significant even after adjusting for age, economic status, depression and other common health problems. Dr. Perissinotto is also interested in examining the link between loneliness and suicidal thoughts, as there has been little research in that area. She hopes to study The Friendship Line, a     loneliness   line run by the Institute on Aging in San Francisco that is also a suicide prevention hotline. Although plenty of research into loneliness takes place in the United States, Britain remains well ahead in addressing the problem. “In the U. S. there isn’t much recognition in terms of public health initiatives or the average person recognizing that loneliness has to do with health,” said Julianne   a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, whose studies also link loneliness to deteriorating health. Age UK, an organization similar to AARP in the United States, oversees an array of programs aimed at decreasing loneliness and coordinates efforts with fire brigades to look for signs of loneliness and isolation in the homes they enter. Another charity, Open Age, runs some 400 activities each week in Central London  —   sewing circles, current events discussions, book clubs and exercise and computer classes, held at church halls, sport centers, housing projects  —   and its employees also visit people in their homes to try to get them out and about. “We try to work out what it is that’s preventing them from leaving the house,” said Helen Leech, the organization’s director. Men and women differ greatly in how they grapple with loneliness. Seventy percent of the calls to The Silver Line are from women. “We have this kind of male pride thing,” said Mike Jenn, 70, a retired charity worker who lives in London. “We say, ‘I can look after myself. I don’t need to talk to anyone,’ and it’s a complete fallacy. Not communicating helps to kill us. ” Mr. Jenn runs a “Men’s Shed” in London’s Camden Town district, which aims to bring older men together in a more familiar and comfortable environment  —   working side by side in a woodworking shop. The concept began in Australia and has since spread to Britain: There are now more than 300 Men’s Sheds throughout England, Scotland and Ireland. Keith Pearshouse, 70, a retired school principal, discovered the Men’s Shed near his home after moving to London from Norfolk, England, in 2007 and recognizing he was lonely. “I was a bit anxious walking into a roomful of people,” said Mr. Pearshouse, chatting amid the din created by a table saw, router and lathe at the Camden Town shed, a    workshop in a local community center. “But I immediately thought, ‘Yeah, this is a place that would work for me. ’” Mr. Pearshouse, who had never worked with wood before he discovered the Men’s Shed, showed a visitor a delicate wooden jar he was finishing. The pieces he produces are gratifying, he said, but not nearly as gratifying as the human connections he has made. While Mr. Pearshouse is still a long way from sharing every little ache and upset with his friends at the shed, he said his life would now feel much emptier without the    way of confiding he has come to know. As he spoke, he took the lid off his jar, and it gave a slight pop, signifying a perfect fit.",0
1478,French jungle destroyed by a legion of baguette bashers!,"Sunday, 30 October 2016 A passing hump-back whale in the English Channel needing nourishment not a Jungle resident! 
French Foreign Legion troops brandishing hi-tech baguettes marched into the Jungle last week and bashed it so badly, it ended up in crumbs! Inhabitants of the jungle were seen fleeing the safety of urine saturated trees, bushes and other watering holes with pieces of stinking camembert stuck to their curly-haired heads after being bashed into surrender! 
The Tricolore was raised after this outstanding victory. Jungle inhabitants who attempted to escape were caught in huge fishnets erected around the jungle to keep them in and not to let them out because the UK's surrounding seas have been heavily over-fished, and this once proud island really does not need any more alien jungle creatures emptying their pots. 
French President, Francois Hollande, who is rather flat, praised his Foreign Legion Baguette Bashers for their superb, historical victory, and even mentioned The Normandy Invasion of 1945 on his stale garlic breath; 
""Messieurs et Madames, France has shown to ze world zat one baguette in ze bush is worth many in ze jungle et baguettes in ze jungle; non si vous plait!"" 
The UK also praised French Foreign Legion forces and told Francois, ""Qui could not have done it better!"" (A seldom statement from the UK admitting that something another country has done is better!) 
Many jungle inhabitants have now been replaced in French zoos, others, not so lucky, have been deported to Bulgaria (They bash with real weapons!). Others who escaped the attack were spotted swimming in the English Channel! Passengers on ferries threw lumps of stale, tasteless English sandwiches, purchased on board, at them, believing they were a school of passing hump-back whales in dire need of nourishment (?).

1480,"Entering Cage, Gold Medalist Kayla Harrison Helps a Show Become a Sport - The New York Times","Only one American has ever won an Olympic gold medal in judo: Kayla Harrison. And she has won two, in London in 2012 and in Rio this year. Yet despite her achievements, Harrison is the country’s   famous judoka. No. 1 is her former roommate Ronda Rousey, who won a bronze medal in 2008 and went on to fame, fortune and magazine covers as the   fighter in mixed martial arts. Now Harrison, 26, plans to follow her into the cage, in the World Series of Fighting organization. “If you had peeked through our apartment window in 2007 and said, ‘One of you is going to win two Olympic gold medals, and one is going to become a sports icon,’ we both would have said: ‘What are you talking about? We’re eating ramen noodles and barely getting by,’” Harrison said. “Four years ago, if I wanted to be an M. M. A. athlete, it’s not something a female could really make a lot of money doing. ” Harrison said. Referring to Rousey, she added: “She trailblazed a way for girls like me who want to make some money. I’m hoping to stand on top of her shoulders and continue to have judo girls kill it in the cage. ” It will be quite a change for Harrison. The   world of Olympic sports like judo is vastly different from the colorful, crazy scene of mixed martial arts. When asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts after winning her second gold medal, in August, Harrison said, “I don’t know if I’m cut out for a world where you get fights by how pretty you are and how you talk. ” She stands by that remark, but said: “The World Series of Fighting is looking to bring some legitimacy to the sport, and have real athletes who are treated like real athletes, not W. W. E. superstars. I hope to see it go more toward the professional route versus the entertainment route, but I’m not in charge. ” The man who is, Carlos Silva, the chief executive, said: “I want people to perceive it as a sport, not just a show. A big part of that is adding sporting people like Kayla. ” Harrison competed in judo at 172 pounds but expects to fight at 145 pounds. (Such discrepancies are not unusual Rousey competed in judo at 154 but fights in the Ultimate Fighting Championship at its highest weight class, 135.) Women at 145 pounds have been somewhat overlooked in mixed martial arts in favor of smaller fighters. The World Series of Fighting expects to add athletes to build up the division with its new star in mind. The biggest name in the heavier division is Cristiane Justino, known universally as Cyborg. Currently signed with the U. F. C. she is a fearsome competitor with a   record and a brutal knockout punch. A match between her and Rousey, if it could be arranged, would undoubtedly be one of the biggest in mixed martial arts history. The bigger Harrison, though, might be a more natural matchup for Cyborg down the road. “I’m not going to go out in my first fight and fight Cyborg,” Harrison said. “That would be crazy. ” But she admitted: “I had a dream the other night that I was fighting Cyborg and I got her in an armbar and I broke her arm. But she wouldn’t tap, so I choked her unconscious. ” In Rio, when Harrison was asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts, her longtime coach, Jimmy Pedro, sitting next to her, was seen shaking his head. “That pretty much sums up how he and his father feel about it,” Harrison said of Pedro and his father, known as Big Jim. “They just feel like I’ve accomplished everything an athlete could ever dream of, having such an amazing career in judo. And I think personally they don’t want to see me put that all on the line and see me get hurt. ” Still, Harrison will continue to work with the Pedros, as well as adding training in disciplines like boxing and wrestling. She said her serious training will begin in January. Harrison has no timetable for her first fight. She will start her mixed martial arts experience as a commentator for the World Series of Fighting’s card at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 31. The event will feature three championship bouts, including lightweight champ Justin Gaethje against João Zeferino. For a judoka transitioning into mixed martial arts, the biggest issue is striking, which is not allowed in judo. “I feel I have a great base, because judo is takedowns and finishes, armbars, chokes,” Harrison said. “When you’re doing judo, you’re gripping, your hands are moving, so I already have that spatial awareness for striking, which I think gives me an advantage learning a new sport. “I’ve been doing the same thing for 20 years. Everything I do in judo I learned in the first six months with the Pedros. Now I’m learning new things. I’m learning heel hooks and knee bars and a jab and a hook, uppercuts. It’s invigorating. ” Still, Harrison is aware that the differences are there, and that they are real. Soon, for the first time, she will be hitting people in the face, and being hit in the face in return. “Judo is controlled violence,” she said. “Judo in Japanese means ‘the gentle way.’ It’s about disarming your opponent or defending yourself, but never killing them. But M. M. A. is   gladiating. So, yeah, I’m scared. Absolutely. I would be foolish not to be. ”",0
1481,WATCH: Anti-LGBT Attack At Equality House – SHOTS FIRED (TWEETS),"WATCH: Anti-LGBT Attack At Equality House – SHOTS FIRED (TWEETS) By Jordan Baranowski on October 28, 2016 Subscribe 
Planting Peace, a nonprofit organization dedicated to spreading peace in the world, purchased the house across the street from the Westboro Baptist Church in 2013. The organization soon painted the house the colors of the rainbow, started flying pride flags, and dubbed the home The Equality House to show support for the LGBT community. 
Over the last week, The Equality House has been targeted by vandals. It is yet another example of the anger and violence that has taken our country by storm during this ugly election season. Image Provided By Aaron Jackson , Via NBC News 
Aaron Jackson, the president of Planting Peace , was in the house on Sunday, October 23, when he heard noises outside. He called the police and discovered the house’s pride flags had been thrown into the street. 
In addition, vandals had graffitied the phrase “fuk fags” in black spray paint on the side of the house. 
Just a few days later, members of Planting Peace discovered seven bullet holes in a window of the house. Luckily, no one was inside at the time. Police are still investigating. 
The Equality House has long served as an important symbol for the LGBT community. Located in Topeka, the capital of Kansas, the house sits directly across the street from the Westboro Baptist Church. Westboro was founded by Fred Phelps, and members of the church regularly picket funerals, plays, and gay weddings, accompanied by a series of signs with offensive slogans like “God Hates Fags.” 
There is currently no evidence that the Westboro Baptist Church or its members were responsible for the attacks. 
Speaking with Huffington Post , Jackson said of the issues facing the country and the LGBT community: “The blatant acts of hate we experience at the Equality House mirror the acts of hate and discrimination our LGBT family experiences every day. Planting Peace has seen an increase in hate mail, death threats and physical acts of vandalism and violence over the past three months. According to the FBI, the LGBT community is more likely to experience a hate crime than any other minority group.” 
Even as these attacks continue, Planting Peace will continue to preach peace, love, and acceptance. Not long after the attacks, they tweeted out the following :

1482,Russia reportedly successfully tests nuclear-capable hypersonic glider warhead,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:54 UTC © Sergey Kazak / Sputnik Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems. The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russia's Far East. ""The test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field,"" the Defense Ministry reported. Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test Russia's hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, 'object 4202', or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. More importantly, an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed, making interception significantly harder, because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technology. Object 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with Russia's next-gen heavy strategic missile the RS-28 Sarmat. Military experts estimate that the new ICBM, an image of which was first made public this week, may carry up to three HGVs as payload. A previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in April.",0

1484,A Heated Linguistic Debate: What Makes ‘Redskins’ a Slur? - The New York Times,"Growing up as a member of the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, Brian Howard attended an elementary school that was within the boundaries of Phoenix and beyond those of his reservation. There, in the third grade, he was first called “redskin. ” Did the white classmate intend it as a term of endearment, akin to buddy? Or was it used as a verbal fist, intended to hurt and to sting? “A slur,” said Mr. Howard, 28, a legislative associate for the National Congress of American Indians. “Oh, yeah. Yes. ” But the widespread acceptance of the term as a pejorative  —   “now considered by many to be an offensive term,” according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary  —   has apparently been tossed into linguistic uncertainty by a recent Washington Post poll that centers on the name of a certain   professional football team. Suddenly, the poll seems to suggest, “redskin” is not so bad after all, raising the question of how society should decide what constitutes a slur. After all, if the   victims of the term are not offended, then.   …     According to the poll, nine of 10 Native Americans said they took no offense in the name of the Washington Redskins, a contentious, litigious issue that has pitted     advocates against the team’s owner, Daniel Snyder, and Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the National Football League. In addition, the poll  —   a survey of 504 people across the country  —   found that more than 70 percent of those questioned said they did not consider “redskin” to be disrespectful to Native Americans. What’s more, 80 percent said they would not be offended if called that name by someone who was not an American Indian. (An interesting   might be to spend a day or two at, say, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, walking up to random members of the Oglala Lakota community and calling them “redskin”  —   and recording how well that goes over.) The poll’s results have been interpreted as some kind of vindication for Mr. Snyder. It also led to a humbling admission by Robert McCartney, a longtime Washington Post journalist who had written many opinion articles calling on his favorite football team to drop the name, which he considered a racial slur. While acknowledging that he remains “deeply uncomfortable” with the term, Mr. McCartney said that “it’s unsettling to learn now that I vented all that energy and passion on behalf of such a small fraction of the Native American population. ” The connotation of words can evolve over time. Not long ago, for example, “queer” was considered a pejorative for gays and lesbians now it has become what linguists call a reclaimed epithet  —   a word adopted by a group in empowering defiance. In addition, accepted use might depend on the circumstances: The sharing of a certain racial slur among   does not entitle white people to use that term, so freighted is its ignominious history. Things can change in a mere generation. As a boy in Boston in the 1970s and early 1980s, Eugene Chay identified himself as Oriental, or  . It was the accepted term. “I grew up using ‘Oriental’ and being referred to as ‘Oriental,’” recalled Mr. Chay, who is a senior staff lawyer for a civil rights organization called   Advancing Justice. But by the   Mr. Chay had become aware of a shift in the language  —   of the growing sentiment that “Oriental” was geocentric, ethnocentric, and disparaging to Asians. It was a rhetorical tool of separation and otherness, he said. “We didn’t refer to people in the West as Occidental,” he said. “I eventually reached a point in my teens where I did not want to be referred to as Oriental, and where I took to task people who referred to me as Oriental. I asked to be referred to as Asian. ” But redskin? Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, who served as an expert for Native Americans petitioning to have the federal government cancel the Washington Redskins organization’s trademark registration, said the term was a qualified form of a reclaimed epithet. Some scholastic teams in Indian country have nicknames that include Redskins and Braves, he said, sort of as a way to say, “If you want redskin savages, then we’ll give you redskin savages. ” “It’s used in those schools in that reclaimed way,” Mr. Nunberg said. “But that doesn’t license its use by third parties. ” The term has come to be associated with hostility, and savagery, and a mélange of popular culture stereotypes that include “F Troop” and “Davy Crockett,” removed in some way from the fact of sustained genocide and mistreatment. “A word can be offensive simply because of its history,” Mr. Nunberg said. “You can’t pluck this term out of its history and say, ‘Because my intentions are honorable, it’s O. K.’” Debra Krol, a journalist in Arizona and an enrolled member of the Xolon Salinan Tribe, on the central coast of California, characterized the opposition to the term as symptomatic of the broader movement by blacks, Latinos and   to “strip our language of these terms that are offensive, demeaning. ” “These terms make it easier for people to think of us Indians as not really Americans,” she said. “Kind of like   of a person that blacks used to be under the U. S. Constitution. ” Ms. Krol also said there was disagreement among American Indians about the seriousness of the issue. “There are a lot of people out there who have a problem with it,” she said. “But there are a lot of other people who really don’t care either way  —   who say we have bigger problems to worry about than a sports team’s mascot and a name. ” But Tara Houska, a tribal lawyer and a member of the Couchiching First Nation in Canada, along the Minnesota border, pointed out that during the American Indian Movement of the 1960s, tribal leaders across the country cited mascots and team names like the Redskins and the Cleveland Indians as racist and dehumanizing. “This goes back long before I was born,” said Ms. Houska, 32, who helped organize a protest in Minneapolis in 2014 against the appropriation of Indian culture for team names and mascots. She questioned the methodology of the Post poll  —   which mirrored the results of a poll conducted in 2004 by the Annenberg Public Policy Center  —   saying that a survey of 504 people could hardly represent the feelings of 5. 2 million Native Americans. She also said that those who clung to family lore  —   of, say, being part Cherokee on their mother’s side  —   had experiences profoundly different from those who actually lived the Native American life, whether on or off a reservation. And, she said, the damage has been documented. A decade ago, the American Psychological Association recommended the immediate retirement of Native American mascots and symbols, in part because they appear “to have a negative impact on the   of American Indian children. ” Ms. Houska, who lives in Washington, said she was bracing for all the people who would be waving the poll in her face  —   “the poll, the poll, the poll”  —   and saying she had no right to be offended by the name of the local football team. That the matter is even up for debate baffles her. “It’s a   slur,” she said. “It’s a   racial slur. It should be a    —   but somehow, it’s not. ”",0

1487,Former Watergate Counsel: Trump-Nixon Comparisons ’Border on the Absurd’ - Breitbart,"The former Assistant Minority Counsel to the Watergate committee, Michael Madigan, has described comparisons between the Watergate scandal and the firing of FBI Director James Comey’s as “bordering on the absurd. ”[Since Trump’s decision to fire Comey last week, a number of politicians and   commentators have compared it to the 1972 Watergate scandal that led to Richard Nixon’s resignation.   Earlier this week, former Comey associates leaked a memo asserting that Trump asked him not to investigate his former national security adviser Mike Flynn over his meeting with the Russian ambassador. However, Michael Madigan, currently the Democratic speaker for the Illinois House of Representatives, dismissed the claims, pointing to the fact that numerous Democrats had previously called for Comey’s dismissal. In a statement, he said:  Having served as Assistant Minority Counsel to the late Senators Howard Baker and Fred Thompson, it borders on the absurd to hear the comparisons from a gaggle of politicians and pundits between Watergate and the firing of the FBI Director by President Trump. Leaving aside that numerous Democrats have themselves ‘demanded’ the firing of Comey and that Comey himself notes that the FBI Director can be fired for ‘no reason’ at all, the comparisons are not only blatant partisan nonsense, they diminish the historic process which lead to President’s Nixon’s resignation in the summer of 1974.   Watergate involved a clear crime for which those involved were indicted, tried in a jury trial or pleaded guilty to clear criminal actions.  Having missed the mark with such comparisons, this politically driven gaggle has now moved on to argue that our President’s suggestion (if there was one) that the FBI should have its priorities in stopping the damaging leaks around classified information and not chasing down a former employee is equally weak and frankly an insult to both Democrats and Republicans who served this country so well at a critical time under the impartial guidance of Senators Ervin and Baker.

1488,Dem Rep Waters: Obama Admin ’Has Done Everything’ It Can To ’Make Sure’ People See Trump-Russia Connections - Breitbart,"On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Representative Maxine Waters ( ) stated that she believes “there was a connection between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians” and “I think there is a trail, and I think that the Obama administration has done everything that it can possibly do  …    to make sure that enough people have seen some of the meetings and some of the connections, so that they have something to go on when the investigations are really underway. ”  Waters said, “I’m going to continue to do my work, to do everything that I possibly can, to help connect the dots, to help encourage independent investigation or commission. I’m going to do everything that I can to keep my colleagues interested enough to want to fight to see exactly what happened. Because I believe that there was a connection between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians and the Kremlin. And I do believe that those connections are there for a reason. And I think that the work that has already been discovered, that was done, in order to have Trump, should be followed up. We shouldn’t say  —   let our intelligence agency say, yes we discovered that the DNC was hacked, and that efforts were made to help Trump in this campaign and to undermine Hillary Clinton, and that’s it. We don’t have to do anything else. No, this is serious and I think that we must continue this struggle to dig deeper, to drill deeper. ” She continued, “I think there is a trail, and I think that the Obama administration has done everything that it can possibly do, and that’s probably been verified somewhat by the New York Times, to make sure that enough people have seen some of the meetings and some of the connections, so that they have something to go on when the investigations are really underway. ” Waters added, “What we know is that, we can’t trust the AG. We can’t trust the FBI. We can’t trust Comey. We can’t trust Sessions, and so, we’ve got to get an independent overseer of some kind in here to get going with these investigations. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
1489,"At the Mosul Front: Traps, Smoke Screens and Suicide Bombers - The New York Times","Mr. Denton, a Times photographer, and Mr. Gordon, a Times military correspondent, are with Kurdish forces near Sheikh Amir, Iraq, on the eastern approach to Mosul.  The Kurdish pesh merga forces started their advance by moonlight, in the early hours of Monday. East of the Islamic   city of Mosul, columns of tanks and trucks lumbered their way toward the objective: clearing villages of militants before any broader advance on the city could happen. As day broke, the vehicles piled off the roads to avoid any improvised bombs and began moving across the dusty Nineveh plain toward the villages. The tank fire began, booming across the distance. Soon the crawl became a run. Thick funnels of black smoke began rising from the towns  —   a past tactic used by the Islamic State militants, setting oil barrels aflame to try to screen them from American airstrikes. The strikes came anyway, sending shock waves through the haze. The campaign to retake Mosul was officially underway. In the weeks ahead, officials are planning an array of efforts by Iraqi security forces, allied militias, Kurdish forces and air support from the United States as the assault reaches to the city  —   the most critical population center captured by the militants in their blitz across Iraq in 2014, and now their last major stronghold in the country. But in the opening hours on Monday, the Kurdish advance on outlying villages east of Mosul was the main action. New York Times journalists traveled with one group of Kurdish fighters as they set out. Islamic State militants quickly showed that they were not going to abandon the villages without a fight: They unleashed at least five suicide vehicle bombs  —   the militant force’s take on   weapons. Near the village of Badana, one vehicle packed with explosives streaked toward the Kurdish positions. A blast and a billowing plume of white smoke proclaimed its fate: Either a   missile or airstrike had abruptly halted the suicide run, short of its target. One Kurdish officer, Col. Salar Jabar, put the final toll of the   operation at five Kurdish dead and five wounded. Colonel Jabar, who uses a cane after surviving a   attack this year, was understated about the challenge. “There was some resistance” was how he put it, insisting that his troops could handle it. As the Kurds settled into their positions, bulldozers came up to start making walls of sand outside some of the villages  —   berms against further car bomb attacks. Kurdish commanders insisted that they were satisfied by the day’s advance, which came in three main columns. Even so, fewer than half of the 10 or so villages they had encircled had been fully cleared, in painstaking and potentially dangerous operations to ensure that no Islamic State fighters were hiding in the settlements. And on Tuesday, Iraqi officials said the advance had halted indefinitely. The monumental challenge that lies ahead was becoming clear. After all, the ultimate objective of the combined assault is not to clear largely depopulated villages, but to reclaim a city of more than a million people that is defended by as many as 4, 500 Islamic State fighters. In preparation, the militants have filled trenches with oil, built tunnels and planted copious improvised bombs along the roads to the city and on the streets within it. “The Iraqi flag will be raised in the middle of Mosul and in each village and corner very soon,” Iraq’s prime minister, Haider   promised early Monday as he announced the start of the assault. Mr. Abadi has closely tied his political fortunes to the retaking of Mosul, Iraq’s   city, and his announcement of the operation, just before 2 a. m. was hours before the Kurds began their main push. Under the overall plan to retake Mosul, troops from Iraq’s counterterrorism unit are to link up with the pesh merga in coming days and press forward. That could be the first serious test of Iraq’s premier force in the fight for Mosul. But political tensions between the Kurds and the Iraqi government are a concern. Toward the end of the day, Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish semiautonomous region, appeared with a senior Iraqi military officer, in a news conference intended to demonstrate that the two sides could work together, at least as far as fighting the Islamic State is concerned. There is little in the way of shelter or cover along the approaches the pesh merga were taking, and there are many other villages to clear. Smoke from some could be seen from miles away over the flat plain. The stark nature of the landscape points to another problem ahead: As fighting intensifies, hundreds of thousands of residents are expected to pour out of the city  —   even though the United States and Iraqi forces are publicly urging the civilians to stay in their homes. “Basically, we have little less than a week,” Lise Grande, the top United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said on Monday. Ms. Grande said that the United Nations had stockpiled supplies  —   including tents and shelters that can accommodate 400, 000 people at the ready  —   but that there were not yet enough sites ready for temporary camps. It is also unclear in which direction fleeing civilians will go. The military, Ms. Grande said, has drawn up secret escape routes for civilians that will be conveyed to residents inside Mosul as the battle progresses. This is a lesson from the battle of Falluja last summer, when the routes  —   known as humanitarian corridors  —   were targeted by the Islamic State after being made public.",0
1490,Gay Catholic Groups Want Pope Francis to Do More Than Apologize - The New York Times,"ROME  —   Leaders of gay Catholic groups on Monday praised Pope Francis for saying that all Christians and the Roman Catholic Church owed an apology to gays for previous mistreatment, even as the groups called on the church to take more concrete steps to repudiate past teachings and condemn   violence. Streaking across the sky on Sunday night in his papal airliner, returning from a visit to Armenia, Francis also visibly winced, momentarily overcome with emotion, when a journalist, Cindy Wooden, mentioned the recent attack at an Orlando gay nightclub and noted that Christians are sometimes blamed for stigmatizing homosexuals. Francis did not directly address the Orlando killings. But he endorsed a comment of one of his top advisers who, soon after the Orlando attack, said that the church had marginalized gay people  and should apologize. The pope said the church “must” not only apologize to a gay person it offended, “but we must apologize to the poor, to women who have been exploited, to children forced into labor. ” Marianne   executive director of DignityUSA, a leading organization of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics, said the pope’s remarks represented a powerful statement, if not enough. “For a pope to acknowledge that the church has done so much damage to gay people, and that we deserve an apology, is an unprecedented act of humility,” she said in a telephone interview. “But a statement of remorse is only as good as the change in behavior that follows. ” Francis’s outreach toward gays has been part of his broader effort to welcome people who have felt marginalized by the church. He made global headlines early in his papacy when he signaled a new openness toward gays when he famously uttered, “Who am I to judge?” Francis’ words raised hopes among some gay Catholics and others that he might make significant changes inside the church itself. Some advocates even wondered if he might loosen the church’s prohibition of   marriage as part of his broader move to make the church more welcoming to unconventional families. But Francis has steadfastly opposed   marriage. His   document on family life, “Amoris Laetitia,” called on the church to welcome gay people but flatly closed the door on   marriage. “He’s not liberal,” said the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who is close to the pope. Instead, Father Spadaro said Francis sought to avoid categorizing people and wanted a welcoming environment devoid of discrimination. “Of course,” he added, “he wants a church of open doors. ” In a statement, Ryan Hoffman,   director of Call to Action, a Catholic group, praised Francis’ remarks but also called on Catholic officials to “reform teachings and practices that refer to gay people as ‘objectively disordered’ and ‘intrinsically evil.’ ” “It’s time Francis’ wise words translate into just action,” Mr. Hoffman said. Ms.   pointed to cases of the firing of gay employees of Catholic schools in the United States after they married in civil ceremonies. She also noted that bishops around the world often played leading roles in campaigns against gay rights. “We need the church to understand the reality of our lives,” she said. “And where church teaching and practice has caused so much trouble. ” Popes have a tradition of apologizing for past sins of the church. In 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a sweeping apology for the church’s errors over the previous 2, 000 years. Francis himself offered a striking apology during his 2015 trip to South America, when he asked for forgiveness for the church’s complicity in the brutality of the era of Spanish colonialism. “There are a lot of people at the Vatican who don’t like the church ever admitting we ever did anything wrong,” said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit priest and senior analyst for The National Catholic Reporter. “With gays, it is especially important because they are still subject to persecution and discrimination all over the world, and even in the United States. ”",0
1491,"Fake News: USDA, Journos Blame Breitbart for Fox News Error Without Evidence - Breitbart","In another example of “fake news,” several   journalists have spread unconfirmed speculation from a government agency to attack Breitbart  —   and, unsurprisingly, they were 100% wrong. [A USDA spokesperson told Washington Post writer Erik Wemple (pictured) that a Breitbart News article may have been the basis for a   Fox News story about food stamp fraud.  “We reported that back in 2016, $70 million were wasted on food stamp fraud. That was actually incorrect,” Fox and Friends   Abby Huntsman said Friday, correcting a report she made on Tuesday. Huntsman’s retraction came at the behest of the USDA, according to Wemple. “We are not quite sure where this came from,” a USDA spokesperson reportedly told Wemple, adding “We saw that there was a story on Breitbart. We have not issued a report on this recently. There is no new rate that we’ve published. So we’re not quite sure why they’re so interested in stirring this up. ” The USDA spokesperson was correct Breitbart News did recently publish a piece about food stamps titled: “Under Obama, 10. 7 Million More Use Food Stamps —  A 32 Percent Jump. ” However, nowhere in that article does the word “fraud” appear  —   not once. Wemple did not bother to mention that fact. Within hours of Wemple’s report, several journalists with Verified Twitter accounts used the quote from USDA to call Breitbart the “source” of Fox’s false report. Fox News falsely reported on a   gov study, and you’ll be SHOCKED by who the source was pic. twitter.   —   Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) December 30, 2016,  Wasn’t @FoxNews, it was @BreitbartNews that made it up.

That’s not entirely unbelievable, seeing as Weiner was up to all sorts of things he wasn’t eager to share with the wife. Then again, it’s not a great defense to mount when trying to counter charges that Hillary Clinton and her aides at the State Department were extremely careless with their handling of sensitive materials. Trending If Hillary wants to know what new information the FBI has, Sharyl Attkisson knows someone she could ask 
That’s weird, though: the story before was that Abedin would forward government emails to her Yahoo mail account so she could print them for the boss, who liked paper copies so that she could relax to the familiar, comforting sound of the office shredder grinding away. But all someone had to do was log into her Yahoo account, and … @ktumulty She used his computer at least once to check her email or maybe he was checking her email. Spouses are known to do that.",0
1493,Comment on Award Winning American Journalist Exposes The True Origin Of ISIS & The “War On Terror” by HILLARY CLINTON’S TIES TO ISIS SUPPORTERS | osmanisnin,"  “The statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.” – Mark Twain ( source )   Award winning journalist Ben Swann shares a number of facts regarding the origin and creation of ISIS, the supposed terrorist group that seems to have replaced Al-Qaeda and, according to former FBI translator and founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (NSWBC) Sibel Edmunds, has revived the “terror war industry.” When it comes to supposed “terrorist” attacks, it’s no secret that the government or the “powers that be” are involved in some way, shape, or form. We’ve seen this with Al-Qaeda, and various documents that have tied them to U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA. We’ve also seen a lot of shady circumstances surrounding the “terrorist” attacks that occurred on 9/11; the evidence alone has approximately half of the American people believing it was an inside job – a simple Google search of the polls will show you that, and for the evidence we are referring to, you can access our articles on that topic here . “All three buildings were destroyed by carefully planned, orchestrated and executed controlled demolition.” – Professor Lynn Margulis, Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts at Amherst and National Academy of Science member, one of many academics who has been very outspoken regarding 9/11 ( source ) ( source ) All of this activity continues to be used as more justification for a heightened national security state, one in which citizens are being forced to give up their freedoms and privacy in order to be “protected” from such attacks. The entire national security state would crumble if people found out that it was their own government perpetrating these attacks, and this realization is finally beginning to leave the realm of conspiracy and enter into the realm of reality in the minds of the masses. It’s about time. “Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.” – David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence ( source )   The “terrorists” we are pointing our fingers at (or so I believe, along with many others, after having done careful research) are a creation of Western intelligence, used to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Those who usually do not believe that, almost one hundred percent of the time have not actually done any research, or examined the information for themselves. This is the power mainstream media has over us – if something is depicted on television, it’s instantly believed without question. Any other explanation which does not come from a major mainstream media outlet (like CNN, for example), or fit the framework of accepted knowledge, seems to be met with harsh resistance. This resistance comes despite the fact that a tremendous amount of evidence is available in the form of videos, documents, and whistle-blowers, yet a large majority of people still refuse to do any research for themselves, or again, believe something contrary to what Western media is telling them. “The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the ‘devil’ only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.” – Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook

1494,Trump and the Power of Money," Trump and the Power of Money
By Peter Koenig
 "" PIPR "" - Imagine, Donald Trump would accede to the US Presidency, an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming, slashing and demonizing him, not unlike they do with President Putin  while cheering no-end for the warmonger Killary, no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body, no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it  like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan  and more, much more. They, the elite, the military-security complex, the financial mafia, want more blood, more than is already covering the entire current Obama Administrations structure of psychopaths. Blood is weapons, blood is money, blood is more profit, blood is good for business  so said the Washington Post, just slightly translated from war is good for business. The warmongering MSM (mainstream media) also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military-security complex that pays them. But just for a moment, lets assume, Trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage.
Trump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war. Trump seems to be looking into a different direction. He essentially says  stop the conflict with Russia, make Russia a partner, stop outsourcing jobs, bring them back, give labor back to Americans, slash the unemployment rate  which is, of course, everybody knows, way above the silly fabricated 5%. The reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the US is hovering between 22% and 25%, a real hammer for the economy, increasing anger and unhappiness and crime. Trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs  STOP globalization, restrain NATO, rein in the banks  yes, Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs-es and Co. of this world of fake pyramid money, dominated by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-Morgan clan. Trump says, lets have a financial system that works for the people.
Does he mean it?  I dont know. Could be true. Most of what he says makes sense for America, for Americans  and by extension for much of the rest of the world, especially Europe, the genuine Europe, not the puppet-commandeered Europe. He also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish  like building a wall separating Mexico from the US of A, emulating Israel; and propagates a crackdown on Moslems. Does he mean it? Or does he want to please potential voters?  Such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish, but they are secondary to all the other things that are PRIORITARY, as they would help restore American society, workforce, dignity  most important: DIGNITY. Dignity is important for Americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money, the peoples resources  on countless criminal wars around the world, feverishly racing towards Full Spectrum Dominance to benefit a few. The secondary stuff is important too, but can be dealt with in parallel by Americans that have come to senses.
Trump is in many ways like Frances Marine LePen, representing the extreme right, and therefore, no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do  and I dont doubt one minute that she means what she says  like EUREXIT and send NATO to hell  she is still framed by the left intellectuals  if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe  as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all colored and veiled foreigners. Of course, thats bad. But let her first initiating France exiting from the EU, the Euro and NATO  the likely salvation of Europe, then tackle the other issues. First comes first. A true intellectual left would have to understand that  and not bend to the presstitute promoted clichés.
Trump has enough money power. He doesnt have to bend to the military security complex, to the banks, to the Obamacare pharma-fiefdom. He doesnt really have to bend to anybody. That worries the elite. He is independent. Lets give him the benefit of the doubt. In no case could he be worse than Hillary  the killer  so much can be read from every word she says. Her pattern of pathology  We came, we saw, we won , when she saw the bloodstained image of the NATO-slaughtered Ghaddafi  indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous Red Button of Death and total world annihilation  perhaps even repeating that same smirk, , We came, we saw, we won .
Now lets go to the next hypothesis, assuming Trump would be elected and they  the elusive high-powered small elite that pulls the strings on Washington and the White Houses overseas puppets, and lets assume they would let him live, at least for a while, Trump might be doing irrational things in the eye of the Beltway slaves. Recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor, Canada, Mr. Trump might call on the western stooges, in Europe particularly, who for the sake of brown-nosing the naked king in Washington, are prepared to sell-out 500-plus million European and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known  CETA, TTIP and TiSA (let alone the TPP, where 12 Pacific countries are about to kiss ass in Washington)  telling them to come to senses, think democracy and stop the deals that 80% or more of Europeans despise and reject.
As a parenthesis and philosophically speaking, one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe, of shameless exploitation, of raping and killing millions of people throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that these trade deals are Europes historically deserved heritage.

The Saker wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election, The US Is About To Face The Worst Crisis in Their History  http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article45729.htm . One of the articles commenters pinned it down to the point:  If Trump does become Commander in Chief, his first job will be securing his life. Those who really run the show in the US will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire. Truly the US is at a cross roads and by extension the world. Times are really scary .
What Trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office, he presented in a groundbreaking speech at Gettysburg, Pa. this past weekend, is for the most part truly astounding http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/24/donald-trump-delivers-a-powerful-policy-speech-on-his-first-100-days-in-office/ . It is not less than revolutionary, because no US politician, let alone a Presidential candidate or President has said something for the most part so sensible as did Presidential candidate Trump. Summarizing, he promises bringing back overseas jobs, would prevent the continued outsourcing of the American production processes, bring order to the crime-ridden communities, he would seek friendly partnership with Russia, defusing the WWIII threat  and he would tackle, restrain and control the corrupt banking system, including the endless money-making machine, the privately owned, Rothschild dominated FED.  That is a challenge other Presidents have failed to master, including Lincoln and JFK. We know how they ended.
Trump has already hinted that to revive the American economy the zero-interest policy may have to be changed, so that banks become more responsible. The owners off the system would hardly allow Trumps interference in their obscene profit-making scheme. Theyd rather at their calling let the bomb loose. A sudden change of this policy would hit many over-stretched banks like a bombshell  reminiscent of 2008 Lehman Brothers, just magnified by a factor of 10. There are currently at least three, possibly five Wall Street giants that are on the edge. They get by, because of the FEDs zero interest policy- and they make sure that this doesnt change, as several if not all of them are part of the private FED system. Would Trump dare touching this system?  Its a deadly challenge. He knows it.
This time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse, a planned emulation of the 2007 / 2008 crisis, where Wall Street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax-money bail-outs. Be aware, this time it would not be tax-payers money that would rescue the Too-Big-To Fail (TBTF) banks, but it would be YOUR money, your deposits, your savings, your pension funds, possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being collapsed  and the process would be called bail-ins.
The (western) world is under the hegemon of a privately-owned money system, the US-dollar  and most people dont even know it. The accent is on the western world , because the east, comprising Russia, China, the SCO countries (Shanghai Cooperation Organization  comprising China and Russia and most of the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, plus Iran and Pakistan  and others are waiting in the wings), the EEU (Eurasian Economic Union), as well as most of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block.  I have said this before, but will repeat it for readers to realize  this economic block  is largely, if not entirely, delinked from the dollar scheme. It consists of about half the worlds population and one third of the worlds GDP, a solid GDP that is. In contrast to the western, especially the US GDP; in the eastern block much of the GDP is based on real labor output and manufacturing.
In reality, this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the worlds largest economic development potential, since history remembers, the New Silk Road  or the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) economic development scheme, stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon (if Europe chooses to participate), does not need the west anymore. The OBOR project has already begun. It represents a view into the future, with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people during coming generations  a dynamic vision for the future. The east is where the future lays.
-
Donald Trump as President notwithstanding, a new western well-planned banking collapse may start in the US, the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe  sinking millions, hundreds of millions of people into poverty, misery, the like we havent seen in recent history. The banks depositors money might not be enough. The reptiles are hungry. They might privatize public properties, infrastructures, roads, ports railways, health care, education, pensions, natural resources  anything that is still in the hands of the people. If Greece is a reminder, then think of Greece blown up by a factor of 1000  all around the globe, touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries  billions of people. While the money flows again from the poor to the rich, to an ever-shrinking pool of super-rich; widening the rich-poor gap to a disgusting yawn. Leaving the 99.99 %  by now the 99. % ever more powerless, having to fend for sheer survival  seeking refuge in better lands  Its a war by money. Canons, bombs and guns could rest  for a while.
For years, I have felt the Empire will have to be brought down from inside  from the people who cant take it anymore, from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monsters back. Rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way. It may still happen. But now I side more with The Sakers theory, namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces, not so much military forces, but economic forces. In theory, it could happen tomorrow. Just imagine, the one third of world-GDP-countries would drop all their dollar reserves, all the dollar denominated international contracts, all dollar issued trade agreements  and in particular, abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in US-dollars. It would most likely wipe out the western economy.
This will not happen, of course. Simply, because the One Third GDP holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world, especially the so-called developing and emerging countries, many  or most of them  eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co-existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts  a sheer dollar-fed killing spree, with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end.
The Power of Money. Would Donald Trump, as President, himself a moneyed powerhouse, survive such a calamity? In fact, would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around, guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between East and West?  Or is the train already too far out of the station?  No telling at this time. The signals are certainly not good. But, lets put in a grain of optimism and bank on a positive strand of dynamics fueled by an increasing human consciousness  one that would not allow Hillary to push the Death Button.

1497,CLINTON CASH 3.0: Chelsea Clinton Being Groomed To Buy Seat In Congress By NWO Handlers,"  CLINTON CASH 3.0: Chelsea Clinton Being Groomed To Buy Seat In Congress By NWO Handlers While Chelsea Clinton currently lives, and is registered to vote, in Manhattan, she could easily make Chappaqua her legal residence in order to run for Lowey’s seat when it becomes vacant.   11, 2016 While some pundits are declaring the Clinton political dynasty dead, sources tell us that it is far from over. Chelsea Clinton is being groomed for the New York seat held by Rep. Nita Lowey. 
Chelsea Clinton could run for the seat in NYC’s 17th Congressional District once Lowey, a respected, 79-year-old career politician with nearly 30 years in office, decides to retire, we have exclusively learned. 
Lowey’s district includes parts of Rockland and Westchester counties and, conveniently, Chappaqua, the Clinton family home base. Continuing the Clinton Crime Brand: 
If you thought for one, fleeting second that the Clintons would just somehow walk away after Crooked Hillary’s rejection by the American people, think again. There are many more billions to be made, and many more state favors to sell and trade. So the baton gets passed to Chelsea. Congresswoman Chelsea Clinton. Thanks for the Congressional seat, mom and dad! 
In August, Hillary and Bill Clinton purchased a home next door to their primary residence in Chappaqua for $1.16 million, which is intended for Chelsea, her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and their two children, Charlotte and Aidan. While Chelsea currently lives, and is registered to vote, in Manhattan, she could easily make Chappaqua her legal residence in order to run for Lowey’s seat when it becomes vacant. 
A source told us , “While it is true the Clintons need some time to regroup after Hillary’s crushing loss , they will not give up. Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand. In the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail. While politics isn’t the life Hillary wanted for Chelsea, she chose to go on the campaign trail for her mother and has turned out to be very poised, articulate and comfortable with the visibility.” 
The source continued, “There has been a lot of speculation within New York Democratic circles about Lowey’s retirement and Chelsea running for the seat. There is a belief that Chappaqua is a logical place for Chelsea to run, because it would be straightforward for her to raise money and build a powerful base.” 
A spokesperson for Lowey — who is serving her 14th term in Congress and was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1988 — declined to comment. A spokesperson for Chelsea didn’t get back to us. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",0
1499,Donald Trump and R.N.C. Crack Down on Rebelling Delegates - The New York Times,"The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are moving quickly and aggressively to head off the fledgling effort to stage a revolt at their convention next month in Cleveland, hoping to spare the party an embarrassing spectacle that could deeply wound the presumptive nominee. They are employing   tactics, warning delegates that attempting to undermine Donald J. Trump’s claim to the nomination violates party rules, and threatening to deny speaking slots to Republicans they deem disloyal for not backing him. “If there’s no endorsement, then I would not invite them to speak,” Mr. Trump said in an interview, adding that former rivals like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio should not expect to address the convention if they continue to withhold their support. The R. N. C. and the Trump campaign are also installing loyal party stalwarts in key party positions to help ensure that they maintain control of the convention if rogue delegates attempt a disruption. And they are trying to discredit Republicans who are advocating an interpretation of party rules that would allow delegates to vote for anyone they want on the first ballot. Their moves are intended to buttress Mr. Trump as he confronts a faction of Republicans who, emboldened by his recent missteps, say their efforts to stage a convention coup are gaining more support. In the last week, prominent Republicans like House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin have breathed new life into these efforts by saying that delegates should be free to follow their consciences instead of being committed to back a candidate. Stopping the presumptive nominee at the convention  —   one who won 37 states and has an indisputable majority of delegates  —   would be an extraordinary affront and seems improbable at this point. But even if the   forces fall short, the scene that threatens to unfold on national television would be an unwelcome one for Mr. Trump and the Republican Party: a band of angry, rebelling delegates trying to seize control of the convention and wrest away the nomination. Mr. Trump insisted in an interview last week that his opponents would fail to derail his nomination. “You mean to tell me we’re going to get the largest vote in the history of the Republican primaries,” he said, “and now the same people that either didn’t run or got beaten in a landslide are going to try and  ?” “My supporters are tremendously loyal to me,” he added. “They would not stand for it. ” Such a   approach would seem to create grim prospects for any kind of reconciliation with Mr. Cruz, who will command more than 500 delegates when the convention begins in three weeks. And to deny Mr. Cruz a speech  —   or for that matter Mr. Kasich, the governor of the state that is hosting the convention  —   would be a rare rebuke. Speeches by the   are usually a   draw at any convention, and usually a foregone conclusion for an event that is supposed to convey party unity and good will. But the speaking arrangements may not be entirely up to Mr. Trump. Because Mr. Cruz won a majority of delegates in at least eight states, he would probably be able to have his name entered into nomination, guaranteeing him a speech under party rules. For its part, the committee is leaving little to chance as it works closely with the Trump campaign in plotting the mechanics of the convention. The two have hired about a dozen operatives to ensure that the nominating vote goes off without a hitch. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, has dispatched associates to reach out to   delegates. And lawyers for the committee are advising state party leaders how to beat back the   efforts, prompting party chairs from Minnesota to Washington State to issue admonitions to delegates who may be thinking of breaking their obligation to vote for Mr. Trump. Party officials are now gently reminding delegates that in the process of applying to be a delegate, many of them signed statements vowing to vote for the candidate to which they were pledged. Mr. Trump has the pledged support of more than 1, 500 delegates, the vast majority of whom were awarded to him based on party rules that allot the most delegates to the winner of each primary and caucus. The R. N. C. pushback has been strong in states that Mr. Trump lost, like Iowa and Minnesota. “The proposed ‘conscience exemption’ does not change anything for Minnesota, especially given each national delegate’ ’s signed pledge,” a message to Minnesota delegates from state party leaders said last week. Party officials are also working to thwart delegates who are encouraging a “conscience vote” based on the notion that Republican rules cannot bind anyone to any candidate. Freeing the delegates, known as unbinding, has been promoted for years by Curly Haugland, a committee official from North Dakota. Yet as his ideas gained currency, Mr. Haugland found that committee officials were sending out emails attempting to discredit him  —   like one forwarded to him by a delegate friend that read in part: “Curly Haugland is the originator of the ideas that are flooding the inboxes of delegates nationwide. He is the North Dakota National Committeeman who every four years challenges the Convention Rules  —   and loses. ” “It’s a total smear campaign,” Mr. Haugland said in an interview. But the   forces are determined to push their cause. One activist, Steve Lonegan, who directed Mr. Cruz’s losing campaign in New Jersey, is now helping a political action committee that advocates letting delegates vote their consciences. The group, Courageous Conservatives, started running a radio ad in Iowa last week that urged people to call Steve Scheffler, a national committeeman in Iowa who is trying to quash the revolt, and demand “to let our delegates pick the best Republican to fight for our conservative values. ” Another group called Delegates Unbound has begun a nationwide ad campaign that implores, “Vote your conscience. ” Mr. Scheffler, who is among the 112 members of the convention’s rules committee, which could ultimately resolve the unbinding issue, said in an interview that he did not even vote for Mr. Trump in the Iowa caucuses. But he believes the will of the voters should be honored at the convention. “Don’t bellyache to me that you don’t like the process. It is what it is,” Mr. Scheffler said, noting that he did not plan to check his voice mail until after the convention. “The voters have spoken,” he added. “Why would 112 people say, ‘We don’t care what you did, we’re going to set our own rules? ’” One major hurdle the   forces face is that the rules committee will be full of delegates like Mr. Scheffler, Republicans loyal to the party committee who might not have wanted Mr. Trump as the nominee but are nonetheless determined to keep the convention from turning into a debacle. Adding to those hurdles, Mr. Priebus has put in trusted loyalists to run the convention rules committee while working with the Trump campaign and state parties to make sure the most important committees are not stacked with unpredictable delegates. In that sense, the motives of the Trump campaign and the Republican Party have aligned after months of mutual mistrust. While party people are not necessarily Trump people, and Trump people are not necessarily party people, the two sides are now locked in a marriage of convenience. Mr. Trump is trying to protect his nomination, while the party is trying to protect the integrity of its nominating process. Peter Feaman, who will serve on the convention rules committee and has a long history with the party, including serving as Florida’s party chairman, called the talk of ditching Mr. Trump “a lot of sound and fury. ” “We’re going to ride the Trump bandwagon into 1600 Penn Ave. or into oblivion,” he added. “One or the other. ”",0
1500,"As Attention Grows, Transgender Children’s Numbers Are Elusive - The New York Times","The Obama administration’s directive last week instructing public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with has set off an intense debate. Many politicians and parents have raised alarms about privacy and warned of predatory boys sneaking into girls’ bathrooms. But others say that such accommodations are critical protections for a vulnerable population. For all of the heated debate, a central fact remains elusive: How many students are we talking about? No one knows for sure. Researchers have not figured out how to obtain consistent, reliable answers from teenagers, much less younger children. The best estimates are that the population is small, probably under 1 percent of adolescents. There are none. Pediatricians generally do not ask patients about their gender identity, and if they do, they do not usually report findings in national health registries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which analyzes much of our behavioral health data, has tested ways for students to identify themselves as transgender. But it has not yet settled on a satisfactory method, and it does not expect to include such a question in its adolescent health survey before 2019. Some local surveys have been done, with results falling in a narrow range. A 2015 health behavior survey of 18, 494 high school students in Dane County, Wis. which includes Madison, found that 1. 5 percent of students identified themselves as transgender. In 2006, the Boston Youth Survey asked 1, 032 public high school students, “Are you transgender?” The responses were 1. 6 percent yes, 86. 3 percent no, and 6. 3 percent “don’t know. ” An additional 5. 7 percent skipped the question. Some believe that these estimates are low, “because trans identity has become more salient and acceptance has increased,” said Jody L. Herman, a scholar of public policy at the U. C. L. A. School of Law’s Williams Institute. “But we don’t have any way of knowing that. ” Interestingly, in surveys, a higher proportion of teenagers than adults tend to identify themselves as transgender. Analyzing adult survey data from Massachusetts and California, the Williams Institute estimated in 2011 that 700, 000 adults, or 0. 3 percent of the national population, were transgender, a number that is frequently cited. Lots of reasons. The situation in which a survey is conducted  —   in school a telephone call an   interview  —   will influence the candor of the response. So will the wording of the question. In some surveys, for example, students have been asked, “Do you identify as: a) male, b) female or c) transgender?” “That is a terrible question because you can only select one,” said Emily A. Greytak, director of research at G. L. S. E. N. the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. “‘So what do I check? Transgender?’ Or they’ll check girl, because ‘I want to be a girl.’ So you get bad data. ” And they are, after all, teenagers. “You end up with adolescents who don’t read the question carefully, or who will check ‘D’ for everything, or will choose what they think is a   option,” said Kerith Conron, a social and psychiatric epidemiologist at the Fenway Institute in Boston, which develops health programs for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, among others. Still, despite all of the imperfect information, researchers have come up with a best estimate for the number of transgender teenagers. “We all have a sense that the number is probably between 0. 5 percent and 1. 5 percent,” Dr. Greytak said. The Obama administration’s directive covers elementary schools, too. But the number of very young children who identify as transgender is even harder to determine. Almost no research has been done on child gender identity. One challenge is that much of the information would have to come from parents. Dr. Conron, who has worked with parents of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths, said, “Parents often do not know that a child’s gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth until their child, or another person, often in adolescence, tells them so. ” Some developmental psychologists say that children as young as 2 or 3 can express a gender identity that is at odds with the one defined by their genitalia. But other children take years, even decades, to determine that they are transgender. Younger children whose behavior and preferences may not be solidly masculine or feminine are increasingly called “ ” or “ ” by educators, psychologists and parents. Those who work with transgender students say that school accommodations will affect few students. But the effect for transgender students, they say, is powerful. Many studies have shown that transgender students are a particularly vulnerable group. They are disproportionately affected by bullying and have higher rates of suicide than the population at large. “There’s a lot of documentation about how hunger impacts a kid’s ability to learn, how they can’t concentrate,” Dr. Conron said. “In my research with transgender youth, many talk about having to ‘hold it’ all day because they cannot access an appropriate, safe bathroom. Can you imagine how not being able to void would impact one’s ability to concentrate and succeed at school?”",0

If Steve Bannon is going to be the chief White House political and policy strategist, Donald Trump is in deep trouble before he even gets started.

1502,"Leashes Come Off Wall Street, Gun Sellers, Polluters and More - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Giants in telecommunications, like Verizon and ATT, will not have to take “reasonable measures” to ensure that their customers’ Social Security numbers, web browsing history and other personal information are not stolen or accidentally released. Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will not be punished, at least for now, for not collecting extra money from customers to cover potential losses from certain kinds of   trades that helped unleash the 2008 financial crisis. And Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns, nor will hunters be banned from using   bullets, which can accidentally poison wildlife, on 150 million acres of federal lands. These are just a few of the more than 90 regulations that federal agencies and the   Congress have delayed, suspended or reversed in the month and a half since President Trump took office, according to a tally by The New York Times. The emerging effort  —   dozens more rules could be eliminated in the coming weeks  —   is one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in recent decades. It is the leading edge of what Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, described late last month as “the deconstruction of the administrative state. ” In many cases, records show that the changes came after appeals by corporate lobbyists and trade association executives, who see a potentially historic opportunity to lower compliance costs and drive up profits. Slashing regulations, they argue, will unleash economic growth. On a near daily basis, regulated industries are now sending in specific requests to the Trump administration for more rollbacks, including recent appeals from 17 automakers to rescind an agreement to increase mileage standards for their fleets, and another from pharmaceutical industry figures to reverse a new rule that tightens scrutiny over the marketing of prescription drugs for unapproved uses. As of late Friday, word had leaked that the automakers’ request for a rollback was about to be granted, too. “After a relentless,   regulatory onslaught that loaded unprecedented burdens on businesses and the economy, relief is finally on the way,” Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a memo last week. But dozens of public interest groups  —   environmentalists, labor unions, consumer watchdogs  —   have weighed in on the potential threat to Americans’  . “Americans did not vote to be exposed to more health, safety, environmental and financial dangers,” said one letter, signed by leaders of 137 nonprofit groups to the White House last week. In other cases, the   rules under attack have drawn objections even from some liberal groups that called them examples of overreach, like the American Civil Liberties Union’s protest of a system to block mentally ill people from buying guns. The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts. Congress, with Mr. Trump’s approval, has erased three   rules in the last month, lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration, as well as the sale of guns to the mentally ill. More than 25 more rules could also be erased in the coming weeks the House has already voted to eliminate nearly half. Mr. Trump has separately signed executive orders directing agencies to pursue the reversal of other rules, including a requirement that financial advisers act in the interest of their clients, and a rule aimed at protecting drinking water from pollution. New White House appointees at agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have also personally intervened in recent weeks to block, delay or start the process to nullify other rules, such as a requirement that corporations publish tallies comparing chief executive pay with average employee wages. The Trump administration has also imposed a broad regulatory freeze, instructing agencies to delay the adoption of any rules not already in effect, and to consider whether those rules should be targeted for elimination. And it has set up barriers to enact any new regulations  —   such as a requirement that for each new rule, at least two others must be identified for repeal  —   and ordered every federal agency to create a team of employees to look for more rules that can be eliminated. “By any empirical measure, it is a level of activity that has never been seen,” said Curtis W. Copeland, who spent decades studying federal regulatory policy on behalf of Congress while at the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office. “It is unprecedented. ” Mr. Trump, in his  address to Congress last week, called it “a historic effort to massively reduce   regulations,” a line that drew thunderous applause from Republicans. Presidents wield considerable influence over the   process. They set the agenda and appoint the   and, since the Reagan administration, a White House office has reviewed every major regulation to try to ensure that benefits to society exceeded compliance costs. It is not uncommon for new presidents to make quick changes in regulatory policy or try to reverse certain   rules their predecessors enacted. Barack Obama, shortly after being elected president, pressed the E. P. A. to let the State of California set more stringent limits on auto emissions, a proposal that the Bush administration had rejected. But the courts have generally held that new administrations need to justify such reversals. The Reagan administration tried to rescind a rule requiring airbags in passenger vehicles. The courts found the move unjustified. “It is not a relevant or adequate defense to say that the president told us to do it,” said Michael Eric Herz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. The Trump administration could face a host of similar challenges  —   the requirement that agencies must find two regulations to eliminate before enacting any new rules is already being challenged in federal court. In addition, Democratic attorneys general from New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont have threatened in recent days to sue the Trump administration to try to block some of the regulatory rollbacks. It is a radical role reversal for state attorneys general  —   their Republican colleagues spent the last eight years suing the federal government to block the enactment of many   rules. Now the Democrats are planning to try to prevent many of these same rules from being revoked. “Demolish the administrative state? I don’t even know what that means,” Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts said during a visit to Washington last week, where she and other state attorneys general met with Mr. Trump at the White House. The pushback has hardly deterred industry executives. The Business Roundtable, which represents some of the nation’s largest corporations and is led by Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, in   gave Mr. Trump a wish list of 16 rules it wanted killed, including the mandatory disclosure of how much chief executives are paid compared with other employees, and a rule intended to curb the trade in minerals that might benefit militant groups in parts of Africa. Efforts to repeal at least 10 of those measures are underway. “The majority of these regulations directly and negatively impact economic growth,” the executives said in their letter, adding that they were convinced that rules could be repealed “without undermining critical protections for consumer health, safety and the environment. ” The reversals by federal regulators are happening, at times, at an extraordinary speed. Lawyers representing the National Mining Association, the American Petroleum Institute and other fossil fuel trade groups and companies asked the Interior Department on Feb. 17 to suspend a new rule changing the way these companies pay royalties for oil, gas or coal extracted from federal lands. While the lawyers called the requirement “impractical and in some cases impossible,” environmentalists and conservative nonprofit groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense praised the effort, saying that for decades energy companies had been underpaying the federal government. The new standard was expected to push up federal revenue by as much as $85 million annually. The Interior Department wrote the industry lawyers back five days later, telling them that the agency, after three years of backing the rule, would suspend enforcement of the new standards. “We agree you have raised serious questions,” the agency’s letter said. This shift in federal regulatory policy is already having implications for tens of thousands of citizens nationwide. Nearly two years ago, the Social Security Administration first moved to set up a new system that would automatically turn over to the Justice Department information it collects on Americans who are receiving federal benefits based on a disabling mental illness for inclusion in a database used for gun background checks. This would effectively prevent these individuals  —   an estimated 75, 000 a year  —   from buying guns unless they sought a Justice Department waiver after being rejected, given the longstanding federal limitation on the sale of firearms to individuals with known mental illnesses. Groups like the National Rifle Association, the A. C. L. U. and the National Alliance on Mental Illness objected to the provision, which had been scheduled to go into effect in January. They argued that it unfairly presumed a tendency toward violence by a wide range of people with mental disabilities, including conditions like bulimia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Mr. Trump signed legislation on Tuesday revoking that rule under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress a limited window to overturn the decisions of regulatory agencies. A total of 46 such Congressional Review Act resolutions are now pending in Congress, on topics including air pollution, unemployment compensation, endangered species listings, debit card fees and oil and gas drilling on federal lands as well as the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf. The act, first adopted in 1996, had been used only once before to nullify a regulation, at the start of the Bush administration in 2001, when a   rule was revoked. Rules not subject to congressional review may still be at risk. The most radical shift has perhaps come at the Federal Communications Commission, which voted on Wednesday to halt new government rules related to data security from taking effect this week, after objections were raised by companies including Comcast, Verizon and ATT. Ajit Pai, a Republican whom Mr. Trump recently named as the F. C. C. chairman, has also made clear that he intends to push to roll back or abandon several other major rules, including the landmark net neutrality regulation intended to ensure equal access to content on the internet, as well as efforts to keep prison phone rates down and a proposal to break open the cable box market. The efforts have been praised by telecommunications giants, like Comcast, but condemned by consumer advocates. The administration started its campaign against regulation on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, with a memo from Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, instructing agencies to halt work on new regulations and to delay putting completed regulations into effect. So far, the effective dates of at least 75 rules have been delayed as a result of this order, based on an analysis of the Federal Register. That includes a measure intended to prevent potentially toxic formaldehyde exposure in homes caused by certain furniture products  —   an effort that has been underway since victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were moved into contaminated   trailers. Such delays are not uncommon with new presidents  —   both George W. Bush and Mr. Obama did the same, to differing degrees. And certain measures are still going into effect as the Trump administration gets underway, including one that prohibits smoking in public housing nationwide as of Feb. 3. Still, the general Trump administration freeze has drawn broad opposition, some of it surprising. The Department of Agriculture has delayed a rule that would make it easier for chicken farmers to sue chicken processors. Business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, want to kill the rule. But   chicken farmers are fighting back. Mike Weaver, a West Virginia farmer who said he had voted for Mr. Trump and was pleased with most of what he had seen so far, said he wished Mr. Trump would meet with farmers. “I’d love to have a visit with the president about this, to tell him that these are federal regulations, yes, but these are good regulations,” said Mr. Weaver, the president of a   group called the Organization for Competitive Markets. “These are regulations that we want implemented. ”",0
1503,The U.S. National Bird Is Now a Drone,"(128 fans) - Advertisement - 
Officially, of course, the national bird of the United States is that half-a-peace-sign that Philadelphia sports fans like to hold up at opposing teams. But unofficially, the film National Bird has it right: the national bird is a killer drone. 
Finally, finally, finally, somebody allowed me to see this movie. And finally somebody made this movie. There have been several drone movies worth seeing , most of them fictional drama , and one very much worth avoiding ( Eye in the Sky ). But National Bird is raw truth, not entirely unlike what you might fantasize media news reports would be in a magical world in which media outlets gave a damn about human life. 
The first half of National Bird is the stories of three participants in the U.S. military's drone murder program, as told by them. And then, just as you're starting to think you'll have to write that old familiar review that praises how well the stories of the victims among the aggressors were told but asks in exasperation whether any of the victims of the actual missiles have any stories, National Bird expands to include just what is so often missing, and even to combine the two narratives in a powerful way. 
Heather Linebaugh wanted to protect people, benefit the world, travel, see the world, and use super cool technology. Apparently our society did not explain to her in time what it means to join the military. Now she suffers guilt, anxiety, moral injury, PTSD, sleep disorder, despair, and a sense of responsibility to speak out on behalf of friends, other veterans, who have killed themselves or become too alcoholic to speak for themselves. Linebaugh helped murder people with missiles from drones, and watched them die, and identified body parts or watched loved ones gather up body parts. 
Even while still in the Air Force, Linebaugh was on a suicide watch list and had a psychologist recommend moving her to a different sort of job, but the Air Force refused. She has episodes. She sees things. She hears things. But she's forbidden to discuss her work with friends or even with a therapist who doesn't have the proper ""security clearance."" 
We let Daniel down even more than Heather. He says he actually opposed militarism but was homeless and desperate, so he joined the military. We could have given him a house for much less than we paid him to help murder people at Fort Meade. 
Lisa Ling worked on a database filled by drone surveillance that compiled information on 121,000 ""targets"" in two years. Multiply that by a dozen years. With 90% of victims not among the targets, add up how many people would die in the targeting of the whole list. That'd be over 7 million. But it's not numbers that have poisoned the souls of these three veterans; it's children and mothers and brothers and uncles lying in pieces on the ground. 
Ling travels to Afghanistan to see the place at ground level and to meet with drone victims. She meets a little boy who lost his leg and his 4-year-old brother and his sister and his father. On February 2, 2010, drone ""pilots"" at Creech Air Base murdered 23 innocent members of one family. - Advertisement - 
The filmmakers have voices read the written transcript of what the drone operators said to each other before, during, and after sending in the missiles that did the damage. This is worse than Collateral Murder . The people whose job it is to identify children and others who should not be murdered have identified children among the group of people being targeted. The ""pilots"" at Creech are eager to reject this information and to get onto killing as many people as they can. Their lust for blood drives the decision process. Only after they've killed 23 people do they recognize children among the survivors, and the lack of guns. 
We see the bodies brought home to bury. Those injured describe their suffering, physical as well as mental. We see people being fitted with artificial legs. We hear Afghans describe their perception of drones. They imagine, just as many Americans may imagine, and just as viewers of Eye in the Sky would imagine, that drone operators have a clear, high resolution view of everything. In fact, they have a view of fuzzy little blobs on a computer screen that looks like it was created in the 1980s. 
Linebaugh says there is no way to distinguish the little ""civilian"" blobs from little ""militant"" blobs. When Daniel hears President Obama claim that there is always near certainty that no civilians will be killed, Daniel explains that such knowledge is simply not possible. Linebaugh says she was often on the side of the conversation telling the ""pilots"" at Creech not to murder innocents, but that they always pushed for permission to kill. 
Jesselyn Radack, attorney for whistleblowers, says in the film that the FBI told two whistleblowers that a terrorist group had put them on a kill list. She said that the FBI has also contacted Linebaugh's family and warned her that ""terrorists"" have been searching for her name online, suggesting that she fix this problem by shutting up. (She had written an op-ed in the Guardian ). 
The FBI also raids Daniel's house, arriving with 30 to 50 agents, badges, guns, cameras, and search warrants. They take away his papers, electronics, and phone. They tell him he is under investigation for a possible indictment under the Espionage Act. This is the World War I-era law for targeting foreign enemies that President Obama has made a routine of using to target domestic whistleblowers. While Obama has prosecuted more people under this law than did all previous presidents combined, we probably have no way of knowing how many people have been explicitly threatened with the possibility. - Advertisement - 
While we should be apologizing to, comforting, and aiding these young people rather than denying them the right to speak to anybody and threatening them with decades in prison, Lisa Ling did manage to find some kindness. Victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan told her that they forgave her. As the film ends, she's planning another trip to Afghanistan.

1504,Alabama Prison Officials Retaliate Against Prison Strike Leader By Cutting Water To Cell,"Advocates say prison officials at the Kilby Correctional Facility in Alabama turned off the water to Kinetik Justice Amun’s solitary cell after he initiated a hunger strike. Officials then transferred him to the Limestone Correctional Facility, which has a “behavioral modification program” known among prisoners as a “hot bay” dorm in which prisoners are forced to live in pairs in hot and squalid solitary confinement cells.
Kinetik, also known as Robert Earl Counsil, is the second leader of the Free Alabama Movement (FAM) to be transferred to Limestone. FAM is a group of incarcerated people and their families struggling to end prison slavery and shed light on inhumane conditions in Alabama’s prison system.
James Plesant, also known as Dhati Khalid, was the first leader to be transferred. Melvin Ray, also known as Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun, is the last remaining leader of FAM not to be transferred to Limestone.
According to a statement released by the Ordinary People Society, an Alabama-based human rights group for the incarcerated, Kinetik refused meals upon arrival at the Kilby Correctional Facility on October 21. Before the transfer, Kinetik spent three years housed in solitary confinement at the Holman Correctional Facility.
As previously reported by Shadowproof, Kilby is said to be a “ bully camp .” When one Alabama prisoner learned of Kinetik’s transfer to Kilby, he explained the prison is where they send those that “they have to iron out with brutality.” He added, “When they send you to Kilby, that’s where they break your arms and break your legs.”
Prison officials turned off the water to Kinetik’s cell in response to his hunger strike, advocates say. “They are trying to kill him,” argued Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, founder of the Ordinary People Society and an “outside” spokesperson for FAM. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The Alabama Department of Corrections is currently facing a federal investigation into the rampant violence, overcrowding, and structural decay in its prison system. Kinetik believes his transfer was an act of retaliation by prison officials for his political activity, and that they timed the transfer to prevent him from meeting with this lawyer.
Kinetik is an outspoken advocate for the human rights of the incarcerated. Along with Dhati Khalid and Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun, Kinetik and the Free Alabama Movement were some of the people behind the call-to-action for the national prison strike against prison slave labor, which began on September 9.
Prominent human rights lawyer and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, Bryan Stevenson, announced he will work with Pastor Glasgow and look into Kinetik’s case.
Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun told Shadowproof the “behavioral modification” dorm or Hot Bay like the one at Limestone is “supposed to be a volunteer program where you volunteer to go into it, but there’s no volunteer aspect. They’re just putting people in it.”
“You don’t have to have anything specific that you’ve done. They’re not serving you any paperwork, there’s not any kind of due process, and they’re getting funding from it,” he said. “So to justify funding, they have to have bodies.”
“Really what they’re doing is they’re targeting individuals,” Bennu said. He noted there is a Hot Bay program at Donaldson, where he is incarcerated. “That’s where James Plesant was originally. T hey framed him. They’re constantly framing and jumping on people in that Hot Bay.”
In the Hot Bay, prisoners are denied visitation, religious services, recreation, and social services, according to the Free Alabama Movement.
“[The Hot Bay] is worse than solitary confinement because they take all of your property and you have a cell mate,” Bennu said. “So the one here at Donaldson is two men to a cell. You’re in the cell with another person for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Y’all defecating with each other. Y’all urinating with each other, passing gas, burping, sleeping, waking up. Constantly, you’re in the cell with the door locked 24/7 with someone else.”
“They’re sending you up there, they’re torturing people up there. People first got exposed to the Hot Bay program from Bibb County,” Bennu recalled.
“There was a bunch of young guys in there. They tore the Hot Bay up,” he said, referring to a July 2015 riot. “They made it where you couldn’t stay in it. They had to get everyone out of there. That’s how bad they are. That’s how bad it was.”
“A lot of people think that when they say they put us in solitary confinement that it’s solitary confinement. In and of itself, that constitutes the torture. It’s not just putting me in the cell. It’s the conditions that they put me in inside of these cells,” Bennu argued.
He continued, “They put us in contaminated cells. What they do is, they have people in solitary and they be complaining about the plumbing or complaining about the lights or the ventilation or something. And they will put us in those cells.”
“They already know there are issues—there’s plumbing issues, there’s maintenance issues, and they’ll put us in these, what they call ‘black out cells’ or contaminated cells. The lights won’t work, we’ll be in the cells in the dark trying to read, ruining our eyesight. The mattress will be torn up, sleeping on top of these concrete slabs. The water will be leaking, running all over the cell. The vents and stuff are filthy. “
“It’s all of these elements that are added on, but that doesn’t show up in the paperwork, and that’s what they’ve done to people like myself. They put me in an isolated cell. I’m on what they call, ‘Walk Along Status.’ That means I cannot interact with anyone. I can’t be around another person. Same thing with Kinetik and James Plesant,” Bennu concluded.
A prisoner previously explained to Shadowproof that Limestone is “where they send everybody and you have to spend one year in isolation.” That prisoner hoped Kilby was not a “layover” on Kinetik’s way to Limestone.
“If he doesn’t reach Limestone, he’ll be okay,” the prisoner said at the time. According to the website for the Alabama Department of Corrections, Kinetik is now incarcerated at Limestone.

1505,Comment on I Just Lost All Faith In Our Deeply Corrupt Legal System And In The Rule Of Law In The United States by redlucy,"  I Just Lost All Faith In Our Deeply Corrupt Legal System And In The Rule Of Law In The United States   6th, 2016 
The FBI just gave Hillary Clinton the biggest gift in the history of presidential politics. Two days before the election the FBI has announced that they are ending their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information. After reviewing the emails that were found on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress telling them that “we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.” That means that there will be no indictment, and the path is now clear for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday unless an election miracle happens. 
These days it is unusual for a news story to hit me on a deeply emotional level, but this one sure did. When the FBI originally announced that they were renewing this investigation, it gave me a glimmer of hope that there may be a little bit of integrity left in our legal system. 
But after today’s announcement I have lost all faith in our deeply corrupt system of justice. America has become a lawless nation, and the rule of law is completely dead in this country. 
Yes, it is true that those of us in the general public do not know what was contained in those emails, and Director Comey says that nothing significant was found in them … 
In a letter to lawmakers, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State. 
“The FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,” Comey said in the letter. “During that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,” Comey wrote. “Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.” 
But of course the truth is that the FBI already had more than enough to go after Clinton based on what they discovered the first time around. 
In the world of national security, if you transmit a single classified document via a channel that is unsecured, you will lose your security clearance in a heartbeat and it is quite likely that you will be prosecuted and sent to prison for mishandling classified information. 
In fact, two different members of the U.S. military were recently convicted for doing precisely that … 
Just last month, Bryan Nishimura, a California Naval reservist, was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $7,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to removing classified material and downloading it to a personal electronic device. The FBI found no evidence he planned to distribute the material . 
Last year, Bronze Star recipient and combat veteran Chief Petty Officer Lyle White pleaded guilty to storing classified documents on a nonsecure hard drive in Virginia. He received a suspended 60-day sentence and a suspended $10,000 fine in return for the plea. White said the information was for training purposes to study and that he had no intent to communicate with anyone . 
Neither of those individuals intended to mishandle classified information, and they certainly never intended to share it. 
But they were both convicted anyway. 
So what makes Hillary Clinton any different? 
During the initial investigation, the FBI found 113 emails that contained classified information … 
Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim was incorrect . 
Of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed. 
And I would be willing to bet that the FBI found some more classified emails that they had not seen previously among the 650,000 or so that they reviewed for this renewed investigation. 
But it doesn’t matter now. Hillary Clinton is free as a bird even though she mishandled 113 classified emails, and it looks like she is going to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday. 
As a law student and then later as an attorney working in Washington D.C., I got to see just how deeply corrupt our legal system has become. 
But after today, I don’t see how any American can ever have faith in the rule of law again. 
If the law does not apply equally to all persons at all times and in all circumstances, we might as well not even have a legal system. 
At this point, there is only one way that some sort of justice can be achieved in this case. And that is if the American people go to the polls on Tuesday and vote to keep her out of the White House. 
It won’t be perfect justice of course, but at least it would keep Hillary Clinton from getting what she wants more than anything else in life. 
The choice before the American people is very simple. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency, and the extremely long laundry list of Clinton scandals and crimes has been well documented over the past three decades. 
The voters know exactly what they are getting with her. And if they choose her anyway despite all of the things that have been revealed, that means that America is willingly choosing lawlessness. 
To most conservatives, this election is all about Trump, but I believe that it is far more about Hillary Clinton. 
I am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in American history, and if the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation. 
So let us pray for an election miracle, because right now Donald Trump is behind in most national polls and time is running out.

1506,"Sale of Federal Mortgages to Investors Puts Greater Burden on Blacks, Suit Says - The New York Times","For years, the federal government avoided insuring mortgages in black neighborhoods, a practice known as redlining that exacerbated racial divides throughout America’s cities. Redlining has long been outlawed, but in New York City, the federal government is again disproportionately hurting black homeowners, according to a federal lawsuit filed by a nonprofit that represents   New Yorkers. This time, the suit says, the government is fueling racial disparities not through its lending policies but in how it handles foreclosures. Since the financial crisis pushed thousands of homeowners in New York and across the country into foreclosure, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has been selling insured delinquent mortgages to private investors, typically hedge funds and private equity funds, which then collect monthly payments. The investors, according to the lawsuit filed against the housing agency and a large private equity firm, Lone Star Funds, provide fewer protections to homeowners who fall behind on their mortgage payments than the federal government does, leading to higher rates of foreclosure. Most of the mortgages being sold to these investors are in predominantly black neighborhoods like in southeast Queens and the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. From 2012 to 2014, more than 61 percent of the   mortgages sold to investors were in predominantly black neighborhoods, according to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, only about   of federally insured mortgages over all were issued in those same neighborhoods. Lawyers for the homeowners who filed the lawsuit say the concentration of the sales is putting black homeowners at greater risk of foreclosure and threatening to undermine decades of progress toward increasing homeownership in these neighborhoods. A spokesman for the housing agency declined to comment on the lawsuit. Caliber Home Loans, the mortgage firm under Lone Star, said the lawsuit was “without merit. ” “Caliber is committed to treating all borrowers fairly, to helping families stay in their homes where it is feasible, and has complied with all F. H. A.  servicing requirements,” the firm’s head of servicing, Marion McDougall, said in a statement, referring to the Federal Housing Administration. The lawsuit, filed on Friday by MFY Legal Services and the law firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff  Abady in United States District Court in Brooklyn, is the latest tussle over how the government turned to Wall Street to help sort through the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis. The mortgage sales are part of an effort by HUD to reduce the burden on its insurance fund that backstops home loans to   borrowers who have gone into default. “This lawsuit exposes that the historic racism that has kept our communities segregated, that has blocked   from sustainable homeownership, and that increases the racial wealth gap in this country is still alive and well,” said Elizabeth Lynch, a supervising attorney at MFY Legal Services. The sales to private investors had already been under criticism in Washington, leading the housing agency to put in new protections for homeowners whose federally backed mortgages change ownership. One new rule announced in June would require the private investors to consider reducing the total amount owed on a homeowner’s mortgage, known as a principal reduction. But these new rules will not apply to the more than 100, 000 mortgages already sold by HUD in a series of auctions. The battle over the mortgage sales has exposed a conundrum that the housing agency faces over its Federal Housing Administration mortgage program, which started in the 1930s. By selling the mortgages to the highest bidder  —   in this case private equity firms  —   the agency can bolster its insurance fund that had been eroded by the flood of foreclosures in the immediate aftermath of the housing crisis. The more flush the insurance fund, the more mortgages to   borrowers the department can backstop. But housing advocates say that the agency is contradicting its mission by selling mortgages to investors that they say are pushing homeowners closer to foreclosure with loan modifications that offer little relief. In some cases, the modifications can leave borrowers in even more financial distress. For example, according to the lawsuit, the terms of one typical offer of relief from Lone Star’s servicing arm require a large balloon payment five years after the modification that can, lawyers say, significantly increase a homeowner’s mortgage costs. Another feature of that same offer allows borrowers to pay only interest on their loans, leaving them with a large unpaid balance. Ultimately, advocates worry that investment firms will be able to take possession of more houses across New York City, one of the nation’s hottest real estate markets, where virtually every neighborhood is rapidly changing through gentrification. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, has made affordable housing a centerpiece of his administration, unveiling plans to build or preserve about 200, 000 units over 10 years. It is part of his broader efforts to address the widening gap between the rich and the poor, which Mr. de Blasio says has been fueled in part by gentrification. In June, the city’s Housing Preservation and Development agency announced that it had bought a pool of mortgage notes from the federal housing department, in what housing advocates hoped could be an alternative to the sales to private investors. “We are fighting to help homeowners stay in the neighborhoods they helped build,” Mr. de Blasio said at the time. In the end, the city bought only 24 mortgage notes. By comparison, roughly 1, 100 federally insured mortgages were sold to private investors between 2012 and 2014, according to the lawsuit. Joseph Washington, a    butcher at a grocery store, took out a $326, 987 federally insured mortgage in 2011 to buy a   house in the St. Albans section of Queens. Mr. Washington fell behind on mortgage payments in 2013 when his fiancée moved out. He said he had been working with a servicing company to get a modification but was caught by surprise when his mortgage was sold to a private investor. His new servicer, he said, offered him a modification with a balloon payment that he believed was intended to make him eventually lose his home. From there, the offers only got worse, said Mr. Washington, who is black. In July 2015, the servicer offered him an option that would allow him to pay only the interest on his loan but then require him to eventually make a balloon payment of $30, 342 on Nov. 1, 2041, when he will be 78, the lawsuit says. “They are trying to force you out of the house,” Mr. Washington said.",0
1507,PressTV-Hezbollah shares Aoun’s victory: Lebanon FM,"Lebanon Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil gestures to his supporters during a rally to show support for FPM founder Michel Aoun, near the presidential palace in Baabda, near Beirut, Lebanon, October 16, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
Lebanon’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Gebran Bassil says the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah shares the victory of Michel Aoun in securing the country’s presidency. 
Aoun, a strong Hezbollah ally, was chosen by Lebanese lawmakers as the country’s president on Monday. 
Addressing a large number of people who had converged at a square in Beirut to celebrate Aoun’s election, Bassil, who is also the head of the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) and Aoun’s son-in-law, said his movement never doubted Hezbollah’s “loyalty” and “honesty.” Aoun is the founder of the FPM. 
He said Aoun’s victory was based on his own perseverance as well as the positions adopted by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who is Hezbollah’s secretary general. 
In a phone call on the same day, Nasrallah congratulated Aoun on his election as the head of the Lebanese state. This image, taken in the southern suburbs of Beirut on October 31, 2016, shows people celebrating the election of Michel Aoun as the new president of Lebanon. 
Nasrallah endorsed Aoun last week, advising Lebanese political factions to set aside their differences in order to fill the presidential void in the Arab country. 
Lebanon had been without a president for over two years amid political bickering in the parliament. 
After the election, Aoun vowed in a speech to the parliament that he would spare no effort in trying to bring about the liberation of Lebanese territories occupied by Israel. 
He said his top priority would be to strengthen the army in order for it to become capable of defending the country against all threats to its independence and sovereignty. 
Hezbollah has been defending Lebanon against Israeli aggression since the movement’s inception, including during a full-fledged Israeli war in 2006.

1509,10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency,"20 Shares
17 2 0 1
In last issue of Black Agenda Report, I argued that readers should vote for the Green Party this November. This week, I will outline what to expect from a Hillary Clinton Presidency. The great migration of Republicans into the Democratic Party tent of Hillary Clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic US Presidential elections. Corporate media outlets have collaborated with Clinton to instill deep popular fear of a Trump administration. Fear of Trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the US who are fed up with both corporate parties. This has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once Hillary Clinton actually takes office.
The corporate media has exploited the general population's distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process. Trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement, all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist. It is critical that the left in the US extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day. However, Trump's vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. His characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a Clinton Presidency.
One could endlessly debate Clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim. Trump's vulgar and putrid presentation has provided Clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice. Yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the 2016 elections. It is reasonable to assume that a Hillary Clinton Presidency will be far less effective than Obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony. This is why her support system, the entire ruling class, has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a Russia-Trump collaborative threat in every sphere of US political life.
Here are ten things to expect from a Clinton Presidency. I will leave it to readers to judge as to whether Clinton represents a ""lesser evil"" than Trump or just plain evil.
1.) The Privatization of Social Security - Hillary Clinton has stated publicly and privately to her Wall Street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program. Wikileaks exposed Clinton's support for the Obama's Administration's ""deficit reduction"" commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare in 2012. Clinton donors on Wall Street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of Social Security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit.
MORE... Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Voting for the “Lesser Evil” John Pilger: Clinton policies will bring great aggression to the US and the world 2.) World War III - Hillary Clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a no-fly zone in Syria. That means US airstrikes would rain down on Syrian and Russian assets in Syria. Such a move would place the US military in direct confrontation with the Russia. Clinton has been caught stating that the Syrian and Russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits.
3.) The Transpacific Partnership - Often called ""NAFTA on steroids,"" the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of Asia Pacific region has been a major talking point in the 2016 elections. Clinton has supported the agreement in the past, only to switch her position due to pressure from the Bernie Sanders campaign. With Sanders firmly in the Clinton camp, there is currently nothing in the way to stop Clinton from moving forward with the TPP's passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality.
4.) Maintenance and Expansion of the Surveillance State - Not much needs to be said here. The Obama Administration's vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of Ed Snowden and Julian Assange. Wikileaks additionally revealed Clinton's desire to drone Julian Assange for releasing Washington’s secrets to the public. A Clinton Presidency has every intention of following up on the Obama Administration's passage of bills such as the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. This bill gave the US government the right to militarily detain ""terror"" suspects indefinitely.
5.) Trump's Wall - Hillary Clinton was Obama's Secretary of State from 2009-2013. Over this time, she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in US history. Furthermore, she oversaw the detention of thousands of Central American children during the great migration from the 2009 fascist coup in Honduras, a coup that was drawn up by Clinton herself. The US-Mexico border is more militarized than it has ever been. Trump's wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip, but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current US immigration policy.
6.) Servitude to the Bankers - Hillary Clinton has received over forty million in support from Hedge funds in the 2016 elections. Before selling out, Bernie Sanders made it a point to request public access into Clinton's private, quarter million dollar speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs. The deregulation of the banks with the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act was a Clinton project. Both her current list of donors and past connection to her husband’s policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class.
7.) Maintenance of the Mass Black Incarceration State - Hillary Clinton is the enemy of Black America. From her callous use of the term ""super predator"" to describe working class Black men to being the architect of the 1994 crime bill, the Clinton dynasty virtually built the mass Black incarceration state. Under Bill and Hillary Clinton's two terms, the prison population rose by 673,000. This was facilitated by draconian ""three strikes"" laws, mandatory drug sentence, and the deep militarization of local police departments. With her record, it isn't too difficult to assume what another four years of Clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons.
8.) Austerity and More Austerity - It was the first Clinton Administration that eliminated ""welfare as we know it."" The evisceration of Aid to Families and Dependent Children (AFDC) and its replacement, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), threw millions of women and children into poverty. Obama has followed up with draconian cuts to SNAP (foodstamps). There is nothing on Clinton's track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the US.
9.) A Boost to the Privatization of Education - Hillary Clinton received boos in July when she urged teachers' unions and charter operators to ""work together"" for the greater good of students. Ever since, Clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of Sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her. Her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education, but that hardly matters. Clinton receives broad support from school privatizers (like Wal-Mart) and should not be expected to roll back the ""shock and awe"" war on public education waged by the Obama Administration.
10.) An Economic Crisis - Bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of 2016. Capitalists everywhere were given free rein to ""recover"" with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in 2008. The internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates. Whether Clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well Obama has remains to be seen.
Clinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season. Her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than Donald Trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class. The question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the two-party corporate duopoly. Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka are attempting to build the base of the Green party ticket. Whatever method is chosen, it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a Clinton Administration.",0
1510,"Donald Trump Beat Expectations Everywhere, Suggesting a Broad Shift - The New York Times","After just about every primary night this year, I’ve written something like “Donald J. Trump stayed on a narrow but clear path to the Republican nomination. ” After Tuesday night, Mr. Trump has never had a wider path to a majority of pledged delegates. He swept the Northeastern corridor by a huge margin, smashing any and all expectations based on primaries to date. He won a majority of the vote nearly everywhere, and even carried many of the places where he was expected to be weak  —   like Montgomery County, Md. or Greenwich, Conn. or Lancaster, Pa. His huge victory makes a majority of delegates seem well within reach. That’s in part because he amassed more delegates than expected, but also because his strength made wins in Indiana and California seem more likely than before. He was expected to fare well, but he beat the   polls everywhere. He was at 48 percent in the final Pennsylvania polls he won 57 percent. He was at 49 percent in the Maryland polls (43 percent excluding the generally dubious polls from A. R. G.) he won 54 percent. Similarly, The Upshot’s   models systematically underestimated Mr. Trump’s performance. His best state, as expected, was Rhode Island. But he won 64 percent of the vote, not the 57 percent that the model anticipated. Mr. Trump was favored to win big, at 50 and 51 percent, in Delaware and Connecticut he won 61 and 58 percent. Maryland and Pennsylvania seemed more challenging for Mr. Trump. The model had him at 41 and 45 percent. He easily outperformed those tallies, winning 54 and 57 percent of the vote. Mr. Trump’s overperformance was broad  —   spanning nearly every kind of county across all of the states in play. That raises the possibility of a significant shift in Mr. Trump’s favor over the last month. There’s no way to be sure, but national polls show something similar, with Mr. Trump creeping up into the  . The state polls in Indiana and California have also looked very good in recent weeks. Perhaps he will return to more familiar levels of support once he leaves the Northeast. But even then, he’ll still have a very credible shot to win a majority of delegates  —   and an easier shot because of the delegates he earned in the Northeast. If there’s any good news for Mr. Trump’s opponents, it’s that his landslide didn’t yield too many more pledged delegates than expected  —   most of the states awarded their delegates to the winner, and Mr. Trump was expected to win. But every delegate counts for Mr. Trump at this stage, and where he could squeeze out additional ones, he did. He won all of the delegates at stake in Maryland and Connecticut by clearing 50 percent of the vote and winning all of the congressional districts. He even earned an unexpected additional delegate in Rhode Island’s Second Congressional District, where Mr. Cruz failed to get the 10 percent needed for a delegate. Altogether, Mr. Trump will probably win 110 of the 118 pledged delegates at stake  —   a hair better than what seemed like his   scenario. Mr. Trump outperformed by even more in the Pennsylvania “loophole” primary  —   the sort of contest that has tripped him up. Voters directly elected 54 unbound delegates to the Republican convention, but the ballot included no guidance on whom the delegates might support. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump’s preferred slate appears to lead in 31 of the 54 delegate slots, and another 11 had told the news media that they would vote for the winner of their district. Mr. Trump may not ultimately win all of these delegates  —   they’re not bound to their statements  —   but they could provide him with a crucial cushion if he falls a bit short in the pledged delegate count. If you include Mr. Trump’s preferred delegates from the unpledged delegate slate in Pennsylvania, he is around 250 delegates short of the 1, 237 necessary to win the nomination. He can cover about half of that amount with expected wins in West Virginia and New Jersey and with delegates from proportional states. That leaves two key states: Indiana and California. Mr. Trump would easily win if he carried both states. He might not even need Indiana if he maintains the loyalty of the unbound delegates who said they would vote for the winner of their district in Pennsylvania, or simply if he wins big in California. And after Tuesday night, a big win in California looks quite possible.",0
1511,Defense Secretary: US Talking to Turkey About Future Role in Raqqa,"Insists ISIS Capital Will Be Attacked With 'Forces Available' by Jason Ditz, November 02, 2016 Share This 
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter today confirmed that negotiations with Turkey are ongoing related to the upcoming invasion of the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital city of ISIS. Carter suggested Turkey’s involvement would only happen “ further down the road .” 
The US announced that it intends to launch an invasion of Raqqa very soon, will conduct the operation concurrent with the ongoing invasion of Mosul in Iraq, and that Kurdish YPG forces will be providing the vast majority of the forces for this offensive. 
That’s irked Turkey, particularly the last part, as Turkish officials repeatedly warned the US against allowing Kurds anywhere near Raqqa and have suggested their own involvement was contingent on there being no Kurds involved. 
Carter’s comments suggest the US plan to invade without Turkey is unchanged, and that they intend to try to placate Turkey about the involvement of the YPG by giving them some involvement in the post-ISIS situation in Raqqa. Turkey is particularly keen to ensure that their own allies end up in control of Raqqa, and that’s likely the main incentive of this deal. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
1512,Beyond Voting: the Limits of Electoral Politics,"(4) Representative democracy 
(5) Overt minority dictatorship 
The present society oscillates between (4) and (5), i.e. between overt minority rule and covert minority rule camouflaged by a façade of token democracy. A liberated society would eliminate (4) and (5) and would progressively reduce the need for (2) and (3). . . . 
In representative democracy people abdicate their power to elected officials. The candidates’ stated policies are limited to a few vague generalities, and once they are elected there is little control over their actual decisions on hundreds of issues — apart from the feeble threat of changing one’s vote, a few years later, to some equally uncontrollable rival politician. 
Representatives are dependent on the wealthy for bribes and campaign contributions; they are subordinate to the owners of the mass media, who decide which issues get the publicity; and they are almost as ignorant and powerless as the general public regarding many important matters that are determined by unelected bureaucrats and independent secret agencies. 
Overt dictators may sometimes be overthrown, but the real rulers in “democratic” regimes, the tiny minority who own or control virtually everything, are never voted in and never voted out. Most people don’t even know who they are. . . . 
In itself, voting is of no great significance one way or the other (those who make a big deal about refusing to vote are only revealing their own fetishism). The problem is that it tends to lull people into relying on others to act for them, distracting them from more significant possibilities. A few people who take some creative initiative (think of the first civil rights sit-ins) may ultimately have a far greater effect than if they had put their energy into campaigning for lesser-evil politicians. At best, legislators rarely do more than what they have been forced to do by popular movements. 
A conservative regime under pressure from independent radical movements often concedes more than a liberal regime that knows it can count on radical support. (The Vietnam war, for example, was not ended by electing antiwar politicians, but because there was so much pressure from so many different directions that the prowar president Nixon was forced to withdraw.) If people invariably rally to lesser evils, all the rulers have to do in any situation that threatens their power is to conjure up a threat of some greater evil. 
Even in the rare case when a “radical” politician has a realistic chance of winning an election, all the tedious campaign efforts of thousands of people may go down the drain in one day because of some trivial scandal discovered in his (or her) personal life, or because he inadvertently says something intelligent. If he manages to avoid these pitfalls and it looks like he might win, he tends to evade controversial issues for fear of antagonizing swing voters. If he actually gets elected he is almost never in a position to implement the reforms he has promised, except perhaps after years of wheeling and dealing with his new colleagues; which gives him a good excuse to see his first priority as making whatever compromises are necessary to keep himself in office indefinitely. 
Hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, he develops new interests and new tastes, which he justifies by telling himself that he deserves a few perks after all his years of working for good causes. Worst of all, if he does eventually manage to get a few “progressive” measures passed, this exceptional and usually trivial success is held up as evidence of the value of relying on electoral politics, luring many more people into wasting their energy on similar campaigns to come.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The country's central bank gave orders to print 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 bolivar bills as well as a 1,000 bolivar coin, the unnamed source familiar with the situation said, as quoted by the Delinmediato.com.ve news outlet. © AFP 2016/ Ronaldo SCHEMIDT 
At the moment, the largest denomination available is 100 bolivars, which, at the exchange rate of about 1,000 bolivars for 1 dollar, makes cash transactions cumbersome. 
The new bills and a coin will reportedly enter circulation by the end of this year. 
On Tuesday, the opposition-led National Assembly voted to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Nicolas Maduro, claiming he had violated democracy and blaming his economic policies for the recession, high rate of inflation, shortages of food and other essential supplies in the country. In his turn, the president accused the legislature of staging a parliamentary coup. ...",0
1514,Angelina Jolie Slams Refugee Order: Trump ’Playing with Fire’,"Actress and human rights activist Angelina Jolie says President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program is like “playing with fire” and will “worsen” America’s war against terrorists. [“Shutting our door to refugees or discriminating among them is not our way, and does not make us safer,” Jolie wrote in an   published Thursday in the New York Times. “Acting out of fear is not our way. Targeting the weakest does not show strength. ”  Jolie, who serves as special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, says “the lesson of the years we have spent fighting terrorism since Sept. 11 is that every time we depart from our values we worsen the very problem we are trying to contain. ” President Trump’s order suspended the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days and bars refugees from failed terror   coming into the United States during that period. A review of the refugee vetting process is now underway. While never mentioning Trump’s name, Jolie rebukes the president’s refuge order calling it a departure from “our country’s history of giving shelter to the most vulnerable people. Americans have shed blood to defend the idea that human rights transcend culture, geography, ethnicity and religion. ” While acknowledging Trump’s pledge to protect America from its enemies around the world, Jolie says the president’s action “must be measured and should be based on facts, not fear. ” “If we send a message that it is acceptable to close the door to refugees, or to discriminate among them on the basis of religion, we are playing with fire. We are lighting a fuse that will burn across continents, inviting the very instability we seek to protect ourselves against,” the Academy Award winner writes. Last May, Jolie criticized Trump after he proposed his plan to temporarily halt entry for nationals from countries fraught with terror. “To me, America is built on people from around the world coming together for freedoms, especially freedom of religion,” Jolie said. “So it’s hard to hear this is coming from someone who is pressing to be an American president” While the Maleficent star continues to condemn Trump’s policies, her father actor John Voight is a fierce supporter.

1515,Another Pool Turns Green Chemical Imbalance Is Blamed - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The problem of the suddenly green water in the Olympic diving pool worsened Wednesday as whatever was ailing the pool migrated (albeit in a lighter shade of green) to the nearby pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming. But Olympic officials said that after extensive tests, they had finally pinpointed the reason: a chemical imbalance caused by too many people using the water. There had been speculation Tuesday that algae was the cause, but that theory was dismissed by officials. “Midafternoon, there was a sudden decrease in the alkalinity in the diving pool, and that’s the main reason the color changed,” Mario Andrada, a Rio 2016 spokesman, said Wednesday morning. He noted that a lot of people had been in the pools in the past week at the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, and that their presence had touched off changes in the water’s chemical balance. “We probably failed to note that with more athletes, the water could be affected,” Andrada said. He said, too, that the water had not been monitored as carefully as it should have been and that the trouble was apparently exacerbated by Wednesday morning’s rain. “The people in charge of the pool should have done more intensive tests,” he said. “We brought in a team of independent experts to check. ” Andrada said that there was no health risk to the athletes and that “the pool should go back to its classic blue colors during the day. ” The alarmingly swift transformation of the diving pool from aqua to swamp green on Tuesday spurred the usual social media hilarity, with much of the speculation focusing on the possibility of athletes’ using the pool for a bodily function generally frowned upon at pools. Nope, said Nate Hernandez, director of aquatic solutions at VivoAquatics, a pool care company based in California whose clients include hotels and resorts. “To be honest, people pee in the pool all the time  —   this wouldn’t affect it,” he said via email. Pool experts said that with decent pool maintenance, water in a pool should not change color so drastically and quickly. “If the pool’s systems are properly sized with adequate filtration and using appropriate chemical distribution, they should be able to maintain clarity and sanitation even during peak use,” Jamie Novak, a brand manager at NC Brands, a swimming pool and spa chemical manufacturer in Connecticut, said in an email. Hernandez said that failing to anticipate and plan for a large number of swimmers at an event like the Olympics, which by definition attracts a large number of swimmers, seemed a weird sort of mistake. “Take a pool like the Hard Rock in Las Vegas,” he said. “On a Sunday in the summertime, we’ll put 5, 000 people in that water at one time. The most we’ve ever had is about 8, 200, and it has never turned green. ” The Rio Games have had their share of   troubles, particularly at the rowing and sailing venues, where the water is contaminated by a toxic stew of bacteria and pathogens. A visit Wednesday afternoon showed that the diving pool was still a fairly dark shade of green while the pool for water polo and synchronized swimming was somewhat lighter, more of a sea glass green. Officials said the alkalinity levels were already improving.",0

1517,"China Bans Dozens of Islamic Names in Muslim Xinjiang: ’Jihad,’ ’Saddam,’ ’Muhammad’","The government of China has drafted a list of “overly religious” names banned in western Xinjiang province, home to the nation’s Uighur Muslim ethnic minority. The list includes names such as “Muhammad,” “Jihad,” and “Imam. ”[According to Radio Free Asia (RFA) the initiative is meant to diminish the public profile of religion, particularly Islam, in the region. The communist Chinese government has long considered religion a threat to its dominance and has, in recent years, imposed a series of initiatives to limit Islamic practices, in particular, in response to a series of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang and threats from outside jihadist groups like the Islamic State.  RFA lists “Islam, Quran, Mecca, Jihad, Imam, Saddam, Hajj, and Medina” among the names in the document, titled “Naming Rules for Ethnic Minorities. ” The New York Times, which reports that the list includes “more than two dozen names,” adds “Mujahid,” “Arafat,” and “Muhammad” to that list. Anyone with such names will be banned from officially registering with the government, which excludes them from, among other things, public education and denies them the legal documents necessary to find work and generally participate in society. Government officials confirmed the ban to both outlets. The official who spoke to RFA argued that it would not be difficult for Uighurs to keep from running afoul of the new regulations: “Just stick to the party line, and you’ll be fine,” the official told RFA. “You’re not allowed to give names with a strong religious flavor, such as Jihad or names like that. The most important thing here is the connotations of the name.   …     [It mustn’t have] connotations of holy war or of splittism [Xinjiang independence]. ” Voice of America adds that the name restrictions are part of a larger set of regulations handed down in the   region. The Chinese government will now also “prohibit   ‘abnormal’ beards, the wearing of veils in public places and the refusal to watch state television”  . Islamic head scarfs had already been banned in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, and Islamic garb and Muslim beards already banned individuals from using public transportation. The World Uyghur Congress, an advocacy group from the ethnic minority operating outside of China, has condemned the new measures. “In setting limits on the naming of Uyghurs, the Chinese government is in fact engaging in political persecution under another guise,” Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the group, told RFA. “They are afraid that people with such names will become alienated from Chinese policies in the region. ” These restrictions are the latest handed down from Beijing to the nation’s westernmost province. In February, the government implemented mandatory GPS tracking on all cars and trucks registered in Bayingol, Xinjiang. “Cars are the major means of transportation for terrorists and also a frequently chosen tool to conduct terrorist attacks. So it’s necessary to use the Beidou system and electronic vehicle identification to enhance the management of vehicles,” the local government said in a statement. China has also implemented measures to universalize language in the country, promoting Mandarin  —   Beijing’s main language and that of the Han ethnic majority  —   in places where Cantonese, Uighur, and Tibetan are more common tongues. The government refers to Mandarin as the “common tongue” and has moved to eradicate other languages from local schools. In January, Xinjiang announced new border security measures, as well. Xinjiang borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, homes to a variety of Islamic terrorist groups to which Uighur terrorists may flee. The main terrorist group operating in Xinjiang is the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) which aspires to establish an Islamic State in Xinjiang. Communist Party officials in Xinjiang have long been banned from publicly observing the Ramadan fast. The law requires shopkeepers in Xinjiang to sell multiple brands of alcohol and cigarettes, items banned by Islamic practice.",0
1518,"Report: Facebook, Google Secretly Teaming with David Brock’s Media Matters over Fake News - Breitbart","David Brock’s   media “watchdog” Media Matters for America is “engaging with Facebook behind the scenes” to shape the social network’s fight against “fake news,” according to a report by the Washington Free Beacon. [A document posted by the Washington Free Beacon outlines Media Matters’ plans to battle the “fake news” and “propaganda” that they believe led to the election of Donald Trump. Describing their relationship with Facebook, the documents states, “Media Matters will serve as their partner,” and that Media Matters’ goal is to help Facebook “adjust its model to stem the flow of damaging fake news on its platform’s pages. ”   “We’ve been engaging with Facebook leadership behind the scenes to share our expertise and offer input on developing meaningful solutions,” it continues. Media Matters pressured Facebook during the 2016 election to focus on the “fake news” they believed to be spreading across social media.  The document also claims, “After Facebook responded to our campaign by acknowledging the problem of fake news and agreeing to do something about it, we began a dialogue. It became clear from these conversations that Facebook needed our help in fully understanding the problem and identifying concrete solutions. ” The document also claims that Media Matters has been working with Google to identify sources of “fake news”: Similarly, after Google revised their terms of service in order to prohibit   fake news sites from using their advertising network, it was Media Matters that had the information necessary to identify 40 of the worst fake news sites to which this policy applied.  The document further claims that “Google will cut off these pages’ accompanying sites’ access to revenue by pulling their access to Google’s ad platform. ” Google has recently updated their AdSense policies leading to the banning of as many as 200 websites. David Brock stated in a speech at the retreat that “fake news” was one of the key issues that Media Matters must fight against, calling the organization “the top watchdog against fake news and propaganda. ”  Brock claimed that with the financial support of donors, Media Matters would ensure that “Internet and social media platforms, like Google and Facebook  …     no longer uncritically and without consequence host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists. ” Facebook has been accused in the past of censoring conservative news sites. In response, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a meeting with conservatives to assure them of his dedication to free speech. Recently there have been rumors that the young tech billionaire is considering a movement into politics, a rumor backed up by close friends that say Zuckerberg “wants to be emperor. ” When asked for comment, a Facebook spokesperson told Breitbart, “We think it’s important to understand how people use and experience our platform, which is why we talk openly with groups, organizations and media outlets that span the political spectrum. ” Google declined to provide comment to the Washington Free Beacon.

1519,Hollywood Writers Trash Trump at Politically-Charged WGA Awards,"Sunday night’s Writer’s Guild of America awards show turned into a   exercise in     as Hollywood’s top writers repeatedly skewered the president during presentations and acceptance speeches.[   Patton Oswalt took on hosting duties for the Los   ceremony and began the night by introducing his event security, two men dressed as “soldiers from armed forces of the Russian Federation. ”  “People here tonight are angry about two things  —   that Deadpool is nominated for Best Screenplay and that Trump is President,” Oswalt joked. “Donald Trump, I want to be very careful about making jokes about. I don’t want to be kicked to death tonight by James Woods,” at which point the conservative actor hopped onstage, snatched off Oswalt’s shoe, and chided him: “This is an awards show, get some shoes, Jesus. ” The impromptu bit was not scripted, Oswalt assured his social media followers.  Regaining control of the show, Oswalt continued: “I feel bad for Trump. Here’s what happened: They had the [White House] Correspondents’ Dinner, Obama went up and made fun of Donald, and Donald said, ‘I’m taking his job. ’” “Now he’s sitting there saying: ‘This job sucks! My life before this was amazing! ’” he added. “Donald Trump taking Obama’s job would be like if the head of linguistics at Rutgers made fun of David Lee Roth   …     and he said, ‘I’m the head of linguistics at Rutgers. Bring on the hookers and cocaine! ’” Later, Chelsea Handler took her own shot at Trump by ridiculing his claim that millions of people may have illegally voted in the 2016 general election, though the talk show host’s jokes didn’t appear to land with the audience. “If you win this award tonight I want everybody to remember not to get a big head because there are millions of illegal voters in California. Not to mention the ones in Massachusetts who took a bus and voted in New Hampshire,” Handler joked.  Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who was awarded the Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television Writing Achievement, went on a fiery   tirade during his acceptance speech. The West Wing creator condemned Trump as being “out of touch” and urged the room full of writers to combat the administration by writing stories that help heal the country. While accepting the WGA West’s Laurel Award, director Oliver Stone broke from the night’s   bias and instead bashed both major political parties. “It’s fashionable now to take shots at Republicans and Trump and all that and avoid the Obamas and Clintons,” Stone said, according to Deadline. “But remember this: In the 13 wars we’ve started over the last 30 years and the 14 trillion dollars we’ve spent and the hundreds of thousands of lives that have perished from this Earth, remember that it wasn’t one leader but a system  —   both Republican and Democrat. ” Introducing Stone was actor and rare Hollywood conservative James Woods. “So my publicists says ‘Whatever you do don’t talk politics.’ I say, ‘Ok.’ And I show up and 15 minutes later I’m Darth Vader,” Woods joked.  Back in New York at the WGA Awards East, which were taking place simultaneously, host Lewis Black also took shots at Trump. “We’re living at the intersection of satire and reality,” Black joked.

1520,Exclusive-Ways and Means Chair Brady: Border Adjustment Tax How Congress Turns Trump Rhetoric into Reality - Breitbart,"The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee told Breitbart News the new Border Adjustment Tax is the way for Capitol Hill conservatives to support President Donald Trump’s efforts to reform the tax code and reverse American trade disadvantages, as well as unleashing trillions of dollars currently sitting on the sidelines. [“We know what our competitors do to beat us,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R. ) who took over one of the House’s most powerful committees from Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) upon Ryan’s taking up the gavel.  “China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and these others, they beat us on low rates, but not anymore,” Brady said. “They border adjust. ” The chairman said virtually every other country in the world has a system in place, where they take major taxes off of a product as it is exported to the United States and they slap a tax on products coming into their country from the United States. Brady said the president is deeply involved with the chairman’s tax reform effort, because it lines up with his campaign rhetoric. “President Trump gets it,” he said. “He knows it is not a level playing field and American workers and American communities are really getting hurt by this, so we are having very good discussions about how to end the ‘Made in America Tax’,” he said. “I am very encouraged with our talks with President Trump,” Brady added. Helping Brady’s cause is the popular support for what he promises the Border Adjustment Tax achieves. According to a confidential poll by Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio and his partner David Lee that is circulating Capitol Hill offices and was made available to Breitbart News, 58 percent of the voters in 14 states key support the BAT, and 29 oppose it. Among Republicans, 80 percent support the BAT with Democrats split: 45 percent oppose and 39 percent support. The poll asked: “( ) people say that they would prefer a tax code that incentivizes   goods imported and sold in American stores for lower prices. ( ) People say that they would prefer a tax code that incentivizes American manufacturing of goods to be sold in American stores and exported throughout the world.“   percent chose to incentivize American goods, and 13 percent chose to incentivize foreign goods. The poll was conducted among 1, 000 registered voters from Feb. 20 to Feb. 22 in 14 states and the District of Columbia.   percent of the calls were made over landlines, and 44 percent were made on cell phones. The poll carries a 3. 1 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence. Brady’s BAT is not a small piece of the puzzle it is the puzzle. It is estimated that the tax will reassign a macro tax burden by roughly $1 trillion, or about   of federal revenues. The legislative lift alone is massive, given that this is the most significant restructuring of the tax code since President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 reform. That reform reduced the individual tax code to three brackets, lowered the rates, and eliminated hundreds if not thousands of tax breaks. The BAT’s $1 trillion haul then allows conservatives to achieve long overdue items on their agenda, such as the full repeal of the tax on estates, lowering the tax rates on personal and business taxes, and elimination of the tax code’s infestation of tax loopholes written in for special interests. Brady said the estimates vary, but it is safe to say that American businesses are sitting on $6 trillion in cash that they were unwilling to use to hire new workers or invest. “Because of President Obama’s constant attack on the free enterprise system, businesses didn’t feel comfortable unleashing that investment,” he said. “Under the Republican blueprint, we allow businesses to immediately write off from their taxes all their new investment, new buildings, new equipment, new technology, and new software,” the Texan said. “We’ll bring all that investment off the sidelines and inject it right into the US economy,” he said. “That’s where you are going to see lots of growth as well. ” Under the current system, low American trade barriers and the tax rebate other countries offer on exports means that American companies have a solid incentive to move manufacturing overseas and then send their products into the United States as our competitors do. Brady said the BAT equals out that disadvantage and fosters an environment where businesses are comfortable hiring and investing. During the campaign, Trump promised to lower the business tax to 15 percent from its current 35 percent. This rate is one of the highest in the world and creates the conditions for lawmakers to give their friends tax breaks. Were Congress to lower the business tax from 35 percent, there would be less reason to hire lobbyists to secure a tax loophole. One other advantage of lowering the business tax rate is the estimated $2. 5 trillion parked overseas by companies unwilling to pay 35 percent off the top when they bring those profits home —  those funds suddenly become reasonable to repatriate, he said. “Those profits, stranded overseas, we want them reinvested in America in new jobs, new research, and new growth. ” The chairman said his goal is to have the bill marked up out of committee by the end of spring and signed into law before the end of 2017. “You want to give the Senate plenty of time to act on their tax reform as well,” he said. “After 30 years, the prospects of getting tax reform done this year are the best they have ever looked. ”",0
1521,FBI REDUX: What’s Behind New Probe into Hillary Clinton Emails?,"
In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton. 
‘NEW PROBE’– The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE) 
FBI October Surprise? 
According to reports , in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey , stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton’s personal email server. 
CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey’s letter discussing the new investigation: 
“In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,” Comey wrote. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” he added. 
Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,” Comey concluded.” 
Huma’s Estranged ‘Sexting’ Husband 
According to a new report released via The New York Times : 
“The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.” “ In a letter to Congress , the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide.” Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her ‘home brew’ email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled. 
This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton ‘s private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under “Bill Clinton, Inc.,” with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years. 
The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation… 
The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new ‘Pay-to-Play’ allegations , as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit ‘large-scale’ voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies. Out of Creamer’s 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times. White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47 “private meetings with Obama or his senior staff,” also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics – thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability. ‘CAUGHT ON FILM’ – Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN ) Creamer, a convicted felon , (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly “shoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign’s inner circle,” following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. ‘PAY TO PLAY?’– Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clinton’s negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. (Image Source new republic ) It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate , Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , “helped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email system, according to a report.” The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: 
“The political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal . 
The report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. 
The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate’s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau.” 
In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations, “…According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton’s email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling “pressured” by another FBI official at Kennedy’s request.” 
The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there’s no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates – the agency needed to save face. 
It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election.

Sanders added that it was up to Congress whether or not they should subpoena Rice, but that the White House was confident in the investigation. Rice declined a request from the Sen. Lindsey Graham to testify in the investigation into interference in the United States presidential election. “While Ambassador Rice commends the Subcommittee’s efforts to examine this matter of extraordinary national significance, it is extremely rare for the Congress to request the testimony of a former senior advisor to the President,” a letter from Rice’s lawyer read to the committee, citing “separation of powers” concerns.

Via NewYorkTimes 

Two members of Mr. Trump’s security detail raced toward Mr. Trump, with one of them grabbing him and forcibly escorting him away from the lectern. Moments before, Mr. Trump had seemed to notice a commotion in the crowd in front of him. As he was led away, video from the event appeared to show people near the stage subduing someone in the audience.
Soon after, police officers escorted a man into a bathroom away from the crowd. Several officers followed him inside, and several more stayed outside, guarding the door. With Mr. Trump off the stage, some in the crowd in the Reno-Sparks Convention Center grew confused and panicked.

“What’s going on?” asked one woman, leaning over the metal barricades to inquire if the news media had any information. “Are we in danger?” A few minutes later, Mr. Trump returned to the same lectern and indirectly addressed the matter.
“Nobody said it would be easy for us,” he said. “But we will never be stopped. Never. Ever.” He added: “I want to thank the Secret Service. They don’t get enough credit. They are amazing people.”

1524,Rodrigo Duterte on Killing Criminal Suspects: ‘I Used to Do It Personally’ - The New York Times,"President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, overseer of a contentious and bloody crackdown on drug dealers and users, boasted on Monday about having personally killed criminal suspects when he was mayor of Davao City. “In Davao, I used to do it personally  —   just to show to the guys that if I can do it, why can’t you?” Mr. Duterte told business leaders at a meeting in Manila, explaining how he goaded police officers to gun down suspects. “And I’d go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble also,” he said, according to The Manila Times. “I was really looking for a confrontation, so I could kill. ” Mr. Duterte is known both for his tough stance on crime and for controversial remarks. He has acknowledged killing before  —   in 2015, he said that he had killed at least three men suspected of kidnapping and rape in Davao City  —   but his remarks on Monday appeared to be his first such public admission since he became president. When he was mayor of Davao City, Mr. Duterte was known to carry a . 38 pistol and was accused of overseeing a death squad to kill people suspected of being criminals. As president, he has led a nationwide “war on drugs” by the police and vigilante groups, which has left more than 3, 000 people dead. Hours earlier on Monday, Mr. Duterte spoke at an awards ceremony in Manila, where he said, “I am not a killer,” and then threatened to kill police officers who disobeyed him. “I do not relish or enjoy a Filipino sprawled there with all the blood,” he said, according to the Philippine Star. “With regard to the killing of persons on bended knees, with hands tied behind their back, that’s not ours. Will that make you a better soldier or policeman? If they do that, I’ll shoot them. ” Though he has led a brutal crackdown on drug addicts, Mr. Duterte seemed to imply in his remarks to the business leaders that he had overused an addictive drug himself. Speaking in English, Mr. Duterte said he had been prescribed the powerful painkiller fentanyl because of chronic back pain and migraine headaches. “I was only given a fourth of that square thing,” he said, describing a patch containing the drug that was to be applied to the nape of his neck. “There was a time that if I took two  —   of course, my doctor learned that I was using the whole patch, because I felt better. ” The Philippine Star posted a video of the speech online.

1526,Krauthammer: Dems ’Trying To Leave Behind As Many Landmines As They Can’ To Undercut Legitimacy of Trump Win - Breitbart,"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer reacted to the investigation into the DOJ’s and FBI’s handling of the Clinton email case by saying, “it looks as if the Democrats, on their way out the door, are trying to leave behind as many landmines as they can to at least cast doubts on the legitimacy of the Trump victory. ”  Krauthammer said, “I don’t want to impute a general conspiracy here, but it looks as if the Democrats, on their way out the door, are trying to leave behind as many landmines as they can to at least cast doubts on the legitimacy of the Trump victory. All of a sudden, as we have seen, they’ve gotten interested in Russian cyberwarfare, which the administration appeared to be extremely nonchalant about until they lost the November election. And now we’re going to have new investigations, meaning days and days of headlines about the other thing that Democrats attribute their loss to, meaning Comey’s action with 11 days to go, in which he reopened, as he said, the investigation. Many Democrats think that’s why they lost. Now, that would have faded into history. This is a way to say that it’s not going to, and it will remain there. I’m not sure this is the best way to ensure a good transition, one where you transfer not just the authority of office, but the legitimacy. But that seems to be what the Democrats want to do as they get out of power. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
1527,Jewish Press Releases Audio Tape Exposing Hillary Clinton Plotting to Rig Election,"
Decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Hillary Clinton saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. The presidential candidate lamented that the US didn’t “determine who was going to win.”
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election.
“And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win,” she said.
Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspaper’s office in Brooklyn.

Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud.
Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that “anyone could support the idea — offered by a national political leader, no less — that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.”
The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas.
Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the “power of democracy,” but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israel’s existence and espoused violence.
That day in September 2006, Clinton made “odd and controversial comments,” all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky “held onto all these years.”
“I went to my bosses at the time,” Chomsky told the Observer. “The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody — even a direct quote from anyone — in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn’t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.”

IT’S been called the most touching love story to ever grace these lands, and it’s continuing to flourish every day. We are of course referring to the love shared between local man Graham Kenny and the sound of his own voice. 
Kenny, 37, admits that it was ‘love at first hearing’ when he learned how to talk over three decades ago, and the love he has for his own opinions, bravado and general nonsense grows stronger each and every year. 
The pair spend a lot of time socialising with Kenny’s friends, who have admitted that they while Graham is alright in small doses, when he’s out with his voice the pair can be ‘quite obnoxious’. 
“Like any overbearing couple, when Graham and his voice get going, you don’t know where to look,” said one of Mr. Kenny’s co-workers. 
“They’ll be there, making everyone feel uncomfortable, completely unaware of how overbearing and embarrassing they’re being. If you could have one without the other, that’d be great. Unfortunately, where one goes, the other is always there”. 
The love affair between Kenny and the sound of his own voice has shown no signs of slowing down, with many expecting a marriage announcement any day now.",0

1533,"‘Is He Having A Stroke?’: Huckabee Calls Trump A ‘Car Wreck,’ Freaks Out When People Laugh At Him","By Jameson Parker Election 2016 , Politicians Behaving Badly , Politics November 4, 2016 ‘Is He Having A Stroke?’: Huckabee Calls Trump A ‘Car Wreck,’ Freaks Out When People Laugh At Him   
It was a good morning for Ben Carson. No longer can it be said that he is Donald Trump’s very worst campaign surrogate. The title now belongs to Mike Huckabee – a very dim bulb in a low wattage room. 
In a turn that had people seriously questioning his mental health, the former Arkansas governor decided to use his patented ability to make lousy metaphors to compare Donald Trump to a car wreck. A strong endorsement if there ever was one. Trump may be a car wreck, but at least his car is pointed in right direction. Hillary is a drunk-driver going the wrong way on the freeway. 
— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 4, 2016 
To break down the comparison, Huckabee is saying Donald Trump may be dead on arrival, but at least he isn’t Hillary Clinton, a woman he thinks is taking the country in the wrong direction. In Huckabee’s tortured brain, the fact that his own candidate is a total mess – the one he plans on voting for and is enthusiastically flying around the country supporting – is less bad than a woman who would back liberal policies he disagrees with. So… vote for Donald Trump, the car wreck! 
Hilariously, Huckabee seemed legitimately shocked and outraged that people took his analogy to mean he thought Donald Trump was a bad candidate. But instead of clarifying, Huckabee’s follow-up made everything so much worse. Low IQ media don't get my earlier tweet about car wreck. @realdonaldTrump will bend fenders but is a vehicle going right way. 
— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 4, 2016

1534,"Not Just Hillary, Entire Obama Administration Exposed for Using Private Email to Avoid FOIA Requests","
By Jack Burns
Wikileaks is helping President Obama keep his 2008 campaign promise — to be the most transparent administration in U.S. history — whether he likes it or not. And, once again, we’re learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices. As FBI Director James Comey announced Friday, a new investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal has been launched, just days before the presidential election. Comey’s move drew fire instantly from the Democrats who claim Comey is attempting to sway the election in Donald Trump’s favor. While many are focused on Comey’s actions and renewed investigation, Wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of state’s emails.
According to former State Department official Tom Nides, in a 2015 email to John Podesta (Clinton campaign manager), everyone in Obama’s cabinet and every White House staffer uses their personal email for government business. Nides should know as he worked under Hillary Clinton in the State Department from 2011 to 2013, according to one source .
While keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply don’t care, ALL correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records.
The Federal Records Act defines a record as anything, “regardless of whether it exists in physical, digital, or electronic form, is a record as defined in subsection (a) shall be binding on all Federal agencies.” This includes all communication of state agents (like the POTUS) who work in the executive branch of government, as well.
But the Obama administration, according to Nides, has long since avoided the Federal Records Act by using private Gmail accounts. Nides wrote Podesta and said, “There is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing. (Which I am sure nobody wants to do). Get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones.” That admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the Federal Records Act. But it was Nides’ next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets.
Nides wrote, “Btw you know as well as I every god damn cabinet officer and WH staff uses their [sic] gmail account!” The former Department of State employee revealed what many already suspected. The Obama administration is anything but transparent. Just ask Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. His organization routinely sues the Obama administration in federal court using the Freedom of Information Act as warrant for inquiry, and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn. Fitton’s organization gave the Obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when Bush was president.
Fitton wrote in 2015 , “There are about 18 lawsuits, 10 of which are active in federal court, and about 160 Judicial Watch FOIA requests that could be affected by Mrs. Clinton and her staff’s use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business. In our various FOIA lawsuits, our lawyers have informed attorneys for the Obama administration that Hillary Clinton’s account and any other secret accounts used by State employees should be secured, recovered and searched.” JW actively seeks out those files through official methods, using FOIA and the Federal Records Act, but has been met with delay after delay from FOIA requests to the Obama administration.
While the Obama administration is on its way out, groups like Judicial Watch aren’t going anywhere, and presumably have all the time in the world to FOIA their way into digging up those deleted Clinton emails, as well as securing Gmail accounts from the Obama administration cabinet and staffers. This story is definitely a long way from being over.
It’s no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines they’re being told. With the president and all his men (and women), hiding their communications within their Gmail accounts, the truth is never going to be told, at least not the real truth. And by the time organizations like Judicial Watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people, it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Julian Assange, we salute you. Thank you for forcing the Obama administration to be transparent. Keep up the valiant work! Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

1535,Train Was Traveling at Twice the Speed Limit Just Before Hoboken Crash - The New York Times,"A New Jersey Transit train that crashed in Hoboken last week accelerated to about 21 miles per hour just before it smashed into the terminal, killing a woman and injuring more than 100 other people, federal investigators said on Thursday. In the minute before the crash, the train had been moving toward the platform at just eight miles per hour, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The engineer had blown the train’s horn and activated the bell that signals its approach before suddenly accelerating, braking only at the last second before the train plowed through a bumper and onto the platform. The federal agency is still investigating the accident and has not determined a cause, officials said. But the new details from an event recorder recovered from the train provided the clearest picture yet of what happened leading up to the crash. Shortly after the crash, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said the train appeared to be speeding into the station. The speed limit for trains entering the busy station is 10 m. p. h. On the morning of Sept. 29, the crowded train hurtled into Hoboken Terminal, causing part of the roof to collapse onto the train. Investigators have interviewed the train’s engineer, Thomas Gallagher, 48, who told them he did not remember the accident and woke up on the floor of the cab after the train had stopped. Mr. Gallagher told investigators that the train was traveling about 10 m. p. h. as it entered the station. He reported that he felt well rested and that his cellphone was turned off and stored in a personal backpack. On Wednesday, New Jersey Transit issued new rules requiring a second crew member to join the train engineer in the operating cab when entering stations in Hoboken and Atlantic City. The measure was aimed at providing a second set of eyes and ears during the final segment of trips into those stations. Train service at Hoboken Terminal has been suspended since the crash. New Jersey Transit has not said when trains will start traveling there again. James E. Hall, a former chairman of the safety board, said the event recorder information showed the engineer had accelerated the train before the crash, but it did not explain why. “What it doesn’t answer is: If there were those movements by the operator of the throttle, were they accidental or intentional?” he said. Mr. Hall praised the railroad’s decision to place a conductor next to the train’s engineer to serve as a backup. But he also urged the railroad to install an automatic braking system to prevent future accidents. “It’s unimportant whether it was human error or accidental,” Mr. Hall said. “There are technologies to prevent the train from accelerating. ” The National Transportation Safety Board has long pushed for railroads to implement a technology known as positive train control, which can automatically stop or slow a train. Investigators said they did not know whether the technology would have prevented the crash in Hoboken.",0
1536,HOT Topic: Catholics & Lutherans,"HOT Topic: Catholics & Lutherans October 28, 2016 File photo of Pope Francis talking during his visit to the Lutheran church in Rome, November 15, 2015. 
An unlikely match is in the works. Pope Francis creates anticipation for intercommunion between Catholics and Lutherans. 
After 500 years of clear differences between them, intercommunion between Catholics and Lutherans seems to be closer to becoming a reality. Lutheran and Catholic bishops are expressing their expectation of the ability to receive Communion in the Catholic Church, a practice that is not lawful. Pope Francis, who will travel to Lund, Sweden, to participate in the ceremonies, has himself elicited the excitement by suggesting that intercommunion is a possibility. 
The Lutheran Church of Sweden to which Pope Francis is going for the celebration accepts contraception, abortion, homosexuality, and female clergy, all of which are strictly forbidden in the Catholic Church. Regarding the Eucharist, Lutherans have a fundamentally different faith from Catholics. Nevertheless, Eucharistic intercommunion seems to be the main desire for Lutheran and Catholic leaders. There doesn't seem to be much talk about whether married homosexual couples will be taking communion together at the Catholic Church. It is after all a legitimate concern for many considering the position of both Catholics and Lutherans on the issue. Donate Today!

1540,"WATCH: UK Reporter RIPS CNN, Calls Them “Clinton News Network”","Rand Paul Warns Poll Manipulation Will Suppress Voter Turnout 
“I think we have seen a very similar thing here in the U.K. with Brexit ,” she continued. “We saw a lot of the liberal press kind of sneering at Brexiteers. We see a lot of the sneering that we’re seeing from the Clinton News Network.” 
Gorani interjected, “That’s CNN, you’re calling us the Clinton News Network,” to which Hopkins immediately responded, “That’s exactly correct.” 
When Gorani pressed as to why Hopkins would say such a thing about the network, Hopkins explained that she was referring to the manipulated polls that CNN routinely passes off on viewers showing Clinton with a seemingly insurmountable lead over Trump.   
Hopkins proceeded to say that she and many others had “grown bored” with the collection of “meaningless” polls that were clearly biased in favor of Clinton and downplayed support for Trump. 
“I will say having sat in the Republican convention and having watched your coverage, it is completely biased. And I think Trump is doing a great job,” stated Hopkins. 
The two then attempted to speak over each other for a moment, with Gorani demanding proof that CNN was biased, until Hopkins finally broke through by decrying CNN’s portrayal of woman as “victims” who need to be shielded from someone like Trump, informing the host that women in general are plenty capable of deciding for themselves if they are threatened by Trump or not. 
She then proceeded to state that polls have shown how much Clinton is disliked by the general public, even saying, “I find her abhorrent to look at. Her little smile there does nothing for me.”  ",0
1541,State Polls: Trump Gains DRAMATICALLY | Daily Wire,"— Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 
Remington Research's summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become ""increasingly competitive"": 
Last week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. 
“The presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen,” said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group 
Other state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a close-race between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comey's announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics : Florida: New York Times/Siena: Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona: CBS/YouGov: Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina: NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis: Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. 
The fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver: Both things can be true: 1) Comey impact overblown — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 31, 2016 
Radio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could ""have a potentially huge impact"" on Election Day: 
Trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. It’s quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republican-leaning undecideds Trump’s way. But that’s provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as he’s been prone to do. Then there’s the matter of Trump’s emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. 
If Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaign’s final week. The hope is that there’s enough voters in those states wearier of Clinton’s corruption than worried about whether Trump’s fit for office. 
FiveThirtyEight currently has Trump's odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBI's re-opened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day. Tags ",0
1542,Donald Trump to Visit Mexico After More Than a Year of Mocking It - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump will visit Mexico on Wednesday for a private meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto  —   a trip that will take him to a nation he has repeatedly scorned  —   before quickly flying back for what is billed as a major immigration speech in Arizona. Mr. Peña Nieto’s office said Tuesday night that the meeting would take place at the presidential palace in Mexico City, and Mr. Trump, on Twitter, said he looked “very much forward” to the visit. The Mexican president’s office said Mr. Peña Nieto had sent invitations last week to both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. The negotiations for both trips were first reported by The Washington Post. The Clinton campaign said Mrs. Clinton last met with the Mexican president in 2014 and would talk again with him “at the appropriate time,” without elaborating. Mr. Peña Nieto is reaching out to Mr. Trump in the face of the Republican candidate’s antagonistic attitude toward Mexico in his policies and campaign rallies. He has said many Mexican immigrants who enter the United States illegally are rapists, and he has repeatedly insisted that Mexico will pay for his proposed wall along the southern United States border. He is widely reviled in Mexico, where the wall proposal has revived deep grievances over sovereignty and respect that have historically dogged Mexico’s relationship with the United States. “They are not our friend, believe me,” Mr. Trump said in a speech last year in which he accused Mexico of treating the United States unfairly, “but they are killing us economically. ” “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he added. “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some I assume are good people. ” Politicians in Mexico have largely remained silent on Mr. Trump, though there have been outbursts, including from Mr. Peña Nieto himself. In March, he compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini for what he called Mr. Trump’s strident remarks and populism, though he later tried to soften his words without quite taking them back. The trip will take place hours before Mr. Trump is to give a speech in Phoenix that is expected to clarify his stance on immigration, which has plagued his campaign over the past few weeks as he has wavered on key elements of his platform. His campaign has given conflicting signals over whether he will stick to the   positions he took during the Republican primaries, particularly on deportations, and he suggested recently that he was open to “softening” some of his proposals. But his calls to have Mexico pay for the wall have continued. “From the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as ‘rapists’ and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and U. S. citizens,” Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign’s communications director, said in a statement. “What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions. ” The trip is the latest gamble for Mr. Trump and his struggling campaign. But for all the risk it poses, it offers an image Mr. Trump relishes: of a wily negotiator willing to do the unexpected  —   meeting with a perceived enemy  —   to advance his agenda. It will also be his first official meeting with a head of state as the Republican presidential nominee. Despite Mr. Trump’s routine scolding of Mexico and its leadership, several of his closest allies have warm ties with the country and its president. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a top Trump adviser and confidant, traveled to Mexico in 2014 to meet with Mr. Peña Nieto, arguing that it was imperative for the United States to put Mexico at the center of its foreign relations. During that trip, Mr. Christie offered lavish praise for Mr. Peña Nieto’s   policies and, unlike Mr. Trump, spoke of the need to cultivate stronger ties with Mexico. “Too often, our neighbors in Mexico and Canada have felt that they were an afterthought in U. S. foreign policy,” he said. “My view is that they should be our first thought. ” A person briefed on the trip discussions said that Mr. Christie, who leads Mr. Trump’s transition team, had helped with them. Mexico’s disaffection with Mr. Trump began early in his campaign, when he said, among other things, that the immigrants entering the United States illegally from Mexico were criminals. From that point on, columns, articles and public forums have been filled with   tirades, his words galvanizing Mexicans across the social spectrum. Artisans have fashioned Trump piñatas, and former President Vicente Fox has made it his mission to rebuke Mr. Trump’s every word, to name but two of the rejoinders from Mexican society. Last year, writers, intellectuals and scientists from across the   world wrote a public letter denouncing Mr. Trump and accusing him of xenophobia. Mr. Peña Nieto’s finance minister has said that under no circumstances would Mexico pay for a border wall. Andrew Selee, the executive vice president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a Mexico expert, said Mexico’s motivation to invite Mr. Trump might simply have been pragmatic. “I think the Mexican government wants channels with whoever is going to be president of the U. S. next, and Trump is a legitimate candidate,” Mr. Selee said. “And from a political perspective, Peña Nieto getting Trump to come to Mexico shows that Trump has been forced to shift some of his rhetoric and take Mexico seriously. ” But considering how often Mr. Trump comes up in conversation in Mexico, and the uniform insult felt by the nation every time he talks about the wall, the government has remained disciplined in their public statements. That is in part a political decision: Officials feel that any responses will do little but provide more publicity for the candidate. For Mr. Peña Nieto, though, the politics could be difficult. His poll numbers are the lowest of any Mexican president in a  .",0
1543,"‘Brexit,’ Angela Merkel, Donald Trump: Your Wednesday Briefing - The New York Times","Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Britain’s House of Commons will debate “Brexit” today. An opposition motion called on Prime Minister Theresa May to reveal her strategy for leaving the European Union. In return, Ms. May asked that lawmakers approve the beginning of talks, in late March. Michel Barnier, one of the E. U.’s lead negotiators, took a hard line against Britain’s plans to retain some advantages after leaving. He also said a deal needed to be reached within 18 months of the start of talks. We look at how populists in Continental Europe, as in Britain and the U. S. are tapping into discontent in the countryside and exploiting resentment against urbanites viewed as elites. _____ • Angela Merkel  accepted her party’s nomination for another   term as Germany’s chancellor in next year’s election. Trying to ward off challenges from the populist right, she said   veils should be banned “wherever legally possible. ” While not mentioning Donald J. Trump by name, Ms. Merkel indicated that his rise to the White House could make it harder to define global policy and tackle international security challenges. _____ • Mr. Trump’s latest disruption involves one of the most hallowed symbols of the American presidency: Air Force One. Mr. Trump suggested that Boeing was inflating the costs of an upgrade. “Cancel order!” he wrote on Twitter. The lobbying firm of former Senator Bob Dole received $140, 000 from the government of Taiwan for its work in establishing contacts that led to the president of Taiwan’s phone call with Mr. Trump last week. Here’s the latest on the presidential transition. _____ • Libyan fighters declared victory over the Islamic State in Surt, ending the group’s ambitions for a caliphate on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. But the government in Tripoli remains weak, having failed to extend its authority even over the capital since it started work in March. Many militias fighting under its banner are more concerned about Gen. Khalifa Hifter, a strongman who dominates Benghazi and the east of the country, than about the Islamic State. _____ • Saudi Arabia has voiced support for U. S. efforts to nourish democracy in Afghanistan. But it has also lavishly funded Sunni extremism there, under various guises. Our special report examines how the kingdom manages to be on both sides of the conflict. _____ • Affluence doesn’t guarantee better results in education, particularly in science and math, a global survey suggests. America’s most advantaged teenagers scored below their   peers in science. The countries with the highest scores  —   Singapore, Japan, Estonia, Finland and Canada  —   tend to be those that have acted to make teaching more prestigious and selective and directed more resources to their neediest children. _____ • The Trump Organization scrapped its contentious application to build a sea wall in Ireland. • Google uses almost as much energy as San Francisco. Next year, the company said, all that energy will come from wind farms and solar panels. • The U. S. economy has more than doubled since 1980, but new research finds there was close to zero growth for   adults on the bottom half of the income ladder. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, above, pledged that Iran would not allow Mr. Trump to “rip up” the nuclear deal and warned of consequences if President Obama signed a   extension of sanctions. [The New York Times] • Malta outlawed “conversion therapy” to change sexual orientation. [Times of Malta] • A court in Greece said three pilots who fled Turkey after the failed coup in July must go back. A day earlier, it said three Turkish soldiers could stay. [Reuters] • Voters in Ghana go to the polls today in presidential elections. The country’s economy has plunged, with this year’s growth on track to be the slowest in decades. [The New York Times] • Russia published a plan to defend itself against online attacks and operate the Russian internet autonomously, if needed in time of war.

We’re asking women around the world to let us know if they kept or changed their names, and why. • A rape scene in Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1972 film “Last Tango in Paris” is at the center of an internet outcry. • Real Madrid will host Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League’s final round of group games. Arsenal secured first place in its group by defeating Basel. Napoli and Benfica advanced. • Beyoncé, with nine nods for her album “Lemonade,” leads the nominations for the 59th annual Grammy Awards. Other nominees include Adele, Drake, Rihanna and Justin Bieber. • Giacomo Puccini’s original version of “Madama Butterfly” will get a second chance at Teatro alla Scala in Milan, more than a century after its premiere was met with catcalls and jeers. The standoff over an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the American Midwest took a turn this week when the Army Corps of Engineers said it would reconsider the pipeline’s route. The Corps has helped shape American infrastructure since its establishment in 1802 as the “world’s largest public engineering, design and construction management agency. ” As a part of the Department of the Army, its early projects involved forts. But the Corps’ most notable legacy may be making Great Lakes harbors safer and reducing river obstacles, a boon to the growing nation’s economy. The Standing Rock protest stems from the pipeline’s planned routing under the Missouri River, raising Native American fears of an environmental catastrophe. When those happen, the Corps often responds, as it did in the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989. The Corps has often been credited with a marvel that it didn’t actually build: the original Panama Canal, which transformed global trade. The canal’s construction was, however, overseen by a famous member of the Corps, Gen. George Washington Goethals. When he died in 1928, officials called the canal “a monument to one of the world’s greatest engineers. ” He was buried at the U. S. Military Academy in New York, overlooking the Hudson River.

1544,Asylum Seeker Suicides On the Rise in Sweden,"Several asylum seekers in Sweden have killed themselves in recent weeks, and the government has held a crisis meeting to find the cause and deal with the issue. [Five asylum seekers have taken their lives in Sweden, three of them in the last two weeks alone. The migrants have two things in common, all were young Afghan asylum seekers, and they were all scheduled to be deported. The problem is especially prevalent among young asylum seekers who even encourage others to kill themselves online Deutschlandfunk reports.  Psychologist Julia Tiberg works with young migrants at Vi står inte ut, an organisation dedicated to helping young asylum seekers in Sweden. Tilberg said, “We observe young asylum seekers in closed internet forums encouraging each other to commit suicide,” adding, “suicide is also considered moral by the group and is for the sake of others, to affect the current policy. ” Ombudsman Fredrik Malmberg has backed up the claims saying, “I have been informed by the social authority that there are seemingly organised suicidal thoughts among asylum seekers without families, which is extremely worrying because several of them have actually committed suicide. ” In the past year around 3, 000 underage Afghan migrants have arrived in Sweden and 600 of them have been rejected for asylum status. Of those rejected, many have been allowed to stay in Sweden because they claim not to have any family back in their native country.  Musse Hossein is an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who tries to help his fellow countrymen. He said of the underage migrants he has met, “they feel lonely, have mental problems, and when their asylum petition is rejected, the situation is, of course, serious. ” Over the past year, Sweden has also had problems with abuse in underage migrant homes. In February of last year, a    Afghan migrant boy who had recently arrived in Sweden was tricked into going to a field near his asylum home by several other underage asylum seekers who proceeded to beat him and rape him.  A few months later in April, another underage migrant was sexually abused. In that case, the victim was a    girl, and her attacker was another Afghan migrant who claimed to be underage, though authorities discovered that he was lying about his age and had only been in Sweden for two days before the attack.   Another boy was sexually abused by Afghan migrants in December in the Swedish city of Uppsala. The boy, who is said to have been under 15, was lured by five underage Afghans to a wooded area where the boys sexually abused him, beat him and filmed the ordeal on their mobile phones. ",0

1546,A Trump Empire Built on Inside Connections and $885 Million in Tax Breaks - The New York Times,"The way Donald J. Trump tells it, his first solo project as a real estate developer, the conversion of a faded railroad hotel on 42nd Street into the sleek,   Grand Hyatt, was a triumph from the very beginning. The hotel, Mr. Trump bragged in “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” his 1987 best seller, “was a hit from the first day. Gross operating profits now exceed $30 million a year. ” But that book, and numerous interviews over the years, make little mention of a crucial factor in getting the hotel built: an extraordinary   tax break that has cost New York City $360 million to date in forgiven, or uncollected, taxes, with four years still to run, on a property that cost only $120 million to build in 1980. The project set the pattern for Mr. Trump’s New York career: He used his father’s, and, later, his own, extensive political connections, and relied on a huge amount of assistance from the government and taxpayers in the form of tax breaks, grants and incentives to benefit the 15 buildings at the core of his Manhattan real estate empire. Since then, Mr. Trump has reaped at least $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York, according to city tax, housing and finance records. The subsidies helped him lower his own costs and sell apartments at higher prices because of their reduced taxes. Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has made clear over the course of his campaign how proud he is that “as a businessman I want to pay as little tax as possible. ” While it is impossible to assess how much Mr. Trump pays in personal or corporate income taxes, because he has refused to release his tax returns, an examination of his record as a New York developer shows how aggressively he has fought to lower the taxes on his projects. Mr. Trump successfully sued the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch after being denied a tax break for Trump Tower, his signature building on Fifth Avenue. Two decades later, in a lawsuit that spanned the administrations of Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, he won a similar tax break for Trump World Tower, a building on First Avenue with some of the city’s   condominiums in 2001. The tax breaks for those two projects alone totaled $157 million. The tax break at the   Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle came to $15. 9 million. No possible subsidy was left untapped. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Mr. Trump lined up a $150, 000 grant for one of his buildings near ground zero, taking advantage of a program to help small businesses in the area recover, even though he had acknowledged on the day of the attacks that his building was undamaged. “Donald Trump is probably worse than any other developer in his relentless pursuit of every single dime of taxpayer subsidies he can get his paws on,” said Alicia Glen, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, who first battled Mr. Trump when she worked in Mr. Giuliani’s administration. In seeking those subsidies, Mr. Trump is not that different from many other developers. But the level of subsidies he has received along with his doggedness in claiming them seem at odds with his rhetoric as an outsider candidate who boasts of his   success and who has denounced what he calls the    culture of politics and a “rigged” system of government. Without addressing specific questions about his pursuit of tax breaks and other subsidies, Mr. Trump in a telephone interview defended going after them. “In many cases, they made the difference between building and not being able to build,” he said. “I’ve gotten incentives in other parts of the world as well. ” In the   eager to make his mark in Manhattan, the    Mr. Trump focused his attention on the failing Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street, next to Grand Central Terminal. The owner, the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad, was keen to sell. It did not seem like an auspicious plan. The city was in the midst of both its own fiscal crisis and a broader economic one the neighborhood near the terminal had gotten seedy and Mr. Trump did not have the capital for the project. He needed his father, Fred C. Trump, to guarantee a portion of the construction loan. Hyatt, which was going to run the hotel, took a 50 percent stake in exchange for guaranteeing the rest of the project. But Mr. Trump insisted that the project was not viable without a tax break from the city. In pressing for government approval, Mr. Trump proved to be the quintessential insider, at least through his father: The elder Mr. Trump was a major contributor to and friend of Mayor Abraham D. Beame and Gov. Hugh L. Carey, both Democrats. “Fred was a big macher in Brooklyn,” said Martin J. McLaughlin, a lobbyist who worked for Donald Trump in the 1990s. “He had an extremely close relationship with Beame and Carey. ” Mr. Trump visited a young city official, Michael Bailkin, who devised a plan centered on a   tax abatement, still the longest ever granted by the city, under which the state would own the land beneath the hotel and lease it to the partnership for $1 a year. “I viewed him as another developer, one with limited experience, but coming from a family with a lot of experience,” Mr. Bailkin recalled in an interview. Mr. Trump had one other qualification. “He did say,” Mr. Bailkin added, “the administration would support it. ” Mr. Carey was on board. But Mr. Trump needed the state’s Urban Development Corporation to go along. He hired Louise Sunshine, the governor’s chief   who arranged a meeting with the head of the agency, Richard Ravitch. Mr. Ravitch said in a recent interview that he responded frankly after Mr. Trump laid out the project: “It’d be great to have a Hyatt on 42nd Street. I thought it’d be successful. But I don’t think it should be exempt from taxation. ” Mr. Trump stood up, Mr. Ravitch recalled, “and said, ‘If you don’t give me an exemption I’ll have you fired. ’” Ms. Sunshine did not respond to requests for comment. In the end, after phone calls from Mr. Beame and other Democratic politicians, Mr. Ravitch and the agency’s board voted to approve the project, though the partners in the hotel had to pay a modest rent for the land based on a percentage of their profits and allow for subway entrances to be built nearby. Mr. Trump said the decision was made on the merits. “We were a contributor like many people were contributors,” he said. “But there never was a quid pro quo. ” After a $120 million overhaul, the hotel, now sheathed in black glass, opened to great fanfare in 1980. Even before it opened, though, Mr. Trump had infuriated the new mayor, Mr. Koch, by reneging on the promise to allow for access to the subway on the east and west sides of the hotel. Mr. Trump eventually granted the western easement and allowed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a stairwell, but shed his responsibility for the other entryway. City officials initially estimated that the tax break on the Hyatt was worth $4 million a year to Mr. Trump. But according to a recent analysis conducted by the city’s Finance Department at the request of The New York Times, the actual annual giveaway was far higher: $6. 3 million in 1983, rising to $17. 8 million in 2016. The combined value of the forgiven taxes is $359. 3 million, with four years left on the abatement. Over the same period, the hotel’s owners have paid the city $202. 5 million in rent and fees, according to the state agency overseeing the project, Empire State Development. Mr. Trump said the tax break did what it was supposed to do. “The hotel was a great success for the city,” he said. “It regenerated interest in that area. ” But early on, the city suspected something was amiss with the rent payments, when the total dropped in 1986, despite rising profits. A 1989 review by Karen Burstein, the city’s auditor general at the time, found that Mr. Trump and Hyatt owed the city $2. 9 million for 1986, having used “aberrant and distortive” accounting methods to reduce their obligation. “This was subsidized by city residents,” Ms. Burstein said recently of the tax break. “The last thing you do is cheat the very people who are your partners. ” After the city and state demanded payment, the hotel partners sued them in 1990. The suit was settled in 2004. Neither court files nor the city’s Law Department have a copy of the agreement, but a city official who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter, said that the city recouped $850, 000. By the time of the settlement, the Pritzker family, which controls the Hyatt hotel chain, had paid Mr. Trump $140 million for his share of the hotel, after their partnership turned acrimonious. When the Hyatt opened, Mr. Trump was already at work on a second project: Trump Tower, the     building that would become his home, the headquarters for his company and a tourist attraction. The idea was to raze the Bonwit Teller department store, whose prestigious Fifth Avenue address he described as a “Tiffany location. ” To build what he called “the ultimate vision of an elegant life seen through a golden eye,” Mr. Trump wanted a   property tax break under the city’s   program, which was created in 1971 to stimulate housing construction. As the city’s economy rebounded,   and programs like it were coming under criticism as giveaways to developers. The Koch administration rejected Mr. Trump’s application, saying the project did not qualify because he was replacing a store with hundreds of employees and annual sales of $30 million, rather than an “underutilized property. ” Mr. Trump sued the city in 1981. Justice Arnold L. Fein of the Appellate Division ruled in the city’s favor, writing that   “hardly contemplates the grant of benefits at the most choice, already adequately utilized location in Manhattan to create residential luxury apartments. ” Mr. Trump appealed and in 1984, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that the city’s action had “impermissibly erected a barrier to the benefit,” and Mr. Trump was entitled to the tax abatement. Mr. Trump said at the time that the abatement was worth $7 million to $10 million over 10 years. The Finance Department, however, said in its recent analysis that the value of the benefit totaled $22. 5 million. Mr. Trump later got an additional $15 million tax break under a separate program for renovating the tower’s commercial space. Mr. Trump continued to fight the Koch administration’s attempts to restrict the tax breaks or to require developer concessions, such as subsidized apartments, in return. After the administration refused to provide tens of millions of dollars in benefits for another project, on the West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Trump declared: “the city under Ed Koch is a disaster. ” It is easy to understand why the tax breaks were so important to a developer like Mr. Trump. During a building’s   to   construction phase, when there is no rental or sales money coming in, a   tax abatement can save a developer millions of dollars in taxes, because the property is taxed at the rate in effect before improvements are made. Once a building is completed and its apartments are sold, the benefits accrue to the buyers, significantly lowering taxes and making the apartments more appealing. In the 2004 offering plan for a new   penthouse at 120 Riverside Boulevard in the Trump   South development, which stretches from 59th Street to 72nd Street on Manhattan’s West Side, the estimated   property taxes were $617 because of the building’s   tax abatement. Without the subsidy, the taxes on the apartment, which was listed at $1. 6 million in 2004, would have been $32, 916. “It was a great selling point,” said Charles P. Reiss, a retired executive vice president for development at the Trump Organization. “For condos, the monthly fee was greatly reduced. ” The benefit declines over time, with the apartment owner paying full taxes after 10 years. After winning the court battle over Trump Tower, Mr. Trump received   tax benefits from the Koch administration worth $20. 8 million for his Trump Plaza and Trump Palace projects. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Mr. Trump built a number of New York projects without taxpayer subsidies. But he continued to chase benefits, large  —   and small. For instance, he sought, and received, a tax abatement worth $48, 000 for the conversion of a condominium tower called Trump Parc East under Mr. Giuliani. And after the Sept. 11 attacks, he obtained a $150, 000 grant for 40 Wall Street, an office tower eight blocks from ground zero, through a   recovery program. In the hours after the attacks, Mr. Trump told German television that his property “wasn’t, fortunately, affected by what happened at the World Trade Center. ” At the other end of the spectrum, there was the   tax abatement he got on seven apartment buildings in Trump   South in which he held a partial stake. According to the Finance Department analysis, the city forgave a combined $331. 8 million in property taxes on the buildings, which were completed from 1998 to 2005. Under the revised rules governing the   program, Mr. Trump was required to set aside 700 of the 3, 494 apartments  —   roughly 20 percent  —   for   and   tenants. In 2000, Mr. Trump began marketing a new condominium near the United Nations, Trump World Tower, which his brochures described as the “newest  —   and the most spectacular  —   achievement of the Trump Organization. ” Again, he wanted the city to give him a   tax break. Ms. Glen, then an assistant commissioner at the city’s Division of Housing Finance, judged the project ineligible for public benefits. After the city’s court battle with Mr. Trump over Trump Tower, the City Council had passed legislation dictating that   benefits no longer be used to demolish usable buildings at public expense. In a letter to Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Ms. Glen said Trump World Tower was to be built on the site of a functioning office building, and denied him the tax break. Mr. Trump sued and a State Supreme Court judge ordered the city to review his application. After that suit stalled, he filed a second one that ended in 2003 with a settlement that granted Mr. Trump a   exemption worth $119. 5 million for the   condo, according to the Finance Department. To meet his obligation to build affordable housing, Mr. Trump paid another developer $9. 65 million for 124 units earmarked for   and   tenants elsewhere in the city. according to court records. He also had to forego a tax abatement during construction. In 2002, apartments at Trump World Tower sold for an average of $1, 046 per square foot, or $1. 5 million for a small  . “His whole MO is to exploit the government for everything he could get,” said Jerilyn Perine, the city housing commissioner during the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations. “In the end, the letter of the law gave it to him. ”",0

1549,How To Measure Water pH At Home,"  15, 2016 How To Measure Water pH At Home 
I was raised in the country and we had well water. It tasted good but it turned the tub, our clothes, and even our hair red. That’s because it had iron in it, which is a sign that the water was acidic. 
To combat this, we used a water filtration system, which increased the pH in the water by removing the excess metals in the water. 
But is water pH important for any other reason that white tubs? Yes it is! 
We’ve discussed the importance of pH before, in articles such as how to make wine and vinegar . Obviously, those two food items are acidic, which means that the pH in each of them is less than 7. Pure water has a pH of 7; a pH less than 7 is considered acidic and a pH greater than 7 is considered basic, or alkaline. 
The Visual Effects of Acidic or Basic Water 
As I stated above, the contents of your water have an aesthetic effect on clothes, dishes, and pipes. The average pH for surface water is 6.5-8.5. Normal groundwater is 6-8.5. If you go too far in either direction, higher or lower, you’ll likely see some physical evidence of it. 
Water with a pH of less than 6.5 or so is acidic and often contains heavy metals such as iron, manganese, copper, lead, and zinc. Obviously, you don’t want to drink too much of these because of the damage that these metals can do to your health. We’ll discuss that in a bit. 
Acidic water is corrosive and can damage pipes, stain laundry and appliances with a blue-green tint, and leave a buildup on dishes. It may also taste metallic. You may remember what the water tasted like coming out of the water hose when you were a kid; that’s similar to what acidic water may taste like. 
The way that you balance it is by adding a neutralizer such as soda ash (sodium carbonate). 
Water with a pH higher than 7 is considered basic or alkaline, though it’s not really outside the realm of “normal” until it’s higher than 8 or 8.5. 
Alkaline water is often high in calcium and will leave whitish scaly deposits on your dishes, utensils, tubs, and appliances and can clog your pipes. It also tastes a bit bitter, especially when you make your morning Joe, and can make it hard to get a lather out of soaps. 
Health Risks Associated with Water pH 
I’ve written content for the holistic health and medical fields for a long time, and though there’s a certain following that says that water pH can change the pH of your body, there’s simply not enough evidence to corroborate that. Your body does a dang good job of balancing itself and saying that water pH can alter your blood pH is a stretch. 
Also, pH levels, in and of themselves, do not indicate the safety of water. For instance, arsenic may be present but not significantly affect the pH. 
However, pH can be a good indicator that there are toxic substances such as heavy metals in your water because “soft” water (water with a low pH), can leach metal ions out of soil and pipes. For example, lead is never a good thing, and a low pH is an indicator that your water may contain lead or other poisonous metals. 
On the flip side, calcium found in water with an alkaline pH can balance some of this out. It can make some heavy metals such as lead, copper, and zinc less toxic. 
Calcium can strengthen pipes by lining them with a protective coating, but it can also clog them if it builds up too much. You’ve probably heard the term, “hard water.” That refers to water with a high pH, because of the build-ups. In limed soil, calcium can immobilize iron and cause a shortage even if there’s plenty of iron in the soil. 
As you can see, the primary health concern when it comes to the pH of drinking water is consuming heavy metals. The important thing to remember is that pH is only one measure of water safely. It doesn’t necessarily tell you what other toxins such as fertilizers, fungicides, and other chemicals are in there. 
The Effects of Water pH on Soil 
The pH of water plays a much bigger role in other ways, though. The two biggest areas may be in how it affects soil and aquatic life. As we’ve already discussed, the calcium that’s typically found in alkaline water can affect how your plants absorb essential minerals such as zinc and iron. 
Again, pH isn’t the only factor; some fish that can survive in water with a pH as low as 4.7 will die at a pH of 5.5 if the water contains just a tick too much iron. PH isn’t everything, but it’s a good indicator. 
PH is important to soil because some plants prefer an acidic soil and some prefer an alkaline soil. Planting in the correct soil will increase plant health and growth, and therefore yield. If you’re going to plant it, you may as well get as much bang for your buck as possible! 
PH affects everything from the levels and types of good and bad bacteria in the soil to the texture of the soil itself. For instance, clay that is in the optimal range or 5.5-7 is granular and easy to work with. If it’s overly acidic or alkaline, it becomes sticky and hard to work with. 
Most plants thrive in neutral or almost-neutral soils, but there are some that love acidic soil. These include radishes, blueberries, cranberries, sweet potatoes, parsley, peppers of all sorts, and rhubarb. The majority of plants can tolerate a mildly-acidic soil, but they’re much less tolerant to alkaline conditions. 
This is because minerals dissolve better in acidic soil. This sounds like a good thing, but only to a certain degree. A pH of about 5.5 is about as low as any plant will tolerate because below that, the concentration of metal ions, especially aluminum, manganese, and iron, become so high that they can inhibit plant growth. Phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium may also be less available. 
Following the pattern, you may guess that alkaline soils inhibit the release of minerals and nutrients, which is why plants can’t tolerate those conditions. 
It’s important to test your soil and know your plants. The goal isn’t so much to achieve a certain pH as it is to make sure that the soil acidity is such that there aren’t any toxic metals and the nutrient availability is maximized. In other words, no poison, plenty of nutrients! 
If your soil is too acidic, you can neutralize it a bit using lime. Alkaline soils, on the other hand, aren’t as easy to adjust. Sometimes you can add sulfur or acid-forming fertilizers, but it’s probably easier just to add nutrients via fertilizer and compost. 
Note that pH isn’t everything. Many sands have a great pH for growth but contain practically zero nutrients. That’s OK – you can always add nutrients . 
Importance of pH in Streams 
Now THIS is where water pH makes a real difference. We’ve already discussed how acidic water induces the release of minerals and we know that many of those minerals are toxic in high levels. 
When the pH of water becomes too acidic due to contamination by acid rain or run-off that contains fertilizers or other acidic chemicals, it can be catastrophic to aquatic life. 
Many plants and aquatic creatures are adapted to survive in a specific pH and can’t tolerate more than just a minuscule change. 
Not only does the acid affect the nutrients in the water, it can also cause the same physical problems to fish and plants that they cause to your drains and pipes. 
Heavy metals can accumulate on gills and even cause deformities on young, growing fish. The same idea goes for plants that grow in the water, except they’re affected by the pH in the soil as well as the water. 
The biggest issue here isn’t that one fish or one plant can’t tolerate a change; everything that eats that fish or plant, or is eaten by that fish, is affected as well. Aquatic systems are delicate and even a small change can cause huge ripples. 
As you can see, pH is just a number; it’s the changes that accompany that number that can cause problems or bring joy and growth. Keep an eye on the pH of your soil because it can change! 
How to Measure pH 
There are simple pH strips that you can buy at a pool store which use color strips to tell you what the pH of the water or soil is. If you’d rather do it the natural way, which is the way we usually prefer to do things, you have a couple of choices. 
The first way is to gather 1 cup of soil (total) from a few different parts of your garden. Add a couple spoonfuls to 2 separate containers, then add 1/2 cup vinegar to the soil in one container. If it fizzes, your soil is alkaline, with a pH between 7 and 8. If it doesn’t, add 1/2 cup baking soda to the other cup. If it fizzes, you have acidic soil. It’s a good guess that the pH is somewhere between 5 and 6. If it doesn’t fizz either time, you have neutral soil – congrats! 
The second way to test pH – and this works for soil and water – is to use a red cabbage. Yep, that’s right. Simmer 1 cup of red cabbage in two cups of distilled water for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let it steep for another 30 minutes or so. 
To test your soil, place a couple of spoonfuls of your soil to a couple of containers, like you did before. It would be good this time around if the containers are clear. Strain the cabbage, keeping the water. It will be a purply-blue color and has a pH of seven – completely neutral. 
Add 1/4 cup or so of cabbage water to each cup, stir it up, and let it sit for 30 minutes. If the water turns pink, your soil is acidic. If it’s blue/green, your soil is alkaline. Video first seen on Carl Nelson . 
To test your water, simply substitute water for the soil. The same colors apply. 
Now that you know a bit more about how and why pH makes a difference with your water and soil, try the tests. If you have something to add about pH, please feel free to comment in the section below.

1551,Chinese Steadily Buying U.S. Entertainment Businesses,"Email 
Flush with money from selling inexpensive goods (made by what is in effect slave labor) in the American market, the Chinese communists are continuing their shopping spree by buying up businesses connected with the U.S. entertainment industry. The New American recently reported on the Chinese purchase of AMC (which owns hundreds of movie theaters in the United States) and the desire of a high-ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party to buy an American movie studio. 
Now, the Chinese firm Wanda, which is owned by the Chinese Communist government, has bought Dick Clark Productions for about $1 billion. 
Begun in 1957 by the famed host of American Bandstand who died in 2012, Dick Clark Productions produces the Golden Globe Awards, the American Music Awards, and Billboard Music Awards. 
Wanda is run by Wang Jianlin, who is considered China’s wealthiest man and is a top figure in the ruling oligarchy of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Xiaoma Lu, the CEO of Wanda Investment, stated, “We are excited to partner with such an iconic company and look forward to supporting the management team as they continue to build the company and expand upon its enormous legacy.” 
Wang assured that after the purchase business will continue as usual, with the new owners retaining the current executives, including Chairman Peter Guber, CEO Allen Shapiro, and President Michael Mahan. Present owner Todd Boehly will remain as an advisor to Wanda. 
Another previous Wanda buy was $3.5 billion for Legendary Entertainment, the studio that produced Pacific Rim , Warcraft , and the soon-to-be released The Great Wall , starring Matt Damon. 
The moves by Wang and the Chinese government into the U.S. entertainment industry have raised some concern in Congress. In September, 16 members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote a letter to the U.S. Government Accountability Office asking for them to scrutinize Chinese purchases of American entertainment companies as a national security concern. The letter mentioned recent Chinese efforts to “censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media.” 
Because of the sheer size of the Chinese movie market, among other reasons, the U.S. industry has already shown extreme caution not to offend the communist giant. For example, when the 1980s movie Red Dawn was recently re-made, the new script originally called for the invaders to be Chinese communists (rather than Russian communists as in the original movie) attempting to take over America. After the film had already been made, MGM became concerned enough about the Chinese reaction to recast the invaders as North Koreans . One supposes there aren’t many moviegoers in North Korea. 
And that was before Wanda took over AMC. 
The propaganda opportunities for Wanda and the Chinese communists in the motion picture and television industries far surpass any such possibilities to be advanced by growing wheat, making cars, or selling cheap goods at American retail stores. For many people, once they have viewed an event on the silver screen, or heard someone say something in a movie theater, or even on television, it becomes “reality” for them. 
Writing in the communist newspaper The Daily Worker in 1925, Will Muezenberg explained the importance of the movie industry in advancing the goals of the communist world. Muezenberg, an agent of the Comintern (created to spread communist ideology and promote Soviet interests worldwide) stated, “One of the most pressing tasks confronting the Communist Party in the field of propaganda is the conquest of this extremely important propaganda unit [the movies], until now the monopoly of the ruling class. We must wrest it from them and turn it against them.”

1552,The 5 Types of Trump-Averse Republicans - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   His unrelenting stream of incendiary remarks have left horrified congressional Republicans divided into five loose categories about the problem that is Donald J. Trump. There are the fast walkers  —   like Senator Patrick J. Toomey, the endangered Republican from Pennsylvania  —   who try to run briskly away from questions about the party’s presumed nominee for president. Mr. Toomey  —   never the most loquacious lawmaker  —   has mastered the art of twisting his face into a grimace and racing away from reporters before they can ask him about Mr. Trump’s latest statements about instituting a ban on Muslim immigration. Another senator in a tight   bid, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, also tries to avoid talking about Mr. Trump, whom she supports, as she makes her way through the halls of Congress. (To be in this category, it is very useful to have Ms. Ayotte’s long legs.) Then there are lawmakers best described as grumps, like Senator John McCain of Arizona, who appears decidedly downbeat about his party, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who offered early support to Mr. Trump’s campaign but said this week, “I don’t know that I really have a lot to say,” adding that he had tried to advise Mr. Trump and was “discouraged by the results. ” Add to that list Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, who has struggled to find a single policy position he shares with Mr. Trump. Another group are doing “the McConnell,” taking a cue from their majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  —   as well a number of House members  —   rotely repeat that they are supporting Mr. Trump, and refuse to engage on his specific statements most days. Mr. McConnell preemptively cuts off discussion by saying things like, “I’m not going to be commenting on the presidential candidates today. ” A smaller group are the free speakers, including Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, who openly heap scorn on Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake called Mr. Trump’s remarks suggesting that President Obama somehow had inside information about the Orlando massacre “particularly disgusting,” and, like Mr. Graham, said he would not be voting for him. The final category is the       . “Am I offended sometimes at the comments? Yes I am,” said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina. “However, what offends me more are Hillary Clinton’s actions. ” Then there is Speaker Paul D. Ryan. He is perhaps the most prominent critic of Mr. Trump on his proposed Muslim ban, but has nonetheless fully endorsed him. That is a category of one. Mr. Trump has created a feedback loop in which he says increasingly outrageous and at times incoherent things about national security, immigration and other issues and Republicans are forced to answer for it. On Wednesday during a rally in Atlanta, Mr. Trump addressed Republican criticism by basically telling lawmakers to shut up. “Don’t talk. Please, be quiet,” he said. “Just be quiet, to the leaders, because they have to get tougher, they have to get sharper, they have to get smarter, and we have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself. ” While it is not clear how much support Mr. Trump is actually losing  —   House Republicans continue to hide behind Mr. Ryan’s embrace of the live wire as proof of their party unity  —   it is clear that he is not gaining support either. His top surrogates remain Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Representative Lee Zeldin of New York, with no sign of newcomers to the list. The toxic combination of Mr. Trump’s statements and his falling poll numbers has given signs of life to the Never Trump movement, whose members cling to the hope that they can prevent Mr. Trump from becoming the nominee next month. “If Donald Trump continues to conduct himself in a way that’s unbecoming of a nominee, let alone a president,” said Rory Cooper, a senior adviser to the #NeverTrump PAC, “then delegates and party leaders in Cleveland should be empowered to open the convention, just as Democrats are able to do. If there is no such mechanism, then you are essentially saying there is no unacceptable line Trump can cross. ” However, there is a big division among   Republicans over whether a change in convention rules, which would essentially unbind delegates from the candidate, or a   option is the best way to go. Many Republicans, even those who appear in need of a box of chocolates or a bourbon to get through each day of Mr. Trump’s remarks, oppose a rules changes. “That’s like saying in baseball that you’re a run behind and now you want to add three innings,” said Mr. Coats, after conceding that the process has been a slog. Representative Robert Dold, an Illinois Republican who has long been outspoken against Mr. Trump, said the will of the voters ought to be respected, even as he openly derides Mr. Trump. “We’ve been explicit,” he said. “We are not supporting Donald Trump. ” Mr. Dold, like some other Republicans, said he would likely write in a candidate’s name. Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, who straddles the line of the free speaker and    camps, has a more novel strategy. “I don’t listen to him and never have,” Mr. Young said. “I may vote for myself. ”",0
1553,Missing California Mother Found Safe On Thanksgiving Day,"Missing California Mother Found Safe On Thanksgiving Day 3.8K shares by Ike Mclean / November 25, 2016 / LIFE / 
A 34-year-old mother of two who vanished on November 2 while out jogging near her home in Northern California has been found alive and safe, the Shasta County Sheriff’s Department said Thursday. 
Sherri Papini reappeared on Thanksgiving morning approximately 150 miles away from her house after she flagged down a car on I-5 near Sacramento. 
“She is safe, in stable condition, and receiving medical clearance at an undisclosed hospital. She has been reunited with her husband,” said Sheriff Tom Bosenko. 
Police are now actively searching for two Hispanic women armed with handguns and a dark SUV in connection to the kidnapping. There is no known motive in the case, authorities said on Thursday. 
An iPhone, a pair of earbuds and a few strands of what was believed to be her hair were the only leads found on a jogging trail close to the Papini’s home when she went missing, CNN reported. 
Sherri’s husband Keith noticed something was wrong when he arrived home, things were quiet, and his wife and two kids were not there. 
“On normal days, I would open the door and my family comes, runs and gives me a hug,” he told KRCR-TV . 
Keith called the day care center they leave their children at and was told his 2 and 4 year old kids were not picked up yet. He then tracked his wife’s Iphone, found it was down the street, and told the news station “That’s when I knew she had been taken or abducted, in my opinion.” 
An anonymous donor had offered a $50,000 ransom to her captor for her safe return. The amount was raised to $100,000 and then withdrawn a day before she reappeared, DailyMail reported.

1554,"Man’s Collapsed Driveway Reveals Hole & Ladder, Shocked When He Goes Down","Share This 
A man was pulling out of his driveway when his wheel suddenly got stuck. Initially, he thought he had accidentally driven up on his flower bed, but once he took a closer look, he realized there was a hole in the ground. There was also a ladder in the hole, but nothing could have prepared him for what he’d find when he daringly went down. 
Simon Marks was pulling out of his driveway in Luton, England, when he thought he had accidentally driven into one of his flowerbeds. When he got out to inspect the damage to the flowers, he quickly realized that he had been mistaken. He hadn’t driven onto his flower bed at all. Instead, there was a gaping hole in his driveway. 
Even more unbelievable than the sudden hole that appeared, he also saw that there was a ladder in the hole, where the driveway collapsed. Wanting to know what the odd discovery was all about, he bravely took a look and was shocked to find a two-roomed shelter. Simon Marks next to the air raid shelter (Source: The Sun ) 
“This massive hole appeared. I thought it was a sinkhole or a badly constructed garden,” Simon explained, according to The Sun . “I was just terrified the whole house was going to vanish. I took some pictures and sent them to my dad. When I moved a few of the slabs out of the way, I found a ladder. I got my selfie stick and put it down the hole where I saw two rooms.” 
When his dad Gerald saw the pictures, he instantly knew what it was – an air raid shelter. After looking on the internet for some more information, Simon and his father learned that there were quite a few of these bomb shelters in the area and that this particular one had probably been built after a German bomb landed nearby during World War II. Bottles and newspapers were found inside 
“The previous owner must have known it was there, and when he built the house and put a garden in, he must have filled it in,” he explained. “He clearly wasn’t very worried about it and it just sat there until the hatch fell through. I think it’s great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it’s structurally sound.” 
The shelter is nearly 10 feet deep and was full of mud. As Simon and Gerald began excavating the shelter with buckets, they found various items along with glass bottles and old newspapers. “It’s incredible to think it has all been made by hand,” Simon admitted. “It’s part of our history so it should be kept.” 
This just goes to prove that you never know when you’ll accidentally stumble on a piece of history hidden in your own backyard or your driveway. I can guarantee that Simon had no idea that his property held a treasure of the past – so you never know what you might stumble on someday and what it could reveal about the history in your area.",0
1555,Trump Meets Theresa May of Britain as He Weighs Lifting Russia Sanctions - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump plans to open a dialogue with Russia on Saturday that could lead to lifting American sanctions, even as Britain’s visiting prime minister and leading senators from his own party urged him not to let up the pressure on the Kremlin until it reverses its armed intervention in Ukraine. In what will be their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office, he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intended to talk by telephone on Saturday about areas of possible cooperation, particularly in fighting terrorism in the Middle East, a collaboration that would represent a significant turnabout from years of friction between the two countries. At the direction of the White House, American officials in recent days have been preparing memos outlining possible common ground, including the prospect of removing some or all of the sanctions imposed by former President Barack Obama, according to officials briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump has suggested lifting the punitive measures in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and Russian cooperation in fighting the Islamic State. Asked about sanctions on Friday, Mr. Trump played down the possibility of quick action, but did not rule it out. “As for sanctions, very early to be talking about that,” Mr. Trump said Friday at a White House news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. “But we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. ” As for Mr. Putin, he offered a far more distant assessment after months of praising the Russian president for his leadership. “I don’t know the gentleman,” Mr. Trump said. “I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That’s possible, and it’s also possible that we won’t. We will see what happens. ” Standing at Mr. Trump’s side, Mrs. May warned against easing sanctions unless Russia abides by a peace settlement for Ukraine negotiated in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. “We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk Agreement fully implemented, and we’ve been continuing to argue that inside the European Union,” she said. Any talk of lifting sanctions is all but certain to spark the first serious conflagration between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans, who have largely given the president a pass on myriad policy areas where they disagree. Republican lawmakers have been bracing for Mr. Trump to make this move, and their concerns deepened Friday when his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, said in an interview that removing sanctions was under consideration. Senator John McCain of Arizona warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting sanctions and vowed to push legislation reinstating them if he does, a measure that already has strong bipartisan support, including from Republicans like Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who has largely shunned confrontation with Mr. Trump, has been a longstanding opponent of lifting sanctions, a position he forcefully reiterated on Friday. In a scathing statement against Mr. Putin, Mr. McCain cataloged all of Russia’s controversial actions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere and said it could not be trusted as a partner. “President Trump should remember this when he speaks to Vladimir Putin,” Mr. McCain said. “He should remember that the man on the other end of the line is a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn. For our commander in chief to think otherwise would be naïve and dangerous. ” Mr. Portman concurred, saying in a statement, “We must stand by our allies in the region, including Ukraine. ” Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mrs. May was his first with a visiting foreign leader since taking office with a promise to pursue an “America First” foreign policy. For Mr. Trump, it was a debut on the world stage that took on additional meaning after a scheduled White House visit by Mexico’s president next week fell apart in a dispute over the border wall Mr. Trump wants to build. Mr. Trump appeared comfortable and confident with Mrs. May standing to his right. He offered a brief opening statement that referred twice to the “special relationship” between the two countries, a phrase Britons take seriously. He offered crisp answers, in contrast to Mr. Obama, who tended to talk at length. While Mr. Trump did not demonstrate detailed policy knowledge, he went out of his way to emphasize commonalities with Mrs. May. He also tried to reassure Europeans who view him with deep skepticism. When a British reporter referred to him as a “brash TV extrovert,” Mr. Trump replied, “Actually, I’m not as brash as you might think. ” Mrs. May, eager to forge a relationship with him akin to Margaret Thatcher’s alliance with Ronald Reagan, reciprocated the warm sentiments, praising his “stunning election victory” and conveying an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II for the president to make a state visit, which he accepted. Addressing one area of disagreement, Mrs. May said that the president had privately expressed his support for NATO, despite past comments disparaging the alliance as “obsolete. ” “Mr. President,” she said, “I think you said, you confirmed that you’re 100 percent behind NATO. ” Mr. Trump embraced the decision by British voters to exit the European Union, a referendum known as “Brexit” that he and others have seen as a precursor to his own election. “I think Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” he said. “I think when it irons out, you’re going to have your identity and you’re going to have the people that you want in your country. ” Mr. Trump and Mrs. May talked about negotiating a new   agreement between the two countries. Ms. May is not the only European leader worried about Mr. Trump’s blossoming friendship with Russia, which United States intelligence agencies have concluded hacked Democratic email accounts to influence the American election last year. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been a leading voice of keeping the pressure on the Kremlin, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to talk with her by telephone, too. The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russian officials and companies, mainly in response to the seizure and annexation of Crimea and the separatist war fomented in eastern Ukraine. Before leaving office, Mr. Obama imposed additional sanctions in response to the Russian election hacking. In an interview with The Times of London shortly before taking office, Mr. Trump suggested a bargain that would ease sanctions on Russia in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State. One topic that may come up on Saturday’s call is the fate of Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012. Mr. Trump may ask Mr. Putin for help in pressuring Russia’s ally, President Bashar   of Syria, to release Mr. Tice, according to an official briefed on the matter. Syria has never acknowledged holding him, but Mr. Trump has considered dropping support for the Syrian opposition.",0
1556,Applications Open For the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant - Breitbart,"Applications for the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant, a college tuition grant created by Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO exclusively for white men, are now being accepted.[  “The Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant, launched by Milo Yiannopoulos and funded by Milo and private donors to provide college funding assistance to white males, is pleased to announce that applications for its pilot program are now being accepted to receive grants of $2, 500,” announced the grant in a post on Tuesday. “The application period will close on February 14th, 2017, and recipients will be announced on March 31st, 2017. Grant payments will be made directly to the recipient’s college or university immediately pending IRS approval. ” As well as announcing the acceptance of applications, MILO has also hired a new Selection Committee Chairman, Janet Bloomfield, to overview the applications which are to students who are “attending or accepted to a two year community college or a four year college or university. ” “My initiative to help white men further their education is now accepting applications. We’ve given it the brilliant name of the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant,” declared MILO on stage during his show at Cal Poly State University on Tuesday. “No this isn’t a joke. ” “It started as a joke, but if you’re a women, or you’re black  …     If you’re disabled, or you’re Muslim, or a refugee  …     If you identify as an attack helicopter, you can get free money,” he continued. “But the facts say that actually it is young white boys who are educationally underprivileged. As educationally underprivileged as many other groups. So it did start as a joke, but nobody can resist the truth wrapped in a good joke, and there’s nothing better than doing good while annoying the left. It is my favorite thing. ” “So I, and a number of private donors, have created this thing  …     My goal is to help more men, no matter their major or political opinions, reach their educational goals. You can even major in gender studies, I don’t care,” MILO joked. “Now although it took longer than I anticipated to set up the privilege grant, I’m happy we’re now well on our way to help young men achieve their dreams. I hope everyone in the room applies, I hope everyone watching at home applies. ” “Men, as you may know, make up just 43% of America’s 20. 5 million college students,” explained MILO in conclusion. “Yet another way in which the feminist consensus about the oppressive patriarchy simply doesn’t bear any relation to the facts. And that number’s getting smaller. So it’s all very well for social justice warriors and progressives to cry and scream and talk about ‘changing things and making a difference and standing up,’ but then there are those of us who are actually doing something for, which now in higher education, is a minority group. ” You can apply for the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant here.

1557,"Gary Johnson Goes Zombie, Tries to Bite Reporters","
Everybody always knew Gary Johnson is kind of crazy but what he just did to a Guardian reporter who interviewed him a few days ago, may cause you to pee yourself laughing!
Well he didn’t really try to bite the reporter, the title its more of a joke to amplify what you are about to see next but be warned, first empty your bladder!
If everyone voting for Gary Johnson saw this video, I promise you they would ALL change their mind. The man is a zombie, literally, watch his facial expressions.
I have honestly NEVER seen someone flip out like this. The first 20 seconds Gary Johnson has his neck veins inflated and all angered up, screams like a zombie, then, he admits to the reporter that he’s an idiot:
“Well I’m an idiot, you know?? Really! I’m the dumbest guy you ever met in your whole life!”
Paul Lewis, the reporter looks stunned and for a while there, doesn’t know how to react to his open admission of being a dumb idiot, but finally the reporter snaps out of it and says “I’m trying to work out if that’s sarcasm.”
Guess what Gary Johnson said… “It is… I hope it’s sarcasm”. So he’s not sure if he’s really a dumb idiot or he is just being sarcastic. He hopes… then he says “How do you respond when you’re being called a dummy? I’m not a dummy, I’m n t! And yeah I’m human!” Are you sure there Gary? Or you’re just hoping again? Well that’s it! That’s how you answer when someone calls you a dummy: “I’m not a dummy, I’m n t! And yeah I’m human!” Paul Lewis looks stunned as if he was expecting a more complex answer…
Then for a few minutes or so Gary Johnson is cordial, even polite and even exposes Utah’s Evan McMullin as a Hillary Clinton shill, who has recently officially endorsed Hillary Clinton and admitted that he’s just a shill . Paul Lewis asked Gary why is he doing so poorly in the pools. Gary insisted that he’s doing fantastic and that he is at 24% in New Mexico.
The reporter then asked Gary, “Then why is Evan McMullin currently tied with Clinton and Trump in Utah?” Gary Johnson responded: “Well he’s from Utah, he’s on the ballot in 11 states, so he can’t win the presidency, ummm he’s a Utahan. He’s ensuring that Hillary Clinton will win Utah and you know what? He is what he is, and you know I hold no grudge on anyone for entering the race… Look you ask me, I’m not labeling it spoiler, I’m just telling you what I think the reality is.”
Then SUDDENLY out of NOWHERE, he flips and goes ABSOLUTELY BATS#IT CRAZY AGAIN when he’s asked about taxes.
Watch MENTALLY ILL Gary Johnson EXPLODE! But don’t go, scroll down to laugh even harder!

We’ve just discovered that taking screenshots of Gary Johnson while he’s in crazy mode and at the right moment is an art! Here’s a couple of perfectly timed screenshots for you:

1558,Is FBI investigation a ploy to divert attention from WikiLeaks dumps?,"Print 
Hmm, how about that? Eleven days before the game-changing 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James Comey announces that his agency is reopening the criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
All of the expected angst and apoplexy from the Left come gushing out. An anti-Trump PAC issues a complaint against the FBI for interfering with the eletoral process . Better still, the Clinton campaign issues a statement via — of all people — its chairman, John Podesta. In it, Podesta accuses Comey of bending to presure brought by “Donald Trump and his Republican allies” regarding the director’s initial determination that no indictment against the former secretary of state should be brought. 
Podesta’s prepared remarks also paraphrase Comey’s declaration in July that “no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this,” which at the time prompted much head-scratching since he also affirmed that Clinton had indeed sent and received classified information using her non-secured private email account . 
Call me a conspiracy theorist if you like — my colleague Benny Huang probably would — but I have to wonder whether all this is too convenient. Could we be witnessing a calculated plan to divert attention from the WikiLeaks emails, which have been hurting the Democratic candidate’s standing in the polls? This development might even gain some sympathy for Hillary Clinton, who has long maintained the vast right-wing conspiracy — which, nota bene, includes James Comey — has it out for the Clintons. 
Or better yet, suppose that the FBI does put a rush on its investigation, as Clinton herself has now demanded, and determines for a second time that there are no grounds for an indictment. 
All the while, the press and impressionable voters would be focused on this probe. Envelope, please !",0

1560,The Director of ‘Toni Erdmann’ Savors Her Moment at Cannes - The New York Times,"CANNES, France  —   Filmmakers find inspiration in love, nature, faith, trauma, other people, other movies. The German director Maren Ade discovered a muse for her latest, the sensational “Toni Erdmann”  —   a critical favorite at the 69th Cannes Film Festival  —   in an American comic who died in 1984: “I fell in love with Andy Kaufman. ” Maren Ade (pronounced    ) also fell for Kaufman’s most outrageous creation, the belligerent insult comic Tony Clifton, whose first name she borrowed for the title character of her new movie. Toni is the fabrication of Winfried (Peter Simonischek) a music teacher who uses this outsize persona to infiltrate the life of his only child, Ines (Sandra Hüller) a corporate strategist on assignment in Bucharest. Toni emerges after Winfried pays a brief, awkward visit to Ines, who barely makes time for her father. Exit Winfried, enter Toni, a lout with a wolfish leer, a fright wig and false teeth who claims to be a “consultant and coach” for the chief executive of Ines’s company. “Toni Erdmann” quickly lifted the festival mood and Ms. Ade’s international profile, though it was shut out on awards night. “It’s nice and weird at the same time,” she said of the attention the day after her movie’s first press screening. While here, she racked up 30 hours of interviews with 60 journalists from more than 15 countries. Seated on a terrace in the festival headquarters overlooking a   marina, she seemed remarkably at ease, especially given that she had been working on the movie days before the festival opened. “It was very, very crazy to just get it here. ” We met again a few days later in a small Italian restaurant. She was at once alert and relaxed, although also hoarse, either from all the interviews or, she thought, tending to her   . She had brought both her sons  —   the other is 6 months old  —   along with her partner and assorted grandparents. That afternoon, she and her family planned to take a boat to a nearby island for a break before heading to a friend’s house. Sipping warm milk with honey to soothe her throat, and speaking in English, she seemed pleased by the praise, if somewhat exasperated that the movie had been described as arriving out of the blue. “In your own life,” Ms. Ade said, “nothing is out of the blue. ” Some of this surprise doubtless stems from the movie’s comedy, a quality not always associated with German cinema, especially in a temple of seriousness like Cannes. In addition, until now, Ms. Ade, 39, has been largely known only inside rarefied cinephile circles and it has been seven years since her last feature, “Everyone Else. ” Since then, she has produced movies and had her children she was pregnant with one son while writing “Toni Erdmann” and pregnant with the second while working on it in postproduction. As she once put it, “I became a mother, which is also like making one film at least. ” The textured realism in “Toni Erdmann” also needed time. “It took long to develop the characters and to really find that story,” Ms. Ade said. “It came step by step, going deeper and deeper into the game they’re playing. ” As a character, Toni enables Winfried to insinuate himself into Ines’s   life. He barges into her workplace and social events, becoming a classic trickster, that mischievous, subversive figure who upends the status quo. Lewis Hyde, a scholar of tricksters, argues that they emerge from need: “There are large, devouring forces in this world, and that trickster’s intelligence arose not just to feed himself but to outwit these other eaters. ” With a demented smile and oversize teeth, Toni the trickster sets out to sabotage the forces devouring his daughter. Most obviously, “Toni Erdmann” is a   story, if one thankfully without the familiar therapeutic platitudes and psychological tidiness. Ms. Ade had been interested in the   dynamic “for a long time,” she said. “I found out that during writing it’s difficult to escape your own family. ” The inspiration for Toni’s teeth came from a gag set she was given at a premiere of “Austin Powers” when she was 20 and working for a production house. She gave the teeth to her father, who she knew would make good use of them, and together they, with Andy Kaufman and Tony Clifton, became part of her exploration of role playing. “Toni Erdmann” is only Ms. Ade’s third feature, after “The Forest for the Trees” (2003) and “Everyone Else,” which shared the Silver Bear (second place) at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival. Ms. Ade began making amateur movies with a camcorder when she was a teenager and attended the University of Television and Film Munich. There, she and another student, Janine Jackowski, founded Komplizen Film, which produces Ms. Ade’s work along with those of other   names like Miguel Gomes. (A third partner, Jonas Dornbach, joined Komplizen in 2010.) Having her own company, Ms. Ade said, gives her the freedom she wants  —   and the control she seems to like  —   including the luxury to rehearse on location. “Everything had to come out of the characters,” Ms. Ade said. “Maybe that’s also why the film needs time. ” The movie runs a comfortable, perfectly calibrated two hours and 42 minutes, although she did try to shorten it. “I went back into the editing room three weeks after giving birth, because I wanted to be sure that it’s the right length. ” But when she tried to cut it, she felt the movie lost its complexity. It makes sense. Ms. Ade is a pointillist, and over the span of “Toni Erdmann,” you don’t only watch Ines and Winfried, you also learn to read their looks, to inhabit their silences and to recognize the weight of their seemingly meaningless moments. Last November, after her second son was born, Ms. Ade sat down with her   and asked them to be honest about whether the film had a shot at being selected for Cannes. It’s an index of this event’s significance to a filmmaker like Ms. Ade, whose importance isn’t measured in box office numbers, that she powered ahead to finish the movie by the festival’s deadline. Her persistence and work paid off, because long after this year’s juries have disbanded and the world has forgotten who won this year’s awards, the 2016 edition will best be remembered as the year Ms. Ade gave us “Toni Erdmann,” a work of great beauty, great feeling and great cinema.",0
1561,’Apocalypse Now’ Game Director: We’re Making a Game for ’The 45 Other States’ Hollywood Doesn’t Care About - Breitbart,"Montgomery Markland wants to adapt one of the most storied American movies of all time, Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, into a video game that the team describes as “like Fallout: New Vegas on acid in Vietnam. ”[Markland has been in the trenches of the gaming industry for a decade, starting with level design for developer Obsidian Entertainment. He’s run his own game studio and recently acted as a producer on both Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera  —   two widely acclaimed   games.  I recently had the opportunity to speak with Markland about the project, his passion for the source material, and the ways he wants to make Apocalypse Now different from anything the gaming landscape has ever seen.  Would you like to introduce yourself to our readers? My name is Montgomery Markland, and we’re making an Apocalypse Now video game, and it’s going to be for the Xbox and the PlayStation and the PC  —   and Mac and Linux if you play on that. One of the reasons we’re doing it is to disrupt the lethargic and stolid game and movie industries that have calcified over the past ten or fifteen years. It used to be that great movies were made in this town, and Apocalypse Now was one of them. Apocalypse Now is still the number 49th movie on IMDB out of hundreds of thousands of movies. And it was made 40 years ago. And there’s a reason for that. And, like I was chatting with you just a second ago, I’m just a guy from Dallas, Texas, born in Ft. Worth, went to the University of Texas, and one day I got it into my head that I would go make video games and movies out here in Hollywood. And so, my path out here has been very different than the normal path  —   though I don’t think there is a traditional or normal path for anybody that ends up getting to do creative things in the game and film industry  —   but I came out here with the intention to disrupt things from the very beginning. And, making an Apocalypse Now game is part of that. When American Zoetrope decided to make a game out of Apocalypse Now, they asked people for pitches, and every single big game company came in and pitched the same thing: They pitched it as a shooter in Vietnam. “It’ll be great, it’ll be easy, it’ll be profitable. We’ll reskin our existing shooter for Vietnam and ship out an Apocalypse Now version. ” And American Zoetrope wasn’t interested in that. When myself and Lawrence Liberty, the executive producer, who is also the executive producer on Fallout: New Vegas, got the opportunity to pitch, the first thing I did was I went back and  —   I had already seen the movie probably a dozen times  —   but I went back and watched it a dozen more times, because in any great endeavor, you have to respect and learn from the traditions of your culture. Apocalypse Now is based on an 80 or     —   depending on where you count from  —   novella called Heart of Darkness, written by Joseph Conrad and published in 1899. And John Milius wrote the screenplay in 1969, and the movie came out in 1979. Joseph Conrad wrote Heart of Darkness and it’s about a lot of things. It’s about a personal journey, more than anything, and that’s why I think Apocalypse Now resonates to this day, because everybody has their own “journey upriver. ” Absolutely. And obstacles along the way that are unanticipated, and it’s more about the choices you make as you go up river, than it is about some theoretical end goal, or final chapter. So, both of these great works of art  —   Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now  —   two of the greatest works of art from Western civilization  —   are both inspired by something that’s 3000 years old: Homer’s The Odyssey, which tells the story of Odysseus. That story started by people sitting around campfires and telling the story orally, probably originally a lot of them who had actually been in the Trojan War, and they told a story about a guy they had heard about, who was stuck on a ship getting back home for a decade. And the story grew and grew and grew, and millions of people probably, or at least hundreds of thousands, retold it over thousands of years. And then finally it got written down over and over again and changed and rewritten I’m sure a thousand times, so it’s completely different now than whatever it was 3000 years ago. But it has the same core fundamental elements. And, so what started out as thousand of people telling a story around a campfire, and eventually became Apocalypse Now, we view our job as to just reverse that 3000 year process and give millions of people a chance to tell their own version of Apocalypse Now around a modern version of a campfire, which is your computer screen. That has got to be one of the best pitches for a game I’ve heard  —   I’m not surprised that American Zoetrope wanted it. Thank you.  Part of what has interested me so much about this project is that Apocalypse Now is both a great war movie and a great movie about humanity. An internal war, if you will. It’s a haunting portrayal of a man’s journey through a horrifying world. But let’s get back to your personal journey, specifically. How did you end up here, making this game? Yeah. I was in law school in Dallas, at Southern Methodist University, and one day I decided I didn’t want to be a lawyer. I played poker pretty regularly and pretty well, and something that I believe Doyle Brunson said in one of the great books on poker was, “Money on the table is no longer yours. ” So, when I decided I didn’t want to be a lawyer, I went and made an independent video game  —   or a “mod”  —   for Neverwinter Nights. We had great success in making it, so much so that Lawrence Liberty at Atari, the head of product development there in NY, wanted to turn our little independent project in Dallas into an expansion pack for Neverwinter Nights, the game that we were making it for. Which was extraordinarily lucky and rare. And what kicked all of this whole process off, that didn’t quite happen. Hasbro decided  —   and this is in 2006 I think, or 2007  —   so a decade ago, Hasbro decided that Planescape Torment was not a great world for Dungeons  Dragons anymore, which ended up being an ironic decision because in 2014 inXile Entertainment, another company I worked with, raised five million dollars for exactly that. So, Larry went to be the executive producer on a video game based on the Alien and Aliens movies, I and II, with Obsidian Entertainment in Orange County. So, instead of getting the expansion pack going with Atari, he ended up getting me on board as a designer and producer on the Aliens game with Josh Sawyer and about half the team that’s working on Apocalypse Now, including Rob Auten, our head writer, who at the time was in charge of video games for 20th Century Fox. So, Rob, Larry and I worked together on Aliens nearly a decade ago. And, the Aliens game was loosely inspired  —   it’s narrative  —   by Heart of Darkness. And so, we went from that point in time to, over the years doing many different things. Larry produced Fallout: New Vegas, which is a     game in a postapocalyptic world, there’s been a nuclear war and you’re exploring this huge 20 square mile open world, it’s got an 86 Metacritic. One of the best RPGs ever. Yeah, and if people knew how efficiently Larry made that game, they would be shocked. You know, you hear about Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto having a 200 million dollar budget or a 150 million dollar budget. Larry made Fallout: New Vegas, which is a 200 hour game in 20 square miles, for $9 million in 20 months. And he did it with a    game engine. So, we’re pretty confident that Mr. Liberty’s production plan for Apocalypse Now is a stout one. Our game is a little smaller, a little deeper, and we use much more advanced technology than they were using ten years ago on Fallout: New Vegas. Larry and I started a game studio called Killspace and we made some games with Atari and Ubisoft  —   Yars’ Revenge and Rocksmith. Rocksmith was cool we got to plug a real guitar into an Xbox or PlayStation and it was like Rock Band or Guitar Hero with a real guitar. We worked on a lot of stuff from 2008 and 2009 and 2010 that unfortunately never saw the light of day because of the   securities crisis at the time, and the economic issues that everybody had, you know, especially out in California. So, you know, all of the game publishers  —   well, not all of them  —   most of the game publishers we worked with went bankrupt. Atari went bankrupt, we had a horror game at THQ that didn’t ever go past the prototype stage because they went bankrupt, so a lot of our partners in developing video games, the people that were providing the financing for video games went bankrupt while we were making these games. And, from my point of view, they went bankrupt because they made terrible decisions. So, then this new method of funding video games arose. Crowdfunding. Through my company Malibu Road Pictures, I was fortunate enough to be producer on Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, which are two of the most successful video game crowdfunding projects in history, and I worked with Brian Fargo, from inXile, on those. Larry, meanwhile, shipped DC Universe Online, which is one of the largest, most successful licensed MMOs ever  —   and it was free to play, I think it had 20 million users. Larry’s career is very storied and goes back a quarter century, all the way to the Nintendo 64 and maybe the PlayStation 1. He shipped a game for just about every console for the past 25 years, since before I could drive. And so, he’s got a really interesting set of games that he’s worked on over the years, including one of the best Tony Hawk’s  —   Tony Hawk 4  —   The Witcher, the Sacred Series, DC Universe Online, Fallout: New Vegas, Aliens, Neverwinter Nights, et cetera. So, I work with inXile for several years on Wasteland 2 and Torment  —   primarily on Wasteland 2  —   and then started this process approximately 18 months ago of really kicking Apocalypse Now off as a project. We had been discussing it for years with America Zoetrope, because when everybody else pitched a shooter, we said, “No, it’s not a shooter, it’s a horror   game. ” Because if you look at the movie, the protagonist only fires his weapons twice. He only kills a few people in the movie. It’s clearly not a movie about smashing a button faster than the AI and running 50 miles an hour with an M16. Makes sense. To me, you got to respect the traditions of the art form that you’re working in. And I think that what needs to be disrupted most about the game industry is that it is becoming technologically mature, but not fully creatively mature yet. And I think you can see that with  —   and I’m not interested in, we’re not competing with anybody  —   we’re making a game that nobody else would make, for an audience that’s  . Hollywood makes stuff for five of the fifty states. Movies made by marketing departments. Absolutely. It’s formulaic, it’s driven by a PL, a spreadsheet. I think that people make a better decisions than former toothpaste executives working off of a spreadsheet, right? You get a graduate from Brown, who has spent some time in the William Morris mailroom and did a week of cocaine, and they decide which combination of intellectual properties and people would make a good video game, and then that’s the thing that goes. It’s a terrible, inefficient way to greenlight stuff. That’s why Marvel has been able to make essentially the same movie with different costumes for years. Right. But at least Iron Man is fun when Robert Downey Jr. starts talking. I think that our job in making the Apocalypse Now video game is to do two things at once. We have to make a great game, that’s our number one job. But in order to do that, we have to disrupt the system of game finance and greenlighting by giving control to the people that are in the 45 other states that do not get consulted on which video games to make and how to make them, even though that’s the audience, and then we also have to respect what came before us and the aesthetic requirements of art and story and interaction that I think people are quick to discard because it is ideologically or professionally satisfying in the short run, rather than being the correct decision in the long run.  I think a lot of the reason that you don’t see movies like Apocalypse Now  —   and video games like your description of the Apocalypse Now game  —   is that it’s uncomfortable. Vietnam was not a pleasant experience, and the themes in the movie are very unpleasant. Virtually every scene in that movie is, in some way, discomforting. Purposefully so. In an industry where the general philosophy seems to be “louder is better” —   “Call of Duty in space,” right?  —  Right. How do you address the darkly complex world of the Vietnam War and the psychological horror of Apocalypse Now? Pablo Picasso said, “Good artists borrow and great artists steal,” and so, to me, as the director, my number one job is to not make the decisions that have already been made for me. And, so, if we look at Apocalypse Now, and watch it over and over and over again  —   and I’ve probably watched it up to 70 times at this point  —   it tells us how to make the game. It tells us that it’s got to be first person, because like you say, it’s about psychological horror. And so, if we’re going to achieve psychological engagement with the protagonist of the story, it needs to be in first person. It needs to be a survival and horror experience, which is like the war in Vietnam and like the movie. These are experiences where, for example, estimates vary, but you’re throwing fifty thousand to two hundred thousand rounds of lead down range per KIA. That doesn’t sound a lot like your typical   arcade shooter. That sounds a lot more like a survival and horror game in  . It does. You’re creeping around the jungle. And then there’s Captain Willard, who’s obviously incredibly important, who has a personal journey that he goes on up the river as he takes on this mission. And that tells me that it’s a   game, that you create your own version of Captain Willard. You design him how you see the world, and how you see yourself moving through that world, and then you interact with the characters in the world in the way you choose to do so. If you intend to move through the world in a more violent fashion than Captain Willard did in the move, that’s your choice. If you want to do recon on the huey during the air cavalry’s raid on Charlie’s Point, you’ll have that choice. If you want to be stealthy and sneak around and recon the jungle more, and make it about avoiding conflict rather than seeking it out, that’s your choice. If you want to develop good relations with the crew of the Erebus, which is the name of the boat, the PBR, “the Patrol Boat River,” named Streetgang, then you can have different relationships with them than Captain Willard had with them in the movie. And, spoiler alert  —   some of those crew members die and some of them live in the movie, but in the game which ones die and which ones live and whether they all survive or not is going to be up to you. And, again, this is a spoiler for the movie, Captain Willard is sent on a mission to terminate Colonel Kurtz’s command with extreme prejudice. And you are given that same mission. And there’s literally dozens of ways that you can complete that mission, but you also can reject the mission. The game wouldn’t be the game that we intend to make if you had to complete your mission, because at the end of the day, all the greatest games put the steering wheel in the hands of the players. Right. I think that a crucial point of the movie is his personal decision about completing the mission. Yeah, and how to go about it. So, we’ve talked about why the game needed to be survival horror, and why it needed to be a   game. How far does that go? Can you complete the entirety of the game without killing anyone at all? Yes. A lot of people will appreciate that. There are a lot of people, myself included, that enjoy finding ways to subvert a given scenario. It’s about control of the experience and the story, right? Many, I think, creatively immature game designers and directors impose their will on the story of a game because everybody has something that they want to say. And that’s okay  …     if you’re making a movie, or writing a novel. Because those are both passive, observational experiences. Right. Yeah, in a video game it’s about what the player does, not about what you do. So anytime we can make our data structures or our gameplay or anything in a more open fashion that allows the player to have more control over it, we will do so. And we won’t care that you can do things that are outside the perimeters of what we expected. We want that to happen. That’s called emergent gameplay, and it’s the best kind of gameplay. It’s no secret that I am a total sucker for emergent gameplay design philosophy. There is nothing else like the sheer sense of agency that it offers players. There’s this great   from DayZ, which is a zombie open world survival horror experience in early access  —   Hell, I don’t know if they’ve ever finished the game. But it’s a game where you can, your character can die and you can lose all of your stuff. And it’s a game where you’re supposed to collaborate and cooperate with your fellow players to defeat the zombies, you know? I’m sure it was inspired a little bit by The Walking Dead, would be my guess. And this one guy goes and gets 25 or 30 players to pile into this bus that he’s driving, and he’s like, “We’re gonna go get ’em, we’re gonna go get ’em, we’re gonna go get ’em,” and he gets everybody into the bus and he drives up this mountainside road, and drives the bus off a cliff and kills them all. [laughing] Everybody loses their stuff, they’re all screaming as they go down in the bus, right? This is totally not intended to be a part of the game, but it’s one of the most famous videos from the game. You know, similar experiences that players have with games are doing speed runs of games  —   Fallout 1 you can complete without exploits in about 16 minutes, even though the game is nominally   hours long, depending on how much stuff you do. And the same’s going to be true of Apocalypse Now. If you want to just jam upriver in the PBR Streetgang and skip all of the content and scenarios and stories and events along the way, call in an airstrike on Colonel Kurtz’s compound and call it a day, you can absolutely do that. Because Captain Willard had that choice in the movie to do it.  Anything that Captain Willard had the choice to do, you will have the choice to do. And then, additional things. Because the movie  —   the theatrical release  —   is two hours and   minutes long, Redux is three hours and forty or something. But the video game is 20 hours long. So, we’ll go to the theatrical cut, the Redux cut, the   work print, the original screenplay, deleted scenes, Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and The Odyssey, to find that new content. We also set up a military advisor group composed of veterans that will help us create both authentic scenarios for the game but also maintain a sense of historical accuracy. Because in the war in Vietnam versus the Apocalypse Now movie, there are some errata because the movie was made years after the war in Vietnam ended and was released in theaters a decade after the year of the events in the movie. So, for a great simple example of that  —   I got two. One good simple example of that is that an M16A1 was issued to soldiers in the war in Vietnam up through 1969 with a 20 round magazine. And then, from late 1969 forward it was issued with a 30 round magazine. So, in the context of the time of the events of the movie, everybody should be using 20 round magazines. But in the movie, everybody’s using 30 round magazines, because it was shot in   or   or whatever. So, little details like that, we’ll ask ourselves and our veteran survivors, “Is it narratively significant?” If it is narratively significant, we’ll keep it. If it’s not narratively significant we’ll be historically accurate. Two other examples of that  —   a Huey airlifts the PBR Streetgang and drops it into the river, the mouth of the Nung River. A Huey can’t carry a PBR Streetgang, it’s above its airlift capacity. But we’ll keep that scene because that scene is narratively significant and I don’t think anybody really cares exactly how many thousands of pounds a Huey can lift, at least not for the purposes of this game. This isn’t a simulation. Then, here’s another example. Colonel Bill Kilgore calls for some “20   Vulcan” on that tree line. Well, he’s calling for a 20 mm Vulcan minigun, but those weren’t on Hueys in 1969. They were only on, I think Falcons, which were airplanes. Then, later, by 1977, they were on Cobras and Warthogs, but they just weren’t on Hueys. They were on gunships when the movie was being made, but they weren’t on gunships when the events of the movie are taking place. But what was on a huey gunship in 1969 was a 7. 62mm minigun, so we’ll have that instead of the 20. And again, it’s not narratively significant, so we’ll be historically accurate where we can be. That’s, you know, a lot of the stuff, but I think there’s a process to all of this. And instead of the process, to me product always follows process, and we have to have fun while we’re making the game, otherwise the game won’t be fun. I think you can tell with many of the   shooter releases, that the development teams are bored. Yeah, they’re just like, “Oh, man, I’ve made this game seven times, do we have to really make it again?” Right. But people want to keep jamming things out while they’re making money. But if it was just about making money, I’d go to Wall Street, or I would have gone and been a lawyer in Texas, you know? Those are more directly connected to money. I make studio games and movies because it’s fun, and this is a good example of the kind of choice responsibility that I think we have to the players in terms of giving them choices and, in doing so, being true to the original motion picture. Apocalypse Now is loosely inspired by Heart of Darkness. In Heart of Darkness when Marlow goes upriver and meets Kurtz, he actually convinces him to come back down the river with him. He doesn’t kill him, he doesn’t airstrike him  —   well they wouldn’t have airstrike in the 1890s anyway  —   but he convinces him to come back with him. And so, to us, when confronting the Colonel, the player should have at their fingertips all of the potential options that Captain Willard and his direct inspiration from Heart of Darkness would have. Apocalypse Now straddles a unique line in regard to its violence. The movie doesn’t have a whole lot of truly graphic depictions of violence despite the setting. Yet what depictions there are  —   the joyous whooping of the soldiers as they raze a village comes immediately to mind  —   are jarring. Which is probably why it didn’t win the Oscar in 1980, and Kramer and Kramer [sic] beat it, and I don’t think anybody watches Kramer and Kramer anymore. Mediocre Meryl Streep movie beats Apocalypse Now for Oscar in 1980. I think because it has scenes like that. Because it is not politically correct, and fortunately I am not politically correct. So, the direction of this game will remain not politically correct. And it will be a better game for that. That’s one of the reasons we have to step outside of the traditional Hollywood publishing system and do something a little disruptive in the initial announcement and creation of this game. To keep it from becoming sanitized. Right, it’ll be sanitized if it just goes through the corporate system. And it won’t be an Apocalypse Now game anymore, it’ll just be some silly shooter. And so, to keep it from being sanitized, to keep it true to its original mission, is, I think  …     Well, first off, I’m glad to be the guy who gets to do it. And I’m excited that we are doing it. I think it’s important for art, it’s important for games as they move toward virtual reality, and it’s important for Hollywood  —   it’s even important for movies that we get back to a place where we create interactive and linear stories that are not afraid of telling the truth. Because the truth is always the best story. Even if sometimes it’s a scary one. It is a scary one, right? You know, Colonel Bill Kilgore in Apocalypse Now, is based on real soldiers. Colonel Stockton, and I believe Hagworth. But also at the same time, the Hollywood version, the Rambo version of getting shot and flying back on wires and stuff, you know, that’s not the way people die when they get shot. And so, you know, I think we’ll strive for authenticity and specificity in that regard, and we’ll certainly rely on our military advisor group for guidance there. One of our senior writers, Ryan Plachetti, served in the US Army and served in Iraq. And I’d like to see most, if not all, of our writing team, other than Rob Auten, our head writer, be veterans because they will have a touch to the experiences that we’re talking about. There’s two, I think, points that are worth making that spin off of this. Number one, for every bit of horror that is present in Apocalypse Now, there’s also humor, especially in Redux. You know, they steal Colonel Kilgore’s surfboard, he comes in in hollering over the PA from the Huey to get it back.  That’s the next thing I was going to ask about. Apocalypse Now’s humor is sparse, and what’s there is pitch black. Right. A lot of “gallows humor. ” And that, I think, is one of the reasons why service members and veterans enjoy the movie. Because it doesn’t shy away from that part. There’s the part where the guy flies by on the other patrol boat from the Erebus and moons everybody on the boat. And that kind of, you know, vulgarity and humor in a war zone is nothing because you’re sitting there in life or death situations. Then there’s a lot of nothing in between, and a lot of waiting. So, naturally a bunch of guys in that environment are just going to cut up, you know? It expresses itself some in Colonel Kilgore’s character. I think that’s a really interesting  —   to me, Colonel Kilgore is as interesting as Willard and Kurtz. Colonel Kilgore is, when he says, “Someday this war is going to end,” you hear the guy from Indiana. Instead of the    war leader that he normally is while we watch him. I think that gets at the duality of human nature, which is also a quote from General Corman  —   named for the director Roger Corman  —   super low budget movie producer and director from the sixties who got Mr. Coppola his start and got Jack Nicholson his start and got Robert Downey Jr. ’s dad his start. A lot of the famous directors you know and have heard about got their start from Roger Corman’s tiny production budget zany movies. Gonzo movies, maybe before the term “gonzo” was coined. So, General Corman says, “There’s a conflict in every human heart between the rational and the irrational, between good and evil, and good does not always triumph over evil. ” I think that each significant character in Apocalypse Now responds to that reality by making different choices. Kilgore chooses to adopt a persona to literally have a glow around him and to have fun leading his men into battle because he both honestly believes that that is the best way to keep the most number of his men alive and to win the battle each time as decisively as possible, and he has fun doing it. That duality is inherent in, I think, every character in the movie. Willard says it in the hotel room. He says, “When I was in the jungle, I wanted to be back here, and when I was back here, I wanted to be back out there. ” And he is an assassin. What we know about Captain Willard is sketchy, his backstory is limited, so the players will have a lot of latitude in creating the backstory of the character. Captain Willard enlisted at 19, which means he was a mustang promotion because he’s a captain by the events of the movie. He’s a   assassin, because he admits that he undertook six assassination missions prior to the events of the movie. He’s also been trained by General Corman, Colonel Lucas, and the mysterious CIA officer played by the assistant director, Jerry Ziesmer. He is given what is probably, almost certainly  —   he is given what is certainly the most controversial, the most secret, the most dangerous mission of the entire war of Vietnam in the world of AN. He’s being sent upriver to “terminate,” euphemistically, an American colonel in his own army, who is, in fact, a member of the 82nd Airborne, just like he is. And so, if Captain Willard is entrusted with this mission, we have to assume that only one of the best and most serious and most dangerous assassins available to the special operations group would be entrusted with that mission. And so, that’s the point from which you’ll be able to create your character, is that this guy is the very serious individual in terms of capabilities. And we don’t necessarily know the full extent of those capabilities. Willard says, six people I’m sure of because I killed them when they were close enough to breathe their last breath in my face, and we see him do that, spoilers, with Chief. Chief is clearly going to die when Willard kills him, but he’s not dead yet, and Chief turns on Willard and Willard eventually puts Chief down, and does it face to face. And that’s, again, one of his own soldiers. So, I think because Martin Sheen has such a natural likability to him  —   I mean, he was the president in The West Wing, right?  —   and everybody loves Martin Sheen because he’s got that natural likability, he pushes against the written reality of Captain Willard in a positive way. It makes it   and more interesting and more dynamic.  That kind of push and pull, we want to give now to the players, because what you choose to do in a video game says absolutely nothing and everything at the same time about your real life. It’s escapist entertainment, but what you choose to do  —   what entertains you  —   has something to say about what kinds of stories entertain you, and about what kinds of stories you want to tell, because we’re getting to the point where just as many people watch people play video games, as play them, And I think by 2019 and 2020 that’ll be even more true, especially with VR and better streaming technologies and   video capture becoming more and more advanced, and hard drives getting larger, hard drives become solid state drives so video capture and high resolution becomes easier for every single player. I think, in the full realization of this game, millions of people will play it, but millions of people will watch it be played by those millions of people. Like I said, returning to the oral storytelling tradition of The Iliad and The Odyssey, 3000 years ago, but in reverse. That’s the most exciting part to me. And a lot of this is kind of  ’ and as a guy from Texas sometimes I like to boil it down to just brass tacks: It’s a       game like STALKER, like Fallout: New Vegas, like Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, like Hitman: Blood Money, and you’re going to create a character that travels through a world, you’re going to navigate that world in an exploratory way, and make choices about how you deal with the obstacles and the conflicts and the secondary objectives that are the choices you want to make, rather than the choices the game designers want you to make. I want you to play the game however you want to play it, and I want people to break the game. Not even kidding. Right? A lot of game designers would be horrified at that, but I want you to go out there and find the edges of the game, and break it, push it to the boundaries, push it to the limits, and see where you can take it. Because where hundreds of thousands or millions of people can take it is going to be a lot farther and a lot wilder and a lot more interesting of a ride than where just we can take it. This is really a very exciting project, and your approach to it is definitely something much different than we’ve typically seen from the games industry. I think that this project  —   I’m a director on Apocalypse Now the video game  —   so my number one job is to make the game great. Historically, I’ve been a producer and an executive, and I think that this project is part of a larger opportunity for the people of the United States of America and the other countries around the world to take back the creation of their culture in a disruptive fashion. And that is equally important as one individual game. As a director, it’s not going to distract me from my job of making the game great. But it is part and parcel with how we’re announcing and delivering the game to the public. The people are going to drive the decisions. We’re engaging in a crowdfunding process so there are thousands and thousands of people who are the boss. That’s a much better situation to be in, because fans of either the movie or the game, or both, thousands of them that get involved with the community at an early process, an early stage in the process, will never ask us to do something dumb. They want us to make it as great as it can possibly be, and everything that they want it to be, and so they won’t ask for the silly things. They don’t need us to make quarterly numbers, and that part of this dynamic in this process is secondary to making the game great, but it’s almost as important. And it’s going to be a   process that we’ll have a lot of fun with. I mean, I already have a ton of fun in the   portion of being the director of this game, when I go on a thousand different Facebook posts and riff with tens of thousands of people and hear what they say about what they’d like to see. At the end of the day, I can do my job as a director, and do it well, but nothing will substitute for an entire grassroots army of people saying what it is they want to see in the game. Collectively, they will be much more accurate at decision making than an executive board or a production team or anything else. And obviously, there’ll be more ideas that people and individuals in the community and in the crowd and on the team come up with than we can ever implement. But sifting through that is fun finding the parts that “Oh yeah, that’s actually a really really cool idea, we should do that. ” And yeah, this other thing that we were planning is dumb. “We shouldn’t do that, because everybody hates it. ” So, that’s freeing in a lot of ways. It allows us to focus on the primary objectives and not worry about guessing a bunch. There’s very little guesswork involved in this project, and I’m fortunate enough to be at a point in my life and professional existence and creative career where I feel no compulsion to prove my worth to the world. Makes sense. So, if the greatest idea in the video game comes from team member number 10, 000 of the backer community, great. That’s fantastic. I’m not the guy here to come up with all the cool ideas. I’m here to direct a great video game.  Do you think that the games industry as a whole is shifting in the direction of the   indie scene? Yes. 100%. I think what we’ve seen so far with some websites is simply version 1. 0 we’re just through the   phase of crowdfunding, and we haven’t hit the next phase of it. But I think it’s fundamentally the way that most entertainment decisions will be made in the future. I think video games will be dictated by the people, I think movies will be dictated by the people, and I think we will get much better entertainment because of that. A major publisher would never allow you the freedom to make the game you’re making. Right. If you drop $100 million on a project but you’ve still got to make the board of directors and the CMO and everybody happy and feel safe and not worried about the press and all this other stuff, you’re not going to get very far with $100 million. But, with a team that’s fearless and a crowd of people that back the message of the game with a very reasonable budget, we can go anywhere in the world. So when can people get their hands on this game? So, if you’re a   backer, $1250 or above, we will give you the prototype no later than Q1 of 2018. So, by like February or March of 2018, maybe as early as December 2017 it’s a little hard to predict the earlier dates and   dates. But that’s the first milestone. If you back the game at $155, you get the early access in around August thru October we’re comfortable promising October 2019, but it could be a little earlier than that. If you back the game at $95, you get the Alpha of the game in February 2020. If you back the game at $65, you get the game beta in the summer of 2020, and if you just want to pledge $25, which is 60% off the retail price which would be about $60, you get the game in October of 2020. And so, there’s a series of releases depending on your level of financial engagement with the budget. The nice thing about the way we’ve got our website set up is that it’s free to pledge. We don’t charge you anything when you pledge. We do not run your credit card, and you will only be charged your pledge if we raise the entire budget. That neutralizes a lot of the nonsense and risks of crowdfunding 1. 0, which is guys in my shoes going out and overpromising on deadlines and budgets in order to get people excited enough to fund things in 30 days. We don’t have to do that. Like I said, at the top, the truth is always the best story, and it’s always also the best marketing. And, so, we’re just being totally transparent. The budget is exactly what we say it is, the timeline is exactly what we say it is, we are certain of every element of it. You know, the mysteries are more in how we get there each step of the way, what our particular journey up the river is, and what the peoples’ journey up the river is as they make the game with us, and what all happens next. And that’s going to be a fun experience in and of itself. Speaking of pledges, you guys have pledge levels from $25 all the way to $1 million. Well, I figure there are some fans of Apocalypse Now in this world who might be interested in backing Apocalypse Now for a million dollars, instead of buying a Ferrari. If I had a spare million lying around, it sounds like a fun package. There’s a lot of stuff in that reward tier. We give you like 110 or 120 copies of the game, first off, but one of the more interesting things we do is  —   if you want, and I presume you would want it if you were a million dollar backer  —   we will come to your house and we will build a virtual reality video game equivalent of a home theater in your house that is Apocalypse   that uses real props from the movie, with a specially designed rig to run the game, and it will truly be a shrine to the Apocalypse Now experience, which like I said, is an experience not just about today or 2020, but tracks back 40 years, tracks back to Heart of Darkness in 1899, and tracks back 3000 years to Homer’s The Odyssey. So, that, I think, is a one of a kind  —   and I believe in the million dollar tier, there’s at least seven or eight     can’t get anywhere else, rewards. Whether it be Colonel Kilgore  —   there’s two extant copies of the actual death cards that Colonel Kilgore uses in the movie. The million dollar tier backer would get one of those. And that’s a    movie prop that is, I have no idea what it would be worth if you were to auction it off as a thing. So, there’s real value in there, and I think it’s a unique opportunity. And so are all the  —   we call them the “advisor tier” pledges in honor of the military advisors that were in Vietnam,   prior to the major hostilities, so the “advisor tiers” range up from a reasonable expenditure of money that’s equivalent to someone who’s a dedicated MMO player or does a significant amount of microtransactions in a game, you know? We have like a $500 one, a $1250 tier, those are a lot of money to just pay for a single video game, but if you think about this process as being something where you’ll be entertained over the course of four years in a variety of ways, both on the website and through the game, and by getting versions of the game over the years, I think it starts to make a lot of sense in terms of structuring the price for those kinds of things at those levels. If you were a World of Warcraft subscriber, you were paying that subscription every month for years. And we intend to provide the same level of entertainment to our team, which is the way we refer to our community, because I think Apocalypse Now, the community is a team. When you back the game, you’re not joining the “community” we’re not going to have a drum circle. You’re joining a team. And if you join the discord chat for Apocalypse Now, it’s called Red Team, and you’re a member of it. And your voice is just as important as anyone else’s in the making of this game. That is a pretty novel approach to addressing a game’s community. Yep. This is a team that is driven by the people. We’ve got an event with the military advisors and the game team coming up in the not too distant future. And then, at E3 and ComiCon we’ll obviously be doing stuff. I don’t know if we’re going to do this, or even if the city of Los Angeles or the Department of Homeland Security would let us, but I want to fly a Huey over E3 blasting “Ride of the Valkyries” and land it in the convention center parking lot, and have Playboy USO dancers hop out of it rather than buying a booth on the E3 floor. Wow. That would definitely make an impression. If we didn’t want to do things like that, we’d be the wrong people to make an Apocalypse Now game. Thank you for your time. It’s been great to talk to you, and I’m definitely looking forward to seeing how the game turns out.

1562,"If Hillary Wins, Here Are 10 Things Anyone Can Celebrate - Vladimir Golstein","Politics If Hillary Wins, Here Are 10 Things Anyone Can Celebrate 
""So why not give everyone a free day, dress everyone in Boy Scout outfits and make them march along the Pennsylvania Avenue singing songs about the Great Mother of the Nation. Finally, North Korea would meet its match."" Hooray! (Click to enlarge) The author is an Associate Professor of Slavic Languages at Brown University, an American Ivy League university. People are justifiably frightened by the prospect of Hillary Clinton re-entering the White House, as if her first stay wasn’t bad enough. To all those who think that her warmongering would result in military confrontation with Russia, and her cozy relationships with bankers would lead to economic collapse, I would like to offer something to cheer about. # 10 America is the country of émigrés, of people who were given a second chance after they landed here. So Hillary’s second coming to the White House, would be the source of endless inspirational stories for the poor suckers belonging to the 99% and who rely on the crumbs that 1% drops to them from their table. Never give up, there is always a second chance at joining this coveted table. # 9 Hillary’s victory would spawn a great new industry for senior citizens. Rather than looking forward to playing bingo or taking cruises, any senior could aspire to become president. What a great area of possibilities! I can imagine courses opening all over the country on such diverse subjects as to how to open a foundation and take bribes legally; how to negotiate with lobbyists, how to laugh demonically and sarcastically, how to erase your emails, and how to forget bad things that you’ve done. Not sure the seniors would pay for this last group of courses, but worth trying anyway. # 8 With Hillary in the White House, the whole world would celebrate her reception of several Nobel Prizes simultaneously. Judging by the eagerness with which they responded to President Obama’s promises of peace, it is hard to imagine Nobel Prize committees failing to respond to Hillary’s winning ways. Consequently, we will be able to rejoice at Hillary’s Nobel prizes for Peace (in the Middle East in particular), for fiction (her whole life is one big fantasy); for mathematics (for inventing computer algorithms that either destroy emails, or attributes them to the hacking Russians), for chemistry (for inventing the coating, that makes Teflon look fragile and crumbling), and for physics (for constructing this missile shield that would enable her to create unopposed no-fly zones any place she wants). This latter prize she might share with the great chief of Pentagon and physicist in his own right, Mr. Ashton Carter. # 7 Hillary’s success would result in a new arms race with Russia, providing endless amounts of jobs for students of Russian, since there will be a need to discover all the mischief of Russians and therefore beef up all the seventeen agencies that, according to Hillary, keep on spying on Russians. Furthermore, with Russians being what they are, seventeen agencies are hardly enough. There should be at least 1001. I can easily foresee the brightest future for all Slavic Departments. A bit of self-serving, I agree, but after all, with Hillary we are entering a new “self-serving-is-good” age. # 6 Hillary would also unleash a new politically correct language onto the world. Just the other day, as I was booking hotel room, I was asked about my gender. And there were only two options to choose. What a disgrace! With Hillary in the White House, all the great students of Ivy League Universities – and they are the only ones who can remember and pontificate on all thirty one gender identities introduced by political correctness --would find fantastic employment advising various companies, agencies, even countries, on this subject. And this is only the beginning. Think about the great employment opportunities for those who can distinguish and label all thirty-one types of terrorists currently fighting in Syria. The State Department, which already employs seventy thousand people, would have to be drastically expanded to accommodate such experts. # 5 The Saudis could buy all Trump’s Hotels, including the one that is supposed to be next to the White House; consequently, they could negotiate with Hillary directly, without leaving any paper or internet trace. So, there won’t be any need for Wiki-leaks emails, and other bothersome documents, all of which seem to distract the country from its main task. The task indicated to all of us by Hillary’s one-time rival, Bernie Sanders, who after he announced, “people are sick of hearing about these damn emails ,” proceeded, without further ado, to lick Hillary’s behind. And so did all his followers who are now cheering for the rest of us to do the same. # 4 A Hillary victory would guarantee the continuity of the same people in such positions of power as Pentagon, State Department, Treasury, CIA, or Senate. Who needs unnecessary disruption that comes with the change of various leaders? With Republicans switching to Hillary, it is high time that we modify the elections in general, to cement the elite’s hold on power. They are obviously very good for the country; otherwise, we would not be voting for the same people again and again. So why not give everyone a free day, dress everyone in Boy Scout outfits and make them march along the Pennsylvania Ave singing songs about the Great Mother of the Nation. Finally, North Korea would meet its match. Who are those skeptics who say that Kim is a serious threat to US? To their Kims we offer our Clintons, to their party we offer our party, to their elections --our elections, to their meager amount of nukes we offer our full arsenal of nukes. So eat your kimchi, Mr. Kim and go back to jailing your opponents. # 3 This small step for mankind will be a giant step for all women in the world. Never mind the previous great examples of female presidents and national leaders. They were not Americans, and therefore cannot possibly serve as role models. With Hillary, every woman could look at her daughter and say: “Don’t worry. One of these days, you’ll marry an ambitious young man from provinces, and you’ll do everything in your abilities to help him succeed. And after he enjoys all the perks that come with his success, while you continue to serve him with devotion and loyalty, you’ll get your second chance. Just be patient!” What a great inspiration to all the young women of this nation! # 2 The banking industry would experience a real renaissance. New York would be renamed New Wall Street, since only bankers could afford to live there. Unopposed and unregulated, they would become truly creative, selling us mortgages for the use of air, sea, rain, stars, and sky. And putting all their profits to good use, they will make sure to provide us with perfect replacements for any retiring party apparatchik. # 1 Warmongering industries, Silicon Valley, and the entire state of California would be given a chance to compete with bankers in terms of power and money. With the shortage of water, the state is slowly turning into a desert. So inventing gadgets for the military, and testing nukes in California deserts, would be a fantastic solution. And in terms of the rest of the country, frankly, who cares about them. Their task is to pay taxes, buy the new financial vehicles invented in New York, play with the new gadgets invented in California, and keep on voting for Hillary, our Big Sister, who never sleeps, devising ways to protect us from those pesky North Koreans and Russians. So it is high time for people who inhabit this little patch of land squeezed between California and New York, to all those formerly known as “the great unwashed,” but rebranded recently as “deplorables” it is high time for you all to give up on your sexist, gun-toting, racist ways, and begin to rejoice in the fact that in this wonderful land of yours and theirs everything is for a woman… And her name is Hillary.

1563,"Debate Takeaways: Clinton Is Still Standing, and Trump Isn’t Going Away - The New York Times","With Donald J. Trump’s campaign engulfed in crisis, the second presidential debate promised a clash of grand proportions: a decisive, even cataclysmic showdown between one candidate on his heels and the other, Hillary Clinton, emerging as a strong  . The confrontation did not entirely live up to that billing, but Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump vented their vast differences over a revealing hour and a half. Here are some of our key takeaways: Mr. Trump had long threatened to go after Mrs. Clinton for her husband’s infidelities, and had often accused her of enabling Bill Clinton’s transgressions  —   but he had never said these things to Mrs. Clinton’s face. On Sunday night, he crossed that line. Claiming that Mrs. Clinton had intimidated women who accused her husband of assault, Mr. Trump told her she “should be ashamed of herself. ” But in the end, a charge long seen as the most incendiary Mr. Trump could offer echoed for only a few minutes. Mrs. Clinton opted not to counterattack, taking the   course of saying that much of Mr. Trump’s tirade had been false, and quoting Michelle Obama’s case for avoiding retaliation in kind: “When they go low, you go high. ” Mr. Trump entered the debate as the most disliked presidential nominee in the history of polling, seen by most voters as biased against women and minorities and as lacking the temperament to be commander in chief. Shifting those perceptions is his overwhelming task in the race  —   as it has been for months  —   and it is unlikely that he accomplished that on Sunday. He expressed no contrition for virtually any of the statements and actions that have alienated voters, from denigrating a federal judge in racial terms to mocking a reporter’s physical handicap. The lone and partial exception came in Mr. Trump’s brief apology for crudely bragging about sexual assault in a 2005 recording: Mr. Trump said he regretted his comments but described them as “  talk. ” If Mr. Trump steadied himself as the night went on, he never showed a side of himself that might surprise voters and transform their overwhelmingly negative views of him. On defense for most of the evening, Mr. Trump repeatedly widened his political vulnerabilities with offhand and   comments. Criticized for demeaning a former Miss Universe, Mr. Trump derided her as “no Girl Scout” and denied having urged people to view a “sex tape,” though he did exactly that on Twitter. He bluntly contradicted his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, in his approach to Syria. As opponents accused him of coddling foreign dictators and aspiring to unconstitutional powers, Mr. Trump said outright that if he were president, Mrs. Clinton would be behind bars. And Mr. Trump admitted in response to a direct question that he had used a massive business loss in the 1990s to avoid paying federal income taxes for years  —   a tactic Mrs. Clinton has long accused him of exploiting. Mr. Trump has now confirmed that charge. She rarely   and did not interrupt. She sprang no surprise attacks and let Mr. Trump off the hook several times as he plainly struggled. Instead, Mrs. Clinton coolly prosecuted the case against Mr. Trump that she has offered all along, calling him unfit for the presidency and describing his candidacy as built on hate. “He owes our country an apology,” Mrs. Clinton said. She did not create an electric moment in the debate  —   the kind that might dominate news coverage for days  —   and with Mr. Trump’s fortunes falling, she likely did not need to. In a rare    remark, she said Mr. Trump’s campaign was “exploding,” an assessment few Republicans would dispute. But for Republicans who feared the night would end with abject and complete humiliation for Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton’s cautious approach came as something of an unexpected relief. Mr. Trump’s defiant performance may not stabilize his candidacy, but it will likely put to rest frenzied speculation over the weekend that he might be forced from the presidential race. Facing abandonment by dozens of important Republican officials, he bucked calls to withdraw and instead offered a performance his core supporters will cheer loudly. His rhetoric was stocked with buzzwords that will gratify the party base: Benghazi. Sidney Blumenthal. Deplorables. Radical Islam. And Mr. Pence, who has faced calls to ditch Mr. Trump or even to replace him as the party’s nominee for president, doused predictions that the ticket might collapse. On Twitter, Mr. Pence offered Mr. Trump hearty congratulations “on a big debate win,” and declared himself “proud to stand with you” in the race.",0
1564,Italy Threatens to Veto EU Budget – No More Refugees,"Italy Threatens to Veto EU Budget – No More Refugees by IWB · October 27, 2016 
by Martin Armstrong 
The Italian Prime Minister is calling for immediate help with the refugees. The EU refugee crisis is becoming a huge nightmare and Brussels refuses to simply admit it has made a bad decision. Italy is overwhelmed by the influx of refugees and is now calling for a fresh review. Italy cannot cope with a similar number of incoming refugees this year. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said he would resign if the upcoming Constitutional Amendment is rejected on December 4. He realizes the vastly unpopular influx of refugees must be stopped or he may have to resign. The Italian coastguard rescued more than 6,000 people from the sea, and this year alone about 155,000 refugees have arrived by sea in Italy. They are pouring in from Libya where operating traffickers send refugees to make large sums to get them to Italy. 
Renzi has now threatened that if other EU member states refuse to accept refugees he will veto the EU budget. Renzi pointed out that Italy pays the EU 20 billion euros and gets back only 12 billion. He has come out and stated that this system “does not work.”",0
1565,Brent Bozell: Attack on Hannity Part of ’Liberal Strategy to Monopolize the Media’ - Breitbart,"President of the Media Research Center Brent Bozell has criticized the   attacks against Fox News host Sean Hannity, describing them as “part of the liberal strategy to   their monopoly over television news. ”[On Wednesday, a number of companies including Cars. com, Peloton, and Leesa Sleep pulled their ads from Hannity following pressure from   activists over Hannity’s pursuit of   claims made by Fox News that murdered DNC employee Seth Rich had contact with Wikileaks before his death.  In a series of tweets, Hannity accused figures including George Soros, David Brock of Media Matters, and failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of “liberal fascism,” after his advertisers were reportedly “inundated with emails” from   groups asking them to stop advertising on the show. Now Bozell, whose organization the Media Research Center analyzes liberal bias across the mainstream media, has accused advertisers of “joining in the liberal cause and advancing the liberal strategy” and becoming “servants of the politically correct. ” He also attacked the military financial services company USAA for “succumbing to the pressure of   extremists,” adding that Hannity has “for decades been a fierce supporter of the military at every turn. ” Please read my full statement slamming advertisers who are boycotting Hannity. pic. twitter.   —   Brent Bozell (@BrentBozell) May 25, 2017,  Hannity is now the second Fox News show to have ads pulled this year, after over 90 companies dropped advertising on Bill O’Reilly’s show The O’Reilly Factor over allegations of sexual harassment, following pressure from   activists. O’Reilly was eventually released by the network, despite being America’s   cable news host. “We have remained silent for far too long. A bridge has been crossed. Stay tuned,” Bozell added.

1566,Debate Committee Rebuffs Donald Trump’s Complaints of N.F.L. Scheduling Conflicts - The New York Times,"The bipartisan commission responsible for arranging presidential debates on Sunday rebuffed Donald J. Trump’s complaints that two of the three debates were scheduled to take place during pro football games, after Mr. Trump hedged about whether he would still participate. The Commission on Presidential Debates made the schedule last September after consulting with officials in both parties. The first two debates conflict with National Football League games: on Monday, Sept. 26 (Atlanta Falcons vs. New Orleans Saints) and Sunday, Oct. 9 (Giants vs. Green Bay Packers). A third presidential debate is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 19, and a   debate is set for Tuesday, Oct. 4. The commission stood by its decision, saying it “selects the debate dates a year in advance in order for the television networks to have maximum lead time and predictability in scheduling these extremely important civic education forums,” and added that it “believes the dates for the 2016 debates will serve the American public well. ” In an interview with ABC’s “This Week” shown on Sunday, Mr. Trump accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to minimize the audience for the debates, saying her campaign had tried to do the same for debates with Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries  —   and suggested that football fans should view her skeptically. “Hillary Clinton wants to be against the N. F. L. ,” Mr. Trump said. Separately, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, expressed support on Sunday for Mr. Trump’s position, despite the party having agreed to the debate schedule last fall. “Certainly, we’re not going to agree with anything that our nominee doesn’t agree with,” Mr. Priebus said on CBS’s “Face the Nation. ” And Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, said on “Face the Nation” that he planned to “sit down with the commission in the next week or so” to make sure the debates “have a broad audience. ” But in a statement issued a short time later, the Commission on Presidential Debates said it had started planning the schedule 18 months ago and had worked to pick dates that would avoid holidays, baseball playoff games, N. F. L. games and other events that would compete for voters’ attention. “It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles,” it said in a statement. “A debate has never been rescheduled as a result. ” The Clinton campaign, when asked for a statement on Sunday, directed reporters to a tweet sent by John Podesta, the campaign chairman. “This is just more Trump debate malarkey,” Mr. Podesta wrote. “We will be at the debates set by the bipartisan debate commission and expect he will too. ”",0

1568,"Tesla Faults Brakes, but Not Autopilot, in Fatal Crash - The New York Times","Tesla Motors has told Senate investigators that its   system failed to work properly in a fatal crash, but said its Autopilot technology was not at fault, according to a Senate staff member. Instead, Tesla told members of the Senate Commerce Committee staff on Thursday that the problem involved the car’s automatic braking system, said the staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not clear how or why Tesla considers the automatic braking system to be separate from Autopilot, which combines automated steering, adaptive cruise control and other features meant to avoid accidents. Tesla declined to comment on Friday. “Those systems are supposed to work together to prevent an accident,” said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm. “But either the car didn’t know it had to stop, or it did know and wasn’t able to stop. That involves Autopilot and the automatic braking. ” The company told the committee staff that it considered the braking systems as “separate and distinct” from Autopilot, which manages the car’s steering, and can change lanes and adjust travel speed, the staff member said. That argument is consistent with the company’s continued resistance to critics’ calls for the company to disable Autopilot. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and other company officials have continued to defend Autopilot, describing it as a lifesaving technology. The meeting on Thursday, which involved Tesla engineering executives, was in response to a request from the committee for more information about Autopilot and the cause of the crash in Florida. The executives also urged against governmental action that could slow introduction of   technology, according to the staff member. Tesla expressed the view that while some deaths might occur as automakers developed and perfected these kinds of innovations, the safety benefits outweighed the risks, this person said. Tesla is still trying to determine whether the car’s radar and camera systems failed to detect a   that was crossing the roadway, or whether they saw the truck but misidentified it as an overpass or overhead road sign. In a Twitter posting last month, Tesla’s chief noted that the radar system “tunes out” readings that appear to be overhead signs to prevent the car from braking unnecessarily. The information presented at the meeting is the most extensive explanation Tesla has given so far for what role its Autopilot system might have played in the crash, which took the life of Joshua Brown, 40, an entrepreneur from Ohio. Mr. Brown was traveling on a divided highway in Williston, Fla. with Autopilot controlling his Tesla Model S when it crashed into a   rig that had made a left turn in front of the car. The company has previously said that neither the car’s Autopilot system nor Mr. Brown activated the brakes before the impact and noted that the radar and camera systems might have failed to detect the white truck against a bright sky. The reliability of Autopilot is a sensitive matter for Tesla because the company tries to present itself to customers and investors as a technology company rather than an automaker, said Mr. Brauer, the Kelley Blue Book analyst. “Autopilot is a key component of the image Tesla wants to project,” he said. “They’ve made a big deal about it. So they don’t want to be in the position of saying that there’s something wrong with something that’s part of the whole company’s image. ” Tesla was also due on Friday to provide the first batch of information requested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is investigating whether a safety defect exists in Autopilot or other safety systems. Tesla declined to say whether it would meet the Friday deadline. The National Transportation Safety Board, which typically examines airplane and train accidents, is also investigating. It has found the car was traveling at 74 miles per hour, nine more than the speed limit. Tesla is scheduled to report its   financial results on Wednesday. Analysts expect a loss, as the company spends heavily to increase production of a new Model X sport utility vehicle, finish the development of a more affordable Model 3 compact and start production at the gigantic battery factory that it is opening in Nevada. It is unclear whether the fatal crash and questions about the Autopilot technology are hurting Tesla’s sales or reputation. It delivered 14, 370 cars in the second quarter, fewer than expected, because 5, 150 cars were still in transit to customers, the company said. A year ago, it delivered 11, 507 cars in the second quarter. A repercussion of the Florida crash is that Mobileye, the Israeli provider of   technology used in Autopilot, is no longer supplying Tesla because of disagreements over how the system is being used. Consumer Reports magazine also publicly called on Tesla to disable the Autopilot’s automatic steering function until it can find a way to make sure drivers keep their hands on the steering wheel while using it. Autopilot consists of a series of safety components that can steer, brake, overtake other vehicles and maintain lane position automatically with little input from the driver. The system warns drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert. But many drivers, Mr. Brown included, have posted videos on YouTube showing it is possible to go several minutes without looking at the road or holding the wheel.",0
1569,A Trump Named Sue (Video),"A Trump Named Sue (Video) Posted on Oct 30, 2016 
By Mark Fiore Award-winning animator Mark Fiore wonders if the Republican candidate can ""sue his way to the White House"" in his latest animation. Watch the clip and read the animator's thoughts on Trump below. When Donald Trump warns of a rigged election depriving him of the White House, his call to arms will most likely be a call to his lawyers. Judging by his track record, surely there has never been a more sue-happy nominee for president . If voters don’t cooperate by Making America Great Again, maybe The Donald can sue his way to the White House. The American Bar Association sponsored a report that looked into Trump being a “libel bully,” that is, suing people willy-nilly to shut them up. The report on Trump was so ominous, the ABA refused to publish it. Fortunately, you can find it here . If Donald Trump will sue anyone from bartenders to journalists to Miss Pennsylvania, surely he is not above suing voters who have the temerity to vote for Hillary Clinton. Of course lawyers helped get George W. Bush into the Oval Office, but Trump-law is a different story . Enjoy the cartoon and be sure to see what’s going on over on my Patreon page .

1570,Trump: ’Our Partners Must Show That They’re Partners’ and ’Must Contribute Financially’ - Breitbart,"During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump previewed his overseas trip and said, “our partners must show that they’re partners, they must show that they’re friends, and they must contribute financially to the tremendous cost  —   the money that we’re spending  —   is so big it’s so much and it’s not fair for our nation.  They have to help and I’m sure they will. ”  Transcript as Follows: “My fellow Americans, This weekend I begin my first trip overseas as president  —   a trip with historic significance for the American people. I will be visiting with the leaders in many different countries to strengthen our old friendships, build new partnerships, and unite the civilized world in a fight against terrorism. In that spirit of unity, I will travel to lands associated with three of the world’s great religions. My first stop will be Saudi Arabia  —   the heart of the Muslim World. There, I will address a historic gathering of the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations. I will represent the views of the American people frankly and clearly. Many of these leaders have expressed growing concern about terrorism, the spread of radicalization, and Iran’s role in funding both. Now it appears Muslim leaders are ready to take more responsibility and a much bigger role in fighting terrorism in their region. It’s about time we do it, we’ll do it together, but it has to be done. America cannot solve all of the world’s problems, but we can  —   and we must  —   help any nation willing to join in the common cause of eradicating terrorism from the face of the earth. Next, I’ll travel to the ancient city of Jerusalem to talk with my good friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, about bringing peace and prosperity to both our nations. Israel is an important American ally, but in recent years we haven’t always treated them that way. It’s time to renew our friendship. While I’m there, I’ll also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem to discuss ways to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians. From there, I’ll head to the Vatican, where I will have the great honor of an audience with Pope Francis. I look forward to speaking with the Pope about how Christian teachings can help put the world on a path to justice, freedom, and peace. I will also meet with friends and allies in Europe at a gathering of NATO in Brussels and at the   Summit in Italy. Finally, I will close my trip by saying thank you to some of the courageous men and women of the United State Military serving their nation overseas. In my Inaugural Address, I pledged to strengthen America’s oldest friendships, to seek new partners in pursuit of peace, and above all  —   to always put American people first. I also pledged that our partners must show that they’re partners, they must show that they’re friends, and they must contribute financially to the tremendous cost  —   the money that we’re spending  —   is so big it’s so much and it’s not fair for our nation.  They have to help and I’m sure they will. The fact is that I’m excited about new possibilities for peace and prosperity  —   and I hope you are too. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

1572,Directors Guild Nominates Nate Parker for Best Debut - The New York Times,"The awards season leaders whom everyone already knew were awards season leaders became ever more apparent on Thursday when the Directors Guild of America revealed the nominees for its top prize. They are: Damien Chazelle (“La La Land”) Garth Davis (“Lion”) Barry Jenkins (“Moonlight”) Kenneth Lonergan (“Manchester by the Sea”) and Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”). The real news came further down in the announcement: Nate Parker received a nomination for outstanding achievement for a   director. This signals a redemption of sorts for Mr. Parker, whose awards hopes for his debut film, “The Birth of a Nation,” were torpedoed when controversy emerged around rape charges he faced and was acquitted of nearly 16 years ago. In the   category, nominations also went to Mr. Davis (a second one for his work on “Lion”) Kelly Fremon Craig (“Edge of Seventeen”) Dan Trachtenberg (“10 Cloverfield Lane”) and Tim Miller, whose satirical superhero film “Deadpool” has been a surprise presence in this year’s awards race. In the main feature film category, the notable omissions were Mel Gibson, for “Hacksaw Ridge,” and Martin Scorsese, whose   passion project, “Silence,” received neither a Directors Guild nomination nor one from the Producers Guild, which found room for “Deadpool” in its nominations list this week. Taken with the film’s shutout from the Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, Mr. Scorsese and “Silence” are all but guaranteed to be ignored in the best picture and best director Oscar races this year. (Academy Award nominations are announced Jan. 24.) Guild awards are given far more weight in the Oscars race than awards from critics or journalists because they represent industry sentiment, and because a huge number of guild members also belong to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The DGA Award nominations capped a busy week that began with the Golden Globes and included nomination announcements from the producers and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which also shares members with the American academy (and is now dealing with a #BAFTASoWhite controversy for picking an   slate of lead acting and directing nominees). Taken with Golden Globes wins, the guild nominations make clear the calcification of this year’s race around the leading contenders, with “La La Land” more out front than ever.",0
1573,Man Arrested for Impersonating Police Officer Claims He’s Female Once in Jail - Breitbart,"A    man arrested in Grover Beach on Sunday on suspicion of impersonating a police officer was later held in jail as a female, according to local reports. [Ken Kennon was apprehended by law enforcement after reports that he had pulled over a driver on Friday evening in his Toyota Prius, using the emergency lights system used by police vehicles.  The driver became suspicious after being pulled over by Kennon on the 800 block of N. Oak Park Boulevard, and then followed him to a nearby parking lot where he confronted Kennon and took down his details, before filing a report to the police. Kennon was later arrested by police on Sunday evening and was marked by police as a male, given this was the gender provided on his driving license. “The drivers license said male,” Grover Beach Sgt. Celis Rabena told Cal Coast News. “We did not check and we did not ask. Sometimes, that is a personal question. ” He was then processed into San Luis Obispo County Jail as a male, being charged on separate counts of providing false personal information as well as attempting to impersonate a police officer. However, Kennon then informed jail staff that he was a female, and was consequently placed in a private cell. Cal Coastal News reports that jail staff initially told them that Kennon was a male, before then stating he would have to “check with a supervisor. ” Bail has been set at $20, 000.

1574,Police Departments Refuse Participation In Dakota Access Pipeline Crackdown,"Videos Police Departments Refuse Participation In Dakota Access Pipeline Crackdown In addition to the general retreat of departments, two officers have already turned in their badges in support of the protesters.   Members of the Stutsman County SWAT watch protesters demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Stand Rock Sioux Reservation, as they stand next to a police barricade on Highway 1806 in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016. 
Standing Rock, North Dakota — Widespread outrage over both the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and violent police crackdowns rages on. That outrage is spreading even to police agencies now returning from deployment to the reservation. Two departments have already refused to return, citing personal and public objections. As if that wasn’t enough, an army of sympathizers is re-purposing social media to combat police efforts in Standing Rock. 
Minnesota’s Hennepin County Sheriff’s Department is among that group. Lawmakers, according to MPR News , found police activities in Standing Rock “inappropriate”. It’s to the point where they’re considering rewriting legislation to avoid future deployments to incidents like the pipeline resistance. 
Police officials, of course, declined to comment on their return from North Dakota or their feelings on what’s happening there. It’s also made the task of rebuilding trust with the community an even loftier uphill battle. “I do not support Sheriff Stanek’s decision to send his deputies to North Dakota”, says LT. Governor Tina Smith, “nor did we approve his decision to begin with. I do not have any control over the Sheriff’s actions, which I think were wrong, and I believe he should bring his deputies home if he hasn’t already.” 
Smith’s comments split the state’s government, however, and she was targeted. Minnesota State Rep. Tony Cornish condemned Smith for prioritizing “the rights of protesters over the needs of law enforcement”, saying she should apologize to the cops. 
Sheriffs from Wisconsin’s Dane County were more empathetic, pulling out and refusing to return. According to the Bismarck Tribune , Sheriff Dave Mahoney made the decision after a “wide cross-section of the community” decried the deployment. “All share the opinion that our deputies should not be involved in this situation”, says Mahoney. Dane County’s deputies were deployed to Standing Rock for around a week. Sources report Dane County wasn’t involved in recent arrests, a string of which scooped up an alderwoman from Madison Wisconsin. 
Ald. Rebecca Kemble traveled to North Dakota as a “legal observer”, filming and participating in prayer ceremonies. When Morton County officers–if they cans till be called that–grabbed and arrested her for engaging in a riot. According to Kemble, no riot was happening. Other Wisconsin departments have been recalled, with at least one staying behind for a more couple weeks. 
Many other citizens have been charged for trespassing and participating in non-existent riots, including journalists. One of the most renowned reporters who’s faced DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline)- related charges was Amy Goodman of Democracy Now . Goodman’s team filmed dog attacks by DAPL contractors who lacked proper K9 licenses. The contractors have also been accused of unethical surveillance, intimidation, and sabotaging the movement by attempting to make authorities believe the protesters have finally turned violent. 
Other journalists, including documentarian Deia Schlosberg, face decades in prison for filming climate activists at a separate oil project. Journalists from the independent outlet Unicorn Riot, who recently reported use of a sound cannon on water protectors, have also been arrested. 
Thousands of opponents to the pipeline have flooded Standing Rock to repel construction and police brutality. More still have taken to the internet, spreading information in the form of writing, video, photography, and art. Among the renegade tactics is using Facebook to “check-in” at Standing Rock. According the Guardian , over a million people–even people I know–have joined the action. 
It began with a Facebook post, disclosing that Morton County sheriffs are allegedly using Facebook check-ins to track protesters. “Checking in”–whether you’re at a friend’s, restaurant, or escalating resistance–pinpoints your location to a tee. Once you check in, a notification is sent out to, yes, your friends, but theoretically anyone who’s capable of watching. It’s yet another tool in the bag of tricks authorities have deployed against civilians, and are likely utilizing in Standing Rock. 
Some detractors have dismissed the social media action as a waste of time. An editor at The Fifth Column challenged these in a Facebook post, narrating a debate on the subject he’d had. Editor Justin King pointed out that even if the check-in’s wasted two minutes of time, multiplied by hundreds of thousands, that equates to two months of wasted police work. Now imagine how ineffective the surveillance may be with millions continuously checking. 
Morton County Sheriff’s, Guardian reports, called claims of police surveillance misguided “rumors”. Morton County, by their own account, isn’t “monitoring Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location for that matter.” Before you trust them, consider that Facebook access for water protectors was reported as “blocked’ during a military-style raid on a camp. 
Data Collection Nationwide 
Other police departments are similarly sketchy when pressured to speak on their surveillance technologies. Wisconsin’s Milwaukee PD hid the use of cell site simulators , or Stingrays, from courts for months. Stingrays mimic cellphone towers, thus tricking phones into providing all manner of user information and data 
Nearby, the Wauwatosa Police Department , despite having admitting to “collecting and analyzing cell phone data” in its public reports, denied ever even coming close to a Stingray. It took the department 5 weeks to respond to that open records request, which is considered unusually long. It remains unknown how Wauwatosa PD, which has been blasted for lack of transparency before , collects cell phone data. 
The Hand’s Fingers In Open Rebellion 
In addition to the general retreat of departments, two officers have already turned in their badges in support of the protesters. North Dakota water protector Redhawk, MintPress reports , disclosed the revelation. The individual also pointed out “you can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions.” “Some are waking up”, they continued, “we must keep reminding them that they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against the pipeline as well.” Hints of shame could be seen in the faces of officers who confronted protesters as they blocked them from prayer grounds. As the protesters condemned officers , some of whom looked down or off to the horizon in shame. 
The modern era of internet and technology gifts us with a plethora of ways to express ourselves, and help one another. Standing Rock is quickly becoming a stand out of that fact. Citizens, journalists, and activists are all using the internet to achieve their own goals. Whether that be spreading information being blocked, tracking police movements, sending food and rations or just voicing opinions. Standing Rock’s resistance is spreading globally, with protests occurring in Europe and elsewhere. As long as construction doesn’t stop, the movement won’t rest.",0
1575,"With All Eyes On FBI, Many Missed Criminal Clintons Getting BUSTED In NY","Share This 
Friday was a bad day for Hillary Clinton as the FBI announced the investigation into her emails and private server was being reopened. While news coverage was occupied with the controversial revelation, another one of the Clintons’ unlawful dealings was also exposed that many people missed. Hillary and Bill were busted in New York, and their habitual criminality is getting harder to deny. Bill & Hillary Clinton 
Hillary Clinton wants you to believe that she’s just like everyone else, but her actions speak louder than words. She’s nothing like the average American, and she doesn’t think she should be held to the same standards. Her criminal activity proves it, but if you need more convincing, just have a look at what Hillary and Bill were busted for in New York while all eyes were on the FBI. 
After dropping $1.15 million in August for the 3,631-square-foot house next door to their original Westchester home, the Clintons decided it was time for renovations. Originally hiring a contractor for “a paint job,” apparently turned into so much more when the Clintons’ wishlist grew and the duo decided that the work must be done before Thanksgiving. Demanding such a rushed deadline, they apparently also decided that time-consuming permits weren’t going to stand in their way. Unfortunately for them, someone didn’t like them skirting the law. The $1.15 million home they bought next door to their original house. (Source: HouseBeautiful ) 
An unidentified tipster ratted them out, which brought Building Inspector William Maskiell to their Chappaqua property for an inspection, and he didn’t like what he found. The “Clintons’ contractors filled in an in-ground pool, covering it with gravel, and extensively remodeled the interior of the property — all without applying for permits and paying the required fees to the town of New Castle ,” New York Post reports. 
The contractors were quick to point their finger at the Clintons for the missing permits, explaining the pressure they were put under by Bill and Hillary to have the job completed by Thanksgiving. Now, Maskiell says the two face “several thousand dollars, at least,” in fees and penalties for failing to complete the paperwork. The Clintons were notified of the violations in a letter dated October 17, which disclosed the missing permits and more, according to The Post : 
Attached to the letter was another document titled “ Clinton Violation Inspection Report ” in which Maskiell said the contractor told him the Clintons “were quite adamant about [the Thanksgiving deadline] and what had started as a paint job turned into this,” meaning the major renovation. 
The outlet further reports, “Maskiell told the foreman for the contractor, Carl Petty Associates of Washington, DC, that he would not issue a stop work order if the contractor sought the proper permits,” but as of Friday, “the general contractor still had not filed all of the required paperwork or paid the fees.” Maskiell also explained that, although permit applications are usually submitted by the contractor, the owners are ultimately responsible and must sign the paperwork. Bill & Hillary’s original Chappaqua home, purchased for $1.7 million in 1999. 
What’s worse, the missing permits isn’t the only problem the Clintons are facing regarding their properties. 
The Clintons also have outstanding zoning and Building Department problems at their residence next door at 15 Old House Lane, which they bought for $1.7 million in 1999 to establish residency so Hillary could run for the Senate, Maskiell said. 
They obtained variances in 2000 for a guard house on the property, for a higher fence and for “lot coverage,” or the amount of space buildings take up on the property. 
The variances must be renewed every five years — but the Clintons never showed up before the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
“Consequently, they are null and void. They should have come back in 2005, 2010 and 2015. So the variances have expired and they have to start from scratch” and reapply, said the inspector. 
The original home and a combination library and gym in an outbuilding still have outstanding building permit issues as well, including a sprinkler “sign off” by the town engineer and an electrical inspection in the library/gym. 
Many may be thinking, “What’s the big deal?” considering all the other things that Hillary and Bill have been accused of doing. However, it’s important to see that, even with the simplest of things, the Clintons don’t think the laws apply to them. Their criminality is habitual and never-ending. 
Sadly, this woman, who can’t complete even the most mundane task lawfully, is running for President of the United States. Shall I remind everyone that the president, as the Executive Branch of our government, is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress? Someone with no regard for our laws shouldn’t be given that power. Hillary Clinton shouldn’t be in charge of law enforcement, she should be on the receiving end of it.",0
1576,"NYPD, More Sponsors Drop Out of Puerto Rican Day Parade for Honoring Terrorist Freed by Obama","NEW YORK CITY  —   The annual National Puerto Rican Day Parade has fallen into turmoil as sponsors and fire and police representatives drop their sponsorship over the parade committee’s decision to use the event to honor Oscar López Rivera  —   a convicted terrorist whose sentence President Barack Obama commuted, and who was released this month. [The New York Yankees,   JetBlue, and ATT all pulled out of the June 11 parade this week in the wake of the parade committee’s decision to award López Rivera, an activist who enabled acts of terrorism in the name of Puerto Rican independence, the title of “national freedom hero. ” Goya pulled out of the parade last week, yanking $200, 000 of patronage, according to local lawmakers.  In addition to sponsors, representatives of the city’s fire and police departments have also rescinded their support. The New York Police Department confirmed to Breitbart News that Commissioner James P. O’Neill will not attend the event over the decision to honor López Rivera, while the NYPD and FDNY’s Hispanic societies have both withdrawn from the parade. The union representing New York’s firefighters also withdrew its support. The controversy centers around López Rivera’s role as a key member of the radical Marxist Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) which conducted more than 100 bombings in the United States in the seventies and eighties, killing five people, injuring dozens, and causing millions of dollars worth of damage. López Rivera was convicted on charges of transporting guns and bombs and was released this month after serving 35 years. Obama commuted his sentence in January. When he was released, López Rivera denied being a terrorist and thanked the governments of Venezuela and Cuba for their support, while reiterating the right for “colonized people” to use force. “Let me say this: We are a colonized people, and according to international law, that says all colonized people have a right to struggle for its independence using all methods within reach, including force,” López Rivera said, according to the New York Times. “That is a right. ” In a statement this month, the parade organizers stood by their decision to honor López Rivera, whom they conceded was “a controversial figure” who does not represent all Puerto Ricans. “Some people call him a terrorist while others think of him as a freedom fighter, as was the case with Nelson Mandela,” the statement said.  The organizers said the intention was to honor those who worked to have his sentence commuted and to raise “awareness about Oscar López Rivera’s story, the grave colonial situation in Puerto Rico and the identity questions that continue to arise, even today. ” “Nevertheless, Oscar’s participation is not an endorsement of the history that led to his arrest, nor any form of violence. But rather a recognition of a man and a nation’s struggle for sovereignty,” the statement said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he still intends to march in the parade. “The parade committee made a choice this year on someone to honor,” de Blasio said, according to the Times. “That does not change the basic nature of the parade. Whether you agree with that choice or not, it’s still the Puerto Rican parade and my point is, I will be there to honor the Puerto Rican people. I intend on marching. It’s as simple as that. ” Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY.",0

Gerhard Wonzke (38) und sein Widersacher Cem Karabulut (35) wurden inzwischen vom Sicherheitspersonal des Geländes verwiesen. ""In meinem Job lernt man schnell, bei solchen Dummheiten rigoros durchzugreifen"", erklärt Peter Kleefeld, der das Gefängnis seit 2009 leitet. ""Schließlich geht es auch darum, den anderen Häftlingen ein klares Signal zu senden: Wer sich nicht benimmt, fliegt!"" Schon länger habe er den Eindruck gehabt, Wonzke und Karabulut seien nicht mit Herz bei der Sache gewesen. ""Die haben ja schon morgens solche Fressen gezogen. Ich sag' immer: Entweder, man macht hier ordentlich mit oder man sollte sich überlegen, ob man bei uns am richtigen Platz ist."" Sitzen jetzt auf der Straße: Wonzke und Karabulut Die beiden verdutzten Übeltäter hatten gerade einmal fünf Minuten Zeit, ihre Habseligkeiten zusammenzupacken, bevor sie vor die Tür gesetzt wurden.

1578,Lavrov Schools European Diplomats in Logic Using Examples of Yemen and Ukraine,"Get short URL 0 44 0 0 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is no stranger to driving a good point home. Speaking to representatives of the Association of European Businesses in Moscow on Tuesday, Russia's top diplomat explained how Western countries have absolutely contradictory approaches to virtually identical problems in Yemen and Ukraine. 
At the meeting, Lavrov devoted a great deal of his speech to the subject of the crisis in Ukraine, the issue which effectively sparked the crisis in relations between Western countries and Russia, and resulted in tens of billions of dollars in economic losses for both sides, not to mention heightened military tensions. © Sputnik/ Vladimir Sergeev Saving Face: 'West's Attitude to Crimea Will Not Change' After US Elections Pointing out the difference in approach to Western policy in response to the crises in Ukraine and that in present-day Yemen, the foreign minister effectively schooled Western officials for their illogical behavior.
Lavrov recalled that when Yemen faced a coup in September 2014, and Yemeni President Hadi fled to neighboring Saudi Arabia, Western politicians reacted by demanding the reinstatement of the country's legitimate president. However, facing the exact same situation in Ukraine in February 2014, US and European leaders reacted very differently. ""For over two years, the international community has been demanding that President Hadi be returned to Yemen and his legitimacy be reaffirmed,"" Lavrov recalled. ""But our European colleagues, who share this view, remain silent when we ask them why the same principled approach cannot be applied to Ukraine."" 
Lavrov pointed out that two-and-a-half years ago, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland brokered a deal between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition, promising early elections in exchange for his security and an end to riots in the streets of Kiev. But just hours after the deal was signed, Yanukovych was ousted, and forced to flee in fear for his life. Apparently, the diplomat said, European officials ""have more respect for Yemen and its political system than for Ukraine, where experiments can continue it seems. Ukraine has been suffering from this for several decades now."" ...",0

1580,The Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy — Paul Craig Roberts,"The Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy
“Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order.” Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order 
Paul Craig Roberts
Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progresives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the “white trash” that they are denouncing.
I think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump’s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup. 
The organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions. 
The Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians. 
The same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that “for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump’s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.” This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.
I hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?
What is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, “who benefits?”
There is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as “free trade,” is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent. 
When US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires. 
Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the “Russian Threat” by demonizing Russia. 
Accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
The military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up “the war on terror” to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of “the Muslim threat,” even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven’t needed an army. Refugees from Washington’s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.
The excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created “the New Hitler” in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy’s principle agent for heating up the new Coldl War.
Hillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeaded. But if Trump resolves “the Russian threat,” the Oligarchy takes an income hit.
Hillary’s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.
Those Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocals with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocals. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.
In other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that “there can be no crime without intent.” (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .) 
One would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump’s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him. 
In other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump’s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination. 
The protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy’s wars to overrun Europe.
Trump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did. 
So what are the protesters protesting? 
There is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.
The protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukranians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becomming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Inernet. 
The Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.
Trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.
Trump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.
Karl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pott learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this thoughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenious people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.
Washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran governmenrt that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.
Hugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.
According to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.
Latin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be concillatory. 
Trump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.
Trump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington’s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans’ economic prospects. 
If tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won’t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.
Note: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters’ mandate for their platform.

Much of the news here in Arizona is about Obamacare. And it is big news. The Drudge Report today features a Wall Street Journal story, Inside the Affordable Care Act’s Arizona Meltdown , that explains: When Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces launched in fall 2013, Arizona seemed like a success. Eight insurers competed to sign up consumers, offering a wide variety of plans and some of the lowest premiums in the country. Today, with ACA enrollment starting Nov. 1, Arizonans will find in most counties only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. Premiums for some plans will be more than double this year, some of the biggest increases in the nation. 
Six major health insurers are leaving the Arizona market altogether in the new year. 
The Arizona Republic story on the fiasco today quotes a Phoenix resident, Ken Hoag, who understands what’s going on. “There are no choices, really, for anybody in Maricopa County,” Hoag said. “The lack of choice is like having empty shelves (and) no food in a third world country.” 
“Do I live in Cuba?” he asked. 
It’s too bad this had to happen, but fortunately there is an upside. You see, during the debate on Obamacare, the Republicans warned that this was inevitable in a State-run, Soviet-style health care system. They warned of deteriorating service, fewer options, and higher prices. Instead, they extolled the virtues of a free market in health care, one free of government that would constantly improve service, increase options, and lower prices. Just like it does with government-free elective medical procedures like vision correction and cosmetic surgeries. 
Now they are able to say, “We tried to warn you,” and their clarity being rewarded, we can hurry past this destructive socialist detour and restore a free-market in health care. 
Oh. 
Wait a minute. 
That’s not what Republicans did during the national debate on Obamacare. With the legislation before Congress in 2010, the Republicans were reduced to accepting the statist presuppositions of government interventionism. Instead of standing firm, they wobbled about on their spindly little legs, as the Republican National Committee ran TV ads calling for a “responsible plan” and a “bipartisan plan.” With only the occasional exception like Ron Paul, Republicans were incapable of articulating an argument against accelerating American healthcare’s Soviet-style trajectory. 
And one more thing. There was also Chief Justice John Roberts, the “conservative” whose lawyerly casuistry tipped the balance in favor of Obamacare at the Supreme Court. In voting to uphold Obamacare, Justice Ruth Ginsburg thought to remind us, as well, of Mitt Romney’s role in fathering this hideous creature. 
So how do you like living in Cuba? 10:49 am on November 1, 2016",0
1582,"Peter Schweizer: Kushner’s Failure to Disclose Billion-Dollar Ties to Goldman Sachs, George Soros Is ‘Massive, Massive Problem’ - Breitbart","Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer addressed reports that President Trump’s    Jared Kushner had an undisclosed business relationship with Goldman Sachs and billionaire   financier George Soros on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily. [“This is a company that not only is Jared Kushner an investor in, he   in 2014,” Schweizer noted. “So this is not some passive investment that one of his advisers said to put money into, and was forgotten about. He   it. It’s a real estate tech startup. Obviously it has a lot of ambitions. He’s got a lot of money in it, and he failed to disclose it on his financial forms. ”   LISTEN: “That’s a massive, massive problem. The whole purpose of disclosures  —   whether you are asking the Clintons to do it, Barack Obama to do it, Jared Kushner to do it, or Mitch McConnell to do it  —   is so the American people can know: who are they financially dependent on, who do they have ties to, who might have leverage over them?” Schweizer explained.  “The problem is that Jared Kushner’s position in the White House, he is essentially the liaison with the business community. He’s not in charge of protocol. He’s not in charge of public outreach. He is basically the   with the business community, so he is ground zero for precisely the kinds of concerns and issues that one might have about very, very troubling financial transactions,” he said. Schweizer conceded that “it’s always hard to look into somebody’s head” and judge whether such a filing omission was a mistake, or an intentional act of deception. “People that defend Jared Kushner could say, ‘Well, look, he’s got a lot of assets, a lot of companies.’ Here’s the problem: it’s hard even with Jared Kushner’s wealth to hide your stake, your involvement, with one billion dollars in loans. So I think this is a massive problem,” he contended.  “I think a couple of things need to happen,” Schweizer suggested. “Number One, Jared Kushner needs to look at who filled out the disclosure forms for him. If he’s saying he had no involvement with lacking this disclosure, somebody needs to be fired. ”  “I think the second question needs to be: what other investments could be out there lurking that we’re not aware of?” he asked. “To be clear, it is a federal penalty, it is a crime, to fail to disclose things on your financial forms. I’m not a lawyer, so I couldn’t speak to this particular case, but these rules and laws have real teeth because they present real problems. ”  “On a scale from 1 to 10, I would put this at a 7,” he concluded, responding to SiriusXM host Alex Marlow’s request to rank the severity of this transparency issue. Marlow referred back to a recent interview he gave to New York Magazine, in which he observed that Kushner rarely grants interviews or issues public statements, so it is difficult to draw conclusions about his agenda, or measure how much influence he truly wields in the Trump White House. “Every president has advisers that have input, that offer insight, but those advisers  —   whether it’s Trump or Obama  —   generally there’s a good public knowledge about them, because they serve them during the campaign. They’ve been public officials, or outspoken on issues in one way or the other,” Schweizer noted. “Jared Kushner has not. During the campaign, he said very, very little publicly. Before that, in terms of his politics or his policy views, very, very hard to discern. And he, in a sense, kind of emerges out of nowhere to become this very powerful figure in the Trump White House. ”  “Now, President Trump certainly has a right to do that,” he allowed. “But I think with that elevation of Jared Kushner needs to come, in a sense, allowing us to lift the hood up from the car and see what kind of engine is underneath there  —   to see really what his views are, have him do some public interviews about what his positions are. ”  Schweizer reiterated that Kushner should expect heightened scrutiny because he is “a liaison with the business community. ”  “He is now the sort of   between President Trump and people like Goldman Sachs   George Soros that might have business in the White House,” he elaborated. “These are people he does business with, and has commingled assets with. The American people need to know, and for a campaign that I think ‘draining the swamp’ and transparency were such important issues, this circumstance I think demands that kind of response. ” Schweizer called for “some sort of an independent audit,” a term he disliked using but found closest to what he envisions. “There needs to be somebody independently that goes in and looks through his assets to make sure that there aren’t other big conflicts that are undisclosed lurking,” he said. “The problem is, you really can’t have confidence in whoever prepared these forms for Jared Kushner because you’ve got these gaps. I would be surprised if there aren’t more of these kinds of mistakes or omissions, because it just seems to me this one is so big and so glaring, it’s hard for me to believe that it was just an oversight, and it’s hard for me to believe that this is the only one that exists. ” Marlow asked if Kushner specifically having ties with Goldman Sachs and George Soros would cause problems with Trump voters, of if such dealings should simply be understood as inescapable aspects of New York City high finance. “I think from the policy standpoint I would have less concern about this, precisely for what you said,” Schweizer replied. “Look, when you’re looking at these large investments where you have very wealthy people or their offices investing,   you find this a fair amount. So I don’t think this necessarily says anything about Jared Kushner’s politics or policy views, the fact that he’s   with George Soros. ” “But I do think, as we talked about earlier, there is this mystery. What actually are his views about crony capitalism?” he continued. “What are his views about the tax rate? What are his views about the   Bank, and those other issues that have been lurking out there for so long?”  “He obviously has an important voice and is going to be a player at the table. People know what everybody else around the table is thinking. People basically know what Gary Cohn thinks. They know what Steve Bannon thinks. People don’t know what Jared Kushner thinks, and I think the American people, particularly the people that have supported him, would expect to know and want to know what those views are,” Schweizer said. He pointed out that Kushner appears to have an extraordinarily broad portfolio in the Trump administration, having turned up in Iraq last month. “Is he a diplomat? Is he a liaison with the business community? Is he doing both of those things? If so, what are his views? Does he have any background or any qualifications in those areas?” Schweizer asked. “I think these are all legitimate questions that people have a right to ask, and to want to know. And yet, it’s kind of shrouded with mystery. ” “I can tell you, if you look through American history, any time there have been family members sort of intermingled with an American presidency  —   whether that’s a Kennedy administration, and Bobby Kennedy is Attorney General, or going back to Woodrow Wilson where he was basically disabled and his wife ran the country  —   this is the lurking concern and fear that people have,” he recalled. “That is, who is actually making the decisions? You really can’t fire a family member per se. They’re going to remain your family member. So it creates a different kind of dynamic and environment, that somebody can’t just be told to go away if they make a massive mistake or engage in destructive behaviors. It presents a unique challenge. ”  “I think that’s why it’s important for the Trump White House to get out in front of his, and this issue of disclosure. This is sort of Clean Government 101,” he said. Schweizer recalled calling out Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta for “his failure to disclose his ties to this company that was funded in part by a Russian fund that Vladimir Putin ran. ” “We were right to call him out,” he maintained. “The same thing needs to occur here. This is basic stuff that needs to be done, and the fact that it’s not being done at this point, a hundred days in, is extremely troubling. ” Peter Schweizer is a Breitbart News Senior    president of the Government Accountability Institute, and author of the   book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

1583,2:00PM Water Cooler 11/11/2016,"Corrente. 
2016 
Days Until: -3. Comment on polling: Election “calls” have never seemed very interesting to me — were it my place to make them — in the same way that predicting when a flood will crest is a lot less interesting than understanding (and perhaps managing) a watershed. That doesn’t mean predictions are not fun! Madison asked in the Federalist 51 : “But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” By the same token: “What is the horse race, but the greatest of all the performing arts?” That said, putting past Water Coolers into the “call” frame, the method I used didn’t yield bad results. Rather than tracking the very noisy individual polls, I decided to use the RealClearPolitics polling averages every Monday — once a week, for sanity’s sake — and plug those averages into a reasonable list of swing states provided by the New York Times, whose interactive tool then enabled me to game out scenarios in the electoral college. In all the weeks I did this but one, Trump had a plausible path to victory, depending on reasonable scenarios in individual states. In other words, still in the “call” frame, I beat most of the paid pollsters in the political class who were, er, trumpeting Clinton’s victory. And as we saw in yesterday’s Water Cooler, I tied the Trump team’s internal polling; they thought they were going to lose, though they qualified their views by pointing out the same plausible paths to victory that I did. Why did I not get the scale of Trump’s victory? I mean, in 2008 and 2012, and maybe farther back, the Republican candiate always made a show of putting Pennsylvania in play, and it never came to anything. Trump won it! Along with Michigan and Wisconsin (where Sanders, interestingly, defeated Clinton as well). 
Policy 
“It is clear to any objective observer that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has resulted in rapidly rising premiums and deductibles, narrow networks, and health insurance, has not been a success. A Trump Administration will work with Congress to repeal the ACA and replace it with a solution that includes Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the States. The Administration’s goal will be to create a patient-centered healthcare system that promotes choice, quality and affordability with health insurance and healthcare, and take any needed action to alleviate the burdens imposed on American families and businesses by the law” [ President Elect ]. Let us know how that works out. And: 
To maximize choice and create a dynamic market for health insurance, the Administration will work with Congress to enable people to purchase insurance across state lines. The Administration also will work with both Congress and the States to re-establish high-risk pools – a proven approach to ensuring access to health insurance coverage for individuals who have significant medical expenses and who have not maintained continuous coverage. 
And: Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation – and beyond Maximize flexibility for States in administering Medicaid, to enable States to experiment with innovative methods to deliver healthcare to our low-income citizens 
Hmm. 
“‘Donald Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare, and we hope that wasn’t an empty campaign promise,’ said Twila Brase, president and co-founder of CCHF. ‘It will take more than a promise to make American health care great again and to restore health care freedom to patients and doctors. Republicans need to advance visionary ideas for health care, ideas that are bigger than buying across state lines; ideas that put patients and doctors back together again without the costly interference and intrusions of profiteering outsiders. The high cost of health care comes primarily from the middlemen, including managed care and government'” [ Citizens’ Council for Health Freedom ]. CCHF is a good conservative site on health care policy. I don’t agree with them on policy, but CCHF is relentless and above all they don’t make stuff up. 
“Obamacare ‘Replacement’ Might Look Familiar” [ Kaiser Health News ]. Could be. ObamaCare was, after all, originally a Republican plan, so it should be possible to rebrand it. “‘It gets into a questions of semantics,’ said Mark Rouck, an insurance analyst for Fitch Ratings. ‘Are they really repealing the act if they replace it with new legislation that has some of the same characteristics?’… Topping the list of ACA provisions likely to survive under Trump is the requirement that employers cover workers’ children up to the age of 26, analysts said. The measure is widely popular and not especially expensive…. A health law crafted by Republicans might also retain the ACA’s protections for people with preexisting illness seeking coverage, said Glenn Melnick, a health economist at the University of Southern California… The ACA’s biggest coverage expansion came through the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, which added more than 15 million people. Trump has suggested giving states fixed federal grants for Medicaid, which could lead to a substantial reduction in coverage or benefits.” 
“Then Donald Trump was elected president, and now the tables may have turned again. Trump has on several occasions expressed his opposition to net neutrality, once calling it “another top down power grab” [ MarketWatch ]. 
“Who’s Advising President-elect Trump on Heatlh Care?” (PDF) [ Holland & Knight ]. Rich Bagger: Executive Director (Health care policy advisor). Was Assistant General Counsel at Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield) Eric Ueland: Budget Advisor (Entitlements) Jim Frogue: Domestic Policy (Health Care, State Policy). Was Health Care Policy Analyst for Heritage Foundation [ home of ObamaCare , interestingly enough] Ado Machida: Domestic policies (Health) Ed Meese: Executive Office of the President Lead Andrew Bremberg: Domestic Policy (Affordable Care Act repeal and replace) 
“Bremberg was on Walker’s team when the candidate unveiled a healthcare proposal that included repealing the Affordable Care Act and splitting Medicaid into smaller programs with separate funding” [ Modern Health Care ]. And: “For eight years, Bremberg served in the Department of Health and Human Services. From 2005 to 2007, he was special assistant to the Immediate Office of the Secretary and from 2001 to 2005, he was special assistant to the executive secretary” [ Health Care Finance ]. And: “Names reportedly under consideration for HHS secretary include former Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gov. Rick Scott, R-Florida, and former Rep. Renee Ellmers R-North Carolina.” Thin bench! 
“One day after his election, we polled our readership of healthcare managers and clinicians to see what they think the short and long-term effects will be of Trump’s policies on the healthcare sector, and we were flooded with responses. While most of them detail the deep concerns industry professionals have, a small few felt the businessman’s idea could improve competition and lower costs” [ Health Care FInance ]. Good article. 
Realignment 
“At this early stage, we can’t know with certainty exactly why Clinton lost. In a narrow sense, obviously, the electoral vote was lost because she lost Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Iowa. Exit polls (which are often unreliable, but all we have for the moment) and the vote distribution strongly suggest those states were lost because Clinton lost many of the white working-class voters that broke for Obama in 2012 . Overall exits show a 16-point swing to Trump among voters making less than $30,000 compared to the last presidential election — the biggest of any group in The New York Times crosstabs…. Also, general turnout was off from 2012″ [ The Week ]. So to fire the blame cannons at working class racism, you have to argue like this: “Trump won the racist vote because the people who voted for the black guy wouldn’t vote for the white woman.” Oh, OK. Now, you can deploy the misogyny blame cannons, but the identity politicians seem to be going with racism at the moment. 
“People often talk about ‘racism/sexism/xenophobia’ vs. ‘economic suffering’ as if they are totally distinct dichotomies. Of course there are substantial elements of both in Trump’s voting base, but the two categories are inextricably linked: The more economic suffering people endure, the angrier and more bitter they get, the easier it is to direct their anger to scapegoats. Economic suffering often fuels ugly bigotry” [Glenn Greenwald, The Intercept ]. I would go further and urge that “racism/sexism/xenophobia” are forms of politics, and that they are the evil twin of identity politics, and together are the only forms of politics permitted by elites . See the next link. 
“A top liberal group [The Center for American Progress] has temporarily abandoned plans for a new project designed to court white working class voters after it could not marshal the necessary financial support for the project, according to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon” [Washington Free Beacon (2014)]. So, the Democrats abandoned the (white) working class because the squillionaires wouldn’t fund the effort to reach out to them (and here we are!) Could it be that the squillionaires had a reason for that? Like that would be against their class interests? More: “The stated need for the project suggests potential pitfalls for Democrats in its eventual delay: In a midterm election year expected to heavily favor Republicans, CAP has apparently abandoned, for the time being, an effort to reach out to a constituency that it acknowledges could determine the viability of the Democrats’ voting coalition going forward. The Bobby Kennedy Project was the brainchild of CAP senior fellow Ruy Teixeira, who for the past decade has stressed that a lasting Democratic majority will require the party to make inroads with white working class voters.” Much too little, much too late from Teixeira, who injected the identity politics virus into the Democrat bloodstream to begin with . 
“The Dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again,” Dean said” [ Yahoo News ]. Oh, HoHo. Really? After helping Clinton rig her selection as a superdelegate and smearing Trump as a coke user on no evidence ? Yeah, the 50-state strategy was great. But that was before you lost your mind!

Consumer Sentiment, November 2016 (preliminary): “Indications going into the presidential election are very positive as the consumer sentiment index is up more than 4 points in the November flash to 91.6 for the best showing since June (the data were compiled before the November 8 result). The gain is concentrated in the expectations component” [ Econoday ]. People expect Trump to do better, then? And: “While this is a very small sampling that is not always universally accurate, investors, traders and economists love to dwell on this report because it is really the first real look at live data for each month” [ MarketWatch ]. 
Rail: “Week 44 of 2016 shows same week total rail traffic (from same week one year ago) marginally expanded according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR) traffic data. Rolling averages remain in contraction – but are improving” [ Econintersect ]. Finally some good news! 
Employment Situation: ” The good news is the prime working age group has started to grow again, and is now growing at 0.5% per year – and this should boost economic activity. And it appears the prime working age group will exceed the previous peak later this year” [ Calculated Risk ]. 
Honey for the Bears: “Sales aren’t falling year over year but they aren’t growing at 5% as they would do in ‘normal’ times” (charts) [ Mosler Economics ]. ” In ‘normal’ times inventories increase with sales, adding to output. But when sales slow inventory growth stops and reverses:” 
Fodder for the Bulls: “Spot metallurgical coal topped $300 a metric ton for the first time since flooding in Australia curbed output from the world’s biggest seaborne exporter five years ago” [ Bloomberg ]. “China’s efforts to cut overcapacity in its coal industry have reduced domestic supply and boosted imports of both metallurgical and the variety burned in power stations.” 
The Bezzle: “If a variable is normally distributed we can use standard probabilistic techniques to analyse it. If it is not then we cannot” [Phillip Pilkington, Econintersect ]. “So, what about economic variables? Are they normally distributed? Short answer: no, they are not.” Oops. If you look at income (a proxy for class) you don’t see a bell curve. You see a power law curve. And see the last link in News of hte Wired, too. 
The Bezzle: “In September, with typical marketing hoopla, Fitbit Inc. rolled out two new gadgets, the Charge 2 and Flex 2. Designed to measure more detailed fitness stats, the trackers were well reviewed and seemed poised to help Fitbit retain leadership of an increasingly competitive market. But within weeks the devices were piling up in stores, according to analyst spot checks” [ Bloomberg ]. In other words, the stuff wasn’t moving. We need more spot checks everywhere. 
The Bezzle: ” UberEats And UberRush Couriers Complain They Don’t Get Their Tips” [ BuzzFeed ]. 
The Bezzle: “Apple cuts USB-C adapter prices in response to MacBook Pro complaints” [ The Verge ]. ” Apple’s cables, unlike those you might order from a random seller online, are going to be well-made and reliable.” That’s really funny. My genuine Apple cable wore out in about a year. The mouse cable is wearing out even faster.

Technically, it’s a kind of biochemical company. After developing colors in a lab, Pantone makes most of its money by selling the shades and corresponding formulas to fabric mills, printers, and designers in a range of disciplines. It’s a simple model, and business has never been better.” Reminds me of identity politics, conceptually and methodologically. 
“Among facts that take a stubbornly long time to sink in, here’s one: Countries that borrow in their own currencies never have to default on their debt” [ Wall Street Journal, “Message from the Gilt Market: U.K. Can Never Run Out of Pounds”].

It’s amazing the dire predictions that didn’t come true. The global economy did not collapse. Neither did the markets or the Internet. There wasn’t violence at the polls. Putin did not hack our electronic voting systems. Funny how when you turn the gaslights off, things stabilize.

1584,Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence,"in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , “voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.” Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. “If anybody can sit there and say they don’t think this is a contentious election, then they aren’t paying much attention,” Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. And without a doubt, voting locations are “soft targets” that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … “There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn’t have 15 or 20 years ago,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. “ What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that’s certainly concerning.” All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … “We don’t want to lose an election because you know what I’m talking about,” Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. “Because you know what? That’s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .” And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. “I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,” Moynihan said. “You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.” In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? Either way, it doesn’t look good. After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. But Democrats don’t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… “It’s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,” Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book “ Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,” previously told The Christian Science Monitor. “Voting was very, very dangerous. I don’t think anyone’s suggesting that we’re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.” Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. Submit your review",0
1585,Black American Anti-Imperialism: an Invisible Subject for the New York Times,"Tweet Widget by Bryan K. Bullock 
To read the foreign policy pages of the New York Times is to enter a world of whiteness. “Whites are the only ones who are presumed to have an opinion on such issues that is worth mentioning.” Although Black America is the nation’s most anti-imperial constituency, foreign policy is considered a white preserve. Blacks “serve the function we have always served: subjects of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign policy.” Black American Anti-Imperialism: an Invisible Subject for the New York Times by Bryan K. Bullock 
“From Vietnam through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military intervention.” 
The October 4, 2016, issue of the New York Times , which contained the article, “Syrian War Magnifies Tension in America’s Global Mission,” is a case study in white supremacy. The article is framed from a totally white “conservative” and “liberal” frame, and completely ignores the perspective of African Americans, who, traditionally, and today, are consistently and overwhelmingly, anti-imperialism and who tend to identify with other Black and Brown people across the globe, including the Palestinians and Syrians. 
The article purports to give “both sides” of the argument for U.S. intervention in the affairs of sovereign nations. The authors of the article give the impression that they are being “balanced” in giving the views of those who support America’s “mission” in the world and those who are “critical” of said “mission.” This false “balance” does not include the perspectives of any African American historians or critics of U.S. foreign policy, like Professor Gerald Horne, Bill Fletcher, Anthony Monteiro, Glen Ford or African (American) scholars like Horace Campbell. In fact, “both sides” of any debate in the U.S. regarding foreign policy, are both white “sides.” This is particularly true when it comes to U.S. foreign policy, where whites are the only ones who are presumed to either have an opinion on such issues, or one that is worth mentioning. 
It is true that “both sides” could include Blacks who adhere to the Eurocentric, party-line views of the dominant U.S. narrators, say, Donna Brazile or Condoleezza Rice, or Blacks on the so-called “left,” but their views (still missing from this piece) are not a Black critique. It is a Eurocentric critique coming from a Black person, which is fundamentally different than an African American critique viewed through the lens of the African American experience. The ideas, views and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes to foreign policy -- which proves that the writers, the editorial staff and the paper itself does not consider those views important. And in ignoring those critiques, it also ignores the historical critical analysis of the people who are and have been the subjects of U.S. foreign policy. 
“The ideas, views and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes to foreign policy.” 
It also completely ignores the analysis of great Black historical thinkers like W.E.B. DuBois, Walter Rodney and Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, the late stage Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as the organizations they represented such as the Council on African Affairs (the CAA), the NAACP of the 1940’s, the African Liberation Support Committee, the Black Panther Party, The African Blood Brotherhood, the Organization of Afro-American Unity, Trans Africa, the U.S. Human Rights Network, the United Negro Improvement Association or the National Council of Black Lawyers, all of whom were deeply critical of America’s so-called mission in the world, especially as it related to African and Asian peoples, like Haitians, Congolese, Syrians, Yemenis and Palestinians. The critiques of these people are irrelevant to, not only the Times , but in truth, to the Democratic and Republican parties, the current incarnation of the NAACP, the Black Congressional Caucus, President Obama and most white liberal formations. However, this is not a reason to give the Times a pass. Even the use of the word “mission,” with the European habit of sending missionaries into Africa and the Americas to soften the people up with European religion before they were subdued by hard power, does not elicit irony on the part of the Times . The “white man’s burden” of “civilizing” the darker races of the world, through enslavement, destroying their religions, cultures, languages, colonizing their lands and resource and extracting their people and whisking them away to foreign lands to toil from birth to death for free, is just as important and essential a part of the history of “America’s Global Mission” as anything else mentioned in the piece. 
The hand wringing of the mostly white imperialists on the “left” and on the right, regarding the proper way to engage in imperialism, is essentially what the piece presents. No other perspectives or voices are important or valid. Thus the perspectives of African American thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns “black” issues like police brutality, but not on international issues, although many black writers and thinkers would argue the two are connected. This is so even though the very presence people of African descent in America is a direct result of the United States’ foreign policy of capturing, importing and enslaving African people. This point is lost on white foreign policy writers. However, early Black thinkers were clear on this point. People like DuBois and Robeson, in the past, and contemporaries like Glen Ford, were/are, fiercely anti-imperialist. 
“The perspectives of African American thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns ‘black’ issues like police brutality, but not on international issues.” 
The white, imperialist presentation in the article excludes the ideas of Syrian Americans, Indigenous populations, Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans and Hawaiians, all of whom may have a totally different idea of America’s “obligation” in Syria. Penny M. Von Eschen notes in the book, Race Against Empire, Black Americans and Anticolonialism 1937-1957 , that “Objecting to U.S. support for South African and the European colonial powers, and increasingly challenging the notion that America was the legitimate leader of the ‘free world’ and therefore above censure, black Americans both criticized new directions in American foreign policy and attempted to use the United Nations as a forum in which to gain support for civil rights struggles in the United States.” African Americans are no less critical of America’s self-serving “mission” today as was then. African Americans were highly critical of the U.S.’s violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60’s and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today. We have not forgotten America’s refusal to recognize Haiti as an independent Black nation when it defeated the French. Nor are we unmindful of the U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1915 and its support of dictators of the Duvalier family, the coup of the Aristide government and the fact that President Obama tried to prevent Aristide from returning to Haiti. 
Black thinkers on international issues are highly supportive of the Palestinian cause and troubled by the continued expansion of AFRICOM, the U.S. Africa Command, on the continent. This analysis is glaringly absent from mainstream media portrayals of America’s “duty” in the world. The Times article offers the view that, “Because many Americans see their foreign policy as a grand mission to make the world a better place, they tend to divide the world into heroes who support their ideals and villains who oppose them.” But which Americans are the writers talking about and whose “ideals” are represented in U.S. foreign policy. It is certain that the views of people like George Padmore, a leader in the Pan-African movement in the 40’s and 50’s, are not represented by this view. Padmore was clear that, “Empire and peace are incompatible.” Michael C. Dawson notes, in Blacks in and Out of the Left : “from Vietnam through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military intervention.” It is also purposely “forgotten” that the Black Panther Party was, following in the footsteps of their ideological predecessor, Malcolm X, staunchly anti-imperialist. As Eldridge Cleaver noted, the U.S. was “bankrolling and arming all of the oppressive regimes around the world.” One of the agenda items contained in the National Black Political Agenda, created in Gary, Indiana, in 1972 called for an end to the Vietnam War and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Asia and Africa; the withdrawal of U.S. military, corporations, and communications facilities from southern Africa and the Third World; self-determination of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; an end to sanctions against Cuba and the closure of the American military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
“African Americans were highly critical of the U.S.’s violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60’s and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today.” 
Contemporary white American analysis of U.S. foreign excludes the historical reality that, in thinking of America’s support of so-called rebels in Syria and Libya , it is clear to African Americans that America never supported a single African liberation group in Africa. It is not lost on Black Americans that the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela were considered terrorists by the U.S. No African rebel movement seeking independence from the Dutch, British, French, German, Portuguese or Italian colonizers of African lands ever received a single drop of military support from Washington. The U.S. never supported the Mau Mau in Kenya, nor Frelimo in Mozambique, nor the ANC in South Africa, or any other revolutionary movement on the continent. 
In fact, the contrary is true. From the coup against Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana to the assassination of Patrice Lumuumba in the Congo, to the capture of Nelson Mandela and to the support the racist apartheid system of South African and the murderous colonial regime in the former Rhodesia, the American government has consistently and forcefully opposed revolutionary movements in Africa and in fact supported their colonial oppressors. The only country to ever militarily support African liberation was Cuba, not the U.S. Regarding Mandela, (who the U.S. considered a terrorist) we heard him clearly when, in response to a request to condemn Fidel Castro, Yassar Arafat and Mommar Ghadifi, he said, your enemies are not necessarily our enemies. Indeed, not only did Castro send troops to aid the Angolans in defeating the South Africans, he also provided refuge for many African American freedom fighters, from Robert Williams to Assata Shakur. While the U.S. was infiltrating, surveilling and murdering Black political activists in the Black Panther Party, leaders of North Vietnam, China, Algeria and Cuba welcomed them as ambassadors of the African American community. 
“It is clear to African Americans that America never supported a single African liberation group.” 
Understanding this historical reality, Black thinkers are justifiably critical and suspicious of U.S. intentions in places like Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya. The greatest thinkers in African American culture explicitly made the connection between the U.S. and European colonialism abroad, in places like Syria, as an extension of the domestic policy of treating African Americans as second class citizens – or, as some African American thinkers have argued, the domestic colonization of Black people. The genocide of the Native Americans resonates with Black Americans. Leaders from MLK, who connected America’s imperialism in Vietnam, and the tax dollars used to support it, to the lack of financial resources available to be used to build cities and provide a basic wage; to Malcolm, who traveled the globe making personal connections with African heads of state, including Nasser in Egypt. It was Malcolm who saw the historic opportunity of the Bandung Conference, where 29 Asian and African, post-colonial nations, met to discuss their own fates independent of colonial powers, including the U.S. 
Black American support for anti-imperialist movements did not find a space in the Times’ analysis of Syria. The writers and editorial staff at the Times are oblivious to the histories of the Third World peoples living in their midst. Therefore, for Black people who understand this history, they recognize articles like the one published in the Times as imperial propaganda pieces for global white supremacy. Yet, the Times , in that regard, is no different than any other white American newspaper, magazine or news program or politician. They all (even, or especially, the Black ones) present a Eurocentric worldview that excludes the ideas, histories and analysis of its black population. We are irrelevant. We serve the function we have always served: subjects of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign policy. Blacks can nominally participate in the American experience, but only so long as we stay in our place and as long as we support the “manifest destiny” of the global hegemon and not get in its way. We are cannon fodder for the imperialist wars abroad and casualties in the U.S. war on drugs and on poor Black life at home. 
“Malcolm traveled the globe making personal connections with African heads of state, including Nasser in Egypt.” 
The presence of a black face at the head of the empire has provided cover for U.S. imperialism in Africa and Asia, but it has not diminished the anti-imperialism of the black community. It has silenced the voices of the self-appointed black “leaders” and revealed them to be supporters of empire and oppression. The Times , too, or rather again, reveals itself as a supporter of the Pentagon by publishing an article that is short on true analysis of America’s support of terrorists in Syria, as well as presenting a limited, white supremacist parameter of debate. Although the African American tradition of anti-imperialism may not be important to the Times , it is a tradition that is still alive nonetheless. And neither the Black face of the empire, nor the white press in service to it, can diminish it. Our antagonism against imperialism may not be publicized in the pages of the Times , but it lives on in our continued support for amnesty for Assata Shakur, the release of all political prisoners from Leonard Peltier to Jalil Muntiquim and Oscar Rivera Lopez, to support for Palestinian self-determination, to opposition to the re-colonization of Africa by America’s Africa Command, to the growing support by Black athletes, young and old, of Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the National Anthem, to our opposition to all U.S. wars of aggression, including the ones in Libya and Syria. African Americans’ opposition to the U.S. supported aggression in Syria, masquerading as humanitarian support, is obviously irrelevant to the Times , but Malcolm X told us plainly years ago, that the media would have us thinking the good guy was the bad guy and vice versa. So whether, or even if, Assad is a “ruthless dictator,” the term the U.S. has used against everyone from Castro to Chavez, it does not therefore mean that African Americans agree that the U.S. has the right to support insurrection in Syria. We know imperialism is Euro-American, white, capitalist venture that is carried against “the darker nations,” not for them. Malcolm, Martin and Mandela taught us well. Attorney Bryan K.

1586,"ALERT – Beyoncé Calls For Blacks to REBEL Against Police – Hours Later, THIS Happened","U.S. 
Remember the last Super Bowl and Beyoncé’s half-time performance? Remember how it seemed reminiscent of the Black Panthers? Well, she is at her anti-cop rhetoric once again, and there have been some deleterious results. 
Hours after Beyoncé called on black people to take a stand, someone got the memo and massacred police officers at a protest, as per Downtrend. Although this actually happened last July, it takes on added significance considering more police officers were ambushed over the last few days. 
This seems to be a recurrent theme, and it needs to stop. Our police officers deserve respect and to be safe from targeted violence! 
Don’t get me wrong, racism is still a problem in our country, but race-baiting isn’t helping. In fact, it’s hurting! 
Race-baiting is, of course, old hat to individuals like Beyoncé, who gain part of their fame from their status as famous black artists, not just as famous artists. 
However, liberals such as Beyoncé have yet to realize a couple of key principles. When you stoke the flames of racial tension, things invariably get worse. 
You promote a double standard when you call on people to rise up. This double standard led to a San Antonio police detective getting shot and killed just a few days ago. The perpetrator of the crime even admitted a few things about the motivation for his crime, which has raised concerns across the nation. 
“I lashed out at somebody who didn’t deserve it,” this perpetrator said. While most people will celebrate the holidays, the San Antonio Police Department is going to be arranging a funeral for the latest victim of violence. A family will be in mourning. 
This tension has been brewing for a few decades now. This type of victim mentality has started with the liberalism that has infiltrated every institution in our country. 
Nowadays, people are happy to cry racism even at the smallest slight. It has led to an inevitable conclusion: the violence against police officers has increased. However, while these men are just doing their job and getting killed for it, the true perpetrators of the crime will never be charged. 
Those who incite violence against police officers deserve some serious consequences. 
This definitely includes the racist Beyoncé, who has contributed to violence against innocent, honorable Americans. ",0

1588,Assange Demands Sweden Drop Arrest Warrant,"STOCKHOLM (AFP)  —   WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange filed a new motion in Sweden Wednesday calling for a European arrest warrant over rape allegations to be dropped, after the United States said it was seeking to arrest him, his lawyer said. [The    Australian denies the accusations in Sweden that date back to 2010, which he fears will see him extradited to the United States.  He has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 and risks being arrested by British police as soon as he steps out of the building. His Swedish lawyer Per Samuelsson said the new motion was filed because US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in April that arresting Assange would be “a priority”. “This implies that we can now demonstrate that the US has a will to take action  …     this is why we ask for the arrest warrant to be cancelled so that Julian Assange can fly to Ecuador and enjoy his political asylum,” Samuelsson told AFP. He said the motion was filed in a Stockholm court on Wednesday and that it should take two to three weeks for a ruling. Assange fears imprisonment in the United States over the leaking by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of secret US military and diplomatic documents that first gained attention in 2010. He has made numerous appeals to Swedish courts, including the Supreme Court, but has lost eight bids to cancel the arrest warrant. Swedish judges have refused to take into account the opinion of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which in February 2016 said Assange “was arbitrarily detained” by Sweden and Britain and called for the warrant to be annulled.",0
1589,Donald Trump Concedes Russia’s Interference in Election - The New York Times,"  Donald J. Trump on Wednesday conceded for the first time that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against the two major political parties during the presidential election, but he angrily rejected unsubstantiated reports that Moscow had gathered compromising personal and financial information about him that could be used for extortion. In a chaotic news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan nine days before he is to be sworn in as the nation’s 45th president, Mr. Trump compared United States intelligence officials to Nazis, sidestepped repeated questions about whether he or anyone in his presidential campaign had had contact with Russia during the campaign, and lashed out at the news media and political opponents, arguing that they were out to get him. “As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,” Mr. Trump said, his first comments accepting the conclusions of United States intelligence officials that Moscow had interfered in the election to help him win. But the   expressed little outrage about that breach and seemed to cast doubt on Russia’s role moments after acknowledging it, asserting that “it could have been others also. ” He also quoted a Kremlin denial Tuesday night of reports that it had gathered damaging information to compromise Mr. Trump. “They said it totally never happened,” Mr. Trump said of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his government. “I respected the fact that he said that. ” The news conference displayed the showmanship, combativeness and sensitivity to criticism that Mr. Trump exhibited throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and underscored his reflex to rebut any criticism or question about his conduct. In his maligning of the nation’s intelligence agencies, journalists and Hillary Clinton, the   indicated that he would conduct himself the same way in the White House. Using the same boastful tone that characterized his campaign rallies, Mr. Trump asserted that his victory in November had vindicated his view that he should not release his tax returns, an issue that he said only the news media cared about, not the public. “I won,” he said. “I don’t think they care at all. ” In a Pew Research Center poll this month, 60 percent of respondents said Mr. Trump should release his returns, although just 38 percent of Republican respondents said he should. Some moments bordered on bizarre for the next president of the United States. Mr. Trump spoke of his awareness as a businessman that there were hidden cameras in hotel rooms in Moscow and other foreign capitals. He called himself “very much of a germaphobe,” apparently in an effort to discredit unsubstantiated claims about sex videos with Mr. Trump and prostitutes in a Russian hotel. “Does anyone really believe that story?” he said, calling it “phony stuff” that “never happened. ” At one point, Mr. Trump got into a confrontation with a correspondent for CNN, which was among the first to report on the allegations, saying to him, “You are fake news. ” Moments later, though, Mr. Trump called on another CNN correspondent. A person who identified himself as a correspondent for RT, the Russian   news organization that American intelligence agencies deem a Russian propaganda tool, shouted repeatedly in vain attempts to draw Mr. Trump’s attention. Mr. Trump voiced only faint concern about what United States intelligence officials said was a campaign by Mr. Putin to meddle in American democracy. He reserved his sharpest condemnation for American intelligence officials who he said had failed to keep secret the accusations that could be damaging to him. On Wednesday, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. said he had spoken with Mr. Trump that evening and expressed his “profound dismay” over the leaks of unsubstantiated information. He said he had emphasized that this information was “not a U. S. intelligence community product” and that the intelligence agencies had not determined that it was reliable. He said he did not believe that the leaks had come from the intelligence agencies. The   asked at the news conference whether he believed that Mr. Putin had directed the hacking effort to help him win the presidency, said, “If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. ” “He shouldn’t be doing it,” Mr. Trump said later of the Russian president. “He won’t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I’m leading than when other people have led it. ” Of the intelligence officials who will soon serve him, Mr. Trump said: “I think it was disgraceful  —   disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. That’s something that Nazi Germany would have done, and did do. ” He did not address whether the sanctions President Obama imposed on Moscow for the cyberattacks should stay or be strengthened as some Republicans have urged, especially as the scope of the hacking has become clearer. The hourlong news conference  —   Mr. Trump’s first in nearly six months  —   touched not only on reports of espionage and attempted blackmail, but also on potential conflicts of interest with Mr. Trump’s vast business empire and questions about domestic policy. The glut of   questions for the   gave him an advantage in navigating the exchange he interrupted inquiries about Russia’s hacking to introduce a lawyer, Sheri L. Dillon, who spoke at length about how Mr. Trump would organize his business affairs and explain why he was not divesting from his global business empire. “  Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built,” Ms. Dillon said. Mr. Trump offered glimpses of his plans for his first days in office, including pledging to choose a Supreme Court nominee within two weeks of Inauguration Day to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia and to invite journalists to watch a series of “signings” at the White House, an apparent allusion to the several executive orders he has promised to sign to roll back major pieces of Mr. Obama’s agenda. Calling himself “the greatest   that God ever created,” Mr. Trump pledged to continue leaning on American companies to keep jobs in the United States. He took particular aim at the pharmaceutical industry, which he said “has been disastrous” and had been “getting away with murder” on drug pricing. Taking on a powerful lobby that Republicans have long defended, Mr. Trump said he wanted the federal government to use its purchasing power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid  —   a proposal long favored by Democrats. But he broke starkly with Democrats over the Affordable Care Act as he repeated a promise to submit a plan to repeal and replace the law “essentially simultaneously,” as soon as Representative Tom Price, his choice to be secretary of health and human services, is confirmed. “Obamacare is the Democrats’ problem,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday. “We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service. ” He also insisted, despite repeated denials by Mexican officials, that Mexico would pay to build a wall on the southern border of the United States to block foreigners from entering illegally. Mr. Trump said Vice   Mike Pence was working with federal agencies to begin construction quickly, and asserted that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the cost through a tax or other payment. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, reiterated Wednesday that his country would not pay for the wall, but said it would invest in more border security. In front of Mr. Trump was a table stacked with manila folders that he said contained paperwork for a portion of the companies being put into a trust to be controlled and run by his eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr. and a trustee. They stood to his side along with his daughter Ivanka Trump, who also announced on Wednesday that she would sever ties with the Trump Organization and her own company. Closing the news conference, Mr. Trump even got in a veiled plug for his former reality show, “The Apprentice”  —   he remains an executive producer of the current version, “Celebrity Apprentice”  —   by saying that if his sons did not manage his empire well while he served as president, he would tell them, “You’re fired. ”",0
1590,The Top 100 Most Damaging WikiLeaks,"vault.fbi.gov (p. 44) “Early in Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, she and her staff were observed removing lamps and furniture from the State Department which were transported to her residence in Washington, DC,” After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return tens of thousands of dollars worth of White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen. The fact that she stole State Department furniture shouldn’t shock anyone as she has a history of doing it. 63. Hillary told Tim Kaine back in July 2015 he would be VP www.wikileaks.org “…HRC has personally told Tim Kaine he’s the veep.” “Won’t stop assuring Sens Brown and Heitkamp (at dinner now) that HRC has personally told Tim Kaine he’s the veep.” Kaine claims he only knew 48 hours before the announcement. This solidifies all theories that he dropped out as the DNC chair so that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz could replace him (and help ensure she rigged the primary for Hillary against Bernie as evidenced in earlier leaks) and open door for Kaine to be VP. This is despite her saying he would be a terrible choice for Obama’s VP in her book when she was talking about the last election. But she needed Debbie in charge to ensure she was the nominee. 64. Hillary tweaks her policies based on donors’ wants wikileaks.org “Raisers are effectively salespeople selling the candidate on the donor marketplace, so their feedback is valuable to HQ in terms of tweaking policy, messaging, tone, etc … big donors usually have ideas/advice and want to feel like they are being heard.” These leaks prove that Hillary will do anything for money, regardless of morals. Her staff even comments often about how worrisome it is. She takes money from countries who (under Sharia law) kill gay people, enslave women, and persecute Christians, but turns a blind eye to it as long as she gets paid. She changes her policies based on who gives her what. She sells U.S. assets to countries who donate in pay-to-play schemes… what a mess… 65. Hillary camp admits it doesn’t support $15 minimum wage wikileaks.org “Substantively, we have not supported $15 – you will get a fair number of liberal economists who will say it will lose jobs.” Even if they flip-flop and say they will implement it, they still admit that it is bad for the economy according to liberal economists. 66. Illegally coordinating with Priorities USA, a SuperPAC funded by George Soros wikileaks.org “So afraid that NYT is going with this story on Priorities whether we like it or not. They have sources about the meetings.” They were scrambling to make sure they were within the law and really worried the donor list was about to come out. The New York Times spiked the story about the corruption to protect her, shielding the donors which OpenSecrets.org shares with us from a later disclosure . As you can see clearly there, the top contributor is none other than George Soros with $6 million in. Staff from the two groups met and coordinated efforts, which caused the concern from Hillary’s side because the Priorities USA people were talking and the media, specifically the New York Times, hid this violation of campaign election law. 67. Racist and sexist remarks: “too white and too male” wikileaks.org “Reed’s lists are still too big, too undifferentiated too white and too male.” Just because the people being referred to are white and male does not stop it from being racist. Just replace it with black and female and you can see why. Race and gender should not be the main determining factor when it comes to administrative positions, only experience and merit, but for Hillary’s staff, race and gender are the determining factors unfortunately. 68. Podesta illegally has access to top secret information wikileaks.org “Two exceptions–White House requests he can handle by email; if any other emergency request comes up, I can process. I’m holding a TS clearance. Scott, you may need to figure out what we need to do to add me to the review authority.” Why does Podesta have a top secret clearance? He’s not holding a government position… 69. Podesta connects to unsecure network where anyone could access classified files wikileaks.org “Yes inbox finally opened up. I should never connect to Amtrack wifi. Seems to always screw things up.” Holds top secret (TS) clearance, and conducts official campaign business on unsecure Amtrak WiFi… These are the people Hillary will trust to secure our secrets once in office. 70. Hillary’s speechwriters: “I don’t mind the ‘backs of dead Americans’ because we need a bit of moral outrage.” (Benghazi) wikileaks.org One prominent theme throughout the leaks is that Hillary is just a put together political head piece that is drafted, rewritten, and approved before being sent into public. They note where she should be outraged, they note where she should smile, she even sighed when they told her to sigh. All of the words coming out of her mouth go through weeks of tweaking so that she comes off as likable as possible. 71. The AP colluding with the Hillary campaign wikileaks.org “They do not plan to release anything publicly, so no posting online or anything public-facing, just to the committee. That said, they are considering placing a story with a friendly at the AP (Matt Lee or Bradley Klapper), that would lay this out before the majority on the committee has a chance to realize what they have and distort it.” And the AP is supposed to be THE NEUTRAL news source… wow… 72. Hillary’s camp says she has a “character problem” and is “arrogant” wikileaks.org “I know this email thing isn’t on the level. I’m fully aware of that. But her inability to just do a national interview and communicate genuine feelings of remorse and regret is now, I fear, becoming a character problem (more so than honesty). People hate her arrogant, like her down. It’s a sexist context, but I think it’s the truth.” Her closest confidants admitting what everyone already knows. She is not genuine. 73. Staging fake anti-Trump protest, conspiring with Univision CEO wikileaks.org “Thinking about the early 4, there is the Trump International Hotel in Vegas. Maybe there is an organizing opportunity next week. Would be good to reach out to unite here.” Previous leaks months ago proved many of the “protests” were staged and they hired people to be there with professional signs. The James O’Keefe bombshell video ( first one ) proves that all these “protests” were all staged and they paid mentally ill people to incite violence. 74. Meeting to go over Cheryl Mills’ testimony wikileaks.org “Please see below for today’s 8am meeting agenda. Also, please note that this meeting should last a full hour” Lists items to talk about “Timing of Focus Groups re Debate Prep” “8/31 Email Release” “Jake/Cheryl Testimony.” This is a memo revealing that they were discussing the testimony of Cheryl Mills in meetings. It must have been highly important to keep all of their stories straight, properly vetted and discussed. 75. Iran nuclear deal was “greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler” wikileaks.org “This agreement condemns the next generation to cleaning up a nuclear war in the Persian Gulf… Yup.” Top Hillary advisor agrees with that statement, indicating they know the Iran deal was terrible despite what they state publicly (another public vs private position). 76. Journalist talks strategy with Clinton staff and asks for permission to write article www.wikileaks.org “am not going to raise this publicly, but one of HRC’s opponents will soon charge that she is running an “imperial campaign.” If it is the right opponent, Democrat or Republican, the charge will resonate.” “BTW, I may doing an Elizabeth Warren column soon. If I write that my optimum scenario would be for Elizabeth to ultimately give a big endorsement to HRC and give the keynote speech at the Convention, totally off the record, would that give you a problem? It would be my personal opinion only, but if you have a problem with my suggesting this as my idea, I won’t tell anyone and I won’t include it, deferring to you” Yes. This supposed journalist is discussing strategy with the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign. Giving him information and warnings about things he learned from other sources most likely off the record. Extreme collusion between the media and Hillary’s staff. But wait, there is more! He is asking permission from Podesta to write parts of an article. John Podesta responds to the email, and grants permission for the journalist to write the story as originally planned. 77. Bill Clinton admits Clinton Foundation has no “real projects” “He also said he’s worried about the pensions commitment and not having real projects to announce at CGI america. I said we are concerned too…” It was also mentioned that the employees are unhappy. 78. Violating campaign finance law wikileaks.org “I’m swinging way above my weight class here. And I’m 100% sure this out of protocol. I’m trying to land the campaign a big fat whale that can give between $100,000 to maybe $1 million if their ego can be reassured that they won’t be just treated “just like any other donor. With your permission, can I CC you in an email to these guys. I’m work with Haim Saban’s political director on these same guys. If it’s 100% inappropriate I understand.” Haim Saiban is the owner of Univision, who has been working with Hillary as revealed throughout the leaks. 79. Interfering with the 2008 Republican primary process wikileaks.org “Yes, we need to move with some tactics to try to stop him. Ideas? We should take another swing at the immigration angle. I think this is a crisis. We need to ring the alarm bell. But I’m not sure how we could affect the GOP primary? Earned media play on McCain and immigration. Robocalls to suppress his vote? Turnout evangelicals for Huck?” What right do they have to interfere in another party’s primaries? 80. Proof that ‘Correct the Record’ (SuperPAC) is directly coordinating with the Hillary campaign against federal campaign law www.wikileaks.com (in attachments) “In May of 2015, CTR separated from its parent organization, American Bridge, and became its own SuperPAC. This structure allows CTR to retain its independence but coordinate directly and strategically with the Hillary campaign. This work is necessary now more than ever.” Correct the Record (CTR) is a group funded by globalist billionaire George Soros to pretend Hillary has support online. They pay “an army of nerd virgins” ( their own words ) to create memes and pretend to support Hillary. On popular internet sites like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook, they are paid to ‘downvote’ or ‘dislike’ or delete anything pro-Trump/anti-Hillary, and fake-promote anything pro-Hillary/anti-Trump. Incredibly sad, but Hillary and her “support” is staged in every department. The same attachment describes everything. 81. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in direct contact with the Hillary campaign wikileaks.org t[He is] particularly interested in meeting people who could help him understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy issues he cares most about. He wants to meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective political operations to advance public policy goals” They are basically saying he wants to learn how to bribe people. Mark Zuckerberg has been very outspoken about Trump and his wall idea, when he himself is building a large wall around his mansion. Facebook also manipulates it’s trending stories to not show pro-Trump/anti-Hillary articles or trends, and even censors videos against Hillary . The censorship is well known and has reduced Facebook’s integrity tenfold. Pro-Trump stories with hundreds of thousands of mentions are deleted to allow room for anti-Trump articles with less than a thousand mentions. Happens literally daily. Unfortunately this is the case across Twitter , YouTube , Google , and Reddit as well (and why it seems like at times more support Hillary despite Trump getting 30,000 at his rallies and Hillary getting 200 ). They are in the tank for Hillary. 82. Hillary’s team working with hundreds of MSM news pundits www.wikileaks.com (in attachments) “IMPACTING THE DIALOGUE: CTR has identified 372 surrogates including influential and frequent pundits on broadcast and cable news for Presidential 2016 politics and provided them around 80 sets of talking points…” Once again, shows the media collusion with the Hillary campaign. 83. Katy Perry is a puppet for Hillary Clinton wikileaks.org “She said no to asking Chelsea. Would go herself before asking her daughter. So we are at plan B: Katy Perry it is.” Huma Abedin writes that they have to send Katy Perry to do an Arkansas event because Hillary is unwilling to ask her daughter to go. Katy Perry is such a puppet for them that they can use her as a replacement for Chelsea when needed. 84. Hillary tries to hide her tiny rallies",0

1592,Undercover Muslim Woman is Offered to Commit Voter Fraud for Hillary,"
Last December, Project Veritas caught NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City. He explained how Muslims can use burkas as a way to commit voter fraud.
Project Veritas wanted to test this theory by sending an undercover journalist dressed in full burka to Huma Abedin’s polling location to see if they could vote. Shockingly, an election official offered the PV journalist Huma Abedin’s ballot.
PV Journalist: “Not even just voter ID because of people voting twice, but people can like cover their faces, you know what I’m saying?”
Alan Schulkin: “The Muslims can do that too. You don’t know who they are.”
PV Journalist: “The Muslims, yeah. Especially, all those Burkas. Someone could claim oh it’s my religion, but you don’t know if they are pretending or not.”
Alan Schulkin: “Exactly.”
Alan Schulkin: “Your vote doesn’t even count even, because they can go in there with a burka and you don’t know if they are a voter. Your vote gets discounted because they come in there with a burka on and they can vote. People think that it’s a liberal thing to do, but I take my vote seriously, and I don’t want ten other people coming in negating my vote by voting for the other candidate when they aren’t even registered voters.”
Election Offical: “Goodmorning. Last name.”
PV Journalist: “Abedin.”
Election Official: “Abedin.”
Election Official: “And that’s your last name?”
Election Official: “And how do you spell Abedin?”
PV Journalist: “A B E DI N.”
Election Official: “I don’t know honey. I’m looking for it in the books. But your name is not in the book. For some reason it’s not here, but that doesn’t mean you can’t vote by paper ballot. You just can’t vote by machine”
PV Journalist: “Ok so I can vote today?”
Election Official: “By paper.”
PV Journalist: “So I can vote as Huma Abedin, but just with the paper ballot?”
Election official: “If that’s the name you voted with in the last election, and you haven’t changed your name?”

1593,"As Fake News Spreads Lies, More Readers Shrug at the Truth - The New York Times","HAM LAKE, Minn.  —   One morning last week, Larry Laughlin, a retired business owner, opened his shiny black Dell laptop and scrolled through Facebook. Most of the posts were ordinary news stories from conservative sites: Donald J. Trump’s deal with the Carrier company. The political tussle over the recount. But a few items were his guilty pleasures. “I like this guy,” said Mr. Laughlin, looking at a post by the conservative commentator and author Mark Dice. Mr. Dice has promoted conspiracy theories that the Jade Helm military training exercise last year was preparation for martial law and that the Sept. 11 attacks were an “inside job. ” But Mr. Laughlin likes him for what he said was his humorous political commentary and his sarcastic     interviews. “I just like the satisfaction,” said Mr. Laughlin, who started his own business and lives in an affluent Twin Cities suburb. “It’s like a hockey game. Everyone’s got their goons. Their goons are pushing our guys around, and it’s great to see our goons push back. ” The proliferation of fake and hyperpartisan news that has flooded into Americans’ laptops and living rooms has prompted a national   with liberals across the country asking how a nation of millions could be marching to such a suspect drumbeat. But while some Americans may take the stories literally  —   like the North Carolina man who fired his gun in a Washington pizzeria on Sunday trying to investigate a false story spread online of a   ring led by Hillary Clinton  —   many do not. The larger problem, experts say, is less extreme but more insidious. Fake news, and the proliferation of raw opinion that passes for news, is creating confusion, punching holes in what is true, causing a kind of   effect that leaves the reader doubting everything, including real news. That has pushed up the political temperature and increased polarization. No longer burdened with wrestling with the possibility that they might be wrong, people on the right and the left have become more entrenched in their positions, experts say. In interviews, people said they felt more empowered, more attached to their own side and less inclined to listen to the other. Polarization is fun, like cheering a goal for the home team. “There are an alarming number of people who tend to be credulous and form beliefs based on the latest thing they’ve read, but that’s not the wider problem,” said Michael Lynch, a professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut. “The wider problem is fake news has the effect of getting people not to believe real things. ” He described the thinking like this: “There’s no way for me to know what is objectively true, so we’ll stick to our guns and our own evidence. We’ll ignore the facts because nobody knows what’s really true anyway. ” News that is fake or only marginally real has lurked online  —   and in supermarket tabloids  —   for years, but never before has it played such a prominent role in an American election and its aftermath. Narrowly defined, “fake news” means a   story with an intention to deceive, often geared toward getting clicks. But the issue has become a political battering ram, with the left accusing the right of trafficking in disinformation, and the right accusing the left of tarring conservatives as a way to try to censor websites. In the process, the definition of fake news has blurred. “Fake news is subjective,” Mr. Laughlin said. “It depends on who’s defining it. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. ” For Mr. Laughlin, conservative sites are a balm for the soul in a liberal world whose narrative of America, he says, seems to diminish him and all that he has accomplished. He was his own legal guardian at 16, after his mother fled his alcoholic father. He built his metal finishing business from scratch after earning an associate degree from a community college. The company he owned employs about 17 people. He and his wife adopted three   children. “My struggles in life are just dismissed,” he said, recalling being lectured by one of his children’s liberal friends at a party in his large home. “‘You have a nice house and got it made because you are a white guy.’ There are all of these preconceived notions that I’m a racist, idiot, a bigot, and oh, uneducated. ” He feels alienated from the conventional news media for some of the same reasons. “It’s like an inside joke for people on the left, and we are the butt of the joke,” he said of one   website. “At some point, we stopped listening. ” Mr. Laughlin likes news that strikes back against that. These days, he takes the most pleasure in watching clips strung together by conservative websites of liberal commentators sneering about how ridiculous Donald J. Trump was as a candidate and how he had no chance at becoming president. “This is like our sweet release after the election,” Mr. Laughlin said. He said the hyperpartisan environment left him craving intense content. “I’m picking through the fruit and looking for the reddest apple,” he said. But Mr. Laughlin avoids news that looks false, like a story after the election that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, and said he was careful not to click on such items to deny them advertising revenue. He said he cringed when he heard about the incident in the pizza restaurant. “It adds to the stereotype that we’re all nutters,” he said. “We’ll all get lumped together with this guy. ” Adding to the confusion is the fact that Mr. Trump and some members of his team have promoted false items, too, such as that millions of people voted illegally. A similar story had circulated on the site of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones some days before. For Clayton Montgomery, 57, a retired state department of transportation worker in Waynesville, N. C. the numbers may not be precisely right, but the broad outlines rang true. “All of a sudden they got this big push of registered voters,” Mr. Montgomery said, referring to California. “They were all illegals. The same thing in the state of Washington, Los Angeles and Houston, too. ” He said that Mr. Jones, who has called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, “can get a little conspiratorial,” but added that he “raises some very logical and important questions. ” Mr. Montgomery has concerns about immigration. He lived for years in South Florida, where he had a painting business that was deeply affected by cheap labor from Hispanic immigrants. “They can’t say that these people are not taking jobs away from American citizens,” he said. “They come up and they lowball. It hurts a lot of people. ” Another story online alleged that Mexico had a wall along its southern border “with guard towers,” Mr. Montgomery said, to keep “all these other countries from coming in. ” (Mr. Laughlin saw that one, too, but pointed out that the photograph that accompanied the story was from Israel.) Mr. Montgomery pushed back: “Check it out, it’s true!” Mr. Montgomery said he was nostalgic for the news of old, when Walter Cronkite delivered it. But the reputation of the press has been tarnished, he said, and people are left to navigate the fractured landscape on their own. The online content can be frustrating, with headlines that promise more than the story delivers. He noted one with a headline along the lines of “The wait is over Hillary’s being indicted. ” “But then you click and there’s nothing in there about her being indicted,” Mr. Montgomery said. “It’s almost like looking at a menu in a restaurant. Oh, that sounds delicious, it sounds great, and then it’s this teeny weeny thing you maybe get three bites of. ” Fake and hyperpartisan news from the right has been more conspicuous than from the left, but both sides indulge. BuzzFeed analyses have found more on the right. Some purveyors have said   items are more profitable. But the left has its share. The   site Snopes said it found no evidence for a quotation, often attributed to Mr. Trump by the left, that Republican voters were stupid. That type of insult increases the partisan divide. Paul Indre, a project manager for a hardware goods company in Akron, Ohio, who gets his news from podcasts and television, avoids much of online news. But he understands why people go there in a polarized era. Mr. Indre, a moderate Republican, said he remained vigilant against fake news. “If I’m in a Trump group and someone will share something that’s fake news,” he said, “I’ll ask them ‘Hey did you check that? ’” But it is often impossible to tell whether “they are just lobbing a bomb, or do they really believe it?” he said. “You have some folks who are a little naïve, who don’t follow the news and believe it. I mean, people do buy The National Enquirer and believe it. ” “But some of it might be revenge factor, getting back at something they are hearing from the left,” he said. “Maybe they are just reacting to something. Maybe we are just in this reactionary period. ”",0

1595,‘I Don’t Know.’ But Does He? The Hidden Meaning of Trump’s Words - The New York Times,"When we invited the columnist Thomas Friedman onto The   to discuss the latest tempest surrounding Donald J. Trump, we had no idea that his column would touch off a   of its own. In it, Mr. Friedman compared a remark by Donald J. Trump  —   widely interpreted as a call for gun owners anxious about Hillary Clinton to take the law into their own hands  —   to the kind of incendiary political language that Mr. Friedman said had incited the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel in 1995. “His children,” Mr. Friedman wrote of Mr. Trump, “should be ashamed of him. ” Right before we taped the show, a prominent fellow journalist, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, scolded Mr. Friedman for engaging in “hyperbolic” and “excessive” criticism in the column by mentioning Mr. Trump’s children as he did. “That makes no sense,” said Mr. Woodward, who argued that there should be a “zone of protection” around a candidate’s children. On today’s episode, Mr. Friedman rejects that argument, saying that Mr. Trump had forfeited any such “zone of protection” when his children became top advisers to his campaign and highly public spokesmen for it. “Oh my God. I mean, who are the main speakers at Trump’s convention?” Mr. Friedman asked. “They are his kids. Who has he cited as his top advisers? His kids. ” An edited excerpt from our interview: I asked whether Mr. Friedman was trying to encourage Mr. Trump’s children to intervene and rein in their father.  “If you want to change his behavior, it seems to me legitimate to call on them,” he said. In the same episode, we asked a former top employee of Mr. Trump’s, Barbara Res, once the head of construction at his company, whether the inflammatory language he is now using resembled his choice of words and his shading of the truth as a boss in the workplace. Her answer? “Absolutely. ” Ms. Res, the author of “All Alone on the 68th Floor,” a memoir about her days as a woman in the   construction industry, said Mr. Trump’s inaccurate claim that Hillary Clinton was a “founder of ISIS” reminded her of how he talked in the office. “For one thing he tends to exaggerate tremendously,” she said. “Like the thing about being the founder of ISIS. ” “He used to do that all the time. He would make a tremendously exaggerated remark, or make something up that wasn’t even exaggerated, and then he would pounce on it and repeat it,” Ms. Res recalled.

Bill Cassidy’s Town Hall,"A group of 200 locals expressed their displeasure during the opening prayer and Pledge of Allegiance at Sen. Bill Cassidy’s ( ) town hall in Louisiana Wednesday night, Independent Journal Review (IJR.) reported.[  Some constituents began shouting, “Pray on your own time” and “let’s get on with it” at the chaplain while others chanted, “Separation of church and state”: As a local veteran took the stage to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, the crowd continued shouting, “We want answers” and “Do your job,” National Review reported. Despite the heckling, the veteran managed to remain on stage until he was finished. By the time Sen. Cassidy arrived at the town hall 20 minutes late, he was met with a    reception from the crowd. Sen. Cassidy received a tense reception from the crowd throughout the speech, especially when President Trump or Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was mentioned, the   reported. “If all you want to do is vent, this will not be profitable,” Cassidy warned the audience.

After mocking her, he argued her detractors should relent and allow her to speak, but also said that she didn’t actually want to speak at Berkeley. “[L]ook man, she’s right about the free speech thing, but here’s my opinion,” he said. “Even though Ann Coulter is clearly trolling and doing this for the publicity of not letting her speak, they should just let her speak. Because you realize, she doesn’t actually want to speak. She wants to be stopped from speaking. ” “The truth is, a side effect of free speech is that there will always be hate speech,” Noah added. “If you ban one, you risk banning the other. Like you might call Ann Coulter ‘hate speech,’ but then what’s to stop Jeff Sessions from calling Black Lives Matter ‘hate speech?’ If there is one idea America has given the world, it’s the idea of absolute free speech. ” (  Daily Beast) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
1598,N.B.A. Free Agency: Who’s Going Where - The New York Times,"Over the last two seasons, the proposed solution to nearly every N. B. A. team’s problems has been simple: Sign Kevin Durant when he hits free agency. Now that he is about to hit the open market, only a handful of teams will even have a chance to talk to him. The rest? They’ll have to try something else. Durant can meet with his current team, the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday. At 12:01 a. m. Eastern on Friday, teams (including the Thunder) can begin discussing contract specifics with him or any other free agent. With the salary cap expected to increase to around $90 million, and a free agent class that is fairly thin on superstars, more than a few gigantic deals will be handed out to players that probably do not justify the expense. Durant turns 28 shortly before the   season begins, and he already owns four scoring titles and a career average of 27. 4 points a game. He is a deceptively large forward  —   despite being listed at    he was photographed at Team USA practice next to the    DeMarcus Cousins and was clearly an inch or two taller  —   and is one of the most versatile and dominant offensive players in the game’s history. Landing Spot: It is still highly likely that Durant will choose to stay with Oklahoma City, either through a max extension or through one of the   1+1 deals that would make him a free agent next season. The next most likely landing spot is Golden State, a team that won a record 73 games a season ago, but is likely looking to retool some to make them less vulnerable to the attacks Cleveland used against them to win the N. B. A. title. Golden State also has the financial flexibility to give Durant anything he wants. Decisions are likely to be announced for many players as early as Friday morning. Players can agree to terms with a team on Friday, but contracts cannot be signed until July 7. As DeAndre Jordan proved with dramatic flair last season  —   he agreed to terms with the Dallas Mavericks and then chose to return to the Clippers at the last minute  —   nothing is final until the contract is signed. A look at the free agent pool reveals plenty of players who can help teams get better. Here’s what to look for during the N. B. A. ’s “silly season. ” LeBron James may have opted out of his player option for the coming season, but he has stated that he intends to remain with the Cleveland Cavaliers and there is little reason not to believe him. After winning his third career championship, and his first in Cleveland, there is little left for James to prove. Anyone familiar with him, however, knows he has no intention of backing off. It is hard to believe that    Dirk Nowitzki would leave the Dallas Mavericks, even though he was briefly rumored to have drawn the interest of the Warriors. Tim Duncan was also on the verge of free agency, but he quickly erased any drama by exercising a $5. 6 million player option to stay with the San Antonio Spurs. He may choose to retire, but there is officially no threat of him pulling a “Hakeem Olajuwon to the Raptors. ” The biggest prize beyond Durant and James is Andre Drummond, the dominant center of the Detroit Pistons. Just 22, Drummond had a breakout season, averaging 16. 2 points and a   14. 8 rebounds a game. He is remarkably durable and despite making Shaquille O’Neal look like Mark Price in terms of   accuracy, he is the type of player a team can build around. Unfortunately for teams interested in his services, he is a restricted free agent, and Detroit will probably match any offer that comes his way. Two intriguing players in terms of defense and chemistry are center Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks and small forward Nicolas Batum of the Charlotte Hornets. Both veterans help a team on offense and defense and do a great job of making the players around them better. Horford’s age, and Batum’s lack of flash, do make them unusual players for a huge payday. There are some strong options at guard available in DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors and Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies. Conley, 28, is the best point guard available, and DeRozan, 26, is a     at shooting guard who has averaged more than 20 points a game in each of the last three seasons. There are a number of restricted free agents available that could help any team that could find a way to pry them away from their current homes. Shooting guard Bradley Beal of the Washington Wizards averaged 17. 4 points a game last season and has shot 39. 7 percent from   range in his   career. Shooting guard Allen Crabbe of the Portland Trail Blazers made a huge leap this season, shooting 39. 3 percent from   range as a bench player and seems ready for a starting role. And swingman Evan Fournier of the Orlando Magic continued his steady development into a force at small forward, but the team’s trade of Victor Oladipo makes it unlikely that they would not match any offer that came in. Landing Spots: For this group, staying home is the most likely option. Drummond will almost assuredly agree to a huge offer sheet with another team, but the Pistons will simply match it. Similarly, Horford is a good bet to remain in Atlanta but could be a good fallback for Golden State if they do not get Durant. Batum will hopefully realize that he found a perfect home for himself in Charlotte and will not be tempted by losing teams that would not really benefit from his skill set. DeRozan is expected to stay with Toronto and Conley, while potentially once a good fit with the Knicks, probably is headed back to Memphis after the Derrick Rose trade. If it felt like Hassan Whiteside came out of nowhere to become a dominant force for the Miami Heat, that is because he did. In 2014, he played for Al Mouttahed Tripoli in Lebanon, Jiangsu Tongxi in China, the Iowa Energy and Sioux Falls Skyforce in the N. B. A. ’s developmental league, and then the Heat. But the   Whiteside finally got a real shot in the league and averaged 14. 2 points, 11. 8 rebounds and a   3. 7 blocks a game last season. There is no doubt someone will roll the dice on a gigantic contract for a    potential franchise center, but there are enough issues in terms of character and advanced statistics that question if he makes his team better that smarter teams may show some caution. (Note: Whiteside announced Friday he was   with the Heat.) While Whiteside may occasionally create his own problems, that is nothing compared to what Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli did to themselves in terms of their pending restricted free agency with their performances in the N. B. A. Finals. Expected to cruise to    titles, the Golden States Warriors crashed and burned thanks in large part to Barnes and Ezeli becoming shadows of themselves when it mattered most. They missed countless shots and seemed to make the team worse every time they were on the floor. That being said, Barnes is a    forward who can play the four in a smallball lineup while knocking down corner   and Ezeli is a    center capable of running the floor and dominating on both ends when healthy, so there should be plenty of money headed their way. The teams that sign them will simply have to plug their noses and pretend the playoffs never happened. The team that signs Dwight Howard will have to pretend the last four seasons never happened if Howard is going to get anywhere near the contract that people once envisioned for him. Still just 30 years old, Howard was once one of the biggest stars in the game, and he still has the ability to occasionally dominate, but back problems robbed him of much of his consistency and his ugly exits in Orlando and Los Angeles and his dramatic tenure in Houston have resulted in the public largely souring on him. For teams looking for a center, there is no one whose stock rose higher in the playoffs than Bismack Biyombo of the Toronto Raptors. Asked to step into a starting role because of an injury to Jonas Valanciunas, Biyombo thrived as a     showman who held his own under difficult circumstances. The    has come a long way since accepting a tiny deal with Toronto last season following Charlotte essentially giving up on him after four seasons. He is no sure bet to continue his spectacular play  —   his career averages of 4. 6 points and 6. 5 rebounds a game are not misprints  —   but he is tall and young and the N. B. A. loves that combination. Teams will also be kicking the tires of Joakim Noah, who is tall but no longer young. Injuries ended a tumultuous season for Noah in which he was failing to adapt to Coach Fred Hoiberg’s new system, but as a former defensive player of the year, who is also an underrated playmaker on offense, he is not likely to done at 31. But teams will have to figure out how much he realistically has left. And perhaps the biggest question mark of all belongs to swingman Lance Stephenson. Things have been awfully messy since his breakout season for the Indiana Pacers in  . Failed stints with the Bobcats and Clippers seemingly had him on his way out of the league, but a   run with the Memphis Grizzlies at the end of the season   some of his value. A   veteran, Stephenson is still just 25 and has flashed the ability to play on both ends of the court. But his value and ability to keep his head on straight are questions teams will have to think long and hard about.",0
1599,"Rusia, China y Arabia Saudita ponen en jaque la hegemonía del dólar, por Ariel Noyola Rodríguez","Rusia, China y Arabia Saudita ponen en jaque la hegemonía del dólar por Ariel Noyola Rodríguez Estados Unidos encuentra cada vez más obstáculos a su paso para mantener la hegemonía del dólar como moneda de reserva mundial. En los meses recientes, los países emergentes han vendido una gran cantidad de bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos, principalmente Rusia y China, pero ahora también Arabia Saudita. Además, a fin de protegerse de las violentas fluctuaciones del dólar, los bancos centrales de varios países han venido adquiriendo enormes volúmenes de oro a fin de diversificar sus reservas monetarias. En definitiva, la ofensiva global contra el dólar se está recrudeciendo a través de la venta masiva de deuda norteamericana y, en paralelo, compras colosales de metales preciosos.
Red Voltaire | Ciudad de México (México) | 5 de noviembre de 2016 français italiano La supremacía de Washington en el sistema financiero mundial recibió un golpe tremendo el pasado mes de agosto: Rusia, China y Arabia Saudita vendieron bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos por la suma de 37 900 millones de dólares, de acuerdo con la última actualización de datos oficiales publicada hace unos días [ 1 ]. Desde una perspectiva general, las inversiones globales en la deuda del Gobierno estadounidense se desplomaron a su nivel más bajo desde julio de 2012. Es evidente, el papel del dólar como moneda de reserva mundial nuevamente se ha puesto en cuestión.
Ya en 2010, el almirante Michael Mullen, presidente de los Jefes del Estado Mayor Conjunto de Estados Unidos, lanzó la advertencia de que la deuda representaba la principal amenaza para la seguridad nacional [ 2 ]. A mi juicio, no es tanto que un alto nivel de endeudamiento público (actualmente por encima de los 19 billones de dólares [ 3 ]) sea una piedra en el zapato para la economía estadounidense, sino que más bien para Washington es decisivo garantizar diariamente un enorme flujo de recursos desde el exterior a fin de cubrir sus déficit gemelos (comercial y presupuestario); es decir, para el Departamento del Tesoro es un asunto de vida o muerte vender títulos de deuda a todo el mundo para de esta manera poder financiar los gastos del Estado norteamericano.
Hay que recordar que tras la quiebra de Lehman Brothers, en septiembre de 2008, el Banco Popular de China se vio fuertemente presionado por Ben Bernanke, en aquel entonces presidente del Sistema de la Reserva Federal (FED), para que no vendiera sus títulos de deuda estadounidense. En un primer momento, los chinos aceptaron sostener el dólar. Sin embargo, ya en un segundo momento, el Banco Popular de China se resistió a comprar más bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos y, en simultáneo, puso en marcha un plan de diversificación de sus reservas monetarias.
Pekín ha venido comprando oro de forma masiva en los años recientes, y lo mismo ha estado haciendo el banco central de Rusia. En el segundo trimestre de 2016, las reservas de oro del Banco Popular de China alcanzaron las 1 823 toneladas frente a las 1 762 toneladas registradas el último trimestre de 2015. La Federación rusa por su parte, incrementó sus reservas de oro en alrededor de 290 toneladas entre diciembre de 2014 y junio de 2016, con lo cual, cerró el segundo trimestre de este año con un acumulado de 1 500 toneladas.
Frente a los brutales bandazos del dólar, es crucial comprar activos más seguros como el oro que, en momentos de gran inestabilidad financiera, actúa como un valor refugio. Por eso la estrategia de Moscú y Pekín de vender bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos para luego comprar oro ha sido seguida por muchos países: según las estimaciones del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), las reservas de oro de los bancos centrales del mundo alcanzan ya el nivel más alto de los últimos 15 años luego de registrar a principios de octubre un volumen total de casi 33 000 toneladas [ 4 ].
La geopolítica también está jugando su parte en la configuración de un nuevo orden financiero mundial. Tras la imposición de sanciones económicas en contra del Kremlin, a partir de 2014, la relación con China tomó gran relevancia para los rusos. Desde entonces, ambas potencias han profundizado sus vínculos en todos los ámbitos, desde la economía y las finanzas, hasta la cooperación militar. Además de comprometer el suministro de gas a China para las próximas tres décadas, el presidente Vladímir Putin construyó junto con su homólogo Xi Jinping una poderosa alianza financiera que busca terminar de una vez por todas con la dominación de la divisa estadounidense.
Actualmente, los hidrocarburos que Moscú vende a Pekín se pagan en yuanes, ya no en dólares. De este modo, la “moneda del pueblo” (‘renminbi’, en chino) se está abriendo paso poco a poco en el mercado mundial de hidrocarburos a través de los intercambios comerciales entre Rusia y China, los países que, a mi modo de ver, encabezan la construcción de un sistema monetario multipolar.
La gran novedad es que a la carrera por la desdolarización de la economía global se ha sumado Arabia Saudita, país que desde hace varias décadas se había mantenido como un aliado incondicional de la política exterior de Washington. Sorpresivamente, durante los últimos 12 meses Riad se deshizo de más de 19 000 millones de dólares invertidos en bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos, convirtiéndose junto con China, en uno de los principales vendedores de deuda norteamericana [ 5 ]. Para colmo de males, la furia del Reino Saudita contra la Casa Blanca viene incrementando su intensidad.
Sucede que a finales de septiembre, el Congreso norteamericano aprobó la eliminación del veto del presidente Barack Obama a una ley que impedía a los estadounidenses denunciar a Arabia Saudita ante tribunales por su presunta participación en los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001 [ 6 ]. Junto, la Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo (OPEP) llegó a un acuerdo histórico con Rusia para disminuir el nivel de producción de crudo y, con ello, promover un incremento de precios [ 7 ].
Es llamativo también que, justo por esos días, Pekín haya abierto la negociación directa entre el yuan y el riyal de Arabia Saudita a través del Sistema de Comercio de Divisas Extranjeras de China (CFETS, por sus siglas en inglés) a fin de realizar transacciones entre ambas monedas sin necesidad de pasar antes por el dólar [ 8 ]. En consecuencia, es altamente probable que, más temprano que tarde, la empresa petrolera Saudi Aramco acepte pagos en yuanes en lugar de dólares. De concretarse, la Casa de la Saud estaría apostando de lleno por el petroyuan [ 9 ]. Ante nuestros ojos, el mundo está cambiando.

1600,Российский мирный атом покоряет Ближний Восток | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: Ближний Восток Сооружение первой иранской АЭС рядом с г. Бушер начала немецкая компания «Kraftwerk Union» в 1974 г., во время правления последнего иранского шаха Мохаммеда Реза Пехлеви. Тогда Иран сотрудничал в атомной сфере с США и европейскими странами. После Исламской революции 1979 г. и создания Исламской Республики Иран строительство было остановлено, а Европа и США стали относиться к ядерной программе Ирана с подозрением. Начались различные санкции, в том числе – запрет на ввоз в ИРИ оборудования и материалов, связанных с атомной энергетикой. Позднее в своих ядерных исследованиях ИРИ пользовалась помощью Китая (при строительстве исследовательского реактора в г. Исфахан). Однако в те времена китайские ядерные технологии еще не достигли нынешних высот. В конце концов, единственной технически развитой страной, помогающей Ирану в его ядерной программе, стала Россия. Летом 1992 г. между Российской Федерацией и Исламской Республикой Иран был подписан договор о сотрудничестве в сфере мирного атома и строительстве АЭС. Было решено завершить работу, начатую в 1974 г. Российские специалисты проделали уникальную работу, в результате которой старые конструкции немецких строителей удалось приспособить для российской техники. Для иранской АЭС был выбран тип реактора ВВЭР-1000, который доказал свою надежность на многих АЭС в России и за рубежом. Работы начались в 1995 г. Реализация проекта не раз наталкивалась на противодействие США и их союзников. Они упорно утверждали, что Иран намерен использовать проект «Бушер» для получения собственного ядерного оружия. Многие европейские компании в связи с этим отказались сотрудничать с Ираном, несмотря на имевшиеся договоренности. Тем не менее работа продолжалась. В 2011 г. первый энергоблок АЭС «Бушер» был подключен к иранской энергосети, а в 2012 г. достиг полной мощности. Тогда иранское руководство заявляло, что пуск АЭС – доказательство мощи ИРИ и ее способности выдержать борьбу с Западом. Церемония официальной передачи станции иранской стороне состоялась в сентябре 2013 г. В тот период Иран еще находился под действием множества международных санкций, принятых против него в связи с его ядерной программой. Однако для российско-иранского сотрудничества в сфере АЭ это препятствием не стало. Дело в том, что между РФ и ИРИ существует соглашение, по которому Россия получает все отработанное топливо с иранской АЭС (при этом сама же его поставляет). Таким образом, станция не может быть источником материалов, которые можно было бы использовать в военных целях. Новая АЭС произвела на заказчика положительное впечатление. В ноябре 2014 г. в Москве состоялось подписание нескольких документов, дополнивших российско-иранский договор 1992 года. Россия и Иран расширили взаимодействие в атомной сфере. Было принято решение о строительстве трех дополнительных энергоблоков к АЭС «Бушер» и еще четырех – в другом месте. Тогда же российская группа компаний «ASE», ведущая строительство АЭС за рубежом, заключила с иранской стороной договор о строительстве двух энергоблоков. Торжественное открытие работ по проекту «Бушер-2» состоялось в сентябре 2016 г. Начало запуска второго блока АЭС ожидается осенью 2024 г., третьего блока – в 2026 г. Учитывая опыт трагедии на станции «Фукусима-1», было решено оснастить новые энергоблоки улучшенными реакторами ВВЭР с самой современной системой безопасности. Создание АЭС «Бушер» стало очень важным событием как для Ирана, так и для России. Для Ирана она стала не только надежным источником энергии, но и символом сопротивления давлению западных стран. Для России, по словам многих участников, проект «Бушер» также имеет особое значение. В трудные годы, последовавшие за распадом СССР, строительство российско-иранской АЭС стало доказательством того, что РФ сохранила свой научно-технический потенциал. Заказ иранского правительства принес российской атомной отрасли немалые денежные средства, так необходимые в то тяжелое время. Многие источники утверждают, что именно с АЭС «Бушер» начался современный этап сотрудничества России с другими странами в атомной сфере. Эта станция продемонстрировала возможности российских атомщиков всему миру и привлекла множество новых клиентов. По данным на конец 2015 г., деятельность «Росатома» охватывала 40 стран, а стоимость десятилетнего пакета заказов составила почти $111 млрд долл. Еще одним важным моментом является то, что «Бушер» пока что является первой и единственной АЭС на Ближнем Востоке. То, что мирный атом в этот регион первой принесла именно Россия, имеет немалое значение. Глядя на Иран, уже многие другие ближневосточные страны заинтересовались атомной энергетикой, и каждая из них рассматривает возможность сотрудничества с «Росатомом». Осенью 2013 г. «Росатом» выиграл тендер на строительство первой АЭС в Иордании, на который претендовало совместное японско-французское предприятие «Mitsubishi Heavy Industries» – AREVA. Сейчас уже ведется разработка технико-экономического обоснования проекта и обсуждаются вопросы финансирования. По имеющимся данным, «Росатом» станет одним из инвесторов. Подписание договора о строительстве ожидается в конце 2017 г., при этом продолжается подготовка к строительству АЭС «Аккую» в Турции. Ведутся переговоры с Египтом и Саудовской Аравией. Всего в регионе планируется построить 26 АЭС, оснащенных 90 атомными реакторами к 2030 г. Многие эксперты выражают по этому поводу беспокойство, ведь Ближний Восток – весьма неспокойный регион. Существуют опасения, что строительство АЭС может помочь различным экстремистским силам получить атомное оружие. Однако пример станции «Бушер» показывает, что при должном контроле со стороны международных организаций за работой станций и утилизацией отработанного топлива этот риск сводится к минимуму. Кроме того, само сооружение АЭС требует от заинтересованных государств усилий по сохранению стабильности и грамотной международной политики. Работа АЭС способствует экономическому, научному и социальному развитию. Все это может помочь снижению напряженности в ближневосточном регионе. Таким образом, российские атомные технологии могут повлиять в будущем на судьбу всего Ближнего Востока – одного из важнейших регионов в современной политике.

1601,How Putin Derailed the West,"shorty BY MIKE WHITNEY “Nation state as a fundamental unit of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.” — Zbigniew Brzezinski, “Between Two Ages: The Technetronic Era”, 1971 “I’m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria….not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.” — Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Third Presidential Debate W hy is Hillary Clinton so eager to intensify US involvement in Syria when US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all gone so terribly wrong? The answer to this question is simple. It’s because Clinton doesn’t think that these interventions went wrong. And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment. (aka–The Borg). In fact, in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success. Sure, a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq, (or the logistical errors, like disbanding the Iraqi Army) but–for the most part– the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washington’s diktats. This is hard for ordinary people to understand. They can’t grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washington’s 15 year-long rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all this? First, we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan. If it wasn’t part of a plan, than the decision-makers would change the policy. But they haven’t changed the policy. The policy is the same. The fact that the US is using foreign-born jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq, is not a fundamental change in the policy. The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government. This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washington’s actions. But why? What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death? Here’s what I think: I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents, the international banks and multinational corporations. Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening quote, he also explains what is taking place: The nation-state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests. Instead, Washington is erasing borders, liquidating states, and removing strong, secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region, a new world order. The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected-global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital, in other words, a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury, mutual debt, federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly. Deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought-and-paid-for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the world’s energy supplies, the world’s reserve currency and become the dominant player in this century’s most populous and prosperous region, Asia. This is essentially what Hillary’s “pivot” to Asia is all about. The basic problem with Washington’s NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it. This is what’s really going on in Syria, the improbable alliance of Russia, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks. The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed…so far. Naturally, the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments, and for good reason. The US has run the world for quite a while now, so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat. The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September, but only recently has Washington shown that it’s prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country, Raqqa. But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017. That’s when the US will directly engage Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be contained within Syria’s borders. It’s a risky plan, but it’s the next logical step in this bloody fiasco. Neither party wants a nuclear war, but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down, therefore, Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante. “No-fly zone”, anyone? The assumption is that eventually, and with enough pressure, Putin will throw in the towel. But this is another miscalculation. Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad. That’s not it at all. Putin is in Syria because he has no choice. Russia’s national security is at stake. If Washington’s strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds, then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia. Putin knows this, just like he knows that the scourge of foreign-backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya. He knows that it’s better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow. So he can’t back down, that’s not an option. But, by the same token, he can compromise, in other words, his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide. For example, he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not support. But why would he do that? Why wouldn’t he continue to fight until every inch of Syria’s sovereign territory is recovered? Because it’s not in Russia’s national interest to do so, that’s why. Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that he’s in Syria to protect Russia’s national security. That’s his main objective. But he’s not an idealist, he’s a pragmatist who’ll do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP. That means compromise. This doesn’t matter to the Washington warlords….yet. But it will eventually. Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort. No one is going to get everything they want, that much is certain. For example, it’s impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria. In fact, Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings. But that doesn’t mean that Putin doesn’t have his red lines. He does. Aleppo is a red line. Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter Aleppo. The western corridor, the industrial and population centers are all red lines. On these, there will be no compromise. Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact. But will Turkey control sections in the north, and will the US control sections in the east? Probably. This will have to be worked out in negotiations, but its unlikely that the country’s borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out. Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored. In any event, he’s not going to hang around until the last dog is hung. Unfortunately, we’re a long way from any settlement in Syria, mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed. That’s the crux of the matter, isn’t it? The bigshots who run the country are still in denial. It hasn’t sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist-militia plan has failed. It’s going to take a long time before Washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster. The sooner they figure it out, the better it’ll be for everyone.

1602,"""Blue Alerts"" to be used to keep the 'War on Cops' lie, alive","""Blue Alerts"" to be used to keep the 'War on Cops' lie, alive   
Police State America's control of our cell phones and media has taken a dark and twisted turn. Soon, everyone's cell phone will receive a ""Blue Alert"" warning them that police are looking for someone who's allegedly injured or killed a cop. Americans can expect to see ""Blue Alerts"" popping up everywhere, on their cellphones, TV's and even their radios .According to the Blue Alert Foundation , a ""Blue Alert"" is a means to speed the apprehension of violent criminals who kill or seriously injure local, state, or federal law enforcement officers.According to Wikipedia, the National Blue Alert system will pay a Department of Justice officer to become their national coordinator . Congress estimates is will cost taxpayers $1 million dollars annually to maintain the Blue Alert system. DHS controlled EAS warning system ""Blue Alerts"" will be broadcast over the EAS warning system.The EAS warning system wasn't designed to be used as a propaganda tool. (i'm trying not to scream as i'm typing) But that's exactly, what it's become. The EAS warning system has become a propaganda tool used by DHS/Police to keep Americans in fear. This past September, FEMA (DHS) conducted a national EAS warning test that encompassed radio, broadcast TV, cable, satellite, and other service providers (cell phone).It's hard to imagine a more successful national propaganda device in the hands of a government.DHS has successfully managed to condition the public into accepting MONTHLY test messages in English and Spanish. Earlier this year, I warned everyone that DHS is a master at using scare tactics to keep Americans afraid . As recently as two years ago, DHS was accused of using scare tactics in order to secure congressional funding. Why would anyone, expect DHS ""Blue Alerts"" to be any different?You can bet former Stasi and KGB officials, would have died to have had such a complete national propaganda device at their disposal. Why do we need a national ""Blue Alert"" system? The 'War on cops' is a lie A recent Antimedia article , revealed the war against police is pure fiction. The reality is, more cops have died from accidents than by violence. In 2015, the latest year for which the FBI has analyzed data, 41 police officers died as a result of the felonious actions of others. Forty-five died in accidents — 40 of which were attributable to traffic and/or automobile-related incidents . For more information, read the FBI’s annual “Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted” report . Police groups blame Obama and Black Lives Matter for the BS 'War on cops' According to a Mother Jones article , police groups have joined high-profile right-wing figures in issuing sharp criticisms of those they see as facilitating a 'War on cops.' (President Barack Obama and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement)In a statement posted on its Facebook page , the National Association of Police Organizations said: ""While we mourn and grieve and commit ourselves to supporting the survivors, we must also stand up and speak out against the senseless agitators and gutless politicians who helped bring about these murders."" A Huffington Post article , reveals the lie that started the 'war on cops.'",0
1603,Vorbild Trump: AfD fordert ebenfalls Mauer an Grenze zu Mexiko,"Donnerstag, 24. November 2016 Vorbild Trump: AfD fordert ebenfalls Mauer an Grenze zu Mexiko Berlin (dpo) - Haben sie sich da etwa Donald Trump zum Vorbild genommen? Die AfD hat heute ebenfalls den Bau einer Mauer an der Grenze zu Mexiko gefordert. Offenbar hofft die Partei im Hinblick auf die Bundestagswahl im nächsten Jahr, bei einwanderungskritischen Wählern noch stärker zu punkten, indem sie antimexikanische Ressentiments bedient. ""Die Mexikaner senden uns nicht ihre besten Leute"", heißt es in einem AfD-Positionspapier unter dem Titel ""Deutschland wieder großartig machen"", das vorsieht, die Kosten für den Mauerbau an der deutsch-mexikanischen Grenze vollständig von Mexiko tragen zu lassen. ""Sie bringen Drogen. Sie bringen Kriminalität. Sie sind Vergewaltiger. Und manche, nehmen wir an, sind gute Leute."" Hat sich die AfD von ihm inspirieren lassen? Zwar betont die Partei in dem Schreiben, dass es sich bei dem Plan, eine Mauer zwischen Deutschland und Mexiko zu errichten, um ein völlig eigenständig entwickeltes Konzept handelt. Doch viele Beobachter hegen den Verdacht, dass die AfD vor allem deshalb mexikanische Einwanderer ins Visier nimmt, weil Donald Trump im US-Wahlkampf damit so beachtliche Erfolge erzielte. Auch wenn die AfD es offiziell abstreitet: Insidern zufolge ist die Forderung nach einer Mauer an der deutsch-mexikanischen Grenze nur ein erster Test, um herauszufinden, ob die Partei mit Trumps Methoden erfolgreich um Wählerstimmen werben kann. Im Optimalfall stünden dann bald weitere Wahlversprechen zur Diskussion wie etwa die Abschaffung von Obamacare, eine strafrechtliche Verfolgung von Hillary Clinton oder die Neuverhandlung des Atom-Deals mit dem Iran. ssi, dan; Foto [M]: Shutterstock, Foto unten: Gage Skidmore , CC BY-SA 2.0 Artikel teilen:",0
1604,Students Claim Objective ’Truth’ Is a ’White Supremacist’ Myth - Breitbart,"Students at the Claremont McKenna Colleges argued that objective truth is a social construct devised by “white supremacists” to “attempt to silence oppressed peoples” in a letter to the Pomona College president. [The letter came in response to Pomona College President David Oxtoby’s affirmation of commitment to free speech and intellectual diversity following the chaos that ensued during a lecture featuring Manhattan Institute scholar Heather MacDonald. Student protesters derailed her lecture on the rise of   attitudes by banging on windows and shouting, “F*ck the police,” and “Black Lives Matter. ” Campus security ultimately forced MacDonald to livestream her lecture from a   room across campus.  “Protest has a legitimate and celebrated place on college campuses,” Oxtoby wrote, offering a condemnation of the conduct of the students who disrupted the event. “What we cannot support is the act of preventing others from engaging with an invited speaker. Our mission is founded upon the discovery of truth, the collaborative development of knowledge and the betterment of society. ” Students at Pomona College, one of the schools in the consortium of Claremont McKenna Colleges, took issue with Oxtoby’s statement and drafted a letter in response that was signed by students at the other colleges as well. “Free speech, a right many freedom movements have fought for, has recently become a tool appropriated by hegemonic institutions. It has not just empowered students from marginalized backgrounds to voice their qualms and criticize aspects of the institution, but it has given those who seek to perpetuate systems of domination a platform to project their bigotry,” the students wrote. “Thus, if ‘our mission is founded upon the discovery of truth,’” the students continued, “how does free speech uphold that value?” Immediately dismissing the possibility that listening to MacDonald’s lecture could widen their perspective, the students went on to explain how objective truth is a concept devised by “white supremacists” in an “attempt to silence oppressed peoples. ” Historically, white supremacy has venerated the idea of objectivity, and wielded a dichotomy of ‘subjectivity vs. objectivity’ as a means of silencing oppressed peoples. The idea that there is a single truth —  ’the Truth’ —  is a construct of the   that is deeply rooted in the Enlightenment, which was a movement that also described Black and Brown people as both subhuman and impervious to pain. This construction is a myth and white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, capitalism, and the United States of America are all of its progeny. The idea that the truth is an entity for which we must search, in matters that endanger our abilities to exist in open spaces, is an attempt to silence oppressed peoples. The students go on to claim that Heather MacDonald is “ignorant of interlocking systems of domination that produce the lethal conditions under which oppressed peoples are forced to live,” which is an explicit reference to the concept of intersectionality, an increasingly popular theory of oppression which conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan recently called a “religion. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

1605,WE NEED A REVOLUTION: Overcoming Fascism with a Movement of Love,"WE NEED A REVOLUTION: Overcoming Fascism with a Movement of Love Sabine Lichtenfels negotiating with a general, “Grace Pilgrimage” in Colombia, 2008 By Martin Winiecki / terranovavoice.tamera.org 
November 9th, the day after the U.S. election, will be a peculiar anniversary. On this day in 1938 more than 1000 synagogues and 7000 Jewish businesses were burning all over Germany, set ablaze by the Nazis. Going down in history as “Kristallnacht” or the “Night of Broken Glass,” this dreadful event marked the beginning of the Holocaust, resulting in six million Jews killed in less than seven years. 
History reverberates in an eerie manner these days. In the United States, the anger and hatred that has long been boiling in millions of people has now found its political outlet. 
No matter whether or not he will be elected president, Trump’s success has been unprecedented and overwhelming. His simple message resonates in large parts of the American society, in people who have long felt betrayed, abused and disenfranchised by an alienated “establishment.” Trump wins against all reasoning of decency because he recklessly breaks what his supporters most despise: “political correctness.” He understands how to play the emotional piano of the masses; he’s the ultimate caricature of a society teeming with universal corruption and sexual perversion. 
The rise of fascism always seems to hit the world by surprise. Yet what we are now witnessing has not begun with Trump, just as German fascism had not begun with Hitler. Wherever people are prohibited to express their basic emotional and energetic drives, wherever they grow up and live in conditions of fear, mistrust and violence, the danger of fascism looms. Suppressed life energy dams up and turns into constant aggression. When the container of the bourgeois order crumbles, when people lose their jobs, voices and prospects – as it has gradually happened in this era of expanding corporate dominance – and the state no longer succeeds in controlling violence, the monstrous force of bottled-up emotions breaks free. Once they have a strong paternal authority telling them whom to blame, declaring them to be a collective that will now exact revenge, people get together in wild exaltation. Finally they have a channel and they develop a threatening force.i We must not despise or ridicule these people, but understand how they have gotten into the desperate state they are in. Thereby fascism is no longer a thing of “the others”; it’s something that concerns us all. The psychoanalyst Dieter Duhm writes, “Latent fascism is present everywhere; it is the cancer of humanity… It develops in the subconscious of our human relationships. In the emotional substrata of a misguided civilization lie the horrible powers that led to Nazi Germany and which currently lead to very similar atrocities in many countries on Earth.”ii 
On the eve of the election, armed militias across the United States are preparing themselves to, as they say, “take back their country” in case their opponent will “rig” the elections. People call for boycotting companies who employ refugees from Muslim countries and threaten the people running them. Attacks on people of color, other religions and political ideologies have steeply increased in the time leading up to the election. People no longer see any prospect for the future. They no longer have anything in this world they can believe in. Unable of loving, retaliation is what gives them strength. Similar explosions of hatred are occurring all over the world. When we witness what political prisoners in Turkey (neglected by our Western leaders) or the civilians trapped inside the besieged cities of Aleppo and Mosul are now facing, we know that this global culture has come to a turning point. 
Yet the aggression now explicitly exploding among white lower-class Americans is only a miniature version of the ruthless warfare systematically orchestrated by this country’s elites for many decades. War is an essential component of our entire economic system – one without which this system would instantaneously collapse. While “decent” Americans show themselves outraged about Trump, their candidate for President has her blueprints ready for expanding military interventionism around the world. Democratic President Obama has already bombed seven Islamic countries and ordered the drone assassination of thousands of innocent children and women abroad, but he is considered “moderate” in terms of warfare compared to Hillary Clinton. In the current escalation with Russia and China there no longer seems to be any limit. We mustn’t be surprised by what is now erupting inside America. Similar to how it was in the late Roman Empire, the American Empire is entering a phase of self-destruction as it is being eaten up by the very violence it has used to establish itself in the first place. And with it goes the entire capitalist world order this country has essentially shaped. 
Trump is nothing other than a mirror for the world to look into, a call to awaken before it’s too late. It is silly to blame the mirror for what you see in it. Trump is not the enemy; he is merely the symptom of a culture worshipping power, violence and greed. If you are afraid of Trump, what you are actually afraid of is this culture. Stopping fascism isn’t achieved through ideological battles; it is rather a matter of building a new and humane culture. This is nothing short of a global revolution. A revolution from bottom up, on all levels of society. 
We need a revolution that establishes new foundations for human life on Earth, new foundations for our coexistence with each other and nature. A revolution that allows us to remember the sacredness of life and of all living beings. We need a revolution for solidarity and trust; “a revolution,” as Dieter Duhm says, “whose victory will create no losers because it will achieve a state that benefits all.”iii 
On November 9th 2005, Sabine Lichtenfels initiated the “Global Grace Day” at the separation wall in Israel-Palestine. At the time, the peace activist and co-founder of the Tamera peace research center in Portugal led a group of 50 Israelis, Palestinians and internationals on a “Grace Pilgrimage” through the Middle East – a form of political activism rooted in reclaiming the depth of our humaneness. The activists committed themselves to overcoming hatred and divide by addressing the human being trapped behind the masks of world views and traumatization.iv This allowed for “miracles” to happen – encounters between former enemies invoking the vision of a reunited land. No matter whether it is a dispossessed farmer, a soldier, a fanatic resistance fighter or ourselves, whether it is a fascist, a banker, a liberal or an anarchist – there is something identical in all of humanity running far deeper than our ideological denominations: a universal longing to be accepted and seen, a longing to love and be loved, to belong to a community and to express oneself in trust and freedom; and there is a similarly universal trauma stemming from the suppression of these essential human needs. What we need is a revolution that acknowledges and follows human longing and establishes societal conditions where they can finally be met. 
This new revolution will not be achieved by shifting political power from one party to another, but by establishing forms of coexistence which allow the human being to liberate himself from all disguises and reconnect in trust. Every fascist will transform into a loving person, every terrorist into a caretaker for life, if he or she can find home in a community that allows closed hearts to open again. This is not a matter of therapy, but of the social, sexual, ethical   we live in. Building a movement based on communities of trust would not only be a genuine alternative to the fascist threat emerging everywhere; it may also set the foundations for the new global culture we as humanity need in order to have a future worth living on this planet. November 9th is a day of both despair and hope. In 1989 it was the day the Berlin Wall was opened. This year it can be a day for opening the wall of despair—exercised by people who find their determination to collaborate for a world of solidarity and trust.

1606,Clinton Foundation Operates as Giant Slush Fund for Buying Influence,"
Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, the current Democratic Party presidential nominee, have attracted billions of dollars to their own foundation to trade power and influence, Wall Street investor and analyst Charles Ortel told Sputnik. 
Charles Ortel is a veteran Wall Street investment analyst who has carried out major studies into the operation of the Clinton Foundation and its legal status, and runs a blog monitoring its activities. Ortel was the whistleblower that blew the lid off the General Electric financial discrepancies in 2008.
“The Clinton Foundation has been a gigantic slush fund,” Ortel said. “People can donate relatively small sums to the Clinton regime and get gigantic concessions worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars back.” During the four years that Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, hundreds of millions of dollars flowed into the Clinton Foundation from governments around the world, many of which then enjoyed favored treatment from the US State Department, Ortel noted. “To the world at large, the Clintons are open for business,” he stated. The US corporate media always refused to subject the Clinton Foundation to any kind of serious or skeptical coverage, in part because of fear of alienating the Clintons, Ortel explained. “This is such a big story that the US press is not doing its job. What we have in ‘Clinton Incorporated,’ is Tammany Hall on steroids,” he said.

1609,"On the Ground in Aleppo: Bloodshed, Misery and Hope - The New York Times","ALEPPO, Syria  —   On the edge of Aleppo’s ancient citadel, Zahra and her family squatted in a   apartment, now facing rebel lines. Plastic sheets covered its tall windows to shield the space from a sniper’s view shelling boomed in the distance. Zahra, 25, who gave just one name, flicked between two photos on her phone. The first showed her husband, a Syrian Army soldier and the father of her unborn child. “Seven months,” she said, touching her belly. In the second, her husband was splayed on the ground, blood trickling from his nose. Two other fallen soldiers lay beside him. He died two weeks ago. “May the men who did this also die,” she said with quiet determination. Four years of war has hardened hearts in Aleppo, a divided city and, for the past week, the scene of merciless fighting. A fragile truce, brokered by the United States and Russia, has crumbled in Syria, leading to the worst violence in months. Russian fighter jets roar through the sky, pounding targets in   areas. The rebels send barrages of mortar rounds and homemade missiles that land in crowded neighborhoods. The war has stoked sectarian tensions and become a proxy battle for regional and global interests. Most fatalities are civilians  —   at least 202 in the past week, about   in   eastern areas and the remainder in the   west side, according to groups that monitor casualties. The violence shows a “monstrous disregard for civilian lives,” the United Nations’ human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad   said Friday. One of the world’s oldest inhabited cities, Aleppo has for centuries been known as the crossroads of empires, with Ottoman, Armenian, Jewish and French influences. Today the only way in, on the government side, is via a lonely road that cuts through hostile territory: a bumpy tarmac strip lined with deserted villages and isolated government outposts. I was traveling with my translator and a Syrian government minder. Traffic moved at a brisk pace: Syrian rebels held territory to the east of the road, and Islamic State militants held it to the west. Our first sight of Aleppo was its ravaged southern neighborhoods  —   a vista of devastation that has become a familiar image of Syria’s multiyear conflict. Like many war zones, other parts bustled with a semblance of normalcy. Traffic officers directed vehicles, laughing children poured out of schools, and shoppers crowded in stores that sold food and artisanal perfumes. People seemed strangely immune to the background beat of explosions  —   thuds, crashes and bangs  —   that provide a deadly metronome to their daily existence. That phlegmatic attitude, though, is little more than a form of   roulette. Whistling death, in the form of mortar rounds and rockets, can fall from the sky in any corner of the city at any time. During our first dinner, in an upmarket restaurant, we were jolted by the whoosh of a departing rocket, its engine thrumming for seconds before it launched, apparently from a nearby park. The old city’s sprawling medieval souk, considered one of the Arab world’s finest  —   and a Unesco World Heritage site  —   is now a wasteland. Down a deserted street, a woman in fatigues sat in a bunker, boasting of how she once cared for tigers for a living at the Aleppo zoo. The woman, who goes by a nom de guerre, Rose Abu Jaffer, produced photos of herself being nuzzled by a lion, holding a python around her neck, standing beside a bear and allowing a tiger cub to press two paws against her head. “That’s Sweetie,” she said, pointing to the cub. “My baby. ” Her   career as a zookeeper was cut short when the rebels occupied the zoo four years ago, prompting her to join the fight, she said. Now she is a frontline fighter. The nearest rebel position was about 100 feet away, she said  —   quiet for now, but unlikely to last. “They only dare come out at night,” she said. “They are like bats, cowardly bats. ” A shell crashed into a nearby building with a deafening bang. A vehicle careered down the street, driven by another soldier. Ms. Jaffer did not flinch, but advised my translator and me to move on. Although Syria’s revolt started as a protest against the authoritarian government of President Bashar   whose family has ruled Syria for 46 years, it has stirred sectarian tensions and   historical grievances. Most of the city’s Armenian population, known for its goldsmiths, has fled to Europe or Canada. Many of those who remain are staunch supporters of Mr. Assad, whom they see as their only hope against Islamist fighters who would never let them live in peace. The Rev. Iskander Assad, a Greek Orthodox priest, lives in Maidan, a frontline neighborhood that is now  . A day earlier, a mortar round slammed into his home, punching a hole in the roof. His wife had been crying all night, he said, but he was not interested in sympathy. “Sorry is no good,” he said. “We need a solution. Sorry solves nothing. ” Father Assad led the way up five flights of stairs to his   apartment. “The truce was a mistake,” he said, referring to the crumbling   as he surveyed a room strewn with dust and broken masonry. “What have we gotten out of it?” he asked. “The terrorists have now come in bigger groups, with more sophisticated weapons. These people are mercenaries. It gave them time to regroup. And now it is we who are suffering  —   not them. ” Neither side has a monopoly on suffering, or blame, in Syria’s grinding war. Mr. Assad, the president, faced new accusations of war crimes after airstrikes hit Al Quds hospital, on the rebel side of Aleppo, on Wednesday night. By Friday, rescuers said they had pulled 55 bodies from the rubble, including 29 children and women, some of whom had been in labor, according to one aid group. Doctors Without Borders, which had been supporting the hospital, denounced the bombing as “outrageous. ” Residents in   areas have learned to fear the “hell cannon,” an improvised form of rocket fashioned from modified propane gas cylinders and packed with explosives and metal objects that is used by some insurgent groups, including those that receive American assistance. Both sides have been ravaged by bombardments, although only the government has fighter jets and helicopters at its disposal, which have reduced broad swaths of rebel territory to rubble. Disregard for civilian life is universal. On Thursday, after the hospital attack, rebel rockets rained on virtually every district of   Aleppo in a fierce barrage that claimed dozens of casualties. Taxis and ambulances screeched to a halt outside the city’s Al Razi hospital as desperate relatives rushed bloodied and   people, many of them children, into the emergency ward. The next day, government forces hit three medical facilities in the east of the city. Some residents on the government side accuse the United States and its allies of selective outrage, turning a blind eye to the excesses of allies, like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. “The Security Council has double standards,” said the Rev. Ibrahim Nsier, a Presbyterian pastor. “They don’t see our victims. They ask for democracy in Syria, and they don’t see dictatorship in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. ” No one is quite sure how many of Aleppo’s prewar population of over two million people are left. Many have already fled to Europe, Lebanon or other parts of Syria. Those who remain scrape by on makeshift systems for electricity and water. Any escalation in fighting brings the potential for a “humanitarian disaster,” warned Valter Gros, who heads the International Committee of the Red Cross in Aleppo. “It’s very heavy these days,” he said. “Everyone feels it in different ways. ” Mr. Gros, who is originally from Bosnia, said he could relate to the apparently calm demeanor of Aleppans in the streets. “It’s bizarre to hear mortars in the distance when there are kids playing basketball outside the window of my office,” he said. “But people try to be normal, to be alive. When your coping mechanism is swamped, it makes you insensitive to things that people in the West would look on with horror. They get used to it  —   and that’s the scary thing. ” Our interview ended when a mortar round crashed into a nearby street, rattling the windows of Mr. Gros’s office. He moved us and his staff members into a safe area in the center of the building  —   the old Turkish Consulate  —   where we waited for 10 minutes. But as soon as we ventured out, another explosion rang out. Some Aleppans are determined to press on with life. Hours later, about 100 young men gathered at a restaurant for a raucous wedding party. The evening sun streamed through the glass walls as the partygoers, many dressed in lounge suits, ate from fruit platters, smoked water pipes and danced the dabke, a traditional folk dance  —   unable to hear, over the music, the occasional boom of explosions outside. “There is war, and then there is life,” said Omar Hretani, 21, a business student and the best man. “We have two hearts in this country  —   one for sorrow and one for happiness. Everything has its own story. ” The restaurant is called Matryoshka, after the Russian nesting dolls, in a nod to the city’s long trading ties with Russia. After four years of war, Aleppans had learned to get on with life, said the manager, Nadim Bsata, 27, who had himself become engaged the night before. An hour later, though, there was a reminder of the perils of Mr. Assad’s hardfisted rule. A squad of   military intelligence men pulled up outside the restaurant, grabbed Mr. Bsata by the shirt and remonstrated with him for allowing his customers to sing and dance on a day that had brought so much violence. The conversation moved to a table on the terrace, where Mr. Bsata assured the commanding officer that he fully supported the soldiers. “I don’t want to let terrorists destroy the city,” he said. “You must kill them and let us live. ” Apparently satisfied with the answer, the commanding officer kissed Mr. Bsata on both cheeks and left. Upstairs, the wedding party resumed and continued into the night  —   even as bombs continued to drop into the streets, some quite near Matryoskha.",0
1610,Influence Peddling Scheme Hits President Park in Korea,"Influence Peddling Scheme Hits President Park in Korea November 07, 2016 Influence Peddling Scheme Hits President Park in Korea 
A South Korean court said on Sunday it had issued arrest warrants for two former presidential aides under investigation in an influence peddling scandal that has sent President Park Geun-hye's approval rating to a record low. Tens of thousands of South Koreans demonstrated at a rally on Saturday evening in central Seoul demanding that Park resign over the scandal involving an old friend, Choi Soon-sil, who is alleged to have used her closeness to the president to meddle in state affairs. Park's approval rating has fallen to just 5 percent, the lowest since such polling began in 1988, according to a Gallup Korea survey released on Friday. The Seoul Central District Court said in a statement that it granted a warrant to prosecutors to arrest An Chong-bum, a former senior advisor for Park, who faces charges of abuse of power and attempted extortion. An was already in custody under an emergency detention order. 
Prosecutors are looking into allegations that An and Choi forced South Korean conglomerates to donate funds to non-profit foundations. 
The court said it also issued an arrest warrant for a second former presidential aide, Jeong Ho-seong, who also had already been held in temporary custody. 
Prosecutors apprehended Jeong late on Thursday on suspicion of leaking classified information. 
An and Jeong both stepped down late last month amid the deepening crisis. Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

1611,BREAKING: We Caught Obama Spending 30 Million Dollars Against Trump To Rig This Election,"It’s no secret that Obama and his puppets are doing everything they possibly can to rig the election against Trump. Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it’s all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary.
Obama’s latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he’s spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it.
From Judicial Watch :
Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it’s dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they’re known as “citizenship integration grants.”[…]
Judicial Watch went on to say… The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. “We intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,” the agency’s grant announcement states. “If you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.” Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[…]
Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing “new workforce programs” for the “new Americans” and the Department of Education is promoting “funding opportunities” to assure that the immigrants “are provided the tools they need to succeed.” The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on “immigrant-focused career-pathways programs.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have “meaningful access to housing programs” subsidized by American taxpayers.
Obama likes to pretend that he’s doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it’s just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.

More from Breitbart… Schweizer: Obama’s DOJ ‘Transferring Money to Left-wing Groups’ ‘to Influence This Election’ By John Hayward
On Wednesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM , Clinton Cash author and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer discussed the latest GAI report about the Obama Justice Department’s funneling of money to left-wing groups using fines levied against financial institutions. Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow described the report as exposing the Justice Department of “quite literally extorting companies to fund left-wing activists.”
“When I first joined Breitbart,” Schweizer recalled, “There was a scandal called Pigford where the federal government was basically taking taxpayer money and giving it to people who were claiming to be victims who were not victims and giving them billions of dollars. This is in that tradition.”
He explained:
What’s really happening here is simple. You’ve got large financial institutions on Wall Street, you’ve got banks like Bank of America, who have in some cases committed financial crimes. I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, ‘You committed these offenses, you’ve got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.’ Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that.
Now, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you’re supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers.
The problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to left-wing groups. They do it under the guise of, “Well, you know, if this bank discriminated against lenders racially, we’re going to give this money to these left-wing quote-unquote housing groups to help deal with the problem.”
But that’s not what’s going on. These housing groups are advocacy groups. They’re left-wing organizations. They are registering voters and getting voters out to the voting booth. And they specifically target what they call quote-unquote progressive voters.
So this is taking the Department of Justice, which we’ve experienced so much in recent years has been politicized by this Administration, even further to where now the Department of Justice is transferring money to left-wing groups — in an effort, frankly I think, to influence this election.

1612,Fourth Grade Teacher Will Not Let Students Watch Trump’s Inauguration Speech,"A fourth grade teacher from Michigan will not permit his students to watch   Donald Trump’s inauguration speech Friday. [Brett Meteyer, a teacher at Explorer Elementary in Williamston, emailed parents Monday that he will let students watch the inauguration ceremony but not Trump’s speech because of concerns about what he might say, the Washington Examiner reported.  According to conservative radio talk show host Steve Gruber, who posted the email on Facebook, Meteyer wrote: I am concerned about my students and your children being exposed to language and behavior that is not in concert with the most conservative social and family values, I have decided to show the inauguration Donald Trump this Friday, but we will not view Mr. Trump’s inauguration speech. The email said Meteyer reached out to Trump’s transition team to request a copy of the speech, but he did not receive a response. “I showed the speeches of Presidents Obama and Bush in 2009 and 2005, respectively, but am anxious about showing Mr. Trump’s inaugural address, given his past inflammatory and degrading comments about minorities, women, and the disabled,” the email continued. A parent who listens to Gruber’s show forwarded the email to the talk radio host, AOL reported. “What kind of message does this send to kids? ‘This president is a bad guy and kids should not watch him?’ This is a piece of history and the kids should be allowed to watch,” Gruber told Watchdog. org.",0
1613,"Migrant Boat Landings Up 57%, 1,300 Arrive in Sicily over Weekend","Illegal migrant sea crossings to Italy are up 57 per cent on 2016 so far, with 1, 300 landing in Sicily over the weekend. [Reuters reports that around half a million migrants have made their way to Italy since the beginning of 2014, with a   181, 000 making landfall in 2016.  Numbers so far indicate that 2017 will mark another   high for landings and drownings, with both up on the same period last year. Sicily’s latest arrivals were picked up on two ships, one from Norway operating on behalf of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and one operating on behalf of an NGO named Proactivia Open Arms. NGOs like Proactivia Open Arms have been accused of becoming an “indispensable” part of the   industry by the think tank GEFIRA. The organisation states NGO vessels pick up migrants from smuggler boats just outside Libyan waters and, rather than taking them to safe Tunisian ports nearby, bring them to Italian Coast Guard vessels which will transport them to Europe. Consequently, GEFIRA argues “these operations cannot be classified as genuine rescue operations” and has called for their prosecution.  Source: GEFIRA, Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri claims that around 40 per cent of migrants arriving in Italy are transported by NGO vessels, and has also accused them of acting “like taxis” for  . “[W]e must avoid supporting the business of criminal networks and traffickers in Libya through European vessels picking up migrants ever closer to the Libyan coast,” he said. “This leads traffickers to force even more migrants onto unseaworthy boats with insufficient water and fuel than in previous years. ” However, the Frontex agency has previously confessed that “all parties involved in [  ] operations” including itself, “unintentionally help criminals achieve their objectives at minimum cost [and] strengthen their business model by increasing the chances of success”. Despite an admission that its current approach is encouraging   and increasing drowning deaths, the agency has said it will not change its tactics in the Mediterranean Sea “because they stem from European values”. This contrasts sharply with the “tough love” approach to illegal sea crossings adopted by Australia, which sees all incoming vessels intercepted at sea and removed to their port of origin or a   processing centre. The deterrent effect of this strategy has prevented any illegal crossings for over 900 days. Tony Abbott, the former prime minister who introduced it, advised EU leaders in September 2016 that “if you want to stop the deaths [and] you want to stop the drownings, you have got to stop the boats”. “Effective border protection is not for the squeamish, but it is absolutely necessary to save lives and to preserve nations. The truly compassionate thing to do is: stop the boats and stop the deaths. ”",0
